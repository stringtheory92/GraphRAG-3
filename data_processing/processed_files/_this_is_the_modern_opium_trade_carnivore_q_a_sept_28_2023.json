        "body": "know we just get more people involved which is good a know we just get more people involved which is good a super chat here from DM thank you very much for that hi doctor on cornivore two months and love it learning a ton from you well that's good it's good to hear I like taking metam musil any negative impacts if I still want to take it thank you so metam musil you know it's just a a fiber supplement really so do you need fiber probably not you know it's just a bulking age agent that you know for these purposes it's a bulking agent so that you can sort of move your stools but your your your stools are going to pass normally uh and better if you just eat more fat and so if you're getting blocked up if you're getting dry hard stools then you need to eat more fat by definition and so um you people say well I'm definitely eating enough fat but I'm still having hard dry stools so to me if you have hard dry stools then by definition you are not eating enough fat because if you're eating enough fat you'll get overflow you'll get you won't be able to absorb all of it and some of that will get in your stools will keep it soft it will go out and so that's that's definitional for me if you're if you're getting dry hard stools you're not eating enough fat if it's just in frequency that you're worried about you're only going once or twice a week and you're normally used to going three four times a day don't worry about that because you're absorbing 98% of the meat that you're EA eating whereas when you're eating plants you're not absorbing you know 90 95% of the plant because most of the plant is made out of the structural component of fiber and you can't absorb that and it has to go out you have to excrete it so with the metam musil um you don't need it you know because you don't need that bulking to to move things through and just have something to I mean your body doesn't like it's like oh my God if if if I don't have anything to move through my bowels everything shuts down your your body's fine with that I mean think about fasting you know people fast for a number of days they don't they don't die of bowel obstructions and and complications of of colon disease right actually they actually do better and when you're you get surgery on your bowels like you rest the bowel like you either fast or you takeing low residue diet so no fiber diet right that's um that's a good thing also remember that fiber is um sort of think of it as a solid component it can cause like a lining and just basically physically gets in the way between your enzymes and the food and then digested so so it doesn't digest as much and then digested food and your gut lining so it impedes digestion and absorption and that's and that's a benefit supposedly that people say well this is good because it it blocks 30% of the the absorption of the food so that you're not getting you're not absorbing all this horrible crap you're eating okay well you're not eating anything horrible that you don't want to absorb on a carnivore diet so if you reduce by 30% or even 5% the amount of meat that you're eating that's actually detrimental you want to absorb all of this stuff because it's all good for you if you're eating a whole bunch of sugar and and other sort of plant toxins great you know fiber is going to stop you from absorbing as much of that maybe that's a positive there are studies suggesting uh it can be positive there's other studies saying that it's not positive there's a study with over 2,000 people that showed that people who had more fiber had higher risk of cardiovascular disease so that's not great and were're more symptomatic with constipation they were getting hard difficult to pass painful stools bleeding fissures bloating all these sorts of things they reduced the fiber those symptoms got better they eliminated fiber they resolve they all the symptoms all resolve so you know studies aren't perfect but if you just think of the mechanism what is it doing well it's bulking it's moving things through you don't need that you just need enough fat okay what else is it doing it's blocking out nutrients that you want to absorb when you're on a carnivore diet so for us it's not necessary and so um yeah I I I don't think you need it if you're if you're worried about it and you just and you're just having difficult to pass toools just just eat more fat you'll be fine Russell Sheridan do you think including butter and fat makes uh including butter fat makes a better health worse health or no Health difference if included in plant-based meals no I think it's better 100% better fat is an essential nutrient it's that you know people say it's like oh you don't want too much fat I don't I don't think that's a thing I think that's um I I think that's just thinking about it a bit differently than uh than our body uses it our body has a limited capacity to absorb fat you know with the amount of bile that our liver makes without bile it's very difficult for your body to absorb fat and so I think that the amount of bile your body makes is the amount of fat that your body wants I don't think your body just makes a random amount of bile to get a random amount of fat that that wouldn't make sense to me physiologically and biologically because other things are so tightly controlled why would this one just be completely random so I think that your body wants the fat and needs the fat and they okay well but if you're eating all this junk and junk food and carbs and sugar then it's bad no you know like it's like it's like saying that you know U you know another nutrient like you know protein or or you know these essential amino acids well those are bad for you if you eat eat with carbs why would that be they're essential you need them the carbs are the bad thing and well but with with f then you'll get too many calories no it's essential nutrient that's that's how I think about it so yes you know if you're eating if you're eating vegetables and all that sort of stuff um you know plant-based meals or whatever at least at the very least you're getting these essential animal based fats and nutrients you need these things and so a lot of a lot of harm and and what I think we call diseases are a byproduct of not eating the right thing partly because you're eating things that our bodies have a heart hard time dealing with like non-bioavailable nutrients and uh direct toxins or things that disrupt your hormones or your digestion or Draw out nutrients things like that but also just not having the essential nutrients that we need so that combination of causing us harm and not having correct nutrition is a problem and so if you're having a plant-based meal but you know that that's if if it's purely plant-based it's not going to have all the essential nutrients you need and there are essential fatty acids and essential fat soluble vitamins that you have to have and so if you're adding in animal fat or butter then yes that's better that's definitely better because you're getting you're getting more nutrients and you're getting more of the nutrients that you need and uh and fats are really good for you it's uh it's very very good for you your brain is made out of fat your nervous system is made out of fat your whole body is made out of cholesterol your hormones are made out of cholesterol this is a really important uh nutrient so yes at any point uh even if you're eating horrible crap if you're eating it with something good for you that good thing for you is still good for you it doesn't all of a sudden become bad for you it's just it's the other stuff that's that is and remains bad for you Lisa Lisa thank you very much for the superjet it's very kind of you and um I'm very generous hi doc thank you as always for what you do uh what's your advice for carnivore uh an ALS a friend of mine uh diagnosed a few months ago um beg in mouth Boston um so ALS is is a tough one so I don't I don't know enough people that have been on Carnival with ALS I've only sort of heard peripherally like from yourself you know that they've had a friend and and would this be something that would help them um I haven't actually seen anyone get on this and try so I don't know um unfortunately there are things that can cause serious problems and harm and uh and that that diet's not going to fix I think that it would help them in in so far as it would eliminate out a lot of other garbage that they wouldn't have to contend with while they're dealing with the alss now is that going to slow stop halt or reverse the ALS I have no idea I I hope so I would hope so and there are some things that seem to be very dependent on diet so for instance in the animal kingdom this is something I learned when I went up to Maggie's Ranch she was telling me she you know she went to veterinary school and she's basically been the vet for her or a major part I mean she does like cesarians on her cows when when needed you know so she's very up on uh you know animal issues and cow issues there is a um a disorder that cows get which is their version of mus muscular distrophy now we look at muscular distrophy and oh that's genetic and that's all there is to it um and there's certainly genetic component um but in at least in the cow version it comes down to a genetic component cows that are susceptible to this and they have a nutritional deficiency I believe she said it was selenium and so you add in selenium into the feed because sometimes they don't have all the nutrients in the feed or in the grass or in the hay or whatever and so if they get deficient then they they they can get this muscular distrophy and so when they add in selenium or or whatever the the U nutrient was if anyone knows please put that in the comments and we can I can stop guessing um then uh then they don't have it anymore and reverses so and there are so many weird things that people have that just go away so I mean I've seen people with ERS danlos which is a connective tissue issue connective tissue issue connective tissue disorder and uh I see people basically become non-symptomatic with that and normally have joint dislocations and a pain in their joints and and and other problems and then all of a sudden Pain's gone joint dislocations are gone their joints work better and the connective tissue is tougher and stronger and Tighter pretty amazing so there are there are genetic components and there are also nutritional components so with ALS that's something I'm very curious about that's something that I that I I hope I can have some patience and people like your friend who give this a try and I I would be happy to work with them directly and and help them out as best I can to make sure that they succeed and um and to see how they do because that's that's a very important piece of information and uh but you know just optimizing your life in general getting proper sleep you know getting the light blocking glasses getting sunlight being out in the sun going back to our normal circadian rhythms you know walking around Barefoot you know I don't know much about grounding but there does seem to be an electron transfer you know current transfer you know through the body when you walk Barefoot so presumably that's how we were designed is it how much of a difference it makes I have no idea but it is there it is a phenomenon that you can measure and certainly the light in the eyes and and getting tracked onto your circadian rhythm that is that is known to be a major issue and uh and then a proper food so you know getting proper sleep circadian rhythm proper food and eliminating out all those other things that are certainly going to make life worse for everyone and especially compound things for someone with ALS I think you do that and you address those things and um it's at least going to help them from that sense and and improve things that can be improved um and I would hope that it would improve ALS uh but I I don't know unfortunately but I would still recommend just pure fatty red meat and water and nothing else I mean with these sorts of things you just want to be as as as pure as possible you know grass-fed and finished from a regenerative form if you can and just just really do it the best that you can to give yourself the best shot at at succeeding and if if uh your friend is interested and wants to talk to me directly I'm happy to to talk to them you know for free and and just try to help them out as as much as I can um I have my email I put in there for um for collaborations and you know things like that it's just Anthony chaffy gmail.com um and if there interested you know just have them email me I don't see all the emails so if I don't get it just bump it up a couple times until I do but I I would be more than happy to help and hopefully they give it a try and hopefully it helps question from sen ofwar I have a question do we know how long uh the opposite of fat adaption takes like once you are fat adapted how long does it take to become carb adapted uh it seems be a few days so it's not too long so uh looking at Professor Ben bman um you know he talks about different studies that uh well that that incorrectly say that a ketogenic diet makes you insulin resistant how how could that happen if you're not even if you have low insulin right um I mean I guess you could you could affect insulin receptors and all that but you know doesn't really follow um the way they measured that is they just did a glucose tolerance test so they gave someone a soda and they said oh look their blood sugar went up higher and it took longer to come down okay um but did you check your insulin at the same time their insulin was low so if their insulin was high and it took a long time for that to come down that's insulin resistance because there's a lot of insulin out and not a lot of happening right whereas um what happens in people in ketosis their insulin is low and so the blood sugar goes up insulin still low and it takes a little while to rise up why is that is because normally when you're eating a lot of carbohydrates your your pancreas preloads insulin pre- makes it and has it sitting there ready to go right and then you eat carbohydrates and goes get it out there because you know you're building up a tolerance for a toxin really and so you when you're an alcoholic you know or drinking regularly your body makes more of these enzymes that break down uh alcohol right so you can get this the hell out of your your system as quickly as possible and so that's the same with carbs and so you're preak insulin because that's the the counter for carbs uh you know blood sugar that's too high so when you're not doing that and you and you you're just eating you know a normal human diet uh you don't have to pre-make your insulin because that's not an issue and so at first you don't have enough insulin to Bow us out and slam out and drop it like other people do but in a couple days you start doing that again so according to to Professor bman who has been studying insulin and its effects on the body for 15 plus years um you know he's a professor at BYU uh he has literally written the book on the subject so um you know it's uh you know that's uh that's what he says so it should just take a couple days it's not it's not that big a deal it's not really going to like not knock you back I mean you already run on carbs right because when you but you just make them yourself and so you you get energy up you know burn you know break down fat uh from your fat tissue some you know some of these nutrients go to your liver your liver makes glucose and glycogen and things like that so you always have glucose and glycogen so in that sense you're always carb adapted because you're always running on carbs anyway you check your blood sugar it's normal it's always normal noral and that's how that's how we know what normal is that's where it's supposed to be that's where your body wants it to be and so when you um when you're on a ketogenic diet carnivore diet everything's everything's normal you are running on carb so you are carb adapted but you're also keto adapted you're also able to run on ketones and carbohydrates so when you go back to eating carbohydrates it's not that you can't run on carbohydrates anymore it's just that it takes a couple days for your you start pre- makak insulin again because oh Jesus we're doing this again okay fine uh and then it just shuts down your ketones really so the only difference is is that you just don't have access to your ketones anymore but your blood sugar was always there and was always able to be used so I wouldn't worry um yeah so in that in that respect you're always carb adapted let grab coffee says started the carnivore diet and feel much better already from Trinidad and Tobago thank you yeah well thank you for sharing that's great I'm glad you're doing better and I hope that well I'm sure it will just keep getting better after that so good luck with it keep going and you'll keep getting better as you go

        "body": "Brian games uh brain games maybe uh back thank you for Brian games uh brain games maybe uh back thank you for Super Chat says back surgery for uh CES in 2018 leg muscle loss from neuropathy as a result um CES stands for CAU quiin syndrome for people that don't know uh I am uh which is sort of a compression of the lower nerve roots in the in the lumbar spine so the spinal cord ends at around L1 and then sort of the nerve Roots come down that's the C Aquin means horse's tail in Latin and if that gets compressed you can get caught Quin syndrome you compress those nerves and causes causes problems it's not good it's an emergency so I'm sure the nerves have healed as much as they will the muscle continues to degrade will I eventually lose ability to walk well hopefully not the the the muscles that are normally afflicted by aot aquina um are usually sort of lower down and so it shouldn't necessarily affect all ones up in your hip and things like that depends on the the level of your compression but the um you know things like well yeah it does just depend on where on where you're your your compression was but um it can it can certainly cause difficulty to walk it can cause you to have a drop foot where you can't lift your foot up you know can't walk properly uh you can have weakness and um but but it shouldn't make you completely paralyzed from the waist down unless it's a high up lesion which you know again I don't know what what level your lesion was but the thing is is that it it shouldn't continue to get really worse and worse and worse I mean you know you can have atrophy because the the the muscles aren't being innervated and that can continue to atrophy uh but if you keep working at it and working at it what is left can grow and if and and and can grow and develop and you're just stimulating it so the more you do the more you stimulate um the more you stimulate the growth and you can even stimulate the nerves to to work a little better um so 2018 so that's a while normally we s tell people that after about 2 years you're going to get whatever recovery you've gotten that's how much you can expect to to keep and maintain now that said you know you just have someone and say okay well you know you got out of high school and you're this big and you're that athletic and that's what you're going to be you're a grown adult and that's how much you're going to be well you can develop where you you know you where you you ended up with in your development right so an adult I've been in my adult frame since I was 177 or 18 but I I was I you know was 177 pounds um at 17 and now I'm 240 you know so my frame is the same but I was able to develop the muscles after that right so that's what you can do you know you can build things up as much as you can also if you're on a carnivore dite doesn't say if you are or aren't I've seen pretty amazing recoveries neurologically now that doesn't mean everyone will but I have seen some crazy things happen there's a guy Dave Mack who I've had on the podcast and I've been on his um that um you know he's uh and he's on on YouTube and everything like that you guys can go check it out and uh he had a stroke when he was 19 or so you know late teenager and and for 30 years he had very stable neurology he had he had right-sided weakness forever and he did a ketogenic diet which actually helps with neurological recovery uh that's been shown in studies especially for tbis traumatic brain injuries and and we know for epilepsy and migraines and and these sorts of things too we know that that it helps a lot so you know he 30 years later went on a carnivore diet and within months he was walking normally and and uh significantly reduced the amount of weakness that he had from a stroke that was 30 years old so it's pretty it's pretty amazing what our body can do if we just get out of its way and what can can recover so that's what I would do if you're not on Carnivore diet get on one and just try beef and water fatty beef and water get a lot of fat in there your brain and your nervous system is made out of fat and cholesterol so that's what you need and um and then just give it time and I would just get get in the gym working with a physical therapist and an occupational therapist and try and work on as much as you can and try to get him back as much function as you can and at least stop it from from getting worse if the more you work at it um the more you'll be able to preserve and hopefully reverse so good luck with that um oh goodness there we go so Jerry Graham thank you for the"

        "body": "goodness there we go so Jerry Graham thank you for the goodness there we go so Jerry Graham thank you for the Super Chat just had Labs showing B12 of 999 been eating ketovore and organ Meats how long should I avoid organs and other advice to lower B12 before I get new Labs my doctor is requesting um never I think that uh that's a perfect score honestly uh pretty cool triple n but so I don't know what country you're in and they use slightly different values but they they balance out to be sort of the same in the US and Australia and Europe and things like that in Australia um the reference ranges like depending on now the reference ranges change change everywhere uh even from Lab to lab in the same city because they go by the average population that that lab has seen that year right and so they change every year and they change every lab that you go to and so that's not accurate right that's not telling you where you should be that's just telling you do you fall in the range of everybody else well everyone else is sick right everyone else is unwell and metabolically unhealthy and nutritionally deficient so that's not the that's not the metric you want to you know compare yourself to okay those AR the people you want to compare yourself to so the reference range in Australia is like 160 to 650 or thereabouts depending on on where you are and yet below 400 is um has been shown to cause uh demin of your axon so nerve damage in uh people so under 400 is a is a true deficiency where your body is not able to maintain uh normal function right so not good so that's half of the reference range right so you'd be 200 like oh that's normal you know 300 yeah fine 420 gez look you're you're doing really well you're upper upper half right no that's um that's really low so the range that that I look at is if you're 255 and you have no medical issues what does your what do your numbers look like and so for B12 that's 800 to 1200 it's your snack in the middle of that if you're in Australia in America it's slightly higher sort of I think it's like 1,00 to 1500 or something like that I'll have to go back and look but it's around there anyway so so that's fine to me the only problem is while that's way too high is because we are you know most people are nutritionally deficient and b12 deficient and so you're comparing yourself against people that that don't have enough and so it looks like you're too high but you know in the in the land of the blind the one onee man is King right so you have you know you're you're doing better than them and it looks like this this crazy disparity and um but it's not actually you're normal they are abnormal so I'd be fine with what you're doing um you know organ meats are fine in proportion to the animal right so if you're hunting and you take down an animal just remember that you get hundreds of pounds of normal muscle meat and fat you know to every pound of organ right you got one liver one heart two kidneys one spleen bunch of intestines right and fat you know that's that's a lot of what's in the abdomen is fat and so that's what you need to focus on is um uh the fat and the muscle meat and organs great but just keep that in proportion you don't need as much of that and so as long as you're keeping it in proportion having you know liver and organs couple times a week but not in like huge quantities you'll be fine and that B12 is is perfectly fine I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about that um at all so that that's perfect you're doing great Mark Briar um if you have health issues going through eating grain how would that impact your health if you eat grain-fed meat when that still cause disease um oh through eating grain yeah so if you eat grains and you get problems in in grain-fed meat would that be a problem well it depends it depends on how well that animal can process the toxins that are in grains or any plant and so if an animal is eating what it is it is designed to eat then it can detox X ify and eliminate out those problems and and it doesn't get into the meat they're filters for that right um but if it's not what they're designed to eat then no that filtration they'll still filter but it won't be won't be perfect right and so this is why some people recommend against eating uh you know Factory farmed chicken and pork and farm raised fish because they're being fed corn and soy and garbage like that they they are not designed to eat and um they don't filter it out perfectly ruminant animals red meat animals with this big rumin this big complex digestive tract um they seem to be able to do detoxify these things much much much better now it changes their nutritional complement and you know their Omega-3s and Omega sixes yeah especially if it's intensively brain finished now not everyone does that you know I was talking to Maggie and Mac up in in Alberta and other ranchers as well and when you you you add in a bit of grain to help keep them fat through the winter and things like that um you're not talking about 95% 100% grain you're talking about kicking it up you know 30% 60% grain the rest of it like hay and feed and grass and things like that it's just a sort of a top up so they're still getting nutrients and all these sorts of things it's a very different different way of doing it and and you get different results and so um you know most people so that that actually seems to be okay and cows can can I mean I saw an article saying that they could get rid of glyphosate right they could they could just burn that stuff out so that doesn't get in their meat either so it depends you know it's still going to be a filter but that's that's why people with autoimmune issues should really stick to red meat because you know they they try pork or chicken and it and it and it gives them a reaction and it gives them a flare up of their autoimmunity so that's probably what that's from is those those toxins that they're not used to uh breaking down and chewing up they can get into the meat so yes that can be an issue and that's why you stick to red meat grass-fed and finished if you're if you're Ultra sensitive but most people even very sensitive people do just fine on even grain finished beef and lamb so just see what see how you do if you're finding you're still having uh a problem then um uh then just go for grass-fed and finished and that then you should be fine fine hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want a nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys Glen condrin asks what what if you've lost your gallbladder this is a very common question um and uh I have addressed this on other videos I should make one just just called this uh just so people can look at up but uh doesn't matter your gallbladder stores bile but your liver makes the B and so your liver is still going to make the bile just going to drip out constantly and so it may be that you can't absorb as much fat in one meal so you just need to eat the same amount as your body still needs a certain amount of meat and fat uh you just may need to split those meals up throughout the day now if you're getting loose stools diarrhea that means your body's not absorbing as much a lot of the fat that you're that you're eating so you need to space that out and so uh just still judge by your stools most people actually a lot of people I don't know the percentages but a lot of people will form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is just an outpouching of the common B duct and that um just works like a normal gallbladder and so they don't have any problems uh eating eating a big one one a day fatty meal as well so just depends but you can still absolutely do it because you still make bile you just may need to uh split up y our meals but not necessarily Joseph thank you for the"

        "body": "our meals but not necessarily Joseph thank you for the our meals but not necessarily Joseph thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy thank you for what you do been on a strict carnivore uh carnivore uh for almost two weeks and already feeling the effects great question at what point will the normal hunger pains go away FYI Costco ribe eyes Rock yes they do um usually usually a few weeks you know usually you don't get Cravings after a few weeks now if you you are getting hunger pains and and and uh uh carb cravings and things like that you may be undereating it's very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet and so you just like yeah I'm not hungry I'm not hungry just eat a little bit or whatever and I'm fine but then you start feeling like you're really hungry or you're having like carb Cravings that may be that your brain is screaming at you you need to eat a hell of a lot more so you should be eating enough fatty meat that you don't get those feelings and so if you are eating riye keep eating until it stops tasting good not until you feel yeah I feel comfortable your body still wants it if it tastes good because you get negative feedback it tastes good now but the next bite it tastes slightly less good slightly less good and slightly less good until eventually it doesn't taste good and you just go H I don't I don't actually want to eat anymore and you stop and that's I believe you I haven't asked any I'm you know haven't come across Dr D little but I would expect that that's the same Sensation that other animals get in the wild certainly the ones that we get and so that's how your body tracks or tells you how to track what to eat and how much to eat um you start eating other things like carbs and sugar and lectins and things like that that disrupts your hormones and your satiety signals and blocks leptin and raises insulin and does all these sorts of things that derange your hunger signals and your satiety signals and then you overeat it's very easy to overeat and they're addictive and so you definitely overeat when you're do when you're doing Carnival you don't have any of that bothering you so you can actually listen to your signals so you have to know what to look for and I think that taste is is a major component there if fatty meat tastes good you are still hungry you should keep eating until it stops tasting good now you the other side of that people say oh I'm just getting tired of of ribey and oh gosh and like try other meat and just doesn't taste good well then you're definitely not hungry and you don't need to eat you don't need to eat just for the sake of eating right so you know unless you're like completely emaciated or or something like that or have a you know an eating disorder or something like that and you just is a survival issue um but you know many people I've spoken to with anorexia do very very well on a cornner war diet and um and and find it much easier to eat and eat a healthy amount and put on weight and be happy about putting on that healthy weight as well so um so yeah so that's what I suggest just make sure you're eating enough make sure that you're eating until fatty meat stops tasting good and and you should be fine and so you shouldn't you shouldn't get those those cravings and those feelings as much if if you're eating e nough so good luck with that sen off thank you for the"

        "body": "always carb adapted really Leonardo thank you for the always carb adapted really Leonardo thank you for the Super Chat uh hypothesis ketones uh is not a starvation survival function as commonly thought but a result of abundance dietary or stored fat that gets interrupted when we eat plants thoughts no I I I agree I don't think this is a survival function I think this is our this is our primary metabolic State this is the primary metabolic state of essentially all most animals at least in the wild so carnivores and herbivores are in a state of ketosis or starvation State um because they're always getting meat and fat they don't they don't take in a bunch of carbohydrates so carnivores because they eat animals with fat they go for the fat first they're eating fat and meat right so they absorb fat and protein High proportion of fat to protein generally and then uh but also herbivores because they don't you know they're taking in a bunch of fiber which is just all carbs but that's not actually what they absorb because no vertebrate animal can break down uh no vertebrate animal can break down fiber and so it's actually the fiber is there to feed their gut bacteria and the gut bacteria eat that break down all the fiber and then as they're waste they secrete short chain fatty acids which are also 100% saturated so they absorb the fat they absorb the waste the is sort of weird to think about but the byproduct of this bacteria that's what they absorb and then the bacteria die off and they break those down and absorb those as proteins so what a cow eats is grass but what they absorb is fat and protein what a gorilla eats or green leaves what they absorb is fat and protein and all the way down down the line so um yeah so that so gorillas and cows are in the same ketogenic so-called starvation state so it's not a starvation State the only reason we call it a fasting state is by the time we were able to look at our biochemistry at a molecular level everyone was eating carbohydrates and says okay what does this look like when we eat oh it looks like this great and okay what about if we stop eating does it look the same well no actually about 24 hours it looks this other way oh very interesting that must be a fasting state it changes okay but if you eat anything else on earth except carbohydrates it also looks like this so-called fasting state so they just jumped the gun a bit you know they didn't test things out um as much as they should have and and this is this is up until current day that's what I was taught in Biochemistry you know two decades ago and uh it's wrong right because when I eat 5,000 calories in ribey I am not fasting and so whatever my whatever you can say about my metabolic State you cannot say it's a fasting State because not fasting right so I think that that's our primary metabolic State that's and that's the primary metabolic state of of most animals in the wild except you know birds and bees and things that like eat nectar God knows what their metabolism is like but uh for for the other carnivores and herbivores out there you know you're running on fat and protein and so I think that's that's uh that the what we call a Fed State what we call our primary state is actually a path olical defense mechanism that your body's defending against high blood sugar because high blood sugar is toxic it damages it cause direct damage to your body and kill this is what kills diabetics is is prolonged high blood sugar right so those glucose molecules physically fuse to other molecules and they damage them they cause permanent damage and disruption to your body and so your body looks at that and goes sweet Jesus what's going on here and you slam up insulin to try to get this out and and save the save the you know the body and so that that's that's just a a defense mechanism that's not our normal state right because if we're eating what we're designed to eat what we're normally eating what we were eating during the ice ages that's not the state we're in and so you can call it ketosis you can call it whatever you want you know people say that the the Inuit don't go into ketosis but that's really because just their ketones are pretty low uh you get better at at using your ketones as you go and you get more efficient at it so at first you have high ketones because your body is not keto adapted and it's not and so you have just like if you're insulin resistant your blood sugar goes up and it's harder for your body to get this into the cells to use so at first you're Ketone resistant right because you don't have the mechanisms set up to use ketones properly because you haven't been using them you haven't been making them and uh you know just like when you go back to eating carbs all of a sudden you're not making enough insulin you're like oh God okay got to get those wheels turning again and so for ketones it just takes a bit of time but when you've been on it long enough your ketones aren't that high that's because you're using them you're using them better and whatever happens it's supposed to happen right because you're eating what you're supposed to eat and so whatever happens is supposed to happen and the the Inuit you know they say Well they're not in ketosis I don't know because they're making ketones they're making blood sugar they're making glycogen they're not just running off of the uh you know I mean there there's glycogen in meat and organs but is that enough to run all of their energy demands is their insulin chronically elevated no I don't think so so not that I know of anyway so I think that they are in ketosis I just think that it looks different when you've been on it your whole life as opposed to just a six week study right so um but yeah I definitely agree that I we the fasting state is not uh a fasting state that um that I think that's our our primary metabolic State and that's where all of our heavy machinery come to bear that's where all the beneficial biochemical actions happen that's where autophagy comes from mitophagy replacing your mitochondria and and bulking up their number um um you know all the different benefits you get from from fasting all these oh that we know fasting is so good for you so you go on a carnivore diet it just mimics fasting no no fasting mimics the metab metabolism you're supposed to be in all the time anyway which you would be in if you were on your proper diet how can we say that eating a whole bunch of grains and sugar and processed crap is normal for us none of that existed in in the last ice age or any ice age or before the 1800s why why are we eating things that didn't exist before you know before the the 1800s I mean there there are things we're eating now that didn't exist before we were even born right why the hell are we eating them you definitely aren't adapted to those things right uh what are we adapted to we're adapted to meat whatever you're adapted to that's what you're supposed to eat that's what that's that's an immutable law of biology is adaptation you you get stressors and survival pressures and whatever can adapt best to that situation survives and thrives and we not only survived we not only thrived we became the most dominant species on Earth during ice ages when all we had to eat was meat right so we are well adapted to eating meat we are not well adapted to eating any plants and you know some people have a bit of adaptation 8 to 10,000 years with agriculture a lot of people don't a lot of people have not been introduced to agriculture until they were met by the Western colonial power hours a few hundred years ago and many of them still didn't eat any of that garbage they knew better it's only in sort of the recent century and a half that they started doing that the Native Americans were still eating mostly meat until you know we wiped out the buffalo in the the American Indian Wars you Buffalo Bill which I still think is just a an atrocity just an absolute atrocity and um but that's what it was and so in the 1800s the Native Americans the Plains Indians were the tallest human beings on Earth that's been well studied and documented and now they are not they started eating a western diet they are more likely to get obese and sick and diabetic and metabolic issues and cancer and these other sorts of things when eating a western diet so what does that mean that means if you know that means the food is causing the disease because if they don't eat the food they don't get the disease and we eat the food and we get the disease we just get it at a lower rate because we have had a bit of protection we've had a bit of adaptation 10,000 years is not that much but it does something and so we have some adaptive measures to protect us whereas the Native Americans don't the native Australians don't subsaharan Africans don't have as much and so that's that's uh where you see a lot of disparities in health come from that back how long have you been exposed to these nasty plants that we really shouldn't be eating if you've been exposed to them longer you can do better with them if you have not had much exposure to them you know genetically in your in your uh genetic past then you're not as adapted to it the law of nature the law of biology is adaptation and if you have not had time to adapt you should not be eating or exposing yourself to that thing you want to expose yourself to things that you are well adapted to and what we are well adapted to All Humans is meat and so that's what you should eat Lee Martinez uh thank you very much for or maybe Leah Martinez thank you very much for the"

        "body": "hat I asked this question already but wanted to send a hat I asked this question already but wanted to send a Super Chat oh thank you 66y old all blood work is great except for uh protein and tibc which are both cornivore 6 tibc di blood count not not recognizing that one maybe that's something else maybe put in the in the in the chat um what that stands for either way I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about it so sometimes you have like little aberant blood test but you know again this is this is what we're designed to eat and so as long as you only eating fatty meat and you're getting enough of it and you don't have any sort of other medical issues then uh um well really it doesn't really matter what your medical issues are if you're eating what you're supposed to eat they're going to work better but you can have other medical issues that have nothing to do with the the food that you're eating um so um yeah no I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about um about the protein and things like that just keep eating and you'll sort it out as long as you're feeling well that's the important thing you treat patients you don't treat blood tests you know if you're feeling well and there's no issue then you just keep an eye on it and uh and then you you can check it again and um and see what's going on with it and if you're getting symptomatic with something and then you check your blood and something's off then you start okay well what what could this mean what could this be doing but if you just have an aberant blood test that's not necessarily an issue and as long as you're feeling well and you're doing well so I wouldn't worry too much and everything else is fine so you know yeah I would uh yeah I would just keep going as you are and uh just put a pin in that and if you check your Bloods again you know take a look see what's going on it could be perfectly normal for you people sit in different ranges normally and so if that's normal for you then that's great um Basics asks hey Anthony uh love what you do well thank you very much when are you going to make a documentary in the same style as a game changers well I'm yeah I don't know I was thinking about it actually but um you know I I just God I just don't know when the hell I would do it um but people like Carrie man from homestead how it just jumped right on that train because he saw how much of a massive benefit this made for him and he started talking to a lot of people who is massively helping he's just like no we need to get a documentary out we need to get this on Netflix we need to do something big and uh and so he's working on that so he's working on a cornivore documentary and so i' I've uh well tried to help out with that as much as I can and put him in touch with different people that can help with that and uh and I'll be presumably um in it as well and and talking to him and talking about all this sort of stuff in that documentary and so hopefully that that gets out now um Brian Sanders has been doing this for six years now so he's he's um you know the the um creator of food lies and the you know created that so he's making this documentary about food lives and now not necessarily carnivore but but the vilification about meat is dead ass wrong and showing that this is wrong and actually eating animal-based is very appropriate is more appropriate so it's not a carnivore do documentary per se but it's pretty damn close and it really goes exactly the opposite of where every other documentary says oh my God Less meat Less meat Less meat Less meat oh just just meat just causing disease or just stop eating it and you'll get better eat any ass plant that you want doesn't matter Hemlock whatever just eat it just just plants because that's what they say more more fruits and vegetables Less meat you do better okay well which ones you know they are different you know and most plants on Earth are inedible you can't just tell people just to eat any random plant and it'll be good and any meat will be bad that's ridiculous that is just ridiculous again going back to adaptation and these immutable laws of biology anyone who studies biology should damn well know this life is about adaptation and if you've not been adapting to something you're not designed for it if you have been adapting to it for millions of years then you are adapted to it and it is beneficial and it is good for you and um you know people like Simon Hill will say well just because we're adapted to it we've been eating it for millions of years doesn't mean it's actually good for us okay you name one example anywhere on Earth that that's true anywhere you know Lions have been eating meat for millions of years but yeah but but a fresh spring salad is going to be better for them really okay prove it right so why would it be different for humans and no other animal on earth why would the laws of adaptation only apply to other animals and not humans that is ridiculous that is a ridiculous statement so you have a lot of these ridiculous statements and then you have the Messiah and the akuu who then people will say well but the akuu yes they're not doing as well they're much less healthy um but they you know they they that's not the vegan diet I would recommend or the vegetarian diet because they do eat some meat and dairy very little that's not the vegetarian diet I would recommend okay so they're doing they're doing vegetarianism wrong that's always the classic excuse you're just doing vegetarianism wrong well your studies say that more fruits and vegetables and Less meat equal better but there's an entire population with 34 of a million people in the akiyu who in 1931 were eating clean nonprocessed food diet plant-base and the Messi were eating a clean nonprocessed food animal-based diet and the Messi Were Far and Away more healthy better developed five inches taller bigger brains more uh more body lean body mass and stronger and healthier had less Health defects right and birth and um um uh developmental defects right well that's but that's not the vegetarian diet I would recommend okay you said less meat better these guys have more meat they're doing better these guys are having more plants Less meat they're doing worse so your studies are crap if a study disagrees with reality it's wrong period doesn't matter right so even even like mathematical equations you know uh Richard Fineman said physicist he said doesn't matter how brilliant your theory is and it doesn't matter how smart you are if it doesn't agree with the experiment it's wrong and so you write this mathematical proof and Einstein was known to do this and he write this mathematical proof say I proved this great everyone's like my God you're a genius and then they go and observe things and go like yep that's not what's happening throw it out and Einstein would throw it out because he was smart enough to know that it didn't matter what he thought he proved in a mathematical proof he just looked looked at it and said yeah that's not what's happening okay obviously there's something here going on that I don't know I don't have all the variables and so we toss it out and that's what you have to do and so oh but there's this study and it said I don't care first of all the majority of studies come from uh food the Food and Drug industry why would you listen to any of those you know the Coca-Cola just cocacola not Kelloggs Pepsi Nestle General Mills all the rest of them just Coca-Cola spends 11 times the amount of money on nutritional research every year than the National Institutes of Health the NIH right the vast majority of of these studies are put out by the the Company's trying to sell you this right so you know I'm sure you know heroin cartels are going to put out as many studies as they can to tell you how great heroin is right why would you trust that you know it's the same thing these are cartels these are drug cartels they are making you sick they are making you addicted and they are profiting this is this is the opium trade this is the new opium trade where people are making entire Empires based on your addiction and your sickness do not listen to these people now they're and then they're putting out studies saying how great opium is I bet they are right why would you listen to that why would you listen to this crap it doesn't agree with reality right so well more plants less less meat that's better because meat causes harm that's their contention but you have the Messi more meat more Dairy drinking blood barely any plants and they're the healthiest people in that region right and they inbreed they interent marry right so they're genetically similar right and you have three4 of a million akuu at the time mostly plant-based clean no processed food no pesticides no fertilizer anything like that not doing very well and it wasn't and and they supplemented them gave them uh you know nutritional supplements because they're all deficient got them up to up to Snuff didn't help didn't help their health issues it wasn't until they replaced the plants they were eating with meat that's when they improved okay so again it doesn't meet with reality it's wrong okay and um and so people like Brian Sanders are making documentary showing all the lies and how wrong this stuff is so that's coming out hopefully that'll be done this year he's put a lot of work into that and I'm really excited to see that um I have a bit of a cameo in it if they decide to keep uh some of my my things I've said in there uh which would be great but uh but it's massive it's massive that mean they've been putting this together for six years so I'm really excited for that so that'll be uh so people don't know Brian Sanders um just look him up on on Instagram um he has a YouTube channel and podcast as well uh it's all run out of like his uh Instagram Pages um food lies and I think it's the website like food lies.com or something like that but certainly on Instagram and so that's Brian's um Instagram and you can you can find all the YouTube channel and podcast stuff through that as well and I've been on his podcast and he's been on mine so really nice guy and um and he I'm really looking forward to that documentary and then I'm really looking forward to carrye uh Carrie man's documentary as well because that that one is specifically carnivore like carnivore helps people going following people and tracking people as they go they're like okay I'm going to get started on Carnivore and and they're doing before middle and after and seeing how this affects people in real time which I think is really really powerful one of the one of the most gripping and Powerful food documentaries which really started the genre was uh it's called fat sick and nearly dead as you this guy was very sick unwell he's taking all these medications he had I think he had some autoimmune issues and he basically went to just a clean nonprocessed food diet and was juicing vegetables but he was still eating meat but he was just sort of juicing things and stuff like that and you could see him he was just losing weight and skin getting better and like throughout the documentary he was going around talking to people and he was just looking healthier and healthier and healthier as he went he's always drinking this green smoothie so that was influenced by the by the vegan Community like Dr uh Joel Ferman if I'm not mistaken I'm pretty sure it's Joel Ferman and um and uh so that had that sort of bent but it was very it was very powerful now this was only him it was only his progress um whereas in the cornivore diet we're going to be showing all sorts of people or car's going to be showing all sorts of people not just one person getting better and and really talking about the science behind it and things like that so hopefully it has has a similar impact and um yeah so so exciting times so um I don't know maybe I'll do one I am working on a book I'm hoping to get it out at the end of the year I'm I'm sort of getting more on on top of that and um uh yeah so we'll see we'll see if uh I can get that out by the end of the year or early next year and um and then yeah we have these cool documentaries coming out on in the pipeline as well so that's exciting Juju Barry thank you very much

        "body": "good look okay uh thank you very much Les Kaiser for a good look okay uh thank you very much Les Kaiser for a Super Chat the Buckeye state says hey well hello when I told my doctor I was starting carnivore he was happy hey that's that's that's a pleasant surprise uh it's happening more and more which is great he wants to use me for a guinea pig um as he has had many patients ask him about doing this diet but double my tens Jesus Christ okay um well look you you can you well this is this is your decision and taking any medication is is always the patient's decision um you know and if and and you can have a conversation with your doctor you say hey look you know I don't you know this is I'm thinking that maybe I don't want to take this for for these reasons or maybe you're happy to and all that sort of stuff but you know it is it's perfectly fine to have a conversation and just and just um you know relay any misgivings that you may have one thing to remember with statins is that um is that how how they lower LDL cholesterol is they they don't get rid of like the small dense so there's over a 100 different particles of LDL right and so or or different types and so the ones that we we probably don't want around are the small dense LDL okay so SD LDL that's a pattern B in your in your LDL cholesterol so do statins reduce those no they do not how statins work how they lower your total LDL cholesterol and again there's over 100 different kinds it stops your body from making the large buoyant LDL that you want those are the ones that you want okay and so that I can actually lower the ones that you want and then you have a disproportionately high ones if you don't want like the sdldl so according to the now people can watch my interview with uh Dr Aima HRA who's an Interventional cardiologist from the UK he wrote a whole book called a statin-free life and uh so people can watch that on my YouTube channel and and get the lowdown on statins and and cholesterol how I met him was we did a um a debate on on cholesterol and you know did have we got this right that that cholesterol is actually a driving factor for heart disease and we argued no that it wasn't and and we we won that we won that debate against sort of three other cardiologists and professors of medicine and things like that I was the only non-cardiologist there um which was funny but it's something that you know I've looked into and um you know so there's uh there is information out there showing that LDL and cholesterol in general was really never a marker for heart disease in the first place and you know we're we're lowering it in our diet we're lowering it with drugs and heart disease rates are going up right right now people say uh you know dishonest people will try to mislead you and say well you know deaths related to cardiovascular disease peaked in the 60s and 70s and now have been coming down steadily since well that's because our interventions have been getting better and we've stopped smoking as much right the rate of heart disease is going up the prevalence the incidence of heart disease is going up it's much higher than it was in this in the 60s and 70s much higher as a proportion of society and as a percentage of people getting it each year and firsttime heart attacks people having their first heart attack there are more people getting first time heart attacks they're just surviving right so it's very dishonest to try and and switch the goalposts and and say hey the rates of heart disease is going up well actually death from heart disease has has gone down not what I just said I said the rate of heart disease didn't I so when someone switches like that and they and they use weasel words and try to change the direction of what we're talking about you know they're dishonest and so if you ever catch anyone doing that call them out on it immediately because they are they're a fraud and they're trying to con you and don't let them so um your doctor's probably not going to do that the doctor sounds like a a very good guy and that is interested in this but you know just that's how people think about statins but just that's that's what statins do they lower your your large buoyant LDL molecules it stops your body from making those also stops it making in your brain lipor torbo Statin um and and other statins some of them will cross a bloodb brain barrier lipor which is a torvis Statin um unless I'm completely blank but I'm pretty sure it is that crosses your bloodb brain barrier if I'm not mistaken and uh and that can stop your brain from making cholesterol and a big proportion of your brain is cholesterol right you need it for myelination of your axons and things like that so that's not good so that's not actually what you want and so just remember that and remember that the the from the the studies published by the drug company so this is this is as pretty a pictures as ever going to be for Statin show that if you've had a heart attack and you go on statins for at least five years you will on average increase your life expectancy by five days Days right for years at least five years or more 20 plus years whatever of taking these things if you've had a heart attack if you have not had a heart attack do not increased life expectancy so what are we doing here and there was a study with over 11 million patients and they found that higher LDL cholesterol of any particulate size they didn't even look at distinguish the particulates they just said LDL period people with higher LDL cholesterol 11 million people big study higher the LDL the lower their all cause mortality meaning they lived longer so people with higher LDL cholesterol lived the the longest okay so you know just think about that and you can watch my my video just called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease where I talk about how this is really just this has been a scapegoat and it's it's not the cause of heart disease and and there's a lot of evidence for that and um in fact just the best evidence is that the cholesterol uh being the cholesterol model and theory of heart disease in the first place was uh put out by by the Sugar Company and they paid off a number of different professors um three from Harvard at least anel Keys famously who came up with that model and they were on the payroll for the sugar companies and they did not tell anybody and that's illegal and one of those Harvard professors was named head of the USDA and he was the one who authored and published the 1977 declaration saying that cholesterol causes heart disease stop eating it stop eating saturated fat and that's and that's what changed everything it was hotly debated for decades before that and then that shut down the argument so and that was false that was fraud that was they were bought and paid for and we have documentation of that that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2016 okay that's a matter of historical record that happened we have clear documentation we even have their their um their contracts we know how much they got paid these guys got paid $6,500 back in the 60s that's the equivalent of $55,000 now so selling out your health and your parents health and having your parents and grandparents die early and die of dementia uh was you know they they got a new Camry for that that that's what that's what the health of your family and your children was worth to them it's sick and um and I you know it's it's just sad that these people have all passed away so that we can't execute them for their crimes against humanity because truly those are crimes against humanity the hundreds of millions billions of people that they affected and damaged and killed prematurely because of that terrible terrible lie that they made is is staggering I mean I don't think we'll ever be able to calculate the amount of of harm that this has caused but I mean you're talking about billions of people that have been Ser I mean all the kids that have been raised on a lowfat diet with a bunch of processed foods none of them have developed properly all the developmental issues developmental delays shorter stature um smaller I you know shrinking IQs things like that that is all directly related to eating the wrong thing and not getting enough fat and cholesterol for our brains to develop properly and eating a whole bunch of things that that screw with our lives and now the drug companies are complicit with it now and saying oh everyone over 40 should be on a Statin purely because you're over 40 get bent like I have absolutely no interest in anything that these people have to say um so I love that your doctor is is uh interested in this um you know watch that video that I did the truth about the carnival or the truth about cholesterol and heart disease watched the interview I do with Dr motra watch the one I do with uh Dr Paul Mason that's that will that really interesting that's that's one of my favorite ones um that will tell you a lot about cholesterol and statins and then you can make an informed decision and and have a discussion an informed discussion with your doctor and it sounds like he's a he's a reasonable guy and uh will likely have a very reasonable and reasoned um conversation with you so uh yeah so just just give it a shot but yeah that's awesome and uh sounds good so keep it up Joseph thank you very much for the"

        "body": "good so keep it up Joseph thank you very much for the good so keep it up Joseph thank you very much for the Super Chat question uh 33 uh healthy male with aspergers carnivore high fat help uh fasting helps greatly well that's great to hear suggestions to improve being on the spectrum that aren't gimmicks I've seen Esters MCT oil uh sulfurane uh epicore Etc well I'd save the hell away from sulfurane um that's that's something that's so toxic that the plant doesn't even keep it in its full form just like you know with cyanide they keep keep it separate and they start chewing it and releases these chemicals which then bind to form hydrogen cyanide which is deadly to all life um and then sulfurane is the same same sort of mechanism where you you chew up things like it's in broccoli and other sorts of things you chew it up and then releases these chemicals which then bind and combine to to make sulfurane uh so that's so toxic that even the plant doesn't want to get near it it's just it's just a kill switch you're going to kill me I'm gonna take you out with me right you start chewing me I'm going to release this toxic poison that's going to get you right so I you know maybe in in low doses whatever maybe it helps because you know what is medicine it's just a poison that that it certain doses at certain times gives more benefit than harm but if you don't have that if you're not in that moment and at that dose it only causes harm or just doesn't do anything anything beneficial anyway so uh you know until we have some you know trials you know uh some phase three trials going out there showing that certain dose of sulfurane helps in this for Aspergers I would I wouldn't I wouldn't touch it but uh that's just me um no the the main thing is is being on a proper human diet having things that are that are beneficial to your brain like meat and fat in particular animal fat Omega-3s fatty acids which you can get from from beef but if it's grain finished for too long intensively grain finished it will have much less omega-3 so you know have a have a tin of sardines and you know in it in water don't have it in like sunflower oil or any sort of seed oil or anything like that miserable uh oils like that um just in water without herbs or anything like that just get them plain plain plain and um you know maybe some cod liver in its own oil and things like that uh those sorts of things uh those are going to have great great amounts of Omega-3s or you know just have salmon or fish or whatever once a week something like that um that is going to give you the things that you need to to grow and maintain your brain and then specifically avoiding things that are going to curtail it so uh being in ketosis not having any any carbohydrates right whether you're in or out of ketosis is not really the issue it's just staying away from carbohydrates because there are I mean there there are papers out that argue say you know uh there's one I believe it's called um uh ketosis as a treatment for autism and it just goes through all the evid evidence as why this is this is probably a good idea and their entire treatment uh facilities for people with with uh autism and Asbergers who uh which is on the Spectrum for autism uh who are having great success with ketogenic diets in general and I think carnivore is the best ketogenic diet so just just keep it carnivore high fat red meat have some omega you know fish and get for the Omega-3s once or twice a week you know sardines are great you know the bigger carnivorous fish they they'll sort of get more of a load of heavy metals and so the smaller fish that sort of don't eat a lot of other fish they don't have as much of a buildup of these heavy metals that can be a problem so uh you know that's why sardines are you know probably a good option there too but yeah so getting those omega3 is getting those things that are good for your brain and your body and then just avoiding all the things that are going to screw it up like carbohydrates which will raise your insulin which will drop your ketones and ketones are the most important fuel for your brain and so you start running on glucose and your brain will not run as well so those aren't gimmicks those have been shown in in studies uh to be effective um MCT oil maybe Esters maybe I don't I don't know of any evidence for that but you can play with it but I think that if you are eating just High fat carnivore diet you're going to get all of that that you need your ketones are going to be up uh you're going to have a lot of healthy fats and uh cholesterol around to build and maintain and run your brain and uh that's what you need so and you'll get all the things that you need too because some some um forms of autism can be just from nutritional deficiencies like there's one at Texas A&M showed that you can get this from uh carnitine deficiency only 70% people say oh that's that's a non-essential amino acid only for about 70% of people the other 30% don't make enough or or any at all and so they have to get it from their diet and it only comes from meat so you're doing the things that you need to do you're eating the things that your body needs and your brain needs and then you're eliminating out all the things that could potentially cause harm and so that's great so just fatty red meat and water grain finished sorry grassfed and finished if you can because that has a better complement of Omega-3s maybe sardines once or twice a week and don't eat anything else certainly no seed oil certainly no plant oil certainly no sugar certainly no carbs and I think you'll do great and you just keep going as you are and uh you'll just keep getting better and better so good luck with that P Anderson thank you very much for

        "body": "rd so well done Lying Eyes thank you very much for the rd so well done Lying Eyes thank you very much for the Super Chat can you reinforce the importance of going completely carnivore and the reasons not giving up sweeteners or fruit interfere with your improvements um well look I I just think it just comes down fundamentally to what we're biologically designed to eat you know as I've mentioned before so you know what you're designed to eat what we've adapted to eating uh is is what's going to be optimal for us and so if you're if you're taking in anything that didn't even exist a hundred years ago like artificial sweeteners you know why are we why are we doing that why are we entertaining that now you know fruit so fruit we can go into the specifics but know all fruit is not made equal most fruit on Earth will still kill you you know the catary Bird eats 150 different kinds of fruit every single one will kill you right because they evolved with the catary bird and it can that seed can only germinate if it goes through the digestion of a cassor bird so if C birds leave an area those plants die out and if something else starts eating those fruit and the Cass Bird's not eating it they die out so it has to be very attractive to the Cass bird it has to be very very offputting or deadly to anything else trying to eat it or else they die right they die out and so you know they have to protect they have to protect their own so uh then there are other fruits and things like that that we do better with especially the sweeter ones but we we've engineered these things to have way too much sugar and that Sugar can be a problem and it's less of a problem than eating you know refined separated sugar because there are things that are beneficial and you know vitamin C can Offset you know some of the the the problems with um and different vitamins can offset the problems with fructose um fiber can reduce the absorption by about 30% of fructose so you know you'll get less of it but there's you know you eat enough and it's going to be a problem and um you know when were we eating this stuff traditionally we're eating this stuff uh never during the Ice Age and outside of the ice age or in places that didn't have ice covering it you know 365 days a year uh we had access to some of these things which weren't all that sweet mostly pretty tart and bitter or or or or tart I should say um and bitter you would you wouldn't need it because that's telling you something's bad in there um but not sweet anyway and it was it was available you know a few weeks out of the year and and that's it you know and we didn't have it every day we didn't have access to it all day every day uh not for millions of years anyway you know maybe during certain periods around the equator um for some people but other people that were in the northern and southern l Tes during the ice ages no so we certainly don't need it and even even the sweet fruits do have defense chemicals they just have less right and so but there are furanic cumerin in all citrus that react with the sun and cause damage to your body they bind irreversibly to proteins and DNA and they damage them you get that on your skin and the Sun hits it you will get chemical burns on your body right right so there are defense chemicals in there there're just there just may be less of them they're not going to kill you sort of things it's safe it's not going to kill you that day so you get a hit of energy but it's not perfect energy it's not all the nutrients you need it's not necessary we know that because there people surviving these ice ages in in the extreme North and South did not have access to fruits for tens of thousands of years okay so we don't need it right and so if it's not ideal it's not necessary it's not optimal and so adding in a bit of fruits and things like that okay if you want to and if you do okay with it go for it but you're eating carbohydrates you're going to derail your your metabolism your insulin goes up and it's going to take you out of our primary metabolic State you're not going to be able to to make blood sugar and glycogen and ketones and you're not going to feel as good you're going to sort of feel good for a bit because you have a bit of a sugar rush and then your insulin stays up and your blood sugar goes down and you can't push out out ketones and you feel worse so I feel a lot better without any of that a lot better you I drink a glass of milk and I feel fine for a minute and then I'm like oh my God I'm tired because same thing I get reactive hypoglycemia my body is isn't has suppressed the ketones right so I don't think it's great uh to do I don't think it's optimal I do know a lot of people that are doing you know having some fruit uh you know with carnivore and they do a lot better than they were doing before but then they drop the fruit and they're like wow I'm doing even better still so that's great and so if you want to add in a bit of fruit and you do fine with it go for it but I just I just recommend people try it you know try going off and just try having just meat and see how you feel and if you feel better great and if you don't fine you know but just just try that yourself I feel a lot better without it and so you know I mean my main thing is just is just like Brian Sanders just like meat has been unfairly vilified and that's and plants are actually Toxic by Nature so we should really think about this a bit better but if you want to eat any of that stuff that's totally fine so just do some self-experimentation um try it you know both with and without and uh and see how you feel and and see what you want to do that's that's um that's what peo ple should do laughing gas thank you very

physique achievable on a carnivore diet and general exercise or did you have a specific routine and program what would you recommend for someone who wants similar results in physique so so this is what I look like out of shape so I'm I I don't I've been back in the gym sort of the past two weeks um but literally two weeks and before that I haven't been really going all that often just just due to time and just I've been out of you know out of the routine um so the diet can maintain your physique and a low body fat and uh musculature whatever you done but yeah I've spent years in the gym working out and things like that I just I work out I try to work out like lift weights and things like that I would always try to lift weights four days a week and then I'd have rugby practice on top of that and and other sort of Sprint training petric trainings and things like that independently so I was working out a lot and I you know built up a lot of musculature and um you know when I was just back on Carnivore I was you know I was always been sort of muscular because I've always sort of worked out a lot but now I really hit into it and was because I had a home gym and I I had time on my hands so I would I would lift weights for three to four hours a day every every day and maybe have one rest day a week maybe uh but yeah I was just just lifting like a beast so uh yeah no you can get this you can definitely get on a carnivore diet it's been easier to put on muscle and get lean on a carnivore diet than anything I've ever done before and so just keep eating uh fatty red meat preferably you don't need a bunch of protein shakes or anything like that you'll get hundreds of grams of protein just from eating steak and uh or or whatever meat and uh and then just work out um sprinting great Hill Sprints even greater and uh lifting weights and going to failure I go to muscle fatigue and exhaustion that's how I just I just work until I've worn out the muscle group it's a lot harder on a carnivore diet so I was doing like crazy sets I was doing like 20 sets you know like I think it was Meer you know professional bodybuilder he said you just did sort of one set he's like oh after that you two sets three sets whatever like yeah sure you get more work out of it but you know there's a detriment because it takes longer for you to recover it didn't take any time at all for me to recover um I you know I was doing this um I some I could do it every day but I thought that was stupid I wanted to let it rest so I would I was doing it every day so I was doing 20 sets of bench 20 sets of dips 20 sets of flies 20 sets of incline every other day it was hours and hours and hours and hours just ridiculous with not all that much rest in between and you know a couple minutes and so you know it's um you just recover so much better now I don't I don't know if that's better or not I don't we haven't really done tests and studies on on people that eat the way I do and recover as quickly as I do uh Dr jawish is of the opinion that you don't want to do that you just do one set to failure especially with the bands the banded exercises and that's all you need to do and you get sort of diminishing returns after that fair enough um but either way uh you you however many sets you're doing uh and you know three sets to failure is fair enough if you want to sort of split the difference um and uh or even just one set to failure or whatever if you're doing them sort of just slow and steady and doing them right really good reps good sets um see how you go see what works for you but but just at least whatever you're doing doing it to exhaustion where you're just really worn yourself out get the whole body and consistency that's the key whatever you're doing work to failure so push yourself and do it consistently if you're going to go four days a week like I do Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday without fail you get those done and other days are bonus maybe you want to do an extra leg day on Wednesdays or you want to do sprints on Saturdays go for it but those days are sacr saan Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday that's that's my routine and I I'll I'll add in other days but I those days get done and you just do that and you keep doing that and you keep working out if you push yourself up now there's a difference but I have friends of mine that I would go work out with they would like oh yeah I'm working out four days a week five days a week this and the other I'm looking at I'm like it doesn't look like you've ever been in the gym and then we go uh to the gym together once and I I realize why because they really just didn't push themselves you know they do decent amount of weight like on say bench and they just going they just go like okay yeah you're doing great and they just rip out 10 real easily I'm like great man keep going and they just try to put it up and I'm like well what are you doing man you're not done and like I Tred to like push back no hey keep going keep going they're like fighting me to put it on literally this happened friend of mine was just pushing back like no no and I was just like I was leaning on it and pressing it back on him saying like get down do it another one and he was able to force my body weight up put this thing on the rack it's like I'm sorry if you're able to lift the bar with all the weights and my body weight off the ground and put it on on the rack you clearly are not done right and so that's the thing so they're doing some work but they're not actually taxing themselves and stimulating that muscle growth so that's what you want to do and yeah you absolutely you can absolutely get a fantastic physique uh you just put in the hard work and eat the right food and so carnivore is the right food and I've just described the right work so uh you you you'll do fine man just it has to be consistent you have to keep it up you know it doesn't happen in two weeks you know you talk to people and say you how does my how are my legs look how does my butt it's getting bigger like you know things like that like it's been two weeks you know you you you're doing great and you can notice difference in two weeks if you're working hard you and you you know and that that is something that you can see but you know it just wait six months and then start looking or monthly you know take monthly pictures and all that sort of stuff but it takes it takes a long time especially if you're coming from from a zero Baseline if you're not if you haven't really been working out a lot um you know it's just it's it'll take time but it will come you just have to stay consistent and so if you just go for a couple weeks and then sort of Peter out you know that's that's not going to get you what you where you want to go uh"

there's one down here my God there's a lot of these things Jesus all maybe I do need a moderator there's a lot of weird ass things Jesus Christ all right well maybe that guy just needs to be yeah why don't we just why don't we just I saw one person doing some stupid so I just uh blocked his ass what is wrong with these people um here's this quick one more here Murray Nathan question bacon versus ground pork do they provide equal nutrition uh probably pretty similar um depends on the fat content and the fat description you know depends on how the pigs were raised if they're feeding them a bunch of soy and corn and things like that they're going to have higher levels of of linolic acid which aren't great bacon just is pork it's just fatty pork pork um and depending on how you make that it um can be better or worse for you if they add sugar and and different sorts of ingredients and artificial ingredients and things like that it's not uh it's not great um so uh but yeah basically if it's coming from the same Pig it's still Pig it's just the same as as you know brisket and steak or ground beef from the same cow it's going to have the same nutritional value give in similar portions of of um of uh similar portions of fat and and uh and lean so yeah that that should be fine dude there are some weird bloody things on here um Jesus Christ oh that guy's gotta go too gee what's wrong with people some lunatics um screaming out from mods okay I'll I'll I'll find some mods where's some mods maybe I can see if there's um some of the people on like my patreon and things like that that uh want to be moderators let's see Jesus Christ come on where are we going here sorry I'm just there are a lot of comments so I'm just trying to work my way through these things um what is wrong what is going on here Jesus Christ all right Jesus age mother oh my good God okay what go okay let's let's find that lady who wanted to be a moderator and make her a moderator and little boy oh hey buddy there's Pao that's good that's a good start I think she was just above [Music] that there's the old people smell one hey little guy okay so can I be a moderator I don't know how to make you a moderator let me see maybe I can do it on YouTube um oh little boy come [Music] here all right sorry if people have questions talk among yourselves things like that and I will try and find how the hell to make someone a moderator come on what's going on here come on why won't it bloody well um fine beef it to be fit you can be a you can be a moderator and I have to find this other person there you go you're moderator please don't uh Jesus what is with these people Jesus God Almighty what is wrong with these people saying absolutely ridiculous things uh um okay so Jesus all right all right I'm G to try to find Paul Salos let me see um okay so I found Paul Sal's one I can't put it up but I found it here on the other chat so I'm 78 good shape but just de to try the carnivore diet now for one week and feeling good great my concern is what impact all the meat and fat will have on gout as I have them from time to time so um when people have well we've been treating gout as a as a a medical establishment since the 1800s with a pure red meat and water diet so I think You' be fine um when you get rid of all the sugar and fructose and alcohol and things like that uh you generally won't get gout U maybe you might have a a flare up or two um uh you know early on but that will go away and and then they'll stay away so I don't I don't think that that's going to be a problem for you but just see how you go you probably won't have a flare up if you do it will go away and uh it they generally don't really come back after one or two one or two goes and then you're and then you're good um let's see here as well I want how do I get Jennifer Jennifer Skinner it's not letting me put you in as a as a moderator because for some reason it doesn't let me put on moderators that gave super chats for some stupid reason so Jennifer maybe send another chat and I'll make you a moderator too uh where are you let me see um there okay see if there's Jennifer has any any other Jennifer Skinner why won't it let me I use a moderator that's weird okay I don't know what the hell's going on here R Rose why oh I have to do it on I have to do on YouTube that's why H this is annoying okay what is wrong with these [Music] people a lot of things wrong with these people I think everyone yeah so thank you for pointing out this this non nonsense um Nazis right um okay all right so people saying that that's got it for now let's see where the hell is everyone else um going try and find some people I know here Jennifer Skinner I'm still here there you go and now you're a moderator great and if um Rachel Maran can I be your moderator too um let see oh come on who else um all right I'll have to figure this [Music] out who else is going on here all right well maybe that's enough for now are they still doing it I've blocked a number of these idiots so hopefully that's good um okay I don't know I think that's enough all right so we've got a couple moderators um and and we got these the idiots out of there so that's good and uh yeah and people saying be careful you pick his Moder yeah I'm yeah I'm I'm I'm with you on that that's um that's that's why I never sort of picked moderators but uh uh either way we'll start with those two and uh at least I can I can keep track of that and um and uh you know and that'll be fine and then maybe some people that from my I'll ask my my patreon members if they uh would like to moderate and things like that because um that's uh that's sort of easier because I have more contact with them and and I know them so okay all right well um let's see I think I got a couple more Super chats here towards the end um uh I'll just go through these and then and then we'll wrap up so thanks weird little hiccup there thank you everyone for being patient um but uh you know yeah that's that was a bit weird there were people saying some pretty obnoxious stuff and I don't always see that so thank you all for ke eping an eye out

have to to bounce off to some other meetings thank you thank you all very much but so de says I am type two diabetic and saw a glucose Spike after eating a big steak I understand this is a glucano Genesis should I eat less red meat and increase fat um well yeah so look if you're if you're you should you want to be eating a lot of fat anyway you know generally glucano Genesis is is demand driven as opposed to substrate driven you're going to get a bit of a bump in your blood sugar or in your insulin but it's it's it's going to be small it's going to be transient and that's okay you know the it it doesn't really matter one way or the other as long as you're eating what's physiological because if you're eating what your body's designed to eat then it's doing what it's designed to do so if you go out of ketosis and then back in fine if you're staying ketosis all the time fine if you've never gone in ketosis and you're just eating meat I don't care I have no idea what my ketones are I have no idea what my blood sugar is because I'm going on first principles that this is what my body's designed to do this is what our species is designed to do we're designed to eat meat and that's a fact we've been eating meat for millions of years and so that's what we're biologically adapted and designed to do and so whether we're uh you know designed through nature designed through God and whatever we are designed to eat meat and so if we eat meat and uh and nothing else then we're going to work the way we're supposed to work and so if that means your blood sugar goes up a bit and your insulin goes up a bit fine you know if you're type two diabetic and you're still very insulin resistant you're you're going to see bigger spikes just because your body doesn't doesn't control these things as well as others but eventually that'll calm down and you'll get back to where U other people would be without diabetes and so um you know eat a lot of fat definitely e a lot of fat like ribeye level of fat or maybe even a little bit more uh you want to get a gram to two grams of fat per one gram of protein and so that uh that's a lot of fat that's a lot more fat than most people think um they should they should eat or ever have eaten before so just uh just um you know just just uh don't worry about that if you're on medication for your diabetes continue on your medication for diabetes work with your doctor to come off of that when and as you can because you will have less and less demand for that and your body will uh re reverse its insulin resistance and its demand for so much insulin and so much and the blood sugar spikes and uh will start leveling off and but yeah definitely eat a lot of fat fatty meat and uh and then after that just let your body get on with it you know if your if your blood sugar goes up a bit so so be it I had no idea you know I got a constant glucose monitor from uh Dr Casey means she has a company called levels and I just did an interview with her very interesting um interview that people uh that will be coming out in the next couple weeks and um and so she sent me uh one of these constant glucose monitors and I'll be interested just to see sort of what happens but it's purely academic for me you know it's just like I eat a steak and that's what happens interesting that's what happens when you eat a steak great and this is what it is when I'm not eating steak lovely that's interesting or when I out it's it's purely academic to me because I'm I'm convinced that I'm doing what my body's designed to do and so if I do what my body's designed to do it's going to do what it's designed to do and if that means it go my blood sugar goes up and my ketones go down and and then the reverse happens in other situations fine uh that's interesting but if it's not going to change anything that I do so you know I mean yeah you know you can see about how you're feeling and what you're doing and when you're eating and you know but i' I've sort of figured that out anyway on just how I feel I don't feel as good if I eat during the day because I get tired I get lethargic I don't have energy is that going to correspond with differences in my ketones and blood sugar quite possibly but I already know that I don't feel great now maybe I could track that and say oh when when my ketones are like this my blood sugar is like that I feel better what did I do to get here and then sort of reverse engineer it but at least for me I've sort of already figured out when I feel good and and how I can do it and uh and that's those are the sort of things I suggest to other people that they try to figure out as well um so for me it's it's just it's interesting but you know I'm eating what I'm supposed to eat my body's going to work the way it's supposed to work and that's that's really all I'm I'm concerned about uh madav uh does rol make one anxious I feel so uh potentially you know I I don't know if we have any studies on that but ruol is just a weird chemical that's not supposed to be in your body it's not something we're adapted to it's not something we've been uh developing with and and um is not something we've been exposed to for thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of years so it's not something you want to put in your body anything that didn't exist 50,000 years ago in the last I AG in the ice not something you want to put in your body for Optimal Health that's my opinion anyway okay all right everyone thank you so much uh everyone for for uh coming to the chat
