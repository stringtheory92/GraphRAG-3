    "title": "Dr Chaffee and Simon Lewis LIVE Q&A! (March 31st, 2023)",
    "transcript": "hey thanks how are you sorry about uh running late just had another meeting no no worries man it happens um good to have you on board we've got 76 people in as soon as you join a lot of people jumped in um and the question the questions are coming in thick and fast so we are only human so we will do one question at a time the fear of getting absolutely nothing done um so I I thought we might start with Joanne Dr chafee she was saying um she's been doing Carnival for three months she's felt amazing the whole time but the last two weeks her energy is really plummeted uh I asked her if unwell maybe if she was sick or had a cold she said no but then she also said she's not showing any ketones I haven't asked how she's testing for the ketones hmm yeah some often people would test with their urine and that's not the best way to test for ketones you want you want your blood Ketone level but um I guess it really matters you know exactly what she's doing a lot of people think of carnivore um as uh you know oh a lot of people you know consider carnivore you know different things right so say okay well I'm doing keto I'm or doing carnivore but they're still having like artificial sweeteners or monk fruit sugar or these different sorts of things that can sort of disrupt your your metabolism disrupt your um uh insulin uh levels and can affect your your blood sugar if you Dr if you're eating dairy or you're using um uh you know like a milk or something like that that has enough carbs to sort of you know can pop you out can raise your insulin enough to like drop your blood sugar you feel a bit crappy because you're not really making a lot of ketones your blood sugar is a bit low so you can feel a bit crummy that way um the you know the other thing is sometimes people aren't eating enough they're not eating enough they're not eating enough fat um or they could be eating like a big meal during the day that's that's one thing that people have um have noticed in the past that that if they eat a big meal of meat they will feel very lethargic right so a lot of your blood is going to be going down into your digestive tract that's just going to take away blood from the rest of your body and it puts you into a rest and digest most you'll get a bit lethargic and tired because of that and so that can be something as well that's why I generally don't eat much during the day if I do eat during the day it's a smaller meal I'm not going to have I'm going to wait for my big meal to be um you know later in the day so you know towards the end of the day and I'm just naturally tired and want to go to bed so those are those are some things you can troubleshoot um trying to eat in the evening one big meal a day and making sure you're getting enough meat making sure you're getting enough fat in particular and eating until meat stops tasting good that's how you know if you've had enough is that you just do bodies just telling you hey I don't I don't want this anymore and so so that's what I would try in drinking water and Messi and ensuring that your sleep quality is good turning on lights towards the end of the day using a sleep mask getting Morning Light getting cold exposure things like that all of these things contribute it's not just it's not just Diet also you feel when you know you ask her like if she had a cold or flu or something like that uh and she said no typically people will say no even if they're exposed to germs so being sick feels different on a carnivore diet you know it's I I experienced this as well where I was just feeling crummy and tired and not feeling great and but I didn't feel sick and um and my parents were doing carnival at the time and I sort of felt the same way that I just don't have much energy like yeah that's weird then we noticed that all the rest of our family would have the flu you know and everyone was sick and like oh yeah you know Morgan kids can't you know do anything because you know they've all got the flu and then you know my brother had the flu my other sister had the flu and we're like okay that's what it is our body's fighting this off and it's just taking more energy to fight this off and so everybody sellings just chill out calm down take it easy you know don't don't fight any Panthers today and um and that's uh and that can be normal too so it could be that you are finding something off as well and that that's totally normal so what I would do is just continue on and you know optimize all those little things we talked about and then just write it out you know she should get through it one way or the other that should resolve and you should get your energy levels back yeah thanks um yeah Joanne you're still on I'm pretty sure so I am also curious about whether you're eating really large meals during the day um that can uh yeah that can take the energy and then also I imagine that could knock you out of ketosis as well because it's a big portion of protein um so you're going to get gluconeogenesis so that's that's something to think about um we've got some other questions here just a really Carnival diet to our husband's toe fungus uh yeah no probably probably not I mean it's you know toe fungus is on the surface of your of your toenail and your foot so it's not really like an infection of the body you you can incr improve your um you can improve your your own immune system but that's just going to stop the the fungus that I get from getting into your body and making a uh you know an infection or like a systemic infection um so it's uh probably not no you still need to you still need to get sort of like topical treatments for that sort of thing as well but it'll help everything else and so it's uh it's still worth doing yeah okay uh we've got a question from primatology here it's about sleep and he says um what are some strategies for improving sleep if you're constantly waking up in the middle of the night it's not tired but wired with me it's more like I wake up in the middle of the night immediately feeling like it's the middle of the day but there's nothing to do I just lay there to me that sounds like wide but tired but he says it's not well I mean but but what you're saying he's not tired he's saying he's just wired you know and that's good yeah I mean this happens from people some people find that they um that they're just not as high they don't require as much sleep and so you know all of a sudden they're sleeping for five six hours and they're like I'm awake now it's like well what the hell is this well before you weren't getting the same quality sleep you weren't sleeping as well you needed more of it to to get what your body needed out of it now you don't and so that's just good I mean that that can't I mean there could be other things going on but if you feel good if you're not tired and if you have a lot of energy uh then your body's getting everything that needs is getting much higher quality of sleep and uh and I just I just you know run with it you know start working out in the mornings write a book you know I mean you you just got gifted four extra hours a day yeah you know like I just don't don't look a gift horse in the mouth man just just take it and run I wish I had that yeah I know um Arnold Schwarzenegger says that when he was in his prime he would sleep like four hours a night and he was working out for four to six hours every single day but he was eating a shirt of meat and he was very sick and healthy person um and he was just like sleep faster it worked for him um so when I quit caffeine I started sleeping less uh and it was easy in the morning so I mean you know it could be a few things but as you say just just appreciate it for the benefit that it is um from Marissa is HRT okay on carnivore yeah I mean it's as long as you're you're well you need to talk to your doctor about that obviously it's not it's not great for everyone but specifically in relation to a carnivore diet no that's not going to uh make it a problem or anything like that most people will find that they don't need HRT that their hormones are improved dramatically and they will they will absolutely improve and so what I recommend to people who are considering HRT um is you know just go carnivore for three months first three to six months really a year really if you can and and see how it goes because a lot of people significantly improve their hormones and you may not need it at all you may feel perfectly fine you may feel amazing and uh and don't don't need that sort of medication um which is great I mean you don't you want to be on as little medication as you can be and and be as healthy as you can be without any medication so I routinely see patients in clinic that um in the office that have gone on a carnivore die right like and then we'll increase their testosterone you know 30 40 percent in the first three months I mean that's crazy that's a massive massive massive boost some even more than that some uh some guys would go and they'll you know do 50 or even double one guy he was in his he was in his early 70s and he like over doubled his his testosterone level it got up to the point of like someone you would expect like a healthy young man in his twenties but he had that testosterone that like he was just bouncing off the walls I feel like I'm a teenager again I always just he was so excited and so so enthusiastic and uh and now you know that's you know not everyone going to get that massive of a result but I you know I've yet to see someone not improve anyway significantly so you know it can very well be you know I talk to people that want to get off HRT or or trt and and you know they go on a carnivore diet and they just feel so much better they're able to sort of bring themselves off of it uh which is hard to do you know a lot of people say you know once you start that as sort of you know you're sort of on it you know um that's not true you can absolutely come off this stuff and and going on uh you know hormonally appropriate you know biologically appropriate diet like a carnivore diet you're going to get a significant um boost your body's just going to work better you're going to give yourself a substrate you're going to give yourself more cholesterol to allow your body to make hormones properly and your body's not going to be disrupted with high insulin and and different um you know different carbs that comes with the food that we eat uh that disrupt your hormones a lot of hormone disruptors I mean like all the different phytoestrogens and phytohormones that are in plants to Jack around your your hormonal levels um really mess you up and really mess people up and so it's uh when you get rid of all that then people do significantly better so I would uh yes I it's not it's not unsafe to go on HRT or trt but but just you know find out if you need it go on a carnivore diet for a while see how you feel you may not want it you may not need it all the problems and the energy levels and all these different sorts of things that we associate with um you know depleted hormones a lot of those things will go away a lot of those things will get better and so you may find you're like yeah I'm good I don't need this so I'd give it I give it you know sort of three to six months and then and then talk to your doctor if that's something you still want to do oh awesome thanks man um we have we have a question here from Jamie do you have any insight into Carnival and male pattern hair loss I'm finding my hair is thinning and really want to overweight medication so there's there's a lot of different reasons for mailed parenterals I'm not at hair loss Specialist or anything like that but um it depends on the age it depends on what it depends on the individual but I do as I understand it um you can actually hasten hair loss uh by insulin resistance so if you have insulin resistance um that can you know damage the you know the hair follicles and things like that you can get you can get more more uh balding as well um it does seem that when people go on a carnivore die first of all you're getting all the protein you need you're getting all the fat cholesterol all these different sorts of nutrients you need so your body your hair your skin is going to be more nourished it's going to be more healthy and um the when the hair follicle is dead it's dead there's nothing you can do for that um to bring it back um but it's if before it dies you can increase its health and so you know that's something that you can potentially do and then you can start getting like new little buds of hair that would be hair follicles that just haven't quite dyed yet but they were so sick that they weren't producing hairs um and the hairs that you do have if they get healthier the The Roots can get thicker and so the base of it will get thicker so even if you have the same number of hairs it it looks like you have thicker hair just because the stalks are thicker so you know it is it's there's more volume to your hair even though it's the same number of hairs so yes it can help um there are a number of things that like insulin resistance and you know probably a lot of other things that can damage your hair and uh you know um you know my girlfriend now she has you know she has a business in the hair a big part of our television does hair extensions she ships out hair extensions um you know all over Australia and the world and and she was saying that actually vegans and vegetarians are some of her best clients because they have such thin poor quality hair they need these hair extensions to thicken up their hair and make it look more healthy and as she was saying she was just like vegans hairs are by far they have the worst hair ever and that's and that's what a lot of our friends in the industry say as well and so you know getting on proper nutrition and not you know eating these things that may have uh deleterious effects to your body and your health can certainly help your hair I can't promise it's going to grow your hair I can't promise it's going to stop you from going well there's other reasons uh that people go bald but um you'll you'll at least eliminate some reversible causes that you have control over and uh and so at least you can cover you can do what you're able to do and then just you know let let time you know take its course but you can at least address the you know the things that you can affect so that's that's what I would suggest thanks man um what have we got here uh Regina I've started to take electrolyte packages because I feel fatigue after two weeks of being on the kind of War diet and losing eight pounds I tried to do one pack a day of lmnt is this okay um uh she's been doing carnivore for two weeks lost eight pounds um her sugar is now normal but she's fatigued um so she's taking electrolytes lmnt uh I suppose you know we both know she she shouldn't need to be taking Elementary where how can she kind of overcome the fatigue feeling well yeah and you know it's not it's not an electrolyte issue generally that's going to cause fatigue you know um that'll cause different issues you know if you have low sodium you'll get very confused and you get seizures uh if you have low too low potassium you get heart arrhythmias and get going atrial fibrillation and then you know ventricular fibrillation and then you die so it's actually a big deal having electrolyte imbalances it's actually quite rare as well um so I think I think we're over prescribing uh electrolytes in in my view um but in any cases that shouldn't be the problem with the energy levels I think going back to you know the first question when we had with um with energy levels uh just doing those same things so in two weeks you know sometimes you're not completely fat adapted if you're still having artificial sweeteners or you know Hmong fruit sugar or or or milk and things like that you're going to mess up your energy levels you just are and so I would just think eliminate everything except meat salt water and um and then eat later in the day make sure you're eating enough eat until meat stops tasting good getting enough water getting your sleep right and um and then just you know seeing around you is like are there people sick are there people off with the flu that could be it too so those are the those are the ones that that's the way I would troubleshoot it and um yeah and most of the time it's you know just not quite fat adapted they're eating during the day and it's making them lethargic um they're not you know doing proper things for their sleep or they're um you know they're not eating enough that's that's the most common thing or they're they're using sweeteners or milk or whatever and that's messing up their their insulin metabolism uh so that's that's what I would do that's that's sort of checklist and drink more water like you know you're not going to do any damage by drinking too much water like that just that's just very very unlikely unless you're like waterboarding yourself just just drink more water yeah yeah I mean you know drinking you know most people having like a liter or a liter and a half a day you know and so if you're feeling tired or whatever you know you could probably go up on that you know I mean I used to drink two gallons of water a day when I was playing rugby uh but I was working out a lot and I was sweating a lot and so you know I required more but um most people can stand to drink more water 100 uh can can the carnival dot help women who have endometriosis um it just depends I mean it I've I have no data on this you know I don't think I don't know of any studies that have looked at like keto um and uh and things like that to um you know to help you know to help endometriosis I've I've spoken to some people that said they had endometriosis but it was like so far Advanced even when they did go carnivore you know they still needed surgery and other other sorts of things and I spoke to other people that actually had endometriosis and it did help um I can't say for sure that it's going to like reverse endometriosis which is tissue outside of the the uterus and getting in and um into the abdominal cavity and causing problems that way uh but you know in in keeping with all the other things that it does it you know it can reduce your inflammation and when you reduce your inflammation you reduce the expression of pain that you get and so you experience less pain so it could be and that you're also balancing your hormones and those are getting more normalized and so it can be that your experience of the symptoms of endometriosis improve uh I don't see why or how like that tissue would then shrink away or go away but you know you never know but we have no no evidence one way or the other um you know but like with you know the other gentleman uh with the toenail fungus I don't know if it's going to help you or fix that but I can say it's going to help you in a thousand other ways that will absolutely revolutionize your health and your life and so it's well worth the try and if it if it ends up helping your endometriosis then that's it's just a bonus that's even better so I think it's well worth a try um and just uh just to check it out because you know it's it's going to be the most most healthy thing you can do anyway yeah for sure we've done a video on PCOS which which went pretty well uh it's like a shortcut that you can find on YouTube and we were talking about ptos which is sort of caused by insulin resistance um I believe um so that would be if we wanted to check out one of the episode yeah one of the one of the causes I mean there's going to be other things that cause PCOS but um a major cause of PCOS is is high insulin and and so women make testosterone first and they convert that into estrogen in the ovaries High insulin levels block that so you have too much testosterone not enough estrogen and you can develop PCOS um and so just putting people on a ketogenic diet which a carnival diet is when done properly then you uh you can reverse that and so people are reversing a PCOS which is a leading cause the leading cause of female infertility uh in in America and and probably a lot of Western countries as well and um so yeah it's definitely worth worth doing for a number of different reasons cool uh is pork as bad as Paul saladino says it is I can't afford grass-fed every day LOL um well you know I I haven't I haven't seen um Dr solidino's critique on on pork you know um is it as good as beef no uh is it as bad as mangoes no you know so it's uh it's it's going to be better than any plant you have right unless you have like a like a flaring you know uh autoimmune issue you know like Michaela Peterson talks about how actually pork will will be worse for her autoimmune issues than fruit you know and fruit really messed her up so it's um it's you know it's up to the individual but I think it has a lot to do with what the animal's eating rather than you know the meat itself and so you know when you're having these if you have like a you know pasture-raised uh you know chicken and pork they're gonna be and they're eating what they're supposed to be eating and not eating a bunch of you know soy you know feed and corn nonsense so you know then they're they'll they'll probably be healthier for you and less of that garb original like translate into the meat um but yeah if you can't afford it man you just gotta eat what you what you can afford and so eat the meat that you can afford that you enjoy that makes you feel good and if that's pork then don't worry about it if you have a problem with pork and pork you know harming you in some way then you know try to look at further options but um you know I mean I eat some pork sometimes 99 of what I eat is beef but I'll have Olive you know bacon sometime you know like no no sugar bacon or pork bellies things like that you know and um you know and that's fine I don't have a problem with that and uh you know any meat is going to be better than any plant as a general rule of thumb unless you have a specific condition like Michaela Peterson um so look if you feel good on pork and that's where you can afford then just go for it man yeah I love the tastes I enjoy eating it I feel feel good so yeah find what works for you um I will say I'm in I'm in Indonesia now and there's not that much there's a bit of beef there's not that much but there's a lot of chicken um and I've been having a chicken here and it's actually really good and you can and I might have chicken once every two weeks when I mean Oz and I have seen the chickens here because they're like in cages and just like roaming free they are not your soft domestic chicken that you've seen Australia where they're sort of like all meat and look like they couldn't survive these things are Hardy like there's chicken the chickens could attack you we saw like six of them in cages just before um so yeah what what where they're brought up what they've all that stuff makes such a difference um yeah helped me tremendously with fungus so there you go oh well there you go great um yeah well that's good you know I mean it is going to improve your your innate defenses but it was just something in the nail like you don't have any blood supply to the nail right so it's not going to really get at it so um you know that's just but you know if it helps it helps that's great you know but I just wouldn't it wouldn't really expect it to uh with everyone you know so just be yeah don't don't don't forego the uh the topicals uh as well I was going to say you know in Indonesia they have those uh they have those uh crispy uh pork places as well have you been to one of those forget what it's called if they have like somebody's like suckling pig they'll do the whole thing a hole that's like a smaller one yeah and so you can get like the pieces and get like the skin it's just like crispy skin as well it's uh like literally my mother's watering right now like that's all I ate when I was in Bali and like I just went to these places I just got like like six orders I was just like actually I want like six of these and he's like oh well it's just you one at a time I was like well how about you just give me what I asked for you know and uh yeah a dude made like a deal with me and he was just like okay well maybe maybe bring out bring out just two and then if you keep one you can bring it I'm like I'm telling you I'm gonna want six and he's just like he's like okay we'll just go to one time so finish Jules like yeah can I get two more please he's just like okay brought him out two more like yeah two more please you know figures it up and I was like told you six that's what I wanted and a difference with the maze he was just blown away yeah I went I found I found this awesome place yesterday where um it's it's really good value and you get you get six eggs you get six poached eggs bacon and sausage and it's like 10 bucks uh and every I went there yet twice yesterday so I said I went there initially ordered my six eggs and she's like you sure you want six and I said yeah bring the six eight and then I was back there at lunch time for another six years she's like more you're more eggs you're the eggs guy yeah yeah wasn't that I mean like six eight someone else said that too there were things like oh and get five if you want five eggs I was just like when did five eggs become alive you know I agree I get I could yeah I go to when I go to the hospital cafeteria like I get I get um six long strips of bacon and and 10 eggs I was like 10 eggs to 10 eggs yeah ten eggs and six strips of bacon so it's like it's like it's you know it's a ton of these things at first they were just like Jesus you know but but now they just know it's just like yeah you want the usual you want the breakfast and like uh people go in there like ask for the doctor Chaffee breakfast and like they just they know exactly what it is they're like okay she want 10 eggs just like you know four eggs and two bacon or something like that yeah like um Regina should we eat butter to help hormones steak and butter girl has mentioned it um well you know just just as long as you're getting enough fat you know so if you're not getting enough fat from the meat that you're eating you know supplementing butter is fine um I don't think that if you're eating fatty like you're having a rib eye and that's enough fat for you then you know then then the butter is you know optional like you don't you don't need it at that point but if if you're not getting enough fat and your stools are drying hard and things like that which is indicative that your body's not getting enough fat that you're not eating enough fat um then yeah just adding in butter like so you know the the meat in Australia's quite Lean by Design and so I I added in butter all the time like I'll melt butter onto my steak just because I want to increase the fat content and uh and that's fine some people have a problem with butter some people have a problem with with milk proteins and even in butter most people are fine most people are fine with like grass-fed butter but you know if you're not then Tallow is fine too or just just getting fatty cuts of meat you know like Chuck is a great fatty cut of meat brisk it's super fatty those sorts of things are are a very good option so it's just a matter of getting enough fat and some people just don't realize just how much fat that is it's actually a lot more fat than you've ever eaten to the extent that it could be like oh my God these people are just eating butter and eating fat and and sometimes you know you can do that you know uh you know Bella is just making a very clear point and statement that one that's good for you it's not bad for you it's not causing a problem and two you need a lot of it and so however you get it uh just get it you know and if that means eating some butter you can eat some butter it actually tastes really good yeah and um appetizing yeah well it's just tasty like I used to catch you know back when when I used to think that if that was bad for you you know when I went back when we're all indoctrinated you know my mom really loved butter and like every now and then she'd be buttering something she'd just have someone that on the tip and she just like eat like a chunk of butter and it would be like what do you do and she's like freak out like oh god I've got caught and um and freak us out and then like when I was doing this actually when I moved to Australia and the and the meat was just so much more lean I started like okay well I should probably add butter to this and I was adding butter and I had some more like it was just on the knife and I couldn't sort of scrape it off so it like scraped off of my thumb and I'm like well I'll just eat it he was like it was it was like I was just eating ice cream I'm like oh my God that's the most delicious thing I've ever had in my life and so I just like started eating butter I was talking to my mama like that's me like butter is like so good she's like right it's you know it's delicious and so I started eating butter after that um you know and I just had I just craved I just like cut off a slice of butter and just like be eating it like this is crazy I just started thinking of it as like cheese you know the dairy products it's just like Daddy cheese it is delicious so do I think that do I think it's required that you need to eat a stick of butter uh no not if you're getting enough fat from the meat that you're eating but if you're not getting enough fat for the meat that you're eating you should add in fat and butter is a good option for most people awesome uh we've got clear stuff I have been on and off a strict carnivore diet so still very overweight but into Triathlon for several years lately a lot of troubles with flexibility would staying strict help you with this issue well with with I suppose with the weight and the flexibility he's asking about with the flexibility of um just as Barney or flexibility of dieting and things like that and you're saying but maybe maybe we focus on the weight and the triathlon yeah so I mean you know flexibility of just your body or stretching things like that like I mean I don't know how much that's going to change things it's going to improve your collagen it's going to improve your connective tissue strength and and durability but um you know other than that I you know that that's going to manifest how it is you know with people with Elders downloads and and you know hypermobile joints actually makes them more stable and uh have a number of patients about so I think through three or four patients now for that have ehlers downloads and uh have you know hypermobile joints and get jointless dislocations they go on Carnivore after a couple months they don't have any dislocations their joints will go back to normal which is crazy um that's not something that people would uh would say if it can happen but it happens I've seen it happen you know four for four now and so and Dr Baker's has said that as well that's something that he's seen as well so um you know it's um it's it so it's gonna it's gonna affect your joints in positive ways anyway so you know and then and then the question was about about how is training again remind me yeah okay saying we'll um will standing strip Carnival help with the fat loss and trap on training well it will definitely help out with fat loss and it will definitely help with your training as well um it's um it's uh you know it it's going to be the optimal food for anybody it's definitely going to be an optimal food and way of eating for athletes um you know you know when when I was you know playing High Level Sports I never felt better in my life than when I was doing carnivore I could like literally Sprint marathons I just couldn't get tired I couldn't run out of energy my recovery was just instantaneous and I could just go go go go go and never hit the wall never ran out of energy you never had to you know push through and get Gatorades I just go just go go go go go and um and so you know that's that's that's what you'll typically see and you'll have much better energy levels you'll have much better stamina and your training will be better your performance will be better I generally always would train and perform um and compete on a fasted uh in a fasted state so and on an empty stomach and just drinking water uh if you need to um and yeah you'll just naturally you know being on a cornball diet puts your body into a when you're not eating sweeteners of any kind put your body into a fat mobilizing and utilizing metabolism so you use your fat and your body just uses your fat and so you'll you'll slim down absolutely and you'll be able to work out have a much higher exercise potential as well and so yes it's absolutely the best way to go for for any athlete in particular nice um Joe has asked Carnival and pregnancy question mark oh yeah 100 I mean I mean so so the score of the core principle here which is that that this is our optimal diet this is our optimal biologically appropriate species-specific diet this is the way we've been eating for millions of years and the people who have been able to eat this way achieve Optimal Health and then that absolutely goes for pregnancy it's the most important during pregnancy because that is when that baby is developing and that sets the stage for the rest of its life and development so that's the most important time to to be to optimize your diet and you when people say it's like oh well I'm pregnant so I'll have a bit of chocolate I have a bit of oh I deserve it's okay because I'm pregnant no no it's absolutely not okay because you're pregnant you know and then this is my my opinion and I'm not trying to offend anybody but the way I think about it is that you know when you're eating for yourself and it's just you well then you know big deal do what you want smoke cigarettes drink alcohol if you want to that's only affecting you but when you're pregnant obviously that's affecting your baby and and most people are going to be very very conscious uh of the fact that they want the best for their baby and they want to do the best they can so the best thing that you can do for your baby is is give it the perfect nutrition and eliminate out anything that's that's going to be harmful and this actually helps with with morning sickness you know animals in the wild don't get morning sickness you don't see like zebras going around with fat ankles puking all the during their pregnancy no they're running away from lions like if they're getting sick and twisted like that they're dead you know so so that amount of of on on you know being unwell and unhappy during pregnancy is just not a recipe for survival in the wild and so you know you know I've spoken a number of people that do carnivore uh during pregnancy most of them don't even get morning sickness maybe a bit queasy for a couple weeks and that's it some people get like weird meat aversions um but if they just sort of just don't eat for like a you know fast for like a day or two then uh that seems to go away and then they they're able to like meet you know if you if meat doesn't taste good if you don't like it it's it's not me it doesn't mean that meat's bad for it just means your body's telling you hey you don't need to eat this right now you know and you can you can test this on yourself when you're not pregnant just keep eating meat and uh past the point that you know you really want to if you just keep going you will get to the point where you just you're just not enjoying it you just don't want to eat it and your body's just like what are you doing stop it so you're gonna get that and so I think that that um you know that's something that you can uh for some reason you know some women get that during pregnancy as well and and so you have a bit of an aversion okay so just don't don't you don't have to eat other things you know just just don't eat right then you know you'll be hungry later you know and meat will taste good again um but yes it is absolutely I think it's the most vital and important time uh in anyone's life is when they're in utero and then breastfeeding and uh and developing because you will never get a chance to develop twice you will never get a chance to develop your brain and your body and so you know if you do it perfectly you will be set up for the rest of your life and you will set your child up for the rest of their life and that's I think whatever every you know parent would want for their kid they want the best for their kid and so that I I am firmly of the opinion that that's the most important thing you can do for your kid is uh is is optimize your own nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding and uh their early adolescence and young adulthood and then they get to do what they want but you you've set the stage and you you've given them a pattern of behavior and health and they go outside of that and they go wow that doesn't make me feel good I don't like that and so they're much more likely to to continue on in these habits of good health the the rest of their life 100 yeah makes perfect sense to me uh then these live chat will definitely make you realize joining the accountable Community would help significantly in the journey totally um and we've then we go to safe and I go live every week and do a q a with um with our kind of what our challenge so if anyone's interested in jumping on there and getting support there are conversations like this happening in the telegram which is a private messaging group all the time and then we go live once a week and we all connect and ask questions what else uh there's a question about the color of the whites the odds um from from Sarah uh I I suppose it's it's saying you know is it normal to have nice clear whites of your eyes or or is there a bit of discoloration on on Carnival no no you only get much wider eyes like um so I used to get like horribly red like bludgeoned out of my eyes were just bloodshot all the time and it was really annoying because people was like oh we've been smoking weed like no I haven't you dick you know I couldn't smoke and um it was really annoying but I just figured it was it was like um uh you know I I just figured it was like allergies or something like that you know and so um but you know it's not um it's not and so like when I stopped eating just like the greens so you know when I was doing like you know I was mostly keto just doing like meat and and veggies and then I stopped eating the veggies and like should we started like my eyes weren't red again and so they would just they would just be very white so normally they'd be like just blush they're a little little off today but normally they're just bright white you can see in my videos that most of the time they're white I still get allergies I still get someone else through irritation and things like that um but most of the time my eyes are are have are bright white so I I find the opposite is true I get I get much better uh Clarity of my sclera um now that I'm off the plants us um a friend Carnival Vitality has said my endurance and performance decreased when I added in fruit and honey what do you um so their their endurance and vitality increased no decreased decrease when they added in fruit and honey well there you go yeah but um let's say again sorry uh it stops you from running on fat which is that nice even energy that sort of feels endless yeah and it's also addictive right and um you know so you end up wanting to do that it gives you a quick hit of energy but it's like taking caffeine or cocaine right so you if you feel better in the short run and then you feel pretty awful after that and you have a you know a knock-on effect and a hangover effect you know that's not uh that's not good for you so it's um you know it's not uh you know it's not it's not optimal it's not beneficial it's it's um it's you know it it and like in like you know uh Simon said it you know it's a carbohydrate and it's a sugar and so you're gonna raise your insulin and you're going to pop out of your optimized metabolic State and you're going to stop your body's ability to mobilize your fat glucose glycogen at stores like that so it's uh it's not helping you I did a video uh no we did a video talking about fruit and honey it was just fruit and honey is not carnivore and um so just look that up and you go through that you know that that fruit is not completely benign first of all sugar is a drug and sugar is sugar is sugar it's just you know it's a chemical it gets in your body and it behaves as a chemical there may be other things in that fruit or honey that can be beneficial but it doesn't magically make the sugar not sugar and um you know and and even different fruits can be toxic and poisonous most berries for instance which are fruit are poisonous they'll kill you right and so you have to know which Berry seed you don't just eat any random ass Berry when you're in the woods um and so you know other fruits as well you know the cassowary bird eats 150 different tropical fruits every single one will kill you right because the plant wants that bird to eat the fruit it does not want to eat anything else to eat it because a lot of these birds have co-evolved with these berries in these fruits and so those seeds actually have to go pass through the digestion of uh that specific animal usually a bird in order to germinate and so if it doesn't go like so those fruits with category bird if it doesn't go through a cassowary Bird's digestion it will not turn into a plant and so it is in it in that plant's best interest to not let anything else eat that fruit so it wants something to eat the fruit it does not necessarily want you to eat the fruit and we did not evolve uh we did not co-evolve with these fruits Birds did so there's some translation you know because you know we're animals and so you know maybe you know the ones that are sweet especially those don't seem to be as toxic but there are some you know I mean like citrus all citrus uh have furana coumarins which are toxic and you have to detoxify them are they toxic enough to kill you like you know probably not in the levels that we eat citrus but it does disrupt your body you do have to detoxify them this is why you can't take certain medications with grapefruit because the parano coumarines in grapefruit use the same enzymes to detoxify them as you know or those enzymes and the detoxifyronic coumarines are also the ones that metabolize certain drugs and so now you're going to get um you know a an off dose of those drugs you're not going to get too much or too little right which is not which is not safe you know and so that's um you know so so it's not completely benign just because it's a fruit most fruit are still toxic and the ones that aren't as toxic you know they're still not optimal and the sugar will always mess you up you know and well in enough amounts yeah [Music] could you talk a little about the best way for those with type 2 diabetes who are currently on multiple types of meds and want to transition to proper nutrition and specifically the best way to stop taking meds uh is with your doctor it has to be with your doctor um people going on a carnivore diet or even a ketogenic diet um which you cannot even fruit and honey then carnivore is um then you need to um then you need to you know sort of be mindful that your you know your demand for these medications are going to go down you know you're you're very simply not taking in a whole bunch of carbohydrates you don't need as much medications to drop your carbohydrates you're going to be making carbohydrates and so yes you're still not having some resistance you're still going to have um issues with the utilization of those the you know that that blood sugar so youth levels can still be a bit high but they're going to be much much more controllable um you know with uh with a ketogenic or carnivore diet so you need to be mindful of that you need to check your blood sugar you know two three times a day and uh and then you know you're you're going to notice that your blood sugar starts going down down down down down down maybe you feel a bit tired or whatever um and so you'll need to talk to your doctor about okay what can I come off what should I ratchet down I'm doing this new diet and then my blood sugars are improving and they're getting better and so what do I do so that needs to be under doctor supervision uh but yes you can absolutely expect to need to lower your medications in a stepwise progression with the help of of your physician and for other things as well like blood pressure uh blood pressure issues uh typically resolve uh in a couple months as well and so you'll find that maybe you're now you're getting your blood pressure is just too low and now you're you're getting really tired and you stand up too quickly and you'll you'll you pass out sometimes you know it's um that happens so being mindful of that and careful because you know you don't want to get into a situation that you know your blood sugar is dropping too low well you know if you're in ketosis you'll be fine but um and type 2 diabetes is very difficult to get like a hypo uh episode new unless you're taking like insulin taking too much insulin and then uh um but blood pressure as well like you can your blood pressure can get too low you can get very lightheaded and uh and and that's a Falls risk so just be mindful of that and be careful and if you you know uh you know if you're if you're taking your blood pressure and your blood pressure is normal you know do you really need to take your blood pressure medication you know in the hospital we we withhold that you know we say hey this guy's got normal he's normally taking you know this blood pressure medication uh but his blood pressure is normal should we still give it you know and then the doctor makes a decision like you know yes we still need to give it for you know XYZ reasons or know we can withhold that and so you know again talk to your doctor about what you should you specifically should do in those situations and uh and just get a game plan and uh and then action it but it will get better and most people can come off the medications even even people long-term type 2 diabetics who are insulin dependent long term a lot of them are coming off their insulin not everyone can come off all the way but you can at least come down to like a minimal dose and not have to take a whole bunch of like fast acting uh insulin things like that you just take your background insulin you know like Atlantis or a similar long-acting insulin and that just covers you for the whole day you know and uh and type 1 diabetics end up doing the same sort of thing they just need that just that background dose and then they and then they're good and so it and it uh it makes sense so your blood sugar is much much much more uh controllable and your HBO won't stable drop dramatically from whatever it is now Austin yeah Kathy said got my mom off all diabetes meds including insulin we're testing her glucose often and cut the meds as we went her doctor was amazed it was quite easy and happened quickly um after 40 Years of type 2 diabetes so yeah yeah it's amazing you know when my mom yeah when my mom reversed her type 2 diabetes she'd been diabetic for I don't know 25 years plus you know and then uh for 10 15 years before that she would have been you know had had any you know insulin resistance and um you know raised fasting insulin levels and things like that you know so she would have she would have been having these issues for you know decades and decades and decades uh in two months she came off all of her oral medications and reduced her insulin down to a minimal dose awesome in two months after hba1c which is a marker of your you know which is a marker your blood sugar control over over the course over the past three months uh or so you know carnivores or blood cells are gonna does it live longer and so it actually you know uh it's probably indicative of the last four months you know so you know it may be slightly higher for uh carnivores just because you know your blood cells are lasting longer they're living longer so they're being exposed to blood sugar longer but either way a for hba1c went from 8.9 which is very high down to 6.1 which is sort of the you know just just past the upper limit of normal some sort of pre-diabetic levels so she went from very diabetic to pre-diabetic on no medications you know that's pretty crazy two months yeah right two months yeah so it just it goes very quickly and uh and and uh has a huge huge impact and that's and that that's not anecdotal at all some of this stuff we just have to say well this is what I'm seeing I'm seeing a lot more of this and more and more of this so you know that's what I'm going to go with but we actually have large randomized clinical control trials showing that a ketogenic dot reverses Diabetes Type 2 diabetes I can significantly control type 1 diabetes this is not new information we've been using a ketogenic diet since like the late 1800s to control diabetes and increase um uh survival in type 1 diabetes because we had no treatments for them we didn't have insulin we had to figure out how to extract insulin from corpses you know we had cadavers we sort of were extracting insulin and things like that and um you know so that is um that is something that they figured out that you could you could do you could fast and you could go on a ketogenic diet and then you you'd prolong survival of type 1 diabetics and you could control type 2 diabetes with that we've been doing that for for literally over 100 years so this is not new it's just we've just pasted over all of this with this whole cholesterol is bad meat is bad just throw out the last you know 200 years of medical science and literature so you know I'm gonna say it's just like you know that carnivores knew that this is these are not new Concepts this is not new ideas we've been eating meat for millions of years that's the established that's the established fact you know the new idea is eating a whole bunch of vegetables fruits and vegetables that's new that's never been done before that's very recent right so they've got to prove that that's better in comparison to a meat-based diet which is what we evolved on which is what we've been living on and are designed to be on they don't have those studies they say oh it's so much better when you increase fruits and vegetables you know these different Health markers improve only when compared to a standard processed food diet only because that's the only thing I've ever compared it to and they say oh well when you when you when you have these things they're all surveys you know like these guys talk about like oh well if you don't have a randomized controlled trial then it's not worth hearing all you have are surveys that's all they have they're just these these nutritional surveys that they just ask people how much of different things they eat and they sort of look at their health issues or ask them what their health issues are you know I mean it's it's really poor poor studies and poor low quality data and yet they're demanding rcts from everyone else like no no no no that's not how that works you don't get to you don't get to control and dictate you know where the evidence comes from if it's evidence it's evidence it needs to be considered as such and you know when you're not putting out rcts and you're not comparing like for like then like you have no room to talk right so you know when they're doing these things they do these surveys they're com they're not comparing like to like they're comparing uh just you know eating more Whole Foods as compared to eating a bunch of processed crap both plant-based 70 of the American Australian diet is plant-based it's just processed carbs and sugar all from Plants right and then you go to Whole Foods plants and it's still like 70 plant-based okay it's still plant-based so this idea of plant-based is idiotic right because the most plants on Earth are inedible right they'll make you very sick or even kill you right so it's not just oh just eat any plants plants or plants or plant this is stupid this is juvenile you know and anyone who makes these arguments clearly is either just has not thought about it too dumb to know what's going on or is trying to trick you on something it's trying to fool you on on some way or another but this is just these are just very basic principles that you need to understand you can say all plants any fruits and vegetables that's insane you know so and also like none of these studies compare like for like none of these studies are actually comparing uh a whole food plant-based diet with a whole food meat-based diet there was one that did that I've spoken about this a couple times recently with um uh the Maasai and the akikuyu tribes in Africa back in 1931 it was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and they had and it was it was a perfect study because these two populations were lived right next to each other so they intermarried and interbred so they're genetically similar and the Maasai just you know class you know is famously carnivore just eating blood milk and meat and then nakikuyu had uh sort of been displaced off their lands and things like that so they were just eating plant-based diet so they were just going like you know roots and tubers and leaves and all these and Grains and things like that so they were just eating a whole food plant-based diet that they grew the 1920s and 30s right there's no no widest you know large-scale you know industrial crop farming and pesticides and and fertilizer runoff and all that sort of stuff this is just this is like a vegan's dream they're just living on a commune and just living on plants and things like that mostly plant-based they've had a little bit of other things but mostly plant-based and what were the difference so again genetically similar populations at the same time right and the Maasai the adult male Messiah were on average five inches taller 24 pounds heavier lean body mass and uh 50 stronger they had much less disease they had much less illness they didn't get infections as much they didn't get diabetes they didn't get lung chest infections ulcers uh they had good teeth they didn't have you know cavities and Carries um the akikuyu had you know crunched crowded teeth rotting teeth bone deformities deformities stunted growth and they would get sick a lot easier and they found they had you know anemia and a ton of different vitamin and mineral deficiencies and they found that even if they supplemented them with uh with these nutrient deficiencies they didn't actually improve their health outcomes so so if you can say oh you can get everything that you need just from plants and taking supplements not true that's not true and because there were other things in Plants first of all there's a lot of nutrients that maybe we don't know about that we can't we don't supplement yet but also there are things in plants that just are bad for you because we are not designed to eat these things and so and even if even if we were an animal that were designed to eat plants we would be designing a specific plant or specific plants not just thousands of different plants that's ridiculous no animal on earth does that they eat extraordinarily specifically they if they're going to eat plants they eat very specific plants they cannot eat a whole bunch of different plants um you know even a goat a goat can eat like a whole bunch of different things but there are things that will kill a goat right and so you know there's so you have to be very specific in what you're eating um and so that kikuyu just supplementing them wasn't enough but when they started feeding them meat and replacing the you know the the plants and things like that that they ate with just like meat they did get better their health improved they stopped they you know they cleared up these infections they clear they healed these ulcers and uh and everything and prove it couldn't develop again that's why it's so important with uh you know pregnancy and um and you know breastfeeding and things like that that that's when this child will get to develop that's when his teeth and his bones and his brain are going to develop and through his adolescence so that never happens again but as adults they were able to heal and get as healthy as they could uh at the time you know for for what they developed into but they could never develop again so but they were able to improve their health outcomes that's the only study that exists that compares what we are talking about which is a whole food plant-based diet with a whole food meat-based diet and another and it shows clear disparities and now we're seeing more and more and more vegans and vegetarians trying to a carnivore diet and massively improving their health I had a gentleman on my my podcast who was vegan for 21 years the only reason he survived was he always taking supplements and every now and then he'd have some fish you know I was like literally the only thing keeping this guy alive and he was a typical angry vegan and he like wouldn't allow people to come in his house if they had meat and uh and he's just like oh absolutely not oh that stuff's poison get that [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of here and uh and then he's sort of just having just worse and worse and worse health and he was just like okay all right I maybe maybe something's going wrong here he started eating meat and just just everything changed and it just dramatically changed his life and so you know it's it's you know we are seeing that and oh well they didn't do it right okay well what is right you know because there are a lot of these people that are like these vegan influencers they're saying this is how you do it this is how you do it this is right this is a great way and they do it that way and then they go off and get guys this is not the way this is this is a bad way this is this is horrible oh they just weren't doing it right they were the guys you were following to do it right you know so don't give me that and um you know so you know also just like there aren't even basic nutrients in in Plants you know of the ones that are bioavailable which most of them aren't you can't even get these things that's how we know we're not designed to eat these things because the nutrients are sequestered and bound in such chemical bonds that we can't break and we can't access because we're not designed to eat them because the plant tries to you know hide these nutrients and tricky bonds so that animals can't access them some are designed to access them we are not so we get some of these things from some of these plants but they're not very bioavailable and also even if they were 100 bioavailable and they didn't have any toxins which is not the case then you still cannot get even a basic complement of essential nutrients you're never going to get B12 D3 or K2 they don't exist in Plants you'll never get enough vitamin A because you'd have to eat six pounds of carrots a day to get enough vitamin A every day you'll never get all the essential fatty acids like DHA EPA they we do not get those from any plant they cannot come from plants they only come from meat we don't really make them very well ourselves and there's other essential fatty acids that we don't make at all cholesterol is is an essential nutrient we make it but we don't make enough of it we make about 70 of our actual demand so you actually need to get this from your diet as well um all the different proteins it's not enough to just get a complete protein you can get a complete protein from different plant stores you've got to be very careful about it you have to you know you have to know what you're doing but you can get and when they need it by a complete protein is just the different amino acids that that we require but in fact you know some people require more carnitine than others there's a type of autism that develops when people don't have enough carnitine which only comes from me this karna team carnivore Latin for body it comes from bodies it does not come from plants and so you know when when people don't quite make enough carnitine carnitine is is uh vital for the normal functioning of your mitochondria and and your your neuronal development and so if you don't have enough carnitine your mitochondrion and your brain don't develop properly and you can develop you know you can have a developmental uh abnormality such as autism and so this is where we're seeing a higher rates of autism and vegan the vegetarians as well um probably for other reasons as well but specifically the ones that don't have the ability to make enough carnitine they're getting this and so you know so that's that's you can't get carnitine from Plants but let's say all the other ones that are available they're not really bioavailable either they come with protease Inhibitors from different plants that make it difficult for you to to extract even the the Protein that's bioavailable and you know because the plant is trying to stop you from profiting from eating its body you know it doesn't want that and so but even if you did that you don't need just these different proteins and it doesn't matter the order you need them in specific ratios an egg is a perfect protein because it has exactly the amino acids we need in the exact right proportion why is that because that yolk is going to turn into a body it needs everything in exact numbers an exact ratios because that is going to turn into a living being right so it needs all the the the essential nutrients for a living being and so they say oh there's all this cholesterol and saturated fat oh my God and that causes cancer causes heart disease as like then why is it that it turns into a chicken and not a answer you know or a bunch of atherosclerosis you know those are the building blocks for Life yours and theirs okay that's what makes the animal kingdom go around it makes no sense no biological sense and people saying that like although it's much much easier for you to turn in you know plant proteins internal protein says who you know you're turning plant material different Kingdom of life into animal material that's much more difficult than turning animal tissue into animal tissue you're not turning it into anything you're using all of the nutrients and just and just using them they're already there available for you right whereas turning plant tissue into human into animal tissue that actually is is more difficult and we're not very uh well adapted and designed to do that so it's harder so you know people going around saying that like not only it can you get away with it because um you know even if you're lacking nutrients you can just supplement um that's one thing that's one argument it's wrong but you know at least you can you can honestly make that argument now they're saying No No No in fact that's even better it's optimal you know and so it's not even ethical issues this is this is just you know biological nutritional issues we evolved as herbivores like no one who outside of an insanist no like paleoanthropologist outside of an insane asylum would ever suggest that you know there's no evidence there's zero evidence for that you know anything that people suggest is complete fabrication all the best evidence shows we've been eating meat nearly exclusively for at least two million years plus you know and before we were eating meat nearly exclusively we were almost eating meat in near exclusion you know that's how that works it's a slow gradual process right and so you're just building up building up building up so a bit of a bit of a tirade there but you know it's just it it makes no sense to me how people are making these arguments and um and and using these these soft epidemiological studies to try and prove things when you have hard Sciences like botany biology physiology Anatomy um and uh and and paleont apology and and Archeology and things like that that the show very clearly the exact opposite of what these these people are saying no it's uh yeah it's amazing what people come up with um all right guys we're gonna wrap there Dr Chasey thank you so much that was awesome if um if you're tuning in and you enjoyed this uh check out our carnivore challenge Dr chafe you guys live once a week uh and it's a small intimate private group that's you know there's generally far less people than are on on right now and you do get an opportunity to speak with Dr chafee and chat with everybody uh in a private messaging group as well so thanks man I really appreciate your time and thank you to everybody who has tuned in today yeah no problem and yeah and thanks everyone for watching hopefully that was was helpful next time and said you know we do try to you know to give more support to people that that need a bit more Hands-On with the idea you know of getting you know you know out of the nest and flying on your own um and so you know hopefully uh people can just sort of do that I do try to make all my resources available for free on YouTube and my podcasts and and so uh but if you need a bit more support or Community um you know we have that available for people and so you know if that's something you're interested in you're checking out how to carnivore.com and um yeah and we have like you said the weekly Zoom meetings where we all get to talk and get to sort of flesh out your problems and talk about hey this is where I'm I'm getting hung up and and we sort of troubleshoot it and we figure it out and uh and you know we are able to figure these things out so that's that that can be very good and helpful and then the telegram group you know again you're with a lot of people um some they're very experienced with this and have gone through a lot of um you know trip ups and pitfall calls and so you know it's not just myself and Simon that can help it's everyone that can help as well and so it's a very good uh Community uh sort of experience and so for people that that need that or think that would help them then you know come check it out and see what you think um absolutely all right we're off thanks everybody thanks"
