        "body": "be the best way to go okay uh thank you Damian for the be the best way to go okay uh thank you Damian for the Super Chat greetings I read some research online indicating that the oils and canned fish products are oxidized those in uh in water more so than those pack and oil can canned fish uh really just or canned fish really just canned poison so I I don't know about the ones in canned fish I I have only heard about the fish oil uh supplements so you know just little pills of fish oils and that's and that's because when you're extracted out of the the animal or you get you get you know the oils out of the plant they you know they can they can oxidize they're the you know the the unsaturated fat so the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated they have a double bond the un mon unsaturated have one double bond the polyunsaturated have multiple double bonds down the chain and so those double bonds are are point of attack and oxidation so they can you know you know other molecules want that energy so they they pop that Bond and and bind to them right so they'll oxidize them and they'll turn them into harmful actors potentially so the the Omega 3s are also unsaturated they're mono unsaturated fats very long chain monounsaturated fats like the ha and EPA like 2022 chain fatty acids with that one double bond and that and that can oxidize and that can that can degrade so if you extract that out of the out of the fish and you put that into a tablet you know there you see different reports but at one point I I saw you know I read somewhere that they were saying it was like as much as 70% of them of the fish oil supplements were already oxidized IED and nasty uh by the time you know they hit the shelves now how long does one of those bottles last quite a long time right you know if it's like 200 pills in there you're taking one a day you know that's most of the year or much of the year and you know the odds of that being you know unoxidized that whole way through if it's if it's oxidized by the time it hits the Shelf if a lot of these things are oxidized by the time they hit the Shelf the ones that aren't oxidized by the time they hit the Shelf are almost certainly oxidized in a month or two after after you get it back home so you know it's probably not best to do that but I didn't I didn't I hadn't heard that about about canned fish um maybe I I hadn't heard that though one way or the other so I'm not sure but you know if you if you do get it packed in oil I'd be I'd be very careful about that um because it's often like sunflower oil and and other other nasty seed oils which are definitely oxidizing and not being great so yeah I I would be curious about that I'm not I'm not sure I mean like would it be you know I mean canned fish they can sit there for a long time you know so maybe the oils can go rancid but um unfortunately I don't know I don't know on that one I haven't really seen much on that I would be surprised though like normally when the oils are still in in the the meat of the animal it's it's pretty good because it's it's sort of Trapped in the in the cell and just it's not really being Expos it's not being exposed to air it's not oxidizing but usually it's not you know getting to a point where it can degrade so I would be I would be surprised by that but unfortunately I don't I don't kn ow 100% free camping in in a van man uh thanks for the"

        "body": "ow 100% free camping in in a van man uh thanks for the ow 100% free camping in in a van man uh thanks for the super chat um I eat one pound of ground beef one riy steak and 4 ounces of butter every day is that enough fat and protein for 150 PB mail well it Poss Poss it depends on where you're coming from it depends on if you're at in a nutritional deficit going into this you know people that that haven't been eating very well and their body needs a lot need a lot more nutrients can need a lot more food the thing is is that you I don't think that people need to just go out and you know eat a certain amount of fat or as much fat as they want or whatever or or whatever it's um you just need to get enough fat and you need to get enough protein for your body and and that's going to differ for for different people I do think that physiologically you know we have a limited capacity to absorb fat based on the amount of bile that we have and so it's you you can you can try to give your body as much fat as it wants and then you you check that by your stools and if you're getting dry hard constipated stools then that means you're not eating enough fat and then you should you should increase that and if you're getting diarrhea you can just pull it back but the thing is you're only going to absorb a certain amount so the idea that say like well you can eat too much fat I don't I don't really see that I don't see that making sense physiologically because we we just don't absorb it past a certain point and bile is an expensive resource that your body makes and you know it doesn't make sense it just just waste resources like that to make a random amount of bile that does that for nothing else it doesn't make random amounts of stomach acids make random amounts of of other molecules and things like that throughout the rest of your body doesn't make a random amount of insulin doesn't make a random amount of you know pepsin it doesn't make a random amount of of you know um you know amas and lipase and you know all these sorts of things they make your body makes very does this in a very controlled manner because it's trying to get a specific job done in exact to exacting degrees and and it is extremely exacting and careful otherwise you know if it's just random and just wasting wasting resources you know you're not you're not going to survive like that species is going to die out and so you know we're still here and so we you know we should see we should see uh very exacting amounts of of products being made like bile so it could very well be that that's enough for you but uh you don't need to guess you know you just just eat until your body tells you to stop you know if you're eating what your body biologically naturally designed to eat eat you know you should be able to listen to your hunger signals I mean people people can detract and say whatever they want about you know our natural way of eating oh just because we've been eating that way for two million years doesn't mean that it's a good way to eat I'm like okay well that's dumb first of all second of all you know this is you know when you tell people just eat naturally and just eat what sounds you know what what tastes good to them and they do that by the millions and it gets exactly the right results and they you know get taken exactly the amount of nutrients that their body needs to maintain a healthy lean body mass and improve their health I mean that that's a proof of concept there I mean literally millions of people doing this and doing it in that way eating intuitively and it just works and you all these other people are saying well you have to do this exact thing and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and it doesn't work for for the vast majority of people um you know what what are we what are we denying here I mean just you're literally just denying the reality in front of your face so I think that I think that you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you uh listen to your body you don't force feed yourself you never you never eat when it's not nice to eat you know I've seen people say online that I've said uh that like on rdit or something I think it was just a troll it was just sort of making this stuff up in order to screenshot it and then go oh my god look what Dr Javy said which was which was oh yeah you know I I saw somewhere that Dr J said you should eat until you want to puke and like all that sort of stuff and and then they screenshotted that and put it out somewhere and said that like oh yeah look at this look how all this crazy stuff that they're putting out and uh I've never said that i' I've literally never said that I've I've always said specifically don't eat if your body's telling you not to if it's if it doesn't taste good and your body's rebelling and saying stop you should stop you should have stopped so just keep eating fatty meat when it tastes good it should always taste good it should always be enjoyable and so you just keep eating as it's enjoyable and you stop when it stops being enjoyable you take a bite and just go it wasn't that interesting I don't really don't really feel like taking another bite then you stop that's when you stop and if you do that and you're getting enough food and you're getting enough fat your body will take care of the rest so it could very well be that that's enough that's looks like a decent amount but it depends if your body is is not happy if your body thinks you're underweight if you're working out and your body wants to put on muscle lean muscle mass then then it might not be enough um so I would just go and listen to your body and see how you're doing hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own questions please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest

        "body": "rest of the Q&A uh Colton Schmucker thank you for the rest of the Q&A uh Colton Schmucker thank you for the Super Chat I have stopped drinking after being a heavy drinker for a while really good job that's awesome my liver kidneys heart are a little damaged fatty liver will carnivore help to heal yeah it absolutely can I mean and the main thing that's going to help your body heal is is is getting off the alcohol which you've already done you know so that that's fantastic uh you know that's really you know that's really a great job you know getting off that that can be very hard to do and you know especially when you get to the point where you're you're damaging your body that's obviously very difficult to do so really well done there um really just avoiding these harmful things is is what's going to help and and the reason that that I one of the main reasons I think that carnivore helps people is is that you are you're eliminating out all these other things that that can cause harm and you're just giving your body what it needs and what it's biologically designed to have and that's what it comes down to you know we're supposed to you know animals eat what they're designed to eat in the wild and that's when they do best and when they don't do that they don't do as well and so if we do that we'll do best fatty liver is absolutely caused by alcohol it can also be caused by sugar fructose specifically has been shown and in studies in humans that have met the Bradford Hill criteria for um for causation to cause fatty liver and you remove fructose you remove alcohol and this can this can remove the causitive factors of fatty liver and your and your liver can heal your liver your liver can heal up into the point of curosis which is scarring of the of the liver once that starts to happen now those parts of curosis the cerotic parts of the liver those aren't going to come back but any any stage up until that it can come back and the whole thing doesn't go cerotic it's not just one big blump of Scar it's just pieces of scar tissue start building up and building up and you get less and less liver function but if you um are at the fatty liver stage you you still have time to reverse that and it can and a lot of people do and so you just you just eat as cleanly as possible and you know just eat meat as your as your body tells you to exercise especially Anor robic exercise so weightlifting sprinting those are the best things for you and and those can those can also help um improve your health metabolically fatty liver disease can be a sign of metabolic dysfunction elsewhere it is and um this can go along with fatty deposits around your heart in the abdomen visceral fat um pancreatic fat um f in your muscles called myosteatosis which is really just marbling in humans right it's it's the same principle you know we give a bunch of you know grains and sugar and alcohol to beef to to fatten them up and get all that marbling like wagu and I think what is it coob be sometimes I'll give them like beer Saki and things like that and this helps with that marbling and and depositing fat where it's not supposed to be we get that too we get human marbling eating the same things and we see you people I I've seen you know people uh like Lane Norton was just oh my God what what the hell is this about this is something we see in clinical practice all the time I don't I don't know if Lane looks at um you know MRIs regular I don't know why he would you know he he's he doesn't work in that sort of area but I look at Mr all the time and we see fatty deposition in the muscle tissue and that's called myosteatosis there's a name for it so that's that's something that's there and and that's what it's from it's just human marbling that's something that Dr shaara talks about a lot as well and um and so you know and he's found I mean he is he is the you know visceral fat expert the pathological deposition of fat expert like Mones atosis and that's what he found in in in his uh studies and research and he's done large studies with thousands and thousands and thousands of people doing MRIs and things like that studying this and he found that that the best diet for reversing this pathological fat deposition is a carnivore diet and the best exercise was high-intensity Anor robic training sprinting weightlifting to failure and so that's what I would do and I think that uh you're well on the right track and I I'm I'm confident that you'll continue to improve your health so keep going with that and uh and avoid the sugar as well so yeah so carnivore is great for this because you avoid all the things that are going to contribute to this problem and you just let your body heal and it absol utely can blessed San family thank you so much for the"

        "body": "utely can blessed San family thank you so much for the utely can blessed San family thank you so much for the super chat um question my doctor is alarmed uh by my Apple level of 177 please any advice I'm carnivore only eat only beef eggs and trying to stop two cups of coffee daily I do not want statins well statins first of all stop your body from making large buoyant LDL molecules which is uh the LDL that you want um and so there are over 100 different particulate sizes of LDL the large buoyant ones are generally recognized as as you know the ones you want that's why your body makes them they can get damaged and glycated and have problems and things like that and potentially being issue down the line but that's from glycation that's from oxidation that's from doing things to them and the statins don't don't stop that they just sort of interrupt your body making the large buoyant LDL so that's first of all second of all apple b is is a is a well it's not it's a non-specific marker because there are other other appoes in your in your body that aren't necessarily like a problem they're actually you know still attached to your your LDL and they're just they're just there so you actually can't differentiate what sort of Apple be that you're talking about and so you know that's that's not as clear a marker as people may think um there are others that go into a lot of depth about this which is why I've never really felt the need to myself which is like um Dr Paul Mason has a great little five minute clip it's on on YouTube where it's talking about Apple so someone might be able to link that in the chat it's just Dr Paul Mason talking about you know apob and talking about this how this is actually a very non-specific test it doesn't really give you all that much information so if people want to know more about that I would I would take a look at that and um and you know there's there's a lot of reasons that these things can change and they're not necessarily negative and so you can look into them further and you know see how you're doing otherwise you know it is funny you know people reverse their diabetes reverse their um their uh metabolic syndrome which are all very high risk factors for developing heart disease you know diabetes is like a tenfold increased risk of developing heart disease which is up there with smoking metabolic syndrome is about sixfold increased risk and then the small dense LDL particulate pattern you know which is the small dense damaged LDL molecules which statins don't help reduce um that is a a 1.7 fold increased risk for heart disease so if you're doing something that reverses diabetes reverses metabolic syndrome you're reducing a massive massive risk factors for heart disease the same things that reverse those actually lower your sdldl as well and give you more of the large buyant LDL which really aren't a good marker for heart disease at all and so you know it really does matter you know the the rest of this the rest of the story The Devil is in the details and you know if you get you get focused on just you very myopic on just one marker you miss the force for the trees and so it it is funny that that you have people go to their doctor and they improve in so many other ways and then they'll have have one mark that says well that's a little off shut it down okay go back to the other thing where you had you know all these other problems and your health was was a mess and that you felt like garbage and your and your your metabolic Health was going in the tank you know I mean that it doesn't it doesn't quite follow you know that that that um that doing something that improves your health so dramatically in so many ways increase improves your um risk profile in so many ways is inherently dangerous and bad for you and it's going to kill you do doesn't really make sense does it you I mean you're improving your health you're getting better objectively and all of these different markers and they're saying nobody's going to kill you okay maybe but it's a bit it's a bit odd that that would be the case that something's making you extraordinarily healthy in all these ways and directly reducing your risk factor for heart disease is at the same time increasing your risk for for heart disease it's like it is it though you know and and that's the problem like we've we've been you know fed a story and fed a line that we know is not true and yet there's just it's just still Clinging On for life and I just I think that you have to re-evaluate the situation you have to look at things from a more holistic point of view and look at all of your different risk factors and markers and you see like wow all of these things are improving okay well this is this one and you know maybe that's that's a risk factor but all these other risk factors have been reduced dramatically so on the aggregate where are we here so for me I don't um I don't get too concerned about that I don't look at my own cholesterol as as an indicator for my relative risk of heart disease apart from my HDL and triglyceride levels um that's what that's what I look at for myself and my HDL is very high my triglycerides are very low and that means I have pattern a LDL and things are good that means I have the large buoyant ones I don't have the small dense ones I don't have metabolic syndrome I don't have diabetes so I would consider myself extraordinarily low risk for heart disease I mean heart disease is is a very recent addition to our our lexicon you know like the first heart attack first myocardial infarction diagnosed on autopsy in America was in 1912 people say oh well we just didn't notice before then you people don't study history and you don't know the first thing about medicine because people were everyone was doing autopsies you're do autopsies autopsies dissections dissections dissections dissections everyone all the time and so if you describe something new that no one had seen before you get your name in the books this is Alzheimer's disease that's named after Dr Alzheimer's who first first described that disease pattern in the early 1900s I think 1902 there was nothing that existed before that by any different name that that was Alzheimer's dementia right he was the first person to notice that going like hey this is weird this is different let's write about it and he wrote it up and he published it and he got his name in the history books everyone wanted to do that right so you think that people just seeing these just big blockages and dead hearts and things like that they're just just just didn't notice it you're out of your damn mind you know it's just like all the Einstein all the all the um you know Newton's and and Leonardo da Vinci and things like that they were all just morons that just just couldn't see what's in front of them it's not until you know 1986 that people started you know being able to pay attention like you're out of your damn mind um so that was the first time and people didn't even believe them because you're like we've never seen that we've never seen you know this this these blockages in the coronary arteries and then dead muscle tissue like we don't know if we believe you 10 years later it was more common and so they're like okay yeah all right that was probably true 10 years after that so 20 years after the first myocardial infarction it's now the number one killer in America all right that happened at a time when we're eating the least amount of meat in 200 years right there's none of this in 1800s when we were eating far more meat than we were in the 1910s 20s and 30s that was a trough it's sort of a U-shaped curve and so we started eating more meat after that but it was already the number one killer while meat was the you know was at the lowest the lowest point so it just doesn't make sense to me it doesn't follow it's literally not even Associated there's no association between meat consumption and saturated fat consumption and and heart disease there just isn't and the Journal of America American College of Cardiology published a massive paper in 2020 looking at all the randomized control trials and metaanalyses and all the top data and and evidence on saturated fat and its relationship to heart disease and they found no associ ation between saturated fat intake and cardiovascular disease but they did find an inverse association between saturated fat intake and stroke so the more saturated fat the less likely you were to have a stroke the less saturated fat the higher your risk of stroke and that was from the best available evidence and that was from authors that did not have uh you know a narrative to to push you know they were actually authors on major papers condemning saturated fat and cholesterol previously and now this is sort of them saying like o actually we got that one wrong sorry guys this is this is actually a better way to look at it so a bit more involved maybe of a question but it's you know it's an important one to address and so I would I would definitely you know keep all that in mind and look at at Dr Paul Mason's uh video on Apple online and um and just look at look at what the evidence actually shows hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys any comment on people with human chromatosis on a cornivore diet yeah this is this is one that that comes up it's um I've only sort of spoken to a few people with hemocromatosis and it's and it's been when they were getting ready to try it or maybe worried about trying it um I have seen people with high levels of uh iron and fertin things like that who didn't necessarily have hemocromatosis or they they tested negative for it um uh and they and their levels came down because it's more about iron metabolism and the and the utilization of iron than just like you're getting too much iron in your body I mean you know people with hemocromatosis they get the same amount of iron or less than other people and it just builds up because there's some sort of metabolic issue so you know I would suspect that you know when you when you actually start working normally your body starts working I mean we didn't have Dina puncture you know going back you know thousands of years millions of years and so people that had that if they were just going to die from from Iron overload they would die pretty early they wouldn't be able to breed and so we probably wouldn't see it in in the genetic population but we do and so does that mean that means that that somehow they had to survive and so if you were potentially um you know eating a more appropriate diet then potentially your your metabolism of iron would be better and I certainly have seen that in in patients that I've had and I've been able to test their labs and I've seen literally just had one Tuesday that had that and the normally had very high uh you know fertin iron iron levels were always elevated and so they just gave blood regularly but they got tested they tested negative for hemocromatosis but still is the effect was the same that they still had sort of iron overload and they had to give give donate blood for that and they didn't test they they went carnivore and so they didn't they didn't give blood and they you know didn't test for like five months and came right down all on its own so I think it's it's more of a metabolism thing now I'm you know people you know doing hemocromatosis and things like that and talking about it you know that's still anecdotal but it is good information and so you know you at least get an idea of what's what's going on for other people and I know that uh you know Dr Baker Dr sha baker has with brao health I mean they've got they've got a database with you know well over 12,000 people in it so they've got they've got a lot of good data points there and and he said that he has seen people with chromatosis improve and so it actually doesn't get worse I think that is something about you know the metabolism going on there as opposed to uh just just too much iron right um or you know too much iron in their diet worst case scenario they still just give blood you know it doesn't really change too much and improves your improves your health in many other ways but there are people reporting that it gets better and I've seen that personally with with some of my patients as well but albeit they they didn't have hemoc they didn't have diagnosed hemocromatosis uh themselves just too high iron and which amounted to the same thing so I think either way it's it's well worth the effort it could very well improve the situation worst case scenario they still give blood and their life improves in a thousand other ways so uh still still worth giving it a go shot gunet thank you very much for the"

        "body": "I mispronounced that I'm sure I did thank you for the I mispronounced that I'm sure I did thank you for the Super Chat can you explain why fiber is not required in diet while on Carnivore uh yeah well it's just not required in general it's not you know they call it an essential nutrient oh my God how are you going to get fiber and and there's people like Professor Gardner at at Stanford that um says that it's it would be unethical to do a controlled trial with you know vegans and and carnivores because I mean you can't even get um you know uh nutrients like fiber like where are you going to get your fiber it's like why do you need fiber you know like what 70% of animals are carnivores they don't they don't get any fiber and the ones that do eat fiber or the the herbivores that do eat fiber they break down fiber we don't break down fiber what what herbivore that eats fiber doesn't break down fiber like I don't I don't I don't know if there really are any um but if there are it's it's the minority and so that doesn't really follow that it would be considered an essential nutrient I mean that's that's you know that's just somebody decided to put that on there that doesn't mean it's true um but fiber isn't even a nutrient so how can it be an essential one right and if it were essential nutrient I'd be long dead the enu wouldn't wouldn't exist uh the nette wouldn't exist the msai wouldn't exist um because traditionally those populations didn't need fiber they didn't need plants you know the Messiah have now Incorporated more grains and cocacola and other sorts of garbage in their diet but even as far back to the 1920s they had already started incorporating like Millet seed uh before that they did not but even in the 1920s and 30s they were extraordinarily healthy as compared to dyu who were largely plant-based and ate a lot of grains and things like that a lot of fiber and they were much less healthy daki cuyu were and so you know as the decades go on and the Messi start incorporating more and more garbage plants in their diet and certainly processed food their health suffered and their health started to decline but traditionally no they did not have that in their diet and they did not have those Health ramifications you know that was that was an advent of incorporating these plant foods and fiber and processed foods generally doesn't have fiber in their diet stud's looking at you know the benefits of fiber compare it to the standard American diet so you're like oh you're eating more fibrous plants well that's healthy user bias you're you're more in tune with or you're more you know uh receptive to to things that might be bad for you and so you try to mitigate those you exercise more you sleep better you try to do the things that are healthy for you like eating fruits and vegetables which we've been told are healthy for you and so you're getting more fiber and you're comparing that to a standard American diet you know process food garbage filled diet and of course you're going to do better um and then there's other ones they give a fiber capsule to someone and and but they're on the standard diet okay so maybe conditionally this is beneficial but what does fiber do is it is it conditionally beneficial because it gives nutrition no you don't absorb it you don't break it down you don't get any nutrients from it um you know your your gut lining might get a bit you know if you have you know certain bacteria that can eat a bit of it and they make short chain fatty acids which is what herbivores do in abundance they make a lot of that but we make a tiny bit and you maybe that can be good for your anas sites but you're in ketosis you make all of those anyway and you and you your inas sites are just fine like you you don't need fiber or else you just your gut lining just dies and falls off or else we would see that right and then people are given these fiber capsules um and they they improve in some in some ways and then you a meta analyses of these things wow this helps with blood pressure okay but then you look at some of the studies and I've unfortunately had to do this because it's you you got to um so but I do it so you don't have to waste your time but you know go ahead check and someone says oh here's this meta analysis top level top shelf data well junk in junk out you have crap studies that go into a meta analysis it's a crappy meta analysis and so you know looking at these things uh was just that you know I saw that you know they had these things where they you just gave them a fiber capsule they were all eating crap diets before or they didn't say it so you you're assuming that they're you you have to assume that they're eating a standard approach you know so you just do the normal uh breakdown by demographic and then you add a fiber capsule to that well what does fiber do it actually stops you from absorbing certain things it can it can it can reduce absorption of nutrients by up to 30% by some accounts um you know certainly Dr Robert lustig talks about this in his in his work on fructose and he's saying hey you know actually if you get fruit with fiber it can actually mitigate this because you know you're you're reducing by 30% the absorption so okay that's good well fine you know if you're eating garbage you know absorbing 30% less garbage okay that could be good and so you know that could could be it and you see this with blood sugar control eating fiber helps blood sugar control why the hell would it do that you know how could that possibly be what mechanistic explanation would we have it doesn't get in your body it doesn't affect anything else there but it stops your body from absorbing certain amount of sugar to 30% less okay well yeah that that'll help stabilize your blood sugar wouldn't it yeah okay but what if you're not eating crap what if you're eating only good things now you're stopping the absorption of good things well that's not in your favor right so they don't test that they don't test adding a fiber capsule you know to people like me who aren't eating crap or just eating good things what does that do and so when you look at those studies that that add fiber to a standard diet or to whatever people are eating and their blood pressure goes down well that's great well how much did their blood pressure go down and in one of these studies in this metaanalysis it was just supposed to be the end all be all it was like an average of like 1.4 points okay so you went from you know they didn't you know just making up numbers here but you you go from like the blood pressure of 160 to an average of 158.3 it's like wow it just really lowered your blood pressure wow that's I'm so impressed but then they run with that and they say fiber lowers blood pressure I'm like yeah yes technically technically it does is it enough to actually mean anything probably not but it technically does you're correct so you don't need fiber because no one needs fiber you don't need fiber on a carnivore diet because no one needs fiber if you're eating high octane garbage maybe this can help um but there's a uh there's a great video or lecture really that's up on YouTube from Dr Zoe harkham who I've had on my podcast recently which is great so if anyone who hasn't seen that do look that up it's fantastic and um she does a whole thing on fiber and one of the one of the um studies she talked about is with over 2,000 people and this is just general population this isn't you know whatever um you know and so this is just normal people and and it found that the high fiber group actually had a higher rate of cardiovascular death right so that mortality rate of heart disease was higher in the high high fiber group so like that's not good I you know I'm not sure why that would be what the mechanism would be or what other confounders would be in there but you know you can't you can't just if you're if you're going to take all these other sort of epidemiological things say oh well this can improve and blah blah blah um you know or I mean this is or or even smaller experimental or whatever I mean you can't discount all these things either but you have to at least sort of think about it so she does a great lecture on that large study over 2,000 people higher fiber diet uh died more okay so that's probably not what you want but if you think about it from a mechanistic point of view why would we need it it's not a nutrient we don't break it down we don't get any nutrients from it so it cannot be a nutrient it certainly cannot be an essential nutrient if it's not a nutrient it cannot be an essential or inessential nutrient it's not a nutrient and so that's just misclassified and so maybe you know certain conditions fiber is beneficial sure um in the context of eating a proper diet I don't think so and it I think that it can actually be detrimental certainly from just simply from stopping you from absorbing nutrients that you want and so I don't worry about it you certainly don't need it to to defecate you know that's that's ridiculous you just eat more fat and uh and your stools will be nice and soft just like 70% of all animals on Earth you know they they do just fine going to the bathroom or you know going to the woods with um with what they're eating wi thout fiber Sharon Thurman thank you very much for the"

        "body": "thout fiber Sharon Thurman thank you very much for the thout fiber Sharon Thurman thank you very much for the Super Chat I have my son on a carnivore diet hoping that it will help with his delays recently found out um he has areas of gray matter um heterotopia according to UCSF thoughts on if the carnivore diet can help thank you well it it depends on what's causing that and I'm very sorry that he's having trouble with his development um I do think this would help I mean I I don't know exactly what is is going on there um and why that's being called and what's you know what what's the cause of that obviously it matters what what the underlying cause is uh to see if if changing diet will improve that however I can tell you that providing him with optimal nutrition and avoiding everything that could be potentially negative to his development is always going to be a good thing and so especially neurologically especi our neurological development it is it is very important to get all of these fatty acids and the you know the DHA EPA and you know those Omega-3s that only come from animal fat they don't exist anywhere else and you just don't make them properly without getting them so you need them they are essential and all the different you know many different essential nutrients that that are required for our brain and and neurological development those all come in meat and those all come in animal fat and that's very very very important to get also being in a state of ketosis is extraordinarily important for brain development proper brain development it's also good for mitochondrial function and or you know and dysfunction you can you can actually damage your mitochondria and and with various things that you're eating but also just having high insulin and being in that alternate metabolic state that is called the FED state which I think is just a pathological defense mechanism against hypoglycemia of your body just trying to protect you by slamming up your insulin um I think that you know that it's much better to be in our Natural State you know infants and even fetuses are in a state of ketosis it's very easy for children to get into ketosis because it's very important for them to because that's required for optimal brain development ketones cross a blood brain barrier freely and they can reconstitute into uh fatty acids and actually get used as the building material and building blocks for the brain also your brain makes cholesterol which is you know upwards of 20% of the physical volume of your brain so people say oh you should take statins and things like that you know it's good for dementia like well that that doesn't really make sense because if it's stopping your brain from making cholesterol which your brain does as a building block component of your of your brain and um you know that that that that that why would that be beneficial why would why would reducing the building materials and potentially stopping your ba body from rebuilding and repairing your brain how how would that stop and prevent dementia I think that that's that that doesn't that that just doesn't pass the smell test and you know maybe but I I think it's complete BS um and I think it's just it's just people you know just trying to push push the the Pharmaceuticals narrative I just just think it's complete crap um so you know for kids especially I think it's it's very very important to be you know in in state of ketosis much of the time for proper neuronal development we have H 100 Years of evidence showing that ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet carnivore diet is or should be a ketogenic diet and you know we have a hundred years of evidence on this that it helps with things like epilepsy and um certainly diabetes and migraines and other sort of neurological disorders and we're just seeing more and more and more improvement with these sorts thing so I I do think it would help him I can't say if it's going to help his underlying cause of his of his issue um but I would hope that it does and I would expect it to help in in many many other ways especially with neurological development always remember that there's a hard line between pre- Agriculture and agriculture human beings in the fossil record after agriculture after they started eating more plants their height adult male height dropped by 5 in same with that's the same disparity between the Messiah and akuu by the way exactly same it's 5 Ines adult male height and they um the adult male brain capacity dropped by 11% adult female brain capacity dropped by 177% so that's a hard line that didn't take hundreds of years or thousands of years that was bang immediately and so that is brain development your brain is not developing properly it's not growing to its its specific genetic design and so that's negative isn't it and so um you know it's it's that's that's an indicative of the brain not developing properly the neurological system not developing properly and and you know just the the the amount of brain that you have um isn't you know if that's being curtail if that's being you know not allowed to develop to its potential you know what else in your body and what else in your neurological system is is not developing to his potential are those connections not developing properly are there's other sort of underlying mechanisms that are you know maybe causing this this issue that your son is having um that that could be at play there as well I I'll read you a passage from I have it pinned to the top of my um to my Instagram Channel but it's a picture sort of two skeletons is a picture taken from a textbook from Cambridge University and it shows the differences the disparities very clear highight differences and it goes through all the different sort of things their jaws are smaller teeth are crowded and crooked and not getting wisdom teeth or rotting teeth signs of poor wound healing signs of infection like tuberculosis in the spine for the first time in um in the fossil record you don't really see it really before that now you're seeing a lot after that in in post-agricultural communities and it's something that Dr Salsbury found in the 1800s that people that were eating more agrarian based Lifestyles long before processed sugar and processed seed oils and processed uh food industry existed and he found the exact same thing he found all these problems like post- agricultural people just had more problems and had you know were more susceptible to tuberculosis specifically and getting autoimmune diseases Etc and he contrasted that with Native Americans who were much healthier much taller much stronger much better teeth much you know healthier in general they're just eating meat they live much longer too and so uh so that was quite interesting as well and now you know since they've been um you know taken off their their natural dietes bison were all killed off which I think was you know a peric victory in the in the Indian Wars I think that did a lot more harm um than than was you know we were doing it to to win a war but I think it was just an absolute loss for for everyone uh that that happened so that's very unfortunate one of the Maj major things is it made uh the Native Americans in the PLS uh of Great Plains of America they forced to start eating agricultural crap and now their health is severely affected and they were the um there's a study in 2001 showing that they were the tallest human beings in the 1800s when they just e bison they were the tallest population of humans on earth right um average he of a population gen notice the average health of a population now they are not the tallest population of humans on Earth um and so I I haven't been able to find exact statistics on that but they they certainly you know aren't uh you know you know the highest average population height on Earth that I could find and so that's that's already you know again five inches down that's what happens so I'll read this passage from this uh textbook in at Cambridge um and uh from a professor at Cambridge and this is about pre- and poost agriculture so it says when populations around the globe started turning to agriculture around 10,000 years ago regardless of their location and regardless of the type of crop a similar Trend occurred the height and health of the PO of the people declined skeletal analysis suggests that these Neolithic peoples experienced greater physiological stress due to undernutrition and infectious disease okay so that's what happens when you eat plants and you don't get enough of the meat that you actually need and so that is happening to our development that's curtailing our development we're not growing as tall our brains aren't developing as fully and I think that this is unmasking a lot of underlying genetic issues that would normally be covered up because we have normal development we have normal nutrition and then when that sort of gets uh gets screwed up you then then all these other sorts of you know problems pop up and and without without that I think that you know they' probably be fine there's a lot of things that have you know your genes load the gun but environment pulls the trigger so you have a genetic predisposition and an environmental uh trigger for and I and that's a lot of these illnesses hopefully that's the case with your son hopefully that's the case and and you get rid of the environmental trigger you get proper nutrition and that hopefully that helps him develop and so um again long answer but I think an important one and uh good luck with that I really wish you both the best and hopefully this this helps and please let me know uh how we do how he goes in the coming months that would be that would be U I just really like to know how he does anyway so thank you and and um good luck with it meet keto Mex Warrior mecfs Warrior thank you very much

so nervous about heart disease and I still eat dairy is that okay well yeah you know some Dairy is fine I would keep it keep it to a minimum I would keep it as you know infrequently as as possible and just use as a condiment and so you know I would avoid milk because it has enough um it has enough carbohydrates to um um to uh you know lift up your your insulin and and throw you out your metabolic state that you want to be in and um and so I would I would avoid that and then just Dairy I would just use like cheese and things like that just as a condiment infrequently your meat is the meal um you you know if you do it the right way if you're healthy and if you're doing well and you're feeling good and um I do I do I do have a video you know answering some of these questions like you know um carnivore for beginners you know it's like getting started on a carnivore diet like carnivore for beginners sort of talk about the different ways that I think is a good way of doing eating intuitively eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good listening to your body trying to get enough fat your body needs fat you want like one to two grams of fat per one gram of protein that seems to be the ratio that most people do well with that that's the ra that's the ratio that most animals in the wild you do the best with as well so um you know and just just listening to your body looking another followup video for the carnivore for beginners one which is fiber constipation and diet and this tells you how to figure out how much fat you're getting if you're getting enough if you get dry hard constipated stools you're not eating enough fat by definition and you need to eat a little more to satisfy your body's um you know desire to absorb fat and then you have a bit spill over and and it keeps things soft and so that those are the major things I would look for just make sure you're eating enough it's very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet um you know in your profile picture looks like you you're a mom that has a baby so you know you need you need to feed yourself you need to have make sure that you have enough nutrients so that you can make milk if you're breastfeeding but also so you can be a present mom and have enough energy and and vitality to be with your kids so make sure you're eating enough um it's very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet which is why you go by taste and you relearn your hunger signals so uh eat fatty meat try around that proportion see how it affects your stools and adjust from there because everyone's a bit different and just eat as much fatty meat as tastes good to you and then stop but keep eating if it does taste good you know if it just sort of I was like yeah I feel satisfied but I could have kept eating keep eating you know just you you want that you want to satisfy your body's uh desire for food so I think that's the main way um the thing about heart disease I just I I you know really think that this was this was a just a non-starter you know again meat is not even associated with heart disease we had you know thousands millions of years that we were eating meat and you know weren't ostensibly we obviously didn't have records going back then we did have records in the 1800s and we were eating much more meat than we were in the early 1900s when heart disease first came on the scene and none of it did not have any of those things it certainly wasn't a major killer and if meat was direct a direct cause of this in the early 1800s it should have been the number one killer um of people back then and it because we're eating more meat in the early 1800s than we were throughout most of the 1900s up until more recently in the recent decades so you know I don't um I I don't think for a second that meat causes this I don't think for a second that saturated fat causes this I don't think for a second that our natural cholesterol that we're making causes this maybe you damage it you glycate it by eating carbohydrates and sugar and alcohol and Seed oils and that can cause damage to it and maybe that has a role to play but these things are also damaging the rest of your body as well and they could be precipitating that we know trans fats those really you know seem to have a causal relationship with with heart disease because people that were eating more trans fats you know the heart disease was was much higher in those in those populations and so you know your body just had had never seen trans fats before they don't exist in nature and so they were just getting deposited in strange places and building up these atherosclerotic plaques which potentially could be happening with these plant sterols these plant cholesterol molecules that um that that can be deposited in in our artery lining walls which look very similar to to our cholesterol and potentially why you know they they were um cast as the culprits you know say well we see cholesterol in there well is it human cholesterol that plant steril we have certainly found plant steriles in in the lining of of arteries so you know who knows but the the cholesterol model of heart disease we know that the origins were fraudulent we know that the origins were from the sugar companies paying off anel Keys paying off various professors from Harvard and elsewhere to to push this narrative when there were studies coming out and evidence coming out showing that actually there's a direct correlation with with sugar consumption and and heart disease which was a brand new disease in the in the 20th century and so we know that that's that's well documented that's this matter of historical record and um I you I never even thought that that people could contest that that's just history um and that's published we have their internal memos we have their contracts we know what they got paid and then people are saying oh my God you conspiracy theorist about you know the the sugar companies I mean I I I was talking to someone about the other day and they're just like talking about how this is like a conspiracy theory like this is a matter of historical record and you know you not knowing that is just your own ignorance and if you have seen that you've seen this Publications you know that they've done that then that's just your your denial of reality so this is not what we've been told that it is and the Inuit who ate a lot of meat and a lot of fat in the early 1900s um really didn't get heart disease pretty much at all and then it started creeping up they were still well under what the rest of the population of Canada for instance was experiencing with heart disease and even up until the 1990s they had much lower rates of heart disease they thought maybe it was genetic they had genetic protections and they found that nope no actually they have pretty much all the genetic risk factors for developing heart disease and like okay we don't know what the hell's going on because these people eat a whole bunch of fat meat and and that definitely causes heart disease and and they they smoke very early so they on average smoke I believe from eight years old so they're smoking very young which is definitely a risk for heart disease and and yet they're they were getting less heart disease up until the 90s and then you in the 2000 2010s are like oh why is everyone saying that the Inu have less heart disease oh we just study them now now they have more heart disease oh this is okay idiot um before when they were eating what they were traditionally eating they had less heart heart disease now they're eating this other crap and they're getting more heart disease what does that tell you that tells you that the things that they're eating the change in their diet is what's causing the heart disease so now they're eating more processed food drinking more alcohol and eating more garbage that we eat in the west and was was brought in from the west and they're getting more heart disease well funny that that's what we're all saying it's that it's the food causing it but not the meat you got it wrong it's backwards and so you know it's the it's projection from the sugar and processed food industry saying oh it's meat it's meat you're causing heart disease now it it's you so you know that's that's what that shows and the Inuit are are a testament a testimony to that right so like when they're eating their traditional diet of just fatty meat they don't get heart disease when they start getting in incorporated into Western Society start eating a western diet a low fat a lower fat and high carb and sugar and seed oil and alcohol diet then they get much higher rates of heart disease yeah right so it's not the me then is it because when they were just eating that they weren't getting it then they did something else and then the problems came okay so it's that something else isn't it right so um this is this is why I choose to live the way that I do and I feel much better for it um Dave Feldman is doing fantastic work showing this that you know these lean mass hyperresponders people have very high LDL but you know also High HDL and low triglyceride on like a keto carnivore diet and um and they're just they've just published data showing they like yeah actually they're not developing heart disease they're not actually getting AOS scerotic plaques or anything like that this isn't actually doing anything negative to them and um so that's good also you have to remember that just fasting if you fast 12 hours for your cholesterol test you'll get a certain cholesterol if you fast 14 hours your your LDL cholesterol will be higher why is that do those two hours put you at risk risk of developing heart disease why why would it you know it's you're not eating it's just your body's doing its thing this is a metabolic issue so when you just stop eating for a number of days your LDL shoot up well it's a metabolic state so when you're in a metabolic state where you're running on fat you have to mobilize fat move it to your body move it to your liver and make blood sugar and glycogen and and you know you know ketones and things like that so that you can you can run your body and have energy this is why I have energy why I'm able to able to do this um I'm not eating carbs you know and so I make all the carbs I need my blood sugar is normal my glycogen is normal and I replenish my glycogen faster than athletes who are sucking down sugar water that's been shown this year now too so um you know just not eating raises your LDL cholesterol is is fasting a risk factor for heart disease No in fact a lot of studies show that fasting is really really good for you in a lot of different Health markers so hopefully that reassures you hopefully that helps you a little bit um you know obviously you have to do what you're comfortable doing and you know stress is stress is definitely a risk factor for heart disease and so if you're worrying and stressing and freaking out that's obviously not not good so you know whatever you do be you know you should be doing something that you feel confident with and feel safe with for you and your family and I hope that that you do I think that that's a carnivore diet I think that's the best thing for you and your kids especially for the kids who are developing they're going to develop to their best potential but whatever you do you need to be happy with it you need to be confident with it and you don't want to be worrying about things so you know just keep you know keep looking into things and researching things and looking at you know Dr Paul Mason his things on on cholesterol and heart disease and uh Dave Feldman and um and Zoe harkham and you know just people you know and and get both sides of the story you know you can look at the other other people saying the opposite you know if you want to and see which evidence you um and you should do you you should always look at both sides of the evidence and see see which one you think holds water see see which arguments you think are better so good luck with that um I sort of lost track of time guys so um we're gonna have to um oh gosh I might have to cut this short I'm going to try to go through as much of the super chats as I can um but I I have to go in sort of 10 minutes uh 105 minutes maximum so yeah please don't don't do any more Super chats I'm I'm going to try to get I'm going try to do some of these things s of speed round so I probably uh you know so I'm trying to get get as many as I can um Stefano G thank you so much for the super chats very very generous of you I use barbecue sauce with no seed oils has 13 GS of carbs and for two tablespoons it really helps me adhere to meat only otherwise I use garlic paprika Etc just and just salt it's tough your opinion please well look you know I mean if you're going to use sauce I would just go for the one that has as as little sugar as possible sugar is very addictive and um and you just you know sort of want to get rid of that if if you're using seasonings and spices and things like that you know I I prefer not doing that because I feel much better without it and objectively there are things in there that you don't want however if it helps you adhere to this if it helps you stick to it and it helps you keep all the other stuff out of it I think that that's a net positive and it's certainly the lesser of two evils I think at some point when you're pretty when you're more comfortable with this it'd be really good idea to try you know 30 days without them and just just see how you go and see how you feel I think you'll find that your tastes actually change and you actually start really appreciating just the meat for itself and I certainly do and I I don't want sauces or seasonings on it because I'm like wow I really like I just want the meat taste you I think you'll find that that same thing as well you have very strong flavors in these sauces and everything it really overpowers that but when you're just eating the meat you start picking up the subtleties of it and they start becoming very very you know favorable so if it helps you stick to this and helps you avoid all the other stuff then I think that's that's a good thing um I think it's a good thing also to try you know 30 days minimum just try without it and see how you feel I think you'll feel a lot better and I think you'll really appreciate the taste of the meat as well um and then you can always try back in and and see how you going if it's if it makes you feel good then that's fine you or if it's not that big of a deal or whatever and and you enjoy it more then that's that's totally fine you've already eliminated out 99% of the other crap and so you're you're going to be doing much better than everybody else so I think it's definitely a net positive and um and if it helps you stay on track then then that's great but you know give it a shot without it at some point when you're feeling more more confident with the diet and see how you go Alexander uh thank you very much for the super sticker that's very kind of you I appreciate that uh Nicho las Simmons uh you'll see us thank you so much for the"

        "body": "l be from from Troy Dan 22 thank you very much for the l be from from Troy Dan 22 thank you very much for the Super Chat thank you everyone um for the super chats as well otherwise I'm so sorry that I I'm not goingon to be able to get to all of them but we'll finish with this one anyway question hi doc love your work can you talk on salt please what brand do you use I live in Australia does it raise blood pressure should we get iodine salt um avoid anti-caking agent avoid him Pig salt well definitely avoid anti-caking agent I don't I don't know um of anything in Himalayan pink salt unless they have anti-caking agent in it uh that should be avoided those mineral salts from like the mines like Himalayan pink salt or you know redm salt um from what I understand those those are probably very good and and and great have these minerals in that are that are good for you um you want to avoid things a lot of sea salts have a lot of microplastics in them so that can be a problem um I don't think you necessarily need to get iodized salt unless you have an iodine deficiency uh then that can be beneficial um does it raise blood pressure for some people it will I think it's it's only something around 20% of people that are actually salt sensitive that they actually need to avoid salt um most people can salt to taste and not have any derangement of their blood pressure or deleterious effect on their blood pressure if you're eating more salt and and you're putting extra salt then that can be a problem then some people you know maybe one out of five people uh may need to just sort of reduce their their salt so see how it affects you if you're noticing that you're having blood pressure issues you can try cutting out the salt and see if if that makes an effect um and um so yeah you know ju just try that with yourself most people be fine most people are find just salting to taste and um you may find that that eventually you don't you don't want salt a lot of people do like salt at first some people even find that they need more salt they don't use all that much salt and they need more salt then that sort of normalize and and settle down once their body sort of figures out how to how to stabilize your electrolytes I find that I I found early on that I salted pretty much normal as I did before and then I started using slightly less slightly less slightly less slightly less and over years I eventually didn't want any salt so this past year I've just stopped salting and um you know if somebody else salts I don't I don't get worried about it but it generally tastes too salty for me if if even put a little bit of salt on it and so I actually prefer no salt now and I don't I don't put any salt and but that that's after like six years you know like six years of just slowly decreasing amount of salt naturally I I just I salt it to taste I just didn't want as much my taste ran to very little salt and now I don't want any salt and so um that's what I would do so yeah just salt to taste the the mineral salts like the Himalayan pink salt redond salt I think are are probably the best they're not going to have the microplastics and weird things in them definitely avoid anticaking agents those things are generally endocrine endocrine disruptors they can screw with your hormones uh so definitely avoid that I don't think you need iodine unless you need iodine you know if so you have a deficiency then you know maybe some iodized salt are good or some you know Lugal drops or whatever um you know in some water it can be quite harsh you know iodine is very custic and um and that's it and if and just just check your own blood pressure if you have blood pressure issues see if you're salt sensitive some people are most people will be just fine salting to taste um okay thank you so much I'm so sorry I didn't get to to the rest of the super chats I really appreciate all of you and and appreciate all of the super chats um but uh yeah unfortunately I have to I have to run next couple times I will be in Seattle I'm still going to try to keep to the same time and I will I will have a bit more leeway and time to to answer more questions i't because I won't be I won't be rushing to work uh shortly after that so that should be um able to sort of do some of the more longer um longer question Q&A sessions and get to more questions then so very sorry I didn't get to everything thank you very much for everyone for joining um please do join me again uh Sunday night Monday morning in Perth Sunday night in in America in
