    "transcript": "[Music] hey good morning everyone good evening um good to see you everyone thanks for joining my live this is for November 9th in America November 10th in Australia and elsewhere so thank you very much everyone for joining up um looks like we still got oh we've got a number of people here uh like Rick hey Rick how are you doing and Melissa nice to see you and um everyone else thanks for for joining as well okay so so looks like people have already started signing in saying hello so hello everyone um if you can uh just hit the like button that that lets YouTube know to sort of push this out there and suggest this to people so they can get here on the live and also if you have a question put question so I can see that and um and then we can answer as many of these as we can okay first one is from ran toada thank you very much for the Super Chat hey Doc I've got stage four dsrct cancer I'm very sorry to hear that I've been doing carnivore for 200 days and feel amazing was wondering what your thoughts on marijuana were and uh their anti-cancer properties love your work doc um that's something I I don't know too much about honestly I I've certainly heard in passing that it could have an cancer effects I don't know what they are I don't know exactly what um cancers they would help with unfortunately that's just not something I really know as as you know all that much about but if it's if it's helping you in some way and it's helping you deal with it and it's helping you with the medications and the chemo and things like that then I think that's that's a benefit in in and of itself is that it it's helping you deal with the situation and so you know that's sort of a decision that you can make and if it's if it is something that you feel is helping you then then that's positive and so you know having a bit more relief that can relieve stress that can help you cope with a situation that you're in and that can make things a lot easier and if you're not as stressed out if you're not as as bogged down with the treatment and the therapy then you're going to have a better time of this and I I I do think that when people sort of get too weary of the treatment and they really just can't fight anymore that's when they start to go downhill and so if this helps you not do that then then I think that's a that's a bonus I don't know uh specifically of the anti-cancer effects that that it has however so I can't really speak to that but I'm glad that you are on Carnivore I do think that that is helpful um you know practicing the ketogenic metabolic therapy as as prescribed by or as set out by Professor C freed and getting your gki your glucose Ketone Intex just down as low as possible under two under one if possible with a combination of carnivore and fasting I think is is probably going to help you quite a lot anyway and and it's great that you're feeling better because that's that's another added bonus from the carnivore diet so uh good luck with that I hope you I hope everything goes well okay all right so next question is from Damen Williams thank you for the Super Chat good morning you're an inspiration well thank you very much that's very kind of you trying your advice to avoid hamstring pulls while sprinting thank you question as a OTR truck driver sitting for seven plus hours your thoughts on compression socks yeah probably a good idea you know that they just they just keep your your legs from you know pulling up blood and you know getting a bunch of swelling and things like that certainly if you notice any swelling in your in your feet and ankle and legs then probably a good idea it keeps that keeps that blood moving and it keeps the fluid from building up in the tissue and that's going to help you from you developing dvts and things like that uh I don't know how much of a of a risk that is for for long hul truck drivers but um it sort of makes sense that you're just sort of sitting there for a long time time that can sort of pull up just like you would on a long haul flight but you are sort of moving around sometimes unless you're just on cruise control the whole time but um yeah that's probably something to think about I think that probably would be beneficial and and certainly if you're getting swelling then uh definitely should should wear those seven figure earner thank you for the Super Chat uh 21 male started carnivore a couple days ago as is it normal to feel aggressive on carnivore and can you touch on the thyroid on and the carnivore die uh normally people don't feel very aggressive most people actually chill out and they call it carnivore Zen and they just feel very very relaxed and very very mellow so you know they could be other things going on obviously when you're transitioning into anything new it can be a bit uh you know unnerving or stressful or um affect you in different ways and it could just be out of a break from your from your normal routine also in the first few days if you're if you're leaving behind a lot of other things like sugar or caffeine or other sorts of things that we we treat as food but are really drugs you know you're going to withdraw from them and that can make you cranky so that's probably more to do with like a withdrawal um phenomenon rather than the carnivore itself so once once you get through that in this you know sort of next week or two that should calm down and you should be much more melow as well so that's um that's the norm is that people people chill out um you know just like when people are quitting cigarettes they get they really on edge so uh that that's more likely to be what's happening I wouldn't say it's the actual diet itself it's just the lack of other things you're sort of withdrawing from uh the thyroid can be affected by many many different things but a lot of them are metabolic and when you correct your met your food and your diet with a carnivore diet then you you improve your metabolism and a lot of ways and your metabolic uh Health improves and so I see a lot of people with thyroid issues which are which are uh very underdiagnosed I see a lot of people that have thyroid issues and go on a carnivore diet and that improves dramatically and so that's something that that is very common but obviously there are different causes of thyroid issues so uh some people will say that being in ketosis long term will damage the thyroid I've never seen that and a lot of the data actually points to the opposite of that and there studies with people in ketosis or on ketogenic diets at least for you know two years and they find no uh problems with their thyroid they find no problems with their cortisol they find no problems really with anything in fact they found improvements a lot of improvements and that's just with ketogenic diets that's not even like full-blown carnivore diet but being in ketosis anyway or for a large portion of that time they don't find problems so I you know I do know that when people eat a ton and ton a ton of organs those are the ones that seem to have some of the problems and there is a mechanism where if you have too much vitamin A that can actually suppress your thyroid stimulating hormone which will then obviously makeing so you don't produce enough thyroid hormone so that could be an issue so I would just that's why I always caution people and just tell them yes organs are great they're very nutrient-dense and and that can actually lead to issues if you're eating too much of them because they're too dense and so you get a buildup of these different sorts of fat soluble vitamins like vitamin A and copper especially in cow's liver so you can get a bit of a buildup in that so try to try to eat things in proportion you take down a buffalo you've got you know thousand pounds of meat that's going to last you a year or two for a family you know certainly an individual it's got one liver it's got one heart it's got two kidneys so put things into proportion it's a big liver but it's still just one liver so try to keep things in proportion don't have have half of your calories coming from or half of the you know poundage of your food coming from just organs because it's not that's not in proportion with what you're going to find in the wild um you know grain finished beef is or or grain finished animals in general probably going to be less nutritious so you probably need you know organs to supplement in with but you know a lot of a lot of civilizations like the Inuit uh don't necessarily use uh organs now there there's mixed report reporting there some accounts say that they do eat it some don't so it's probably in some areas they do and some they don't but either way there are certainly documentation documented civilizations where they don't really eat the organs and they give those to the dogs and so you know it's it's certainly um not necessary that everyone has to do that now some people may find that they don't get quite enough nutrients just on the muscle meat and so they need to add in you know some liver and things like that but just if you're in that cat in that camp then you know just just keep it you know in in proportion with the rest of the animal there are people with like the mfrg mutation probably can't process fully um and and b12 properly and so they'll need a bit more uh liver and things like that and that happens but um uh but just see how you go and um you know just don't overdo it is the main thing uh coder Terry thank you so much for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy can you talk about wet aging I know you did a video a while back can you uh give a brief explanation thanks yeah so wet aging is just is just when you buy one of those big Primal cuts and you leave it in the vacuum seal vacuum wrap thing that comes from the you know the store from the butcher or the you know the Avatar packed in it just goes straight to the store and you just buy it wholesale you just leave it in there so you leave in you put it in the fridge you don't have to freeze it and certainly uh don't leave it on the counter but you you need in the refrigerator but you you just leave it you just leave it in the cback pack as long as there's no holes in it as long as air is not getting in bacteria is not going to have a chance to to go anywhere or get in there then you can just leave it for you know beef and lamb I wouldn't really do that with you know pork or chicken things like that um just because they they will go off uh pretty quickly um so you don't want to do that but beef I've done up to six weeks I think I don't think it's probably a good idea to go more than four weeks though but you know it's not necessarily going to be a bad thing if it goes over four weeks but that's that's probably a good limit to put that on so you don't you don't you know spoil it um and that's it you just leave it there and it just sort of breaks down a bit becomes more tender bit bit better texture um some people say it it improves the flavor others say it doesn't really it just improves the texture and then dry aging improves the flavor and that's certainly true you sort of getting out some of the water it Browns better concentrates the the flavor better so that's that's the idea behind wet aging and then you doing a bit of dry aging or dry brining you know putting a bit of salt on the steaks and then letting them sit out on the drying rack like I also do I don't really use salt anymore I just like the taste without salt but you know you know if when people if people use salt just use the amount of salt that you'd want for that that piece and and then just put it on a rack make sure it's not touching anything else leaving in there overnight and for a couple days and it just really concentrates the flavor and actually tastes really nice so yeah that's the idea behind that um let's see here you go from T Nelly question do you think carnivore is is the optimal diet for those with no medical or metabolic issues yeah absolutely I mean that's the whole idea is you don't want to develop the metabolic and medical issues and that's that's what the diet is about because if you are eating what you're designed to eat your body's going to work the way it's designed to work and you're not going to develop these metabolic issues in the first place you unless you have other sorts of exposures but because we're putting things in our face every single day you know that that's our greatest exposure generally is and new chemicals coming into our body is is through our food and so yeah first of all even if you don't have any metabolic issues you don't have any health issues your health will improve dramatically and you'll be surprised at at the fact that it's like wow I I actually didn't feel my best I had no idea what my best felt like and then you'll feel like a superhuman so that's what you want to do you want to eat to your biological design and if you do that your body's going to work to its biological design and you won't develop these met metabolic issues in the first place but more than that you're going to feel better than you've ever felt in your entire life whether or not you have a medical issue and I talk to people that say you know well you know I'm interested in the carnivore diet but you know I'm not I don't have any health problems and so you know I don't I don't really need to do that and I point out to them you know they say like you know I feel pretty good so you know I I don't really need to do this and I point out to them that you actually have no idea what good feels like because you've never you've never tried going on without it if you do you'll see that you you haven't felt your best and in fact your whole life you felt like crap and that's what I said to myself when I was you know 38 and came back to this and realized that's what I was doing for those five years that I felt like a superhuman and and I never could figure out how to get back to that and then at 38 all of a sudden two weeks into a carnivore diet I felt like that again and I realized that I felt like crap my entire life except for those 5 years and I was very upset because I was robbed my Birthright I should have been feeling that amazing all the time and my body should have developed better taller stronger smarter bigger brain all these sorts of things that we we sort of all been robbed from because we all didn't have the proper nutrition as we were developing as a fetus and infant and then as a child and and teenager so we've all been robbed from that and so you will be surprised how good you feel and uh and how upset that you'll be um that you haven't been doing this for a whole time but you know the they say you know the best time to plant a tree uh was 50 years ago and the second best time is right now so uh I would just get on it and see how you go and you'll feel better than you ever have so next question is from Debbie go question how does low thyroid affect libido and a 69y old woman um it doesn't necessarily I mean it can make you just feel it can make you feel low energy and just just not really interested in in life in general I guess that could affect your libido but generally it's other sorts of things especially you know when you're 69 you're you're past menopause generally and so your hormones are going to be very low women can actually get low testosterone women need a bit of testosterone just like men need a bit of estrogen and so if you have a bit low testosterone on top of your other hormones being low that can that can affect your libido as well so some women Turn to You Know HRT or even not even full HRT where they sort of go back to youthful hormonal levels but just like a little bit just to make them feel a bit better and help their lito and sometimes a bit of testosterone helps with that um thyroid you just just makes you feel a bit down about everything and so that can affect your libido but it affects every aspect of your life including your libido um thyroid is generally helped by a cornivore diet I've seen this many many times hormones are helped by a cornivore diet in general because you're you're you're taking away the impedance of thyrotoxic and metabolic disruptive you know substances that you're putting in your body including carbohydrates which which raise insulin block leptin and screw with a lot of your other hormones which is is really harmful so I would expect that to get better I would expect your thyroid to get better I would expect your libido to get better A lot of people do find their libido improves when they go on a carnivore diet and it's going to be for a number of reasons and and they just have more energy they have more you know interest in life and um interest in other people and that obviously can can track into Libo but you know most people um will find that that um oh I think I lost my TR train of thought there well people will find anyway that they they improve um and um and then Lio can improve as well I think I forgot my my my uh end point there but anyway uh I do think that that would improve and um so it's worth a try [Music] anyway seven figure earner thank you again for the Super Chat so he's saying aggressive is in high libido high energy Etc I see uh people back in the day drank a lot of milk wouldn't the carbs and a gallon of milk take you out of keto yes it would and I've tested that myself I drank um three gallons of milk in three days and I uh I was I uh my insulin ended up you know going going way up uh because of that um well not way up but any it became higher than was it wasn't like elevated for um you know like the you know the test sample and everything like that but it was higher than my normal resting uh insulin and that was just from three days of of a lot of milk and I certainly noticed that where I I drank milk and you know tasted amazing obviously because it does um but you know know my My Sweet Sensation is much more sensitive it's like it's like I'm drinking ice cream when I'm when I'm uh drinking milk so it's like it's very sweet to me now and that's very compelling to drink more of but more than that you know you drink you drink a couple glasses of like raw milk tastes great you feel good for a while and then you get reactive hypoglycemia because it's taking you out of ketosis your insulin is high and now you're you're you're not producing ketones and your blood sugar drops and you feel a bit tired and off and you want to go drink some more milk again and you just keep doing that so I did that for like three days and um and then I you know just tested my blood because that was sort of an experiment I wanted to run and um you know my insulin was up and other and and that was pretty much it you everything else was still fine but uh I definitely didn't feel my best I definitely didn't have consistent energy throughout the day kept you know having this flagging energy like like you would have had you know previously in life where just you're constantly eating and you're constantly feeling like crap and so that definitely happened uh with that so aggressive is in high libido high energy so that's great I mean yeah that is normal people do generally increase their libido and their energy levels and and that just keeps improving because you're running on proper energy you're mobilizing your energy you're mobilizing fat you're mobilizing ketones mobilizing and and making new blood sugar and glycogen so you have tons of energy all the time uh your libido goes up because you've stopped impeding it uh with the different things that you're eating and uh then generally improve their testosterone and uh know women fix the balance of their testosterone and estrogen and generally you know improve their estrogen progesterone balance and when PE when women are eating carbohydrates they can actually get too much testosterone and too little estrogen so that balances as well which obviously improves you know their health and their hormonal health and would improve their libido as well so yeah that that's very [Music] common uh thank you for the Super Chat uh from uh fnafi Al huge fan uh carnivore 22 years um 22 years old I assume maybe not 22 years long um prefer raw but all the data on bacteria parasites and meat is offputting when in developing countries well yeah look I mean developing countries you got to be a bit more careful so you probably should cook it yeah kindly offer clear advice on when where it is safe to eat raw meat and the true danger to consider yeah so in in developing countries you have no idea where that stuff is coming from you have no idea the quality control you have no idea if that that meat has parasites you assume that they do and um you have no idea if those people washed their hands in the last month let alone before they they handled your your food and so you assume that they haven't and so you certainly want to cook the outside because you know you don't want to trust anybody's food hand handling and um so you want to you want to cook the bacteria off on the outside um depending on what it is and and um and what you think of it you could get it well done or you could let it be rare in the middle but that runs a risk of having parasites so if I if I was in a developing country I would be cooking meat well done I would not be eating it raw um unless you knew the source and you trusted it but if you're just at a restaurant or just at a you know at a at a you know on a market or a butcher I would not trust that and so the only time I would eat eat raw is if you you know exactly where that's coming from if you're in a in a western country um you know like America UK Australia you know Europe in general New Zealand all all these other places and there obviously many more um you know they have much tighter control over the quality of of the meat that comes out and they test them like the USDA will test them they'll send samples it check for bacteria there's any bacteria they shut it down clean everything deep clean it check it again if there's anything they shut it down again and do it again uh before they're ever able to start processing meat and they have to they do a deep clean for two hours like every six hours so it's like eight hour cycles and they they then take samples from that meat they send it off to the lab they try to culture it see if there's any bacteria or parasites if they find any they recall the whole batch and so that's very rare that that happens but it happens and so great it comes back done and so that you can more trust is is in places like you know Western countries that have a lot more quality control um and you know even even with sushi and sashimi with the raw fish you know they're very careful about that they do things you know specific fish they treat them in certain ways to try to you know make sure there's no parasites in there or Draw out any parasites if there are there um but even then you know people that eat Sashimi can have issues with with parasites so you know you have to be careful but I certainly wouldn't wouldn't take that risk in like a developing country so thank you for the Super Chat C Cafe effects um you have shredded me for the summer a awesome that's good to hear yeah I mean you can get you can get very lean and very very muscular very quickly on a carnivore diet and I you just and you maintain it and so you know if you're working out like I've never put on muscle faster and leaned out quicker than when on a carnivore diet especially when when able to work out so yeah that's great H good timing for the summer fatty fatty carnivore uh Conor thank you for the Super Chat 54 year old female 6 months on carnivore beef butter bacon and eggs no Dairy down 67 pounds that's amazing four clothes sizes um BG stays near blood glucose stays near 100 why is that especially after all this time I feel great otherwise well it depends you know it depends on on where you were at before and you know if you were a diabetic before are you still taking medications how much medications are you taking um if you're if you are taking medication for diabetes you should take enough to keep you in in a normal range uh near 100 is is you know under 100 but near 100 is still in the normal range and and so that's okay it also depends on when you're checking it it can go up and down depending on the time of day obviously you have like a dawn effect where you're your cortisol is up in the morning and that's going to be higher than it will the rest of the day you will get a bit of a of um insulin response and you could get a blood sugar response when you eat a lot of protein which is fine that's that's normal um and so that that could be part of it as well so you can take it at multiple times during the day obviously if you're stressing out about it and you're worrying about it you're going to increase your cortisol and you're going to increase your blood sugar so I just I would just take it easy if you're on if or if you were on Diabetes medication I would continue to take it until your blood sugar is is normal on its own and um you know it's it's been 6 months which is great but not everybody gets off all their medication in six months and so just just be patient with it make sure your blood sugar is in a good range if it's under 100 that's that's still in a good range and so I wouldn't be too worried about that but um but if you do take diabetes medications or you have in the past it might be that you still just need to be on a bit more of it or it could be that the timing of the day or your stress levels are affecting that as well but you've lost 67 pounds in 6 months that's amazing and um you know so I wouldn't I wouldn't be too worried about it because obviously your body's doing very good things and uh the most important thing is that you're healthy and uh and thriving okay Andre Frasier thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy have you heard anything about the carnivore diet helping people with HIV oh that's interesting no I actually haven't um I haven't come across anyone who has um dealt with that um on a carnivore diet I mean I would expect it just to help in general is it going to make it so that's not a problem really no way to tell it's uh but it's just going to help your health in general it can help your immune system in general it would be interesting to see how that that affected people with HIV I mean there's pretty good treatments for that now I mean most people um have a pretty much normal normal life expectancy now even with HIV due to um the treatments that they're on or possibly due to not giving them the treatments they used to be on in the 80s which were probably killing them like massive amounts of act which uh was absolutely just criminal the amount that they they gave people and or not yeah I I don't know everything about it but you know when when you're giving people chemotherapy agent I mean this you know chemotherapy kills people and you're giving people chemotherapy every day that high doses longterm what do you expect it going to happen you're going to destroy their immune system and then they're going to die it's pretty much pretty much that's pretty much it so you know a lot of people think that that a lot of the improvements in in um life expectancy and survival for people with HIV is that they've stopped giving them all that a and they' they've gone to other sorts of methods so uh but yeah I mean I would any situation you're in any medical condition you're you're you're suffering from um are going to improve because you're going to improve your body's going to improve you're going to optimize your health and so you're going to optimize your situation with any unfortunate circumstance such as HIV but that would be interesting I don't um I haven't I haven't spoke to anybody who has uh had HIV to see how that has affected them but I would be interested in finding out if you know anybody who has had that and tried it all right so Mark Brier thank you for the Super Chat do you think a carnivore diet could help with heart conditions for example svts of over 200 beats per minute oh that's a good question I mean there's there's a lot of and so that's a superior super ventricular attack of cardia so that's um it depends you know it depends on what's causing that I mean I haven't um I haven't spoken to anybody who's sort of suffered from that directly you know like the the HIV thing but there are a lot of connections to our metabolic health and our specific organ health and our or cardom metabolic Health um one thing apparently there's a there's a strong correlation with atrial fibrillation which is you know rapid heartbeat that stems from uh cardiac uh fat like visceral fat so fat around the heart and building up around the heart and that sort of coincides with visceral fat fat around your organs and your abdomen you sort of build fat around the heart as well and that can screw with the electric electricity of the heart and so there could be some sort of connection there and so you know if you address things that will address that like addressing the visceral fat and visceral um or and the the cardiac fat uh which are you know according to Dr Shan Omar who's the expert in that field um is uh you know the best diet for that would be a carnivore diet and then sprinting and resistance training to fail failure is the best exercise for that and there's other sorts of things that he does in his protocol with his patients that you know also add to that um but a carore diet being the the a number one diet that helps with that so I would expect um you know other things to improve obviously it's not going to improve everything it's not going to fix everything but there is a connection between you know disregulation of the electric electricity in the heart uh with things like adal fibrillation and this visceral fat and fat around the heart and so potentially when you remove that and you eliminate that with uh you know diet and lifestyle you can improve that as well so that would be interesting to find out also okay so Allan thank you for the Super Chat I'm not seeing a not seeing a question with that let me see if there's anything down here there another one from Allan Dr J please get a job at Stanford Hospital uh well that I mean that would be nice you I don't I don't live in in um in the US but obviously um you know um Stanford is a great institution and that would be be more than happy to to work there at some point if if the opportunity Rose and I didn't even get to potentially meet you one of my heroes Dr Thomas so who's over at Stanford as well and that guy's just just an absolute hero um it' be great I would love to get I would love to get Thomas so on on the carnivore diet and help him with that because I just I just I just want that guy to live forever and be as healthy as possible because I just you know selfishly I I want him in the world using that big ass brain of his to you know to um you know to uh uh you know crunch through these major problems that that uh that we have and uh there's no one better there's no one better than him so I don't know anybody has any connections with to Thomas soell let me know I would love to talk to him I I mean that would just be you know you know like just getting to meet your Heroes you know um I would absolutely love to talk to him I I don't even know I mean i' love to have him on the podcast and talk to him but I don't know what um you know I couldn't relate it to to diet it would be completely about him it would be something different but um the guy's amazing and so if anyone has connections please God let me know I would love to talk to him I would love to try to get him on a corner board diet and um and get and keep him around for you know another 40 50 years that'd be great Mason Hull thank you for the Super Chat I have psoriasis and started the cornivore diet to help with it um how long do you think it would take to see results looks like gr fed beef and water only so could be grass or grain um I'm maybe going to guess you're going to say grass-fed if it's grass-fed then that that's obviously you know the best option grain fed's still really good um is better than other options better than pretty much any other option um it depends so some people some people find that their psoriasis clears up pretty quickly like in the first few weeks or months other people will find they have more of a stubborn case the more strict you are with it the more pure just beef and water you are the better you're going to be so I would I would expect you know especially if that's if that's saying that's grass-fed beef then you you'll do pretty well if you have a pretty stubborn case it might take a a little longer but it it will get better um some people I've spoken to that have had stubborn cases where it's sort of lingered on for a few months they found that using Tallow as a moisturizer just beef Tallow as a moisturizer that you know putting that on the psoriasis that that it actually helped clear it up and so that's something you can you can do early on is just keep it sort of moist with Tallow which is apparently very similar to our natural oils that we make and then we strip off every morning when we take a shower and wash with soap so um something you could think about but it it is different for most people but most people find that they get significant Improvement early on especially if they're doing it uh very you know pure beef and water like like you are so I I would expect you to get pretty good results Jeff lanton thank you for the Super Chat I've been on strict carnivore for a month and the last couple of days I've noticed that most of my anxiety and depression is gone and I have very stable energy levels throughout the day well that's great uh that's really great to hear Jeff I'm very glad to hear that that is something that um you we're seeing more of and we're seeing in clinical studies with people such as Professor Chris Palmer Dr Georg Eid who are you know doing great work in the mental health field especially when it comes to metabolic health and diet as it relates to those and so a lot of people are finding this and and it's really great because the the the sort of an epidemic of mental health issues and depression and anxiety is it's just getting worse and worse and so and I think that's directly caused by our situation and manipulations that we have and social media and things like that that are trying to mess with your head and then you have on top of that our metabolic Health isn't isn't very good and we're eating very poor diets that don't belong in a human diet at all these things just don't belong there and and we're getting really disrupted from that and so people go back to eating in a natural biological way they get better which is great and so I'm very glad to hear that I'm very glad to hear that you're you're doing better and it'll just keep getting better you know because your mitochondria keep going improving as the months go on and um your metabolic health will keep improving as months go on so it'll just keep getting better and better and better so I'm I'm glad that you're already getting good results you're going to keep getting better results so just keep with it because that's great and mckever thank you for the Super Chat uh thanks for the awesome help you provide what is the ideal range for healthy blood glucose after going strict carnivore my blood glucose finally fell into the 80s uh then is low is 71 my insulin is 3.4 I think that's fine I think that's a perfect range U you know your insulin is right there in a fantastic range um there's you know there are different camps on on what um I've heard people say of as an ideal insulin range it can be from you know 2 to six to 6 to9 um or four to seven you know but in that range that sort of lowish range but you still have it obviously you do need insulin it's a very important hormone and you need sort of little fluctuations in it which you will get from eating big bolet of protein um not as big as a as a carbohydrate Spike but that's that's not that's not an issue really so you know I think those are those are fantastic you know being in the low 70s fine and your insulin is right I mean I think that's my insulin level you know so and I've been doing this for six years and so that seems to be where my my body sort of stabilized you know at um with my insulin so yeah no I think that's actually excellent numbers and uh yeah so as long as you're feeling good that's the main thing Deborah thank you very much for the Super Chat she says uh thanks for reaching out uh to help Bill not you are awesome oh well you know well thank you I appreciate that um yeah Bill if you people don't know he's um he's a guy up in Alaska who carry man from uh Homestead how I've done a number of things with he's really nice guy he's very he you he's found that the carnivore has just really literally changed his life changed his family's life and you know just turned their health around in such major profound ways that he's just like okay everyone needs to know about this so he's really pushing this out there to people and doing the carnivore documentary uh which I think is just is fantastic and Bill not is a gentleman up in Alaska who unfortunately has you know been stuck in his house for a number of years because he has been very uh very overweight and not able to travel and go around anywhere or really go outside so he's been I think he was around 700 lb um around there and so he wanted to do carnivore and he wanted wanted to uh you know just sort of get his life back so Carri helped him out with that and he started going to cornivore diet they were going to Chronicle it and document it and he started a YouTube channel in order to to do that it's already been very popular obviously it's you know people are interested in that sort of thing and and he's already lost like nearly 200 pounds in the last couple months so he's doing really really well um and but he was having some issues and I I you know I'd seen a couple of his sort of things but sort of didn't watch like the whole video and then just just this last week I just randomly said like okay well maybe I'll watch like a whole one through and I just watched it and he was talking about you know how he was doing and everything like that but then he was saying that he was actually having some neurological issues and some numbness and weakness in his legs and that was very concerning for me because to me you know if I saw someone like that in the hospital the emergency room uh I would be very concerned about that that they had something compressing their spinal cord and that they might need surgery uh pretty much emergently because you know time losses is his nerves lost and so if that's Contin it it's slow sort of creeping onset um over the course of about a month but it's getting worse and that that's a bit concerning so it at least warrants an MRI and to see what's going on if it's if it's not any sort of something pushing on the spine or the spinal cord then um there's some sort of medical issue that needs to be addressed as well either way it needs to be addressed and so I just sort of reached out to him and let him know my thoughts and and so he went to go get a an MRI unfortunately still he was just over the limit for the MRIs um literally by 15 pounds so he was very close but um they had to get a special MRI and that that's not available for like four days even though it's pretty urgent um that he get that done but um hopefully he'll be getting that soon apparently it's going to be on Saturday and hopefully he does well if people haven't seen bill um check him out he's he's a really nice guy he's very inspirational and he's really working hard to get his life back which is which is really great to see so um you can go over to his his channel and say hi and support him and um you know see see what what he's doing there but he'll be he'll be in that carnivore documentary as well and U doing just a fantastic job and hopefully this is this is either nothing or something that can be uh treated easily but um yeah just sort of concern that he needs to get it get it checked out soon anyway oh this says Allan thanks again for the Super Chat and um please got a job at Stanford Hospital yeah yeah well you know maybe down the road um you know my uncles went to Stanford they really loved it and um you know have some connections there like my mom's cousin went um went to Stanford Medical School and his dad was faculty there um so there there are some you know family connections there and that might make it interesting but um I mean not nothing that would help me get a job you know so it's way too distant but um you know but obviously just heard you know good things and good reports so about people that have gone there and worked there so yeah that would be great um but uh yeah we'll see we'll see where life takes me at Mom thank you very much for the Super Chat um I think you missed my super chat at the top of messages interesting I didn't I don't I don't think I did see it super chat at top of messages not seeing it app mom actually not not seeing it let me let me check over here try to go all the way up which is not very easy to do see very strange I'm not I'm not seeing your your super chat um there at mom um unfortunately you know normally this this um allows me to have to see just just the super chats and a special window and it's not it's not actually showing so I don't I don't actually know what's going on there oh maybe oh there we go that's really weird that's weird that they didn't show me that okay so mom um well thank you for the Super Chat carnivore for 6 months 30 kg overweight still have loose stools and high alkaline phosphate um 54y old female would love to lose weight uh but love this way of eating so yeah look some some people do uh find it difficult to lose weight I think there's hormonal reasons for that generally have very high leptin you get your leptin checked I would I would bet that that's High um and it can be very difficult until that leptin comes down but it does come down and so I I I would expect that to be actually significantly reduced from where it was at this point especially after six months if you're if you're really not having any carbs or sugar or artificial sweeteners and you can you can look at things like um Kelly Hogan Kelly Hogan actually put on weight for six months on a cornivore diet but she was feeling so good that she was like okay I'm just going to trust the process and keep going with this and so she did and then eventually it just started coming off and then she's got it all off and she's kept it all off so I would expect that to happen to you as well um you can always check your leptin and your hormones and make sure that there's anything underlying that that maybe needs to be addressed that may be making this a bit more stubborn um but you should check out Kelly Hogan I I did an interview with her on my channel and then she has done a specific video on not being able to lose weight on a carnivore diet with um Charles Washington who's been doing carnivore for probably nearly 20 years now and um he runs the Facebook group zeroing in on health which I think is is an excellent one um zero carb Health with Dana and then zeroing Inon Health with Charles I think those are probably the two best carnivore Facebook groups out there and um and they're very strict but I think that's good I think that's what makes them good and so there are a lot of really good ones but those are sort of two of the original ones and um so she does a video with chars and they talk about that and they talk about that phenomenon it is rare uh most people do lose weight um early on and pretty quickly but not everyone does and so what you have to do is you have to troubleshoot are you only eating fatty meat and only drinking water if there's anything else in there cut it out and even if you don't think I mean it's you know sugarless gum just get it get rid of it you know anything that's not fatty meat and water get rid of it and see what happens a lot of time that's that's the trigger that's the hold even Dairy is it can be a stall for people so just get rid of anything besides meat and water even just beef and Lam and water and see how you go um and then also just focus on your health how you feel how you're doing how your energy levels are you know are you coming off medications like that's improving your life that's improving your health you know you can check your blood you can check you know do sort of a deep dive into your hormonal Health maybe your thyroids out of balance maybe your leptin is massively ele elevated maybe there's something else going on um maybe you're not absorbing nutrients and minerals properly and your B12 is in in the ground so you you correct these sorts of things that diet can correct most of the time but sometimes you know it needs a bit of Health especially early on and then you maintain it or you're just parts of your bodies are just not there anymore you have things like pernicious anemia you can't absorb B12 properly you have to get shots you just you've destroyed your thyroid for you know decades and Decades of lowgrade autoimmunity or highgrade autoimmunity and you just need help with your thyroid that happens so you know I would I would follow that in in those sorts of in that sort of way in that order and uh and and also just give it time focus on your health focus on how you're feeling and uh and eventually you'll get through but even if you never lose any weight you will be in Better Health you will feel better you will uh perform better you'll have better energy you'll live longer if you're eating optimally you go back to eating the way you're eating you're going to go back to feeling the way you're feeling you're going to go back to putting on weight right because you're you're going to be doing the same things that got you into the situation that you're in the loose stools that can be a number of things usually people are still drinking coffee tea taking magnesium supplements artificial sweeteners those are the main things things like metformin that can also cause loose stools as well um and people say well I'm drinking the same amount of coffee I was you know before I went carnivore so obviously that's not it no no it can be because now you don't have a whole blockage of fiber clogging up the you know the passages so it can be push things through very quickly um if you're not having any of those if you're only eating meat and water then it could be that you're eating a lot more fat than your body can absorb and you can just pull that back or the alternative side is that you have if you're eating such a low amount of of um fat that you're starting to get little pseudo blockages and you actually get overflow diarrhea it's called spurious diarrhea or overflow diarrhea and so that looks like you have most of the time you have watery stools and then every now and then you have this hard Rocky chunk that comes out you're like Jesus and that was difficult to get out of there and and that's what that is that means you're eating you're way too little fat you need to eat a lot more fat and that would be um much better off so I would give that a try Zeus Wayne thanks for the Super Chat this is one of the the ones that just for some reason didn't show up but um we're up there so thank you very much for the Super Chat uh how often were you sprinting when you felt like you could uh break a world record at a marathon yeah I'm an ultra endurance athlete recently switched to Sprint heavy training protocol and meet I'm improving so much quicker now awesome that's really great to hear so when I was doing that I mean I was I was I mean our main trainings were like Tuesday Thursdays I would have sort of trainings every day with um with um you know with with the college team but like Tuesday Thursday would be the main main one I'd be from like 3:30 to 9:00 9:30 U I was just sprinting the whole time you know with practice and everything I did was as hard as I could go then on the weekends I'd have anywhere I'd have at least two games if not three or even four games because I just wanted to get as much training as possible because that just wasn't enough Fitness for me on the weekend because I wanted every I needed to Sprint more than that and then I would do other other work on other days so quite often I would do um like like boot camp training sort of things where I just be just going like on Mondays and Wednesdays as well so it be sort of like four days a week but like the Tuesdays Thursday it would be for six seven hours and uh and then games on the weekend as well and and yeah just eating meat I just got better and better and better and better and better and then I would do some runs every now and then on my own and like I would be on the the Kirkland Waterfront I'd just be sort of just sprinting up and down from the Waterfront um on Lake Washington Boulevard and it had these mile markers where was like you see like half a mile at a time and so I'd just be running hard it was just like yeah this is easy I'm like okay next next signpost I'm just going to Sprint the next half mile and I would Sprint at just a dead Sprint for half a mile and and then I sort of just run hard the next half mile I was like yeah that was fine I mean I could I could have kept sprinting I could just sprinted the whole mile um and I just sort of played around with that like how long do I want to Sprint I never wore myself out like I could just keep sprinting it was just that's interesting and um so that's how I figured I would just do that I just go back and forth and back and forth I just be just sprinting and doing that and um it was like and I'd be doing sort of like half marathon sort of distances in that sort of wind Sprint sort of pattern where I I was like either running very fast or a dead Sprint and I just literally could not wear myself out I I just wasn't even really breathing hard and I have asthma you know as soon as I get rid of the initial sort of asthma attack and let it rest C take an inhaler just go forever and so yeah so that that's uh that's awesome you should definitely do that I mean training as a sort of as a sprinting protocol I mean you're just going to get better and better and better and you can be just at a dead Sprint and that would be great just to see you go over and just Sprint a marathon just floor it and um and see how you did you know you break a world record you know you gotta you gotta you gotta give me a shout out on the podium all right so that's that's the deal okay um okay I think that I think that we got the ones that we missed okay let me see great okay so uh s thank you very much for the Super Chat let me just see how many I got here okay um I think we've got we got a number of Super chats here um and I've got about um 25 minutes half an hour um so why don't we sort of stop the super chats there and I'll I'll answer all these ones and then um and we'll go from there because I have to I have to had to work after after that s says hi Dr chaffy my friend has paroxysmal nocturnal hypo hemoglobin area a rare blood disease that causes red blood cells to break apart will she benefit from doing keto cornivore diet thanks for all you do that's a good question that that again isn't isn't one that I've come across uh before in the context of Keto carnivore I don't I haven't looked up any if there are any studies on keto um diets and um um but but with with that issue but you can certainly go to like Google Scholar and try to like look that up and see if you can look that up and just put in ketogenic diets with Parable nocturnal hemoglobin area and and see if anyone has done a study on that or if there any like case reports um yeah it's hard to say I mean your body is sort of breaking down your hemoglobin I mean that's that's not what it's supposed to do and so you know presumably if your body's a bit out of out of balance and and you're eating things you're not supposed to eat your body's not working the way it's supposed to work you get these weird sort of issues and that's and that's what we're seeing you know we're seeing people with these strange diseases these strange issues they start eating normally and they just go away so we don't know exactly what's going on there but whatever it is it's working and so I think it's well worth a try and um obviously they're going to improve their health dramatically in so many other ways anyway that if it doesn't help with that issue I mean their lives are going to be better off in any case and that's sort of My Philosophy with any of these issues is is we don't necessarily have data on these things and sometimes we don't even have anecdotal evidence or observational evidence on it but we know that it does help in so many other ways that that's that's just that's just a cold hard fact that either way it's going to help them either way it's going to improve them either way it's going to make their lives better and you know know because we don't have data yet we don't know we don't know that it won't you know it's not like someone's done a study and say yeah that doesn't help with that okay that's something else um you know when people when people are with Huntington's disease go on this it starts improving it you know I I just leave nothing um nothing out as a potential it's like well if that can be helped you know then anything can be help potentially so I would certainly try it and see how you go and if it if it does help please do let know because obviously it's good to gain uh to gather all these these these um these personal experiences from people and get more and more actually you know going back to what I was talking about before in zeroc carb health and zeroing in on health Facebook groups th the great thing about those things they've been around for 15 20 years and so people have been doing carnivore called zero car previously and really improving their health so you can go into a search function there and just go and search and you can search for paroxysmal nocturnal hypog globin hemoglobin area and you can say look that up and you'll find threads and I guarantee you you'll find threats because every question Under the Sun has been asked on those things because been going on for 20 years and so people have come there and asked their questions and if and if it's for some reason you can't find a threat on that then um you know then I would just go and uh ask the group and say hey has anyone dealt with this have they have they found that it improves and I think you'll find at least some people who have had experience in it so I would I would check that out that's a very good resource and for anybody that's that's um interested about about uh you know does it help with certain things carelle thank you so much for the Super Chat have you heard of anything that would help with recovery uh from intis soitis is is is a is a terrible terrible disease it's you know it's an infection of the brain tissue itself so menitis is just an infection of the sacking around the brain keytis is the brain so I mean that's like the worst infection that you can get really so it it often causes very severe damage and and can cause permanent damage and death if it's not treated in time or successfully so the body can recover from a lot of things obviously you can have permanent damage and you can have Damage Done That doesn't recover you know we do have studies on traumatic brain injuries and some um some data on stroke injuries and recovery from stroke injuries but we do have studies on on traumatic brain injuries with ketogenic diets and why is that why is that going to help it well it's going to be a number of things one you're eliminating out a lot of things that are going to be neurotoxic and and impede your brain's ability to function normally and heal itself normally you're also going to be increasing fat animal fat animal proteins and things like that which are going to be used to build rebuild structures of of your brain you're going to go into a state of ketosis where your ketones are going to go up your ketones cross the bloodb brain barrier reconstitute into fatty acids and are used as a physical structure to rebuild your brain after an injury trauma or infection potentially so I would expect that keto carnivore diets would help any neurological recovery from any sort of damage such as a TBI traumatic brain injury or a stroke or even an infection because this is damage and repair and your body's you know got to um you know got to have the building blocks and um and the proper metabolic state to to repair things properly and so I would expect that to be of benefit I can't tell you how much recovery he'll have or if he'll even have any um or that you know they man or woman will have any recovery from in keytis but um there is definitely data out there on other forms of injuries to the brain that can heal and repair better on a ketogenic diet keto carnivore diet I would say ketogenic carnivore diet being being the best example of that because you're also eliminating out other things that are harmful to your body as well besides just carbohydrates besides getting into the proper metabolic state that you should be in a linear Body Work normally so uh hopefully that that helps them um unfortunately there such thing as Damage Done your body can't recover from all injuries um but I've seen some pretty amazing things and some and people get a lot more benefit than they would have otherwise so I think it's definitely worth it uh Dave uh windhammer thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm not seeing a question there but I'll I'll keep an eye out for one Tim W thank you for the Super Chat I have MOG an auto an immune mediated disorder um it causes optic neuritis on steroids for seven months still testing positive had a little relapse of optic of optic nerve Doctor is recommending IVIG want to try carnivore is there anything um is there anything meat I shouldn't eat um you know with any any sort of autoimmune issue or sort of immun mediated issue um I would I would just be very very strict red meat and water that's going to be the best thing for you you know the the monogastrics like you pork and chicken even fish when they're farmed and they're intensively fed and and given a bunch of things that they're not designed to eat their bodies aren't going to work the way they're designed to work they're not going to give have the nutrients they're designed to have they're not going to be able to filter out the toxins that they're supposed to fil that that that you don't want and also their linolic acid levels would be way too high um they won't have the Omega-3s Omega sixes they'll have way too much Omega six is and so for all of those reasons you just want to stick with just red meat and water and I think you probably would get a benefit I have yet to see um you know autoimmune issues that don't improve on a on a red on a red meat and water diet um and I've certainly seen people with optic neuritis improve and um and not have to go on steroids and not have to go on ibig I think is well worth a try and I would just be very very pure very strict red meat and water get everything out of your system uh besides that so no coffee no tea no sweeteners no workout drinks no protein shakes nothing like that just fatty red meat and water and and that's it and um hopefully hopefully that that does the trick and um you know let me know how that goes Mike D thank you for the super chat um he says I have read that the higher the temperature meat is cooked to the lower its nutrient content for this reason is it wise to avoid brisket and beef ribs things cooked up to 190 200 degrees Fahrenheit is raw beef ideal depends because you know we've been we've been yes look if if you're if you're cooking this stuff it does denature some of the proteins and the enzymes and you lose those uh does that mean that you are missing something essential that you that you really can't do without not necessarily um a lot of people cook meat all the way they do very very well cats don't do very well with cooked meat so they they need the raw meat but you know we're we're a little different to cats because we've been cooking meat for at least 800,000 years and so that's 500,000 years half a million years before Homo sapiens ever ever walked the Earth right so that's a long time and um and it's at least 800,000 years some people think this you know 1.5 million years to two million years that we've been you know had had control over fire and we're cooking meat so if that's the case and we've adapted to cooked meat so whatever happens to cooking meat it's probably probably fine at this point since we've been doing it for so long but yes it is true objectively you do lose some of these nutrients like torine or glutamine now you make glutamine you make torine so you have to have them not necessarily you know higher torine um has been shown to be beneficial for you know for Health and Longevity but you have to have it to live no um is it better to have more of it seems to be same with carnitine and and carnosine these sorts of things so I don't think that you need to avoid brisket I don't think you need to not have beef ribs I think that if you if you have a mix of that you should be covering your bases um I don't think you have to have these things I don't think that's necessary for life um because I I don't know of any nutrient essential nutrient that we lose by cooking meat but that doesn't mean that it's optimal um raw meat will have more nutrients and more nutrients um that that aren't denatured but cooking meat actually opens up and makes you know you lose some nutrients but you actually make other nutrients more bioavailable so there's a bit of a TR off there but you know I personally just think you know just eat eat what tastes good to you and um listen to your body for me I just gravitate more and more towards more and more rare meat and just sort of searing the outside basically having it raw on the inside that's my preference at the moment um for you know certain Cuts anyway but I still like brisket and I still like ribs and but I just don't have them all the time but um you know so my my main meal would be less cooked meat but I don't I don't think I don't think that you have to avoid those things no a Watson thanks for the Super Chat thoughts on Stevia or Stevia and green tea yeah I I would avoid it so my my my hard rule for myself and what I think is optimal is no plants or fungus uh no sugar or any sweeteners nothing artificial and that we go for sausa seasonings and drinks as well so tea coffee those are plants so I wouldn't I wouldn't do that um Honey comes from bees that's an animal but it's sugar so I would avoid that Stevia is a sweetener and it's from a plant so I would doubly avoid that um you know we we we get suckered into these ad campaigns they say oh Stevia it's good it's no carbs it's so great it's so it's a it's a random chemical that we've never had in our body so why would we want to put it in there now you know if you haven't been if you haven't been adapting to something you haven't been biologically um you know fit for for uh being exposed to this sort of thing it's not something that you want to do necessarily you know you're you're rolling the dice now there's nothing in meat that's harmful a zebra can eat meat and be fine actually it's very bioavailable so there they're going to be fine but you know a a plant you don't you don't know what these things do so you know if it didn't exist in the last ice ages where our our ancestors were uh and our ancestors weren't eating during the last ice age don't eat it if it didn't even exist as a product you know in the last 100 years definitely don't eat it right if you had to have some sort of chemical Factory involved to make a product really don't eat it so Stevia we don't have much data on this stuff it's brand new right um but there have been studies done in animal so pre-clinical trials and they found that it actually severely affected their their fertility rate and they found that mice they were just had one equivalent of one can of soda a day for a human um with stevia in it they uh drop their fertility rate by 55% right so what the hell is that doing to our body right we're not furnaces we're not combustion engines we there oh this goes in there and it burns and this doesn't have any calories so it doesn't burn that's very foolish um you know people who talk like that really have a fundamental misunderstanding of our biology and biochemistry we are chemical factories not a furnace and so chemicals go in our body and they react and have chemical reactions with other chemicals in our body has nothing to do with heat that escapes when you burn it because nothing is being burned inside of us so you know you need to understand you need to think about in that context you're putting a chemical in your body it's going to have chemical reactions in your body is that a chemical that's supposed to be in your body no it is not so you don't know what's going to happen in there I would bet it's not good and um and in fact in in animal models it seems to to really not be good and so I would I would avoid that uh if I were you uh b car oh thanks for the Super Chat oh good to see you buddy and thanks for the great hangout yesterday yeah it was good so we did a we did a live yesterday that people can check out on my YouTube channel and B carnivore um asked me you know a bunch of questions that were submitted to him and then we sort of answered some some questions toh to everyone else like we're doing now um lelu thanks for the Super Chat I suffer from neck and head pain from concussion four years ago want to try carnivore but react to it uh like from other trigger foods like Dairy sweets fruits every time I eat it I inan a lot of pain I'm really sorry to hear that um it actually is really good for recovering from head injuries like TBI um obviously the earlier you get on it you know closer to the to the injury um the better able it is to help you recover but I I still think there's there's definitely room for improvement even even four years down the road I mean I've seen people recover from Strokes 30 years down the road which is just wild um so again I just don't discount anything at this point I just wait and see how how it goes um but you know just try eating the meat that you can you know if you have different meats that that are okay that you can tolerate just just ease into it slowly just try different Meats the main thing about carnivore diet is you're just not eating the other things and so not eating things you know like carbs and fruit and vegetables and things like that that hopefully shouldn't cause a reaction if it is then that's likely to be a withdrawal and you can withdraw from sugar and you can get you know headaches and you can feel pretty rotten from that um but that goes away same thing with caffeine and so sometimes it can be a withdrawal mechanism uh because you know not eating something that you're not supposed to eat anyway shouldn't cause pain unless it's unless it's a withdrawal so just try eating the meat that doesn't give you a problem that you can tolerate it feels good to you and just really work on avoiding the other things especially the carbohydrates and sugars and things like that because you know that's going to be the best thing to do to get um to get uh more recovery and then eventually you can sort of work your way down to just getting a meat only and I I would hope that that would help your situation and I hope it does oh it's very sweet so is my my little elmarie uh said hello so hello uh thank you for all you do to help others we all love and appreciate you you're my favorite carnivore guy well thank you you're my favorite carnivore girl very sweet and fatty fatty carnivore uh thanks for the Super Chat also guys I I really um can't do many more questions so please don't don't do any more Super chats because um I might have to not be able to answer them uh but if that happens I'll try to I'll try to answer them in the comments uh later on but please don't please don't do it because I I I really do need to go in sort of five 10 minutes um never diagnosed with diabetes recently A1C 5.7 and got a glucose meter morning uh 99 to 1114 fasting uh 90 to 108 one hour after meals 92 to 104 a lot of grief lately taking iodine for Hashimoto I keep having um two to lower thyroid meds since going carnivore well that's great that you're lowering your your thyroid meds that's that's exactly what we like to see is that pimo is improving U be careful taking iodine with Hashimoto because that can actually trigger and worsen Hashimoto so that should be under doctor's supervision if you have normal iodine levels General recommendation is not to take iodine um I don't think your your your blood sugars are are that off you know if you're very stressed you had a lot of grief lately your cortisol is going to be up that's going to explain that I would just work on calming down centering yourself focusing on your health focusing on the things that you need to focus on and don't get too stressed out about your blood sugar those blood sugars are fine A1C is 5.7 look that's not it's not a big deal your body is is recovering from a lot of things just give it time and give yourself peace you're doing great everything's going great your thyroids improving and uh and and you're improving in other ways so I would just focus on that focus on your health and focus on getting through uh your issues with grief and um hopefully getting to a better place and I think everything will settle down uh once you do and I'm very sorry to hear about um uh that that things have been hard recently oh J Park thank you for the Super Chat not seeing a question um I'll I'll keep an eye out for it but um yeah it's really it's really a shame when that happens because sometimes I don't I don't I don't see the the questions down in the chat so I'll do my best uh loves okay um thank you for the Super Chat don't think I can say that name out loud but almost one year keto 95% carnivore lost uh 70 70 pounds quit drinking quit smoking 41 years old six foot uh 215 pounds with 30inch waist blood pressure uh so first of all fantastic job that's absolutely excellent uh quitting smoking quitting drinking on top of everything is just amazing you've lost 70 pounds so that that's fantastic uh so really well done with that um BP still always high average 160 over 95 no caffeine for the last four months to previous heart attack at 38 years old 98% RCA blockage so high blood pressure there can be different reasons for high blood pressure um keto carnivore diets can help them a lot of times it has to do with insulin resistance and high insulin levels and that's going to improve dramatically doing what you're doing and after a year you would expect your insulin levels to be pretty pretty low and insulin resistance to have corrected so there might be something else so there are and especially at 41 that's pretty young um to be having um blood pressure issues that that aren't really controllable so I would talk to your doctor generally you have to do a number of Investigations for heart um blood pressure that's really not correcting um and so you you check for these sorts of things like f chromy Tomas and different sorts of you know weird wild wonderful things that that do show up occasionally um so I would definitely get if you haven't been checked out for those I would definitely get checked out for those and I I would go on blood pressure medication in the meantime anyway because you don't want this chronically high blood pressure because that can cause its own problems but I would certainly investigate that as well uh here we go from J Park uh thank you for the for the super chat again what are your thoughts on raw dairy aside from the appetite issue raw dairy seems to have a lot of health benefits making raw milk yogurt at home seems to help my energy and chronic allergies yeah look it has a ton of of benefits and nutrients and if you're coming from a nutrient deprived state or you're you're sort of eating a nutrient deprived diet adding in raw milk is going to help and do wonders Weston Price found that you know the places that had had uh nutritional deficiencies you could correct most of them by giving them raw milk so it is definitely very good and very healthy um in that regard it has a lot of nutrients um the carbs I think are a problem it has enough carbohydrates has enough lactose it's it can cause a problem so I would be mindful of that making raw yogurt is different because you're you're fermenting it you're putting bacteria in that and that's going to eat the carbohydrates or or should anyway so a lot of a lot of these things will not really have any lactose left because the bacteria will eat it all so that's different um and if you find that that helps you then uh great I would go for that I wouldn't really do un uh fermented dairy though you know or or things that had lactose in it because obviously cheese is generally okay um and if you respond well to that then that's great um generally if you if you are going to eat yogurt with the bacteria in it eat it put it on meat chew it together swallow it in the same bite that helps get that bacteria down into your gut and helps your microbiome as well so if you're going to have uh you know the dairy in that and that you have it in that way and that can help you further with your microbiome and yeah good luck if that makes you feel good then then go for it that's the idea Vib 714 thanks for the Super Chat suggestions on getting the willpower to avoid carbs and sugar yeah so you know quite often these can be from Hunger this be from addiction to Sugar because it is addictive And So It generally is about two weeks you know so there is a light at the end of the tunnel it's just about two weeks and um sometimes it's your brain telling you that you're hungry you should eat something so eat meat eat fatty meat it's very satiating if you eat until it stops tasting good often you just you have no interest in the sugar like got some there but no I'm not doing that because you're very satisfied you're very satiated so if you're getting Cravings if you're getting carb Cravings sugar Cravings maybe think am I hungry try eating meat you want to eat enough meat uh you know Dr sha baker said once people say how much should I eat and he said eat enough that you don't get cravings and uh I think that's pretty good especially in the first two weeks generally if you're eating until meat stops tasting good you know that's that's where you'll be so you have to relearn your hunger signals you have to relearn how much your body wants I think a good measure of that is by taste if it tastes good your body wants it once it stops tasting good your body's fine and that will generally suppress the cravings and after about two weeks that goes away unless you're undereating and then your brain's just telling you eat something and so eat something but eat meat and those Cravings usually go away and so yeah good luck with that and remember two weeks it's not that long and um and just eat a lot of fatty meat and those Cravings will be suppressed and then they'll pretty much go away after two weeks all right good luck with that Dave windhammer um there we go so thank you again for the Super Chat 59 years old 14 days on Carnivore uh down 14 pounds very good uh on mopol 50 milligrams twice a day uh fide 100 milligrams once and aorist Statin 40 milligrams once my blood pressure went from 127 to 98 over 56 feeling great just worried uh skipped one Metro at night yeah look you need to work with your doctor uh to um about your blood pressure I don't know why you're on the metop could be for a fib or could just be for blood pressure but either way your blood pressure issues are going to resolve most of them do you gentleman before seems to have some stubborn ones which is why I think you should investigate that because a lot of people will be like uh Dave here who uh improves their their blood pressure quite dramatically you know and drops uh you know 30 points in two weeks so um quite often that's what we see and so you need to work with your doctor on on reducing that dose or coming on some other medication that that doesn't quite drop you too low because you can get laded you can get dizzy you can stand up and go lightheaded and you can fall over because your blood pressure drops too low so um yeah so if if your if your blood pressure is going lower and lower and lower you need to take less medications so work with your doctor on that get a game plan on what you should change to what you should go down to and how you should change it how you should address it but yeah if your blood pressure is too low if your blood pressure is 98 over 56 you should be very cautious about taking any blood pressure medication at that point because you will likely drop too low so uh be very careful with that but yeah most people will come off their blood pressure medication metool is prescribed for other things besides blood pressure as well so you know there may be something else that your doctor needs you on that for and so they need to they need to figure out what they can put you on that's not going to drop your blood pressure too low so I would I would getting to see them uh soon and yes don't take too much medication that you're going to cause an accident Adele eats to live very good good advice um I missed your Super Chat as well damn it uh where the hell was that let me see see if I can go back where are all these things I don't know why these things things didn't didn't show up um from Roman I am not seeing it where is it I'm really not seen this I don't know what happened [Music] um well if you can if you can put your your question just in the normal chat um I'll try and I'll try and see it um there just one more Super Chat and then I was going to go um but if you put your your message up now so I can see it now I'll try to I'll try to get you because I'm just not seeing it in the uh in the super chats that's really weird yeah I just don't I don't I don't I don't see it at all down needs I'm really not seeing it yeah I don't know what's going on maybe just put it in uh put it in the messages now and um and uh and hopefully I can I can find it and maybe someone can point it out to me uh we can go from there but um okay yeah very sorry about that um okay so here's the question from s followup question quick PubMed search paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobin nuura p& is a very rare clonal autoimmune disease manifesting with hemalis thr thrombosis or bone marrow failure carnivore seems to help autoimmune diseases it does and so um I I've yet to see an autoimmune issue that doesn't respond very well so very strict red meat and water and nothing else and I would I would be willing to bet money that that that improves so well that's good yeah good um interesting there um yeah I don't know if if you search in for you know Pub Med uh with that and ketogenic diets to see if that's helped anything but if it's an autoimmune issue I would expect it to to get better I mean you know eventually it's G to it's going to run into the exception but I haven't seen it yet I have yet to see an exception to that rule that um that uh there's any sort of problems with um or or it that it doesn't sort of improve on that because it just every autoimmune issue I've ever seen does okay let's see um here we go thank you very much uh Melissa for for for grabbing that question so question from Adele eats to live um my fiance went under anesthesia on um September I'm assuming September 7th and has since uh that same and has since that same night had light and sound sensitive panic attacks anxiety attacks and brain fog oh very very strange um H well that's a very severe reaction generally reactions to um generally reactions to um anesthesia usually wears off it usually doesn't persist for for months that's very strange MRI MRA EEG and CT scan normal and all Labs normal that is very strange U presumably this is being investigated by their doctors but I haven't I haven't really heard of that um obviously you know correcting diet and things like that is something that can just help in general um does help with anxiety but you know that's not that's not something that's really common enough to know what to do about it um or if it can you know what what can really help with it but I'm very sorry to hear that um because that's that's that's very troubling you know it could be that this sort of triggered something that was underlying and then you just try to optimize his health as much as possible um and and hopefully that helps um and they said they don't okay yeah so they said they they basically said they basically it's psychological um and so see a psychiatrist and the neurologist didn't want anything to do with it look that happens you know if if they if they can't find an organic problem they say look we we can't we don't know this seems to be some sort of psychological issue that doesn't mean that that it's all in his head and then he's making it up it's it's a mental health issue as opposed to neurological issue but all these mental health issues like anxiety and depression schizophrenia OCD bipolar ADHD even autism are helped by ketogenic carnivore diets so definitely worth the effort to see if that can rebalance and reboot uh his system and get him back on track and that's what I would try um and the psych diagnosed him with post-operative neurocognitive disorder I I don't even know what that is um uh so obviously that's something sort of in their in their Bailey Wick I don't know what their treatment for that is if it's just sort of the normal treatments for anxiety and and depression which are generally similar uh pharmacologically but I would definitely try the dietary methods and and fix his metabolism and um and hopefully that can that can sort things out because obviously the doctors don't don't have any other Solutions so you might as well might as well try this one it'll help them in other ways as well and it helps a lot of people with anxiety and so you know if if it's triggered by this it's still happening you don't know what it is but you know can have some damage to mitochondria or neural connectivity and some sort of functionality in the brain that optimal diet can help so hopefully that uh that works and that helps with them we certainly have a lot of clinical data showing that that um uh that anxiety depression other mental health issues can improve and generally do improve with keto cornivore diet so I would I would definitely uh I would definitely give that a shot okay thank you very much everyone uh I really appreciate you guys coming on and submitting the questions and thank you everyone for the super chats it's very kind of you and uh good luck to everyone good luck to you Adele and to your husband hopefully he he recovers soon and hopefully the uh the cornivore diet helps um and oh good God Jesus okay it's last one guys Stephen uh question not carival related but what does the literature say on exercising at night before sleep or am versus the day uh thank you I've shared the content to dozens of people I'm actually not too sure about that um a lot of people say that that exercising in the morning does better because you're basically in a keto state of ketosis and and fasting and that you can burn fat better so that's generally the argument but if you're in a on a cornivore diet you're always in that metabolic State anyway so it doesn't really matter I work out at night all the time I feel great with doing it um Dr John jqu is is more of an expert in the exercise physiology side of things so he might have something on that as well so I would uh maybe check on um on his his pages and see if he has something on that okay really have to go now guys thank you all and I'll see you guys on Sunday what time Sunday at call it well I'll figure it out anyway Sunday afternoon early evening uh for for my next um YouTube premiere of my next uh uh release of the episode and I'll I'll be chatting live with everyone so if everyone can make that to the premiere and hit like and share it around it really helps the algorithm say like oh this is something people are interested in and um and gets it out there so that would be great thank you everyone really appreciate it and I will see you next time"
