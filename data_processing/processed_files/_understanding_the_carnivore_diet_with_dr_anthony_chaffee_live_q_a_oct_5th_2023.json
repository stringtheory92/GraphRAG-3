there is one there we go question uh thank you doc um bil 61y old male 160 lbs 5'10 diagnosed with hernia scoliosis idus headache chiropractor says tinius and headache caused by scoliosis don't know why that would be except that maybe that's something that he can charge you for um scoliosis in C1 and C2 chiropractor also says uh must be very low fat due to um time 2 apoe4 well I don't well the thing is is is that is that he he may be able to look into things very well but that's certainly not part of chiropractic training is is going into that level of um of uh of medical issues and with your apoe genes uh either either way you can just you can just look at this from a um first principles point of view which is that regardless of your particular genetic dissimilarities or or particular uh particularities you're still a human being and as a human being you still have uh an evolved species specific or designed human diet that is optimal for you as it's optimal for every everyone else doesn't matter what the genetic variations in a dolphin are they all eat what dolphins eat lions eat what lions eat giraffes eat what giraffes eat koalas eat what koalas eat and humans should eat what humans should eat now you can go outside of that and maybe some Gene variations make it easier and safer to go outside of that but that does not change what is optimal for any species that is a law of biology and that is something that in this whole argument and discussion of nutrition has been very much lost we have we have completely walked away from the fundamental realities of biology and people who claim to be biologists who claim to have degrees in biology have completely written off biology and that's wrong that is the underlying scientific structure that we are working on and so if you have any sort of studies that disagree with some of these immutable laws of of biology they're wrong they're flat out wrong Einstein knew this when he proved something mathematically or thought he did and then he looked and say yeah this disagrees with this or that and you experiment with it and go like yep that's not what we're seeing he threw it out because he was smarter than that he was smarter than his own you know arrogance and so you know someone says no no but this proves this that and the other if it goes against fundamental reality and The observed phenomena it's wrong um so you know humans are humans we have an we have a a biologically appropriate diet that is optimal for everyone because that's how it works if you have a different optimal diet you're a different species period and and that goes for us too Idis is generally from inflammation of the auditory nerves in your head they have nothing to do with your neck that's not where those nerves are those nerves come off uh sort of the the the um brain stem towards that area but not of that joint uh of the c1c2 level okay it's up from that so on your brain stem has nothing to do with a kink in your neck has to do with inflammation in uh in that nerve generally or damage to that nerve and quite often people going on a k keto carnivore diet really carnivore diet is is best you reduce the inflammation and the idus improves a lot of people's idus improves there are different causes of idus if you're having if you have actual damage to the nerve for one whatever reason then maybe not if you have some sort of structure inside your head pushing on that nerve irritating that nerve that's that's going to cause a problem too and diet may or may not actually be able to help that however a lot of these just come from inflammation of that nerve have nothing to do with uh what he's trying to sell you and um so you know I I know a lot of chiropractors who who don't do that sort of thing but there are chiropractors who just try to upsell people and that's part of the business model that they're sold I have I have a lot of friends who are Chiro actors and they are really really really heavily impressed upon them in school the the business model side of this and and how to make return customers and patients and basically convince them that they have to be seen three days a week for the rest of their life or they're just they're just going to fall apart you know if you had a doctor that said that if I said that to you and and you said oh doc you know have this chest infection and I I'm not really feeling well and I'd say oh yeah this is crazy you're GNA have to come to me and I'm G to have to slap you in your back and do some PT sort of exercises with you and try to get this gunk out three days a week basically until you die you know or else this is just you know you're always going to have this infection it's never going to go away it's like okay you're going to go to another Doctor Who maybe knows what the hell they're talking about so if you have a problem and they can't fix it if they can't say hey here's the treatment and here's the resolution this is this is when we're going to get resolution oh yeah no you just have to do this forever this this a chronic condition that you're going to have for life you know maybe get a second opinion and um and I wouldn't I wouldn't listen to him about app oe4 because that's a that's not his specialty and it's probably an appropriate for him to be speaking about that whether or not he's actually looked into it privately professionally he's not actually licensed to talk about that I don't I wouldn't think and also he's wrong right you're still human and um humans eat humans eat or they're supposed to anyway and question from Joseph any studies you know of uh that show if cornivore helps with cluster migraines or intentional Tremors um what are your thoughts on keto Chow mineral supplement thanks for all you do well thank you very much for the"

        "body": "question from Laura Smith thank you very much for the question from Laura Smith thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm brand new to carnivore anything in particular I should be mindful of as I start out well just e it's very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet so you want to eat as much as you can and you need to eat enough fat as well it's going to be a lot more fat than you've ever eaten in your entire life most likely and so it's going to feel very strange but you you need the fat okay so get very fat fatty Cuts Like a ribeye or Scotch filet and brisket those sorts of things are very fatty that's what you want that's a level of fat that you want that's not going to make you fat that's not going to make you sick that's not going to cause heart disease those are going to make those are very important nutrients That's essential nutrition to the human body and brain especially the fat and the brain so eat enough keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good that's how you know because your hunger signals are going to be very different it which is why it's easy to undereat because you just don't know how much you're supposed to have because it you feel fine all the time and then it's as important what not to eat as what to eat so my hard rule for myself is no plants or fungus no sugar or any sweeteners nothing artificial that goes for sauces seasonings and drinks as well so you look on the ingredients and there's more than just meat don't get it right if you want to be as good as you can be right and red meat for for the best of best results um and then just you need to throw yourself into um sort of educational uh settings for for this so you know going on my YouTube channel watching things like this that's excellent going on my YouTube channel go to my playlist called getting started on a carnivore diet and then working your way through those videos and some of them are like carnivore for beginners uh things on fiber uh frequently asked questions about 97% of the issues that people run into or the questions that they have are generally answered in those three uh videos and then it's really important to watch the other videos on on the why this is a good idea and not just how to do it because if you know and understand you know the evidence behind this and the arguments and the logical reasoning behind this and seeing how people are succeeding then you are much more likely to make this a lifestyle and a LIF and and a lifelong change because that's what this is this is not a crash diet this is not something you do just to just to drop some weight really quickly but then you have to get away from it because it's not healthy this is the this is optimal nutrition for human beings and it's very important that if people want to live optimally live the the most healthy happy and longest life that they eat to their biological design that's how we're designed right and there's an immutable of biology which is that of adaptation what we have been adapting to for millions of years which is meat is what we're optimized for and so eating something that didn't exist a 100 years ago or thousand years ago or we didn't start eating until 10,000 years ago we don't have much time to adapt to that and so we're not as adapted to that as we are to meat and there's not really much you need to adapt to with meat there's there are no actual harmful chemicals in meat there are harmful chemicals in plants that you have to be adapted to which we are not and especially different populations such as Australian aboriginals or Native Americans or subsaharan Africans and others who did not have access to cultivation and agriculture as long as other populations have they are less adapted even less adapted because they've only been introduced very recently so they've had couple hundred years to become adapted to this garbage doesn't work so it's not going to it's going to be even worse for them so um that's what I would do really immerse yourself in uh understanding why this is a is a good thing I the first video I ever did I still think it's one of one of my favorites uh the facts about carnivore and vegan diets it just goes through the arguments you know for and against both uh both cases saying oh we should be vegan okay well here are the arguments that they make here are the arguments they make against eating meat let's go through them and so it's 44 minutes and I think it's it's as it's as succinct as it can possibly be to cover the most material and then I have other videos like why we are carnivores plants are trying to kill you um and so on and ones with with Dr Peter baller um looking at the environmental impacts and actually the the benefits that we get from livestock Agriculture and that covers really all the Gambit of um of why the we should do this and and the detractions when people say no no you can't do this or my one on cholesterol the truth about cholesterol and heart disease just goes through the facts the history the science this was a scapegoat you know that people scapegoated uh cholesterol to try to protect their vested interest in Sugar there sugar companies paying these people off they did not tell people they were paying people off it's a con it's a fraud these people were frauds and whether or not you know people like anel Keys ever did good work in their past I'm sure they did that's how they had clout to sell right um and those Harvard professors same thing their cons their frauds and their their just garbage humans that they would do this at all and and uh and really try to hurt the world whether knowingly or unknowingly they cause huge huge serious harm and suffering and people to die decades early and suffer throughout that time it's actually really sick and um I have no idea what their intentions motivations or feelings were to that or if they even understood just how bad they made the world but they did you know they they caused huge amounts of human suffering probably on a grander scale than any other dictator like Stalin and Mau and Hitler and all these sorts of people I mean you're talking about hundreds of millions of people billions of people that have been affected by this terrible terrible fraud fraud that was perpetrated on people so understanding that understanding the history understanding the actual science the actual evidence is really important and so that's what I would suggest uh"

        "body": "ng with that Franc Lael uh thank you very much for the ng with that Franc Lael uh thank you very much for the super chat again hello Dr chaffy uh carnivore since August 11th sometimes my husband feels dizzy he lost 40 lbs fantastic high blood pressure cup of coffee per day he eats red meat eggs bacon what do you think is causing his diziness could be a lot of things first thing that pops into my head is um blood pressure medications so if he's on blood pressure medications and his need for them goes down he's going to get low blood pressure especially when he stands up so you can get uh postural hypotension so you're sitting down everything's fine then you sort of stand up you know everyone gets this when they stand up too quickly sometimes oh bit lightheaded this will happen to him if he's getting drops in his blood pressure consistently because he's on too much medication he'll get that experience consistently because your blood pressure changes when you stand up or when you lay when you're laying down and you sit up and you go from sit up to stand up you get a you get a a temporary drop in your blood pressure and and your body normally corrects this pretty quickly but if it doesn't correct this then you're going to get a bit less blood to your brain uh that your brain needs and you sort of go I feel fuzzy I feel dizzy sit back down first of all um you know sit down before you fall down as they say um but that that would make me suspicious that he's on too much medication and so what you do is you just come off the medication and or or at least reduce the amount of medication that that he's on working with his doctor so that's first of all second of all is dehydration you're not getting enough water most people aren't getting enough water um very few people like if the because if he's off all his blood pressure medication okay then you have to look at other things maybe he's dehydrated they could be dehydrated and on too much medication and U and and some people will actually get a bit of low blood pressure because they're dehydrated actually electrolytes may help in this case because that can sort of help your body retain a bit of water right and so that can that can help sort of bolster your blood pressure but most people can do it with just most more water if he has high blood pressure he's going to be on medications if he's on too much medication he's going to be on his blood pressure is going to be too low so check the blood pressure a couple times a day certainly whenever he feels dizzy and if he's getting that dizziness when he's standing up almost certainly that's what's going on work with his doctor to reduce the amount of blood pressure medication because hey that's great he he's not he doesn't need as much uh medication that is very normal people going on carnivores that they don't have as much of a demand for their blood pressure medication so I would do that um black coffee just so you know most black coffee especially if it's like a French Press um not filtered not going through a paper filter they will spike your blood pressure too so if you're you're sort of playing these games where you're spiking your blood pressure and dropping your blood pressure and doing all these sorts of things you're going to have imbalances right you take that coffee raises your blood pressure that's Bal counterbalanced by the blood pressure medication then the coffee sort of wears out of your system now the blood pressure medication is too much and now you feel dizzy and laded so um try to eliminate out as many confounding factors as possible coffee being one of them if it's if it's filtered oh hey buddy I'm going to v a little visitor um if it's filtered it usually takes out those what's called rancid oils in coffee that that uh cause those blood pressure issues question from gem 5252 uh will the line diet help the autoimmune uh light and sclerosis uh and can it rebalance the gut microbiome without the use of sauerkraut and probiotics thank you uh it can rebalance your um guy come here it can rebalance your microbiome you look at the the Inuit they have fantastic microbiomes and um and that that can be us right um the the ferments I mean those those ferments are I don't you don't need probiotics right um ferments are probiotics you certainly don't need commercial probiotics lot of them have sugar and sweeteners and all that sort of garbage which actually promote the growth of the wrong gut bacteria as well and ill health um so uh don't don't use those there's actually a study just came out recently showing that they don't help to actually make things worse probably because of the sugar and the sweeteners promoting the wrong kind of gut bacteria um but I haven't read the study uh but that would be my guess um you can use fermented uh animal products you can have you know a bit of fermented dairy um live Culture Yogurt you know you take that mix that in with meat you chew them together and and swallow them together that gets the bacteria sort of past the danger zone in your stomach and and first part of your dadum and it gets out down further down into your colon and so on that that have they're actually supposed to have bacteria and so so that's what you can do but no just just eating meat you're going to be fine some people they're having gut issues or whatever they may need to address this and have some you know some some fermented dairy or something like that some people do use fermented plants as well um and just for the microbiome aspect of it I think you probably I I don't think you need that um if if you do need anything just just the fermented dairy I'm sure would be fine as to the the lyan sclerosis um that's not one that I've treated directly or or seen too many people talking about online uh but I would expect so because I I've yet to see an autoimmune condition that doesn't respond extraordinarily well to a carnivore diet and that's just because you're you're you're not introducing the things into your body that your body's reacting to and and attacking with antibodies to begin with and those and now you don't have cross reaction with those antibodies in your body and I would expect it to be the same uh for for that as well um one thing can do you go to some of the older Facebook groups for carnivore usually be called zero carb so zeroing in on health zero carb Health those are two great uh platforms they're very strict which is why I like them because there's no effing around and uh you know people are just like hey this is this is how you do this is how people have done it who have succeeded the most and this are more most likely to succeed this is the model and oh well you can do this you can have that that save for another group this is this is for people that are that are really want to do it as as as well as possible and um and I like that and I like the people that uh that started it like Dana and Charles Washington on the respective platforms but anyway they have a great search function because they've been a they've been there forever and so you search in there you search for for that or your particular condition it has been discussed someone has had it they have experience with it most commonly it gets better and so I would expect that with the with the autoimmune issue um but you can you can just check you just check and see uh if anyone else has ha s had an experience with that bod XO thank you for the"

        "body": "s had an experience with that bod XO thank you for the s had an experience with that bod XO thank you for the Super Chat are big Pharma and Medicine intentionally doing this to the population to make them easier to control Greek and Egyptian texts said give slaves grain yeah hard to say but it is it is pretty reminiscent of all these things like the Greeks and Egyptians and you know Romans had you know they gave their slaves and their Gladiators is the argument of the game changers oh the Gladiators ate a lot of grain yeah because they were slaves and they were fat and they actually ate grains they were called The Grain eaters in fact I learned that uh in in in my classic uh studies in college uh they were called grain eaters that was because they wanted to get fat they wanted to get put on extra fat because that was like armor right because if you're very lean and Slim Right 2in cut in 2in stab in three inches and hit a major organ major vessel you're done uh you've got five six inches of fat on you that's protection you get a 2inch 3inch stab yeah it'll bleed but you're not hitting any major organs or vessels right so it's protection it's body armor right um You can make an argument Maybe you're fat and sick and and not moving as fast as you would and you have a bigger Target to hit could be but you know we do know this with like cats you know like I I have a hairless cat can't let them outside because they'll just get their asses handed to them by other cats who have a big old mat of fur that's that's protection to them they don't have that protection you know so you go after a cat and you just biting fluff you know doesn't help you whereas if you're seeing the skin you know exactly where to buite to get a chunk out of someone right and you don't have any any little defenses so that was the same with with the Gladiators but you know different different um Imperial Powers have subjugated and kept people in check the surf class the peasant class the plebeians kept them in check by giving them a bunch of grains and cutting off the meat Supply that that that's a tactic old as time and or as old as civilization anyway and I don't know I don't know the intentions of big farmer and big and big medicine I I do know that most doctors certainly don't prescribe to that and would have no idea that that's even something that is is in the possibilities um but I do think that they're trying to profit and their profit model is is uh is such that it benefits them for us to be sick perpetually so that they can sell us chronic treatments okay so there's a Goldman Sachs uh memo that went out or or you know meeting that they that they talked about and it just said you know is curing disease a viable business model you know should we be curing these or should we be looking at treatments for chronic conditions that will never go away so we spend a billion dollars developing a drug and this is something that people have to take for 40 years 50 years 60 years and in a large population so looking at it like an isol actually curing something that goes away you can only treat them once this you treat them for 40 years right and so that's what they're going to dedicate their money and resources to right they're not going to try to cure something they're going to try to treat something and they're going to look at things that are prevalent throughout the population that have a you know high impact and is something that is a chronic condition it's not like antibiotics I mean there hasn't been a new antibiotics I think in 30 years something like that uh more than that it's um yeah God knows I mean they they they just don't or a new class of them anyway I mean there it's it's been a long time since people have looked into actually treating infectious disease right even though we've got super bugs uh coming up out all over the place that's not what people are looking at they're looking at diabetes and heart disease and blood pressure and and cholesterol and saying hey how can how can I give this someone a pill you give them a course of antibiotics that's done in in a week or two right but this person needs a Statin forever right and that's what they say you know if you if you um uh if you if you listen to some of these people the age and the and the threshold for when you start on blood pressure medication or when you start on statins is getting lower and lower and lower and lower and this is of course to sell more products because you can sell it to more people and you know they're saying anyone over 50 just because of your age you should be on a Statin and now they're saying over over 40 and now people are saying well basically you should just be on a Statin for your whole life you should just never let this stuff build up that is insane your body is cholesterol your brain is cholesterol and some of these things cross into the bloodb brain barrier and stop your brain from making cholesterol which is about 20% of the physical structure of matter in your brain and the axon myelination is partly cholesterol it's like I don't know 50% cholesterol something like that it's it's high levels of cholesterol and your brain makes cholesterol these drugs can stop your brain from making cholesterol and now you don't have the physical building blocks and structures to build your brain you give that to a kid whose brain is developing you are going to prevent proper development that is sick that is absolutely I mean that's that's going going to Alis huxley's Brave New World where they're they're intentionally dumbing down certain uh members of the population in order to have them do these menial jobs that the alphas don't want to do and make it and make it easier for them to just you know have a hedonistic life and and not work too hard um that's God knows who's intentionally doing what but that's going to be the result you are going to you're going to seriously damage and affect the intellect and and mental development of of of kids and Adolescence and and adults because that's you're constantly remodeling your brain you still need cholesterol as an adult as a late adult you need cholesterol there are case reports of people getting dementia from these different statins that cross a bloodb brain barrier right that's not okay right so I don't know if that's their intention I don't I I do know their intention is to make money and I and they have already figured out that you don't want to cure disease I mean Chris Rock called this in the 90s you know one of his uh one of his big tours um I used to listen to it with my buddy Jonathan going to to France with we listen do all the time it's hilarious and and and we thought it was a joke but he was bang on said they don't want to cure diseases they want to treat diseases so you can treat them your whole life you know they're still pissed off they cured polio right and know everyone laughs but like that's exactly what they're saying they're saying we don't want to treat it that's not a viable business model we want we don't want to cure it we want to treat it for a prolong period of time that's what's happening so that's their business model now it could be that they're nefarious and could be some like the the the pharmaceutical executive I believe it was c means but it could have been someone else who sort of said there's a there was a a conversation with a pharmaceutical executive and they said and and he asked do you know what my favorite drug is that that our company produces and they go oh you know what's that something cancer and helps children or something like that no my favorite medication that we make are medications that c side effects that we have medications that treat those are my favorite because we sell more product right you get down these prescription Cascades you have these bad side effects you get medications for that side effects that causes other side effects you get medications for that side effect right and and you hear this you're not supposed to go down that route as a doctor you're supposed to I mean that was taught to us early on in medical schools like don't go down that you know don't go down this prescribing Cascade address the first one say okay what can we change here to make it so you don't have that problem in the first place hey buddy and um and I talked to people and they're like hey I was taking this drug or whatever and it made me feel very sick and so I stopped taking it um like a Statin um in particular I was talking to someone the other day about that and they're doctor said oh well we could have I could have just given you something for that I could have given you something for it's like damn it no so there are people there they have that's their business model they want to sell you drugs they want to sell you drugs for as long as possible they and and and you know people have always wanted to be in power they've always wanted to be oligarchs they've always wanted to be the aristocracy they've all and what does that mean that means other people have to be the Surfs they have to be the plebians that means you me we are the plebians we are the masses we are the Surfs you read uh um um frederck kayak's book The Road to surum you you will see all of this he calls this he said 20 years before you get the totalitarian regime where people are now surfs again they're all uh you know they're now U beholding you know slaves bound to the land um you know you get certain things that happen and and they're predictable and so you we are seeing this stuff in full force at the moment so um you never know I mean the people at the WF they are almost certainly doing this this stuff intentionally they they've basically almost said that in a lot of in a lot of ways you know like we need to make people allergic to meet so that we can force them to do what we want I mean the these are these are Hitlers these are the next these are the ne this Generations Hitler exactly what they are this is what Hitler did right uh some of the things that Hitler did and it started here and it ended in genocide so you know how about let's not you know how about let's stop before we get to the genocide side p art that would be my vote uh Giovani thank you for the"

maybe I'm eating grass-fed Burger ribeye and a little bacon is that enough fat daily um well depends on how lean your your grass-fed Burger is but it should be fine um if it tastes good to you and you're feeling well great watch my video uh called you don't need fiber and parenthesis fiber constipation and diet that will and also getting started on a carnivore diet I talk about how to sort of gauge how much fat you're getting goes by your stools if you're not drinking coffee not using artificial sweeteners or other sort of laxativ because those are laxativ te is as well then uh you can you can look at your stools your body has a limited capacity to absorb fat and so once you've reach that threshold it actually goes out it gets excreted and so that's fine and so that little bit of excess fat is what keeps your stool soft so if you have soft normal stools even if it's only once a week you're not constipated you're getting enough fat that's fine if you're getting dry hard constipated stools that's constipation not frequency but but the the consistency texture of your of your stools that's constipation then you uh are then you are not eating enough fat so if you're eating that much you're not drinking coffee you're not drinking tea you're not using artificial sweeteners which are all going to move things too fast and you're not GNA be able to to tell you're not going to be a good test then um and you're constipated then you're and yes you are you need to eat more fat if it's normal and soft you're doing just fine so that's what I would go by everyone's going to be a little bit different so sounds like a decent amount of fat depending on on the amount of um fat in the burger which is often too lean but um you check with your with your stools oh I already did that one um did that one again okay so font Freud one I'm gonna guess uh the question is I get out of ketosis when I drink broth made with bonees so frustrating how is this possible depends on what's in the broth I wouldn't worry too much about it just don't drink it uh if you don't want to so a lot of people don't um drink broth if you want it every now and then as just a bit a sort of a warm drink that's fine but it it can sometimes make it so you you don't eat as much meat as you want and you're not getting all those nutrients think about it this way our taste and the good taste good flavor comes from our body saying we want that nutrient with sugar being an outlier because sugar is a drug and we recognize it is safe and something we can eat and not die that day and survive so that being an outlier push that to the side when meat and animal products taste good milk is always going to taste good because again sugar but again push that to the side the um those are the nutrients your body is saying hey we want these nutrients okay and they taste better the more your body wants those nutrients and you have negative feedback so the more you have the less good they taste until they don't taste good at all and you just say okay I'm going to stop eating so you get nutrients from bone broth you get nutrients from that beef broth and it tastes good but when you don't need as much of those nutrients they don't taste as good and so what is that going to do when you eat a steak well the nutrients in there that you want are going to taste good and the nutrients that you already have enough of not going to taste as good and so meat's not going to taste as good the steak's not going to taste is good potentially this is all Theory but that's sort of the way I think about it but this is a phenomenon that people have noticed that if they drink bone broth and uh and things like that that they tend to eat less and uh not necessarily being being a good thing that you know potentially just not getting as much as their body actually wants and so they're not getting proper nutrition and I think that could be you know a a potential mechanism for that that you're reducing your enjoyment and experience of those nutrients you got from the bone broth and now they don't taste as good in the steak and so you don't need as much steak but you need those other nutrients from the steak that now you're not getting uh so that's how I think about it I also don't care about ketosis as much per se if we're in ketosis that's great we're supposed to be we're supposed to eat meat that's what I know we're supposed to eat meat that's what we're designed for we've been doing for millions of years and so if I'm in ketosis out of ketosis if and a balance of that throughout the day okay uh whatever I'm eating what I'm supposed to eat my body's doing what it's supposed to do I'm I'm giving it I'm sort of a trust system you know buddies buddy trust I'm doing a trust fall here you know this is how how My Body Works my body is saying this is how we work give me this food I'm giving it this food and I'm trusting that my body is doing what it's supposed to do uh when it has that food and so far so good feel great my Bloods are great I'll actually be doing a video on um on on my Bloods looking at my blood results which are all great you they're all basically exactly the same as they were four years ago uh last time I checked and I I don't check my Bloods regularly because I feel fine I don't think you need to check these things all the time unless there's a problem uh I probably wouldn't have checked it now anyway but it's just basically to appease the vultures um that say oh my god oh but your blood my Bloods are great they've always been great they're still great and it's just really just to shut people up on the internet but um I'll be doing that at some point when I find the time to do that I'll be going to France as I said so probably won't be until after I get back in any case but uh but again I don't no idea if I'm in ketosis or not I just eat when I'm supposed to eat and I feel great and uh things are going well so that's what I go by uh question from

        "body": "uh question from Sunflower thank you very much for the uh question from Sunflower thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Anthony my hubby has Parkinson's so we just started the carnivore diet after listening to a post where you spoke about your father do you have uh any starting recommendations um well I think it's really good that you're you're trying uh trying this to address this for for your husband's health and your health as well I think you'll both find fantastic improvements from that I can't say if it's going to reverse his Parkinson's I can say that it's going to improve his life in many other ways that will make Parkinson's much easier to deal with and uh and and um and hopefully it helps with the Parkinson's as well I do know that my father's been very stable he has not progressed he I mean really doesn't look like he has Parkinson's and so and he's and he was diagnosed six years ago seven years ago and really no progression and and he wasn't he wasn't doing great at the beginning and um a month into carnivore he was just a different person I mean it was just it was just took 10 years off the clock and then he was still eating pretty lean and so I impressed upon him like Hey you because he was getting constipated and so I was like hey you know if that if you're getting constipated that means you're not eating enough fat you need to eat more fat and that's good for your brain as well and he was like great good for my brain going to do it and he started eating a lot more fat and you know and did even better after that and there are studies showing that people with higher LDL cholesterol have lower rates of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's you brain needs Fat Brain needs cholesterol and so um you know getting that and giving your and my dad was a was a proponent was doing pricin diet since the 70s you know so that poor man's brain had had been undernourished for 40 years you know the hell do you think's going to happen it's it's not going to work properly and you know and then all the other sort of things that we're eating or or medications that we're taking that can detract from that as well so thankfully he's doing thousand times better and hopefully your husband does as well so getting started uh you need to watch those those things go to the car that playlist getting started on a carnivore diet um on my YouTube channel and watch the um and watch the things on get how carnivore for beginners the ones on fiber frequently asked questions and then the different videos on on why we are carnivores plants are trying to kill you and uh and you know bioavailability and all those other ones in that playlist work your way through that so you understand the why and why this is so important so that you can maximize the likelihood that you and your husband will both make this as a lifelong commitment and that so you will maximize your health and optimize your Health and Longevity and I you know I truly hope that that you guys uh do great with it just keep it simple right just eat meat fatty meat and drink water and that's it that's all you have to do eat the meat that you like eat enough fat so that you're not constipated and then if you're taking medications understand that some of those medications may be too much after a few months or even a month especially like things like diabetes it really really reduces your demand for these sorts of medications and just being aware of that tracking blood pressure tracking blood pressure uh blood sugar and and working with your doctor to come off medications if you need to and that's pretty much it but watch the videos immerse yourself in those things get involved in a in a sort of a support group get go on to those you don't have to pay for anything um you know I mean you can there things exist I mean I do a corn of our Challenge and that we try to give as much support and resources to people that we can but you don't need that you can just go to the Facebook groups like zeroing in on health zero carb Health there are people there that have been in your situation and are happy to help you and give you advice and you look at the search function you will see conversations of people just like you and your husband who have asked the same questions that you and your husband have and you'll get answers and you can go there and say hey I'm just starting out having these sort of problems you know uh and and you search in the in the you know in the chat see if someone's answered that problem if they haven't you ask the group there's thousands of people tens of thousands of people that have been where you know through this not necessarily with Parkinson's but they've been through this and uh and they'll have very good advice for you so that's what I would do and good luck with it coach constant Lem minded living thank you very much for the"

        "body": "would tend to avoid it Connie Martin thank you for the would tend to avoid it Connie Martin thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy my new hero that's nice of you uh I used to hate steak but now I can't seem to get enough of it again it's conditioned responses we condition oursel to hate this wonderful glorious marvelous taste and because we're told it's so bad for us so uh I'm glad that that that's over now is that normal yes it is uh also how long before you start losing weight I'm quite overweight um yeah so again it is normal to uh to to sort of be averse to this sort of flavor because we've been telling our elves we should be averse to it that it's bad for us so we associate that flavor even though it's marvelous with something bad for us and so we get a psychosomatic reaction of feeling gross and sick and oh I don't like it I don't like it yes you do you know it's just a conditioned response you oh I like broccoli I like no you don't that's Stockholm syndrome you're being abused your whole life and now You' fallen in love with your your abuser um so you can recondition yourself you can you can Deb brainwash yourself deprogram yourself and uh and yeah so that's normal so go to town on that eat as much fatty meat as tastes good to you and then stop once it's done Weight Loss can be triggered by eating enough as well so if you're eating if you're chronically eating less than your your body wants and demands you will reduce your metabolism you will drop your metabolism you will slow your metabolism you won't lose weight bariatric surgeons say that if their patients after they get this surgery it's very hard to eat but you have to get at least 1,200 calories a day or you will not lose weight 4400 calories you lose weight 800 calories you don't lose weight why is that right because your metabolism is dropping right so eat as much as your body is asking you for you don't have to overeat you don't have to force feed yourself definitely don't force feed yourself if meat doesn't taste good you're not hungry don't eat if there's food on the plate put it in the fridge you don't need it right then and but you want to eat until you get to that Point get till you get to the point where you just say h don't really want to eat that there are also people that for a number of different reasons hormonal in nature um and and because they've boxed their metabolism and their hormones for so many years eating the wrong things starving themselves doing different sorts of dieting that that is really detrimental to our health and our hormonal Health it can take time it can take time before this this settles down and your hormones come down especially leptin that's something you can check if if people have stubborn weight loss you can check your leptin Le TI n so your serum leptin and you can see if that's elevated you might have a a you're going to have a slower time of of losing weight because you have leptin resistance and that goes away most bariatric surgeons that I've spoken to say that if your leptin's over a 100 you cannot lose weight on your own you will never be able to lose weight with dying lifestyle you have to get surgery because it's just out of your control that's not true if you do it right if you do a carnivore diet that leptin comes down and I even seen people with leptin over 100 that do lose weight even before their leptin comes down there are some people that are very stubborn in their weight loss especially when they have this this very elevated leptin and there's something else going on too because there are people that have very elevated leptins that you just drop weight off like crazy so there's other things going on too could be your thyroid could be uh your other sex hormones could be your vitamin D could be your zinc could be a lot of things that are out of balance that that you need to get in Balance generally through optimal nutrition sometimes a supplement might help like vitamin D if you're just not getting getting sun and and the fatty meat that you're eating isn't isn't grass-fed and finished not going to have as much vitamin D um and um you know so if you have low vitamin D you know you might you might benefit from a supplement if you're very low it's it's a hormone you don't need hyper elevated sort of ones from supplementation you do want it from natural sort of sources it does seem to make a difference you know different sorts of supplementation uh studies that I've heard Dr Paul Mason talk about aren't very uh you know impressive you know if you're supplementing to get up to a level that someone else is at just physiologically they don't have the same health benefit um as each other supplemented one just sort of you get above a threshold you need this you need it so if you're very low definitely supplement but if you're sort of high normal probably okay but if you're low you know definitely think about that um most people on a carnivore diet eventually will have will have very good levels of vitamin D and and get in the sun Suns good for you um anyway so a lot of different things a lot of different hormonal imbalances that can can be at play your metabolism can just be suppressed for years and Decades of Crash dieting and eating horrible things so give it time focus on your health focus on how you feel and your energy levels and your sleep and all these other things and optimize those things too you need good sleep you need to optimize your your circadian rhythm go to bed on time get proper sleep use melatonin if you need to don't use other sleeping drugs that are not great for you're not going to give you good rest full sleep and and uh and if you're still having a problem check your leptin if that's elevated just understand hey this is going to take a bit of time and and that's okay you know Kelly Hogan talks about how she actually gained weight for six months on a carnivore diet but her health issues were improving so much she was just like okay I feel great my boils are gone and all these other problems are gone that's so I'm just going to stick with it and after 6 months she started just just dropping weight like crazy and so could very well be that she had high leptin she probably did just just knowing her history and how she you know dieted and ate before that um so just give it time just be patient if you're curious you can check your leptin and just see like oh okay look it's 78 this just going to take a bit of time if it's four you know then you know then it's like okay it's it's something else maybe I'm just not eating enough and maybe that's suppressing my my metabolism so do all that stuff and then um and if you're everything right and it's still being stubborn just be patient it'll happen focus on your health first and foremost also if you put on muscle you put on bone density and you don't lose any weight or gain any weight it's because you've lost a corresponding amount of fat right so you you've offset it and I I didn't lose weight for I don't know five six months but I I was dramatically different in in the mirror I was feeling better I was looking better I was performing better I was getting much more muscular and I was visibly less fat right I weighed the exact same amount I didn't lose any weight so weight is problematic as well because it doesn't tell you about body composition and so look in the mirror take a monthly progress picture you know you want you want to see how you're doing right and if you're looking leaner your faith face is thinner you're doing great do try to exercise if you can is it is it's not necessary if you can't but do what you can you know walking is fine if that's what you can do um if you get up to the point where you can do Sprints just as hard as you can go if it's not safe to do that don't uh and resistance exercises so even body weight exercises to failure you can do a wall sit Dr Ben um who who does the was it 15 minute 15-minute workout we have the book but I don't I don't um recall the name but anyway you he was saying that he works with people at any any stages and he like okay you can't do squats and you know power lift and things like that to failure you can do a wall sit to sit against the wall until your legs give out that was strenuous exercise for you and so you just do that and and you challenge yourself like that and you do that sort of exercise not cardio but like high-intensity sprinting or weights to failure you are going to trigger more visceral fat uh reduction and deep cutaneous fat reduction which is which are metabolically active and that can actually slow and impede your metabolism and and your health in a lot of ways so um do all those things and then just be patient it'll come um also uh everyone just so you know I have I can't do like a like an extended director's cut version of of Fellowship of the Ring version today um I have I have an appointment uh that I have to get to uh by 12 so I'm going to have to finish up wrap up probably around 11:15 so got solid you know 40 minutes 45 minutes left uh but just so you know uh that's when I have to sort of cut it off and so if we get sort of close to end I'm going to sort of Rapid Fire through U the super chats I'll probably just dead focus on the super chats now because I don't want to I don't want to leave anyone hanging uh H Kimberly Clinger thank you for the"

        "body": "low drama thank you very much uh for the very generous low drama thank you very much uh for the very generous Super Chat um uh my friend 53 started moderate low carb last year until 7 weeks ago down 22 pounds triglycerides 140 alt 56 ggt uh 67 um was it fi 33 HBC 3 or 5.3 he uh then he started keto now fasting triglyceride je Jesus 416 alt uh and ggt everything's sort of gone up hbmc is about the same your thoughts thanks for all you do well Christmas like um normally you wouldn't see that you know triglycerides go go down uh if you don't eat carb sugar alcohol um probably seed oils are involved in that as well but um but definitely the carbs and the sugar so I I would wonder what difference he you what what did he change was eating exactly the same and then all of a sudden he just dropped the um just dro the rest of the carbs but everything else is identical or is he doing something else is he doing sort of dirty keto is he having artificial sweeteners and they'll keto treats and snacks and things like that if he is get rid of all of those uh go carnivore as well and um also you know did he check his Bloods directly before he made the switch and now seven weeks later a test is only as good as a retest sometimes you get these aberant levels that are just a bit crazy um and so if he tested those levels months and months and months ago um you know or even before he started all this and then there's some sort of change I mean you don't you don't know what happened in the middle so you need a series of tests and you need a mat specific time so you can because you can only tell that there's a difference between these two points in time it's just snapshot in time so you don't know all the ups and downs and changes and differences that happen in between that so the more data points you get the better able you'll be at at sort of filling in the gaps um I would test again I would also get rid of everything that is not um that did not exist in nature uh a thousand years ago or 10,000 years ago or 50,000 years ago really or maybe 500,000 years ago when our pre Homo Sapien ancestors were turning into Homo sapiens um so that just means meat so um and then I would retest I I would wait six weeks I wouldn't worry too much about this and I would retest triglycerides should come down you know if he's not eating any of these of these things um or she is eating any of these thing no he is eating any of these things um the liver as well um that that is you know it could be the the things he's eating on keto are are necessarily needing to be detoxified by his liver and that and is causing stress and strain because these that's that's who's detoxing this stuff is your liver right and so it's uh it's if you're if you're stressing it with I so a lot of people do keto and they think it's funny right so you're eating what you're eating and then you just say okay I'm just not going to eat carbs and because I'm not going to eat carbs I'm going to eat more meat and fat and that's where I'm going to get my calories from now I have to eat a lot more vegetables to replace the the nutrients that I'm not getting because I'm not eating carbs what nutrients are in carbs that we need What vitamin is in carbs right so why would you need to increase the amount of vegetables you're eating to get more nutrients because you're losing nutrients from from bread there are no nutrients in bread you know so especially white bread so that that's always very funny to me that people would do that or think that they needed to do that but because they do think that they eat a ton of vegetables first of all all your nutrients come from meat so that's that's what you want but if you're eating a whole bunch of vegetables you're going to get a lot of these defense chemicals that are that are not normal to you and that you're not used to and they're going to cause harm right so if you need a hell of a lot more of this stuff you can actually damage your liver you can damage your kidneys you can damage other processes in your body and so I would get away from keto I would go to carnivore uh which is also keto and but it gets rid of these plant toxins and if they're eating tons and tons and tons of these things that can be a problem I would go carnivore I would go high fat carnivore I would cut out everything that didn't exist 50,000 years ago during the last ice age you know meat right so he doesn't have to go track down a mammoth but you know uh you know fatty meat anyway and and get rid of everything else and I I'll check it again in in a few months cholesterol is a bit of a weird one because um and that's another thing depending on the time of day you test this it's going to be different depending on your your your activity level the day of or the day before you if you had sex that morning and the sex day before you worked out you're going to have different cholesterol levels you're going to have different hormonal levels uh if you're not fasted um you you know you're going you're going to get these derange now he says fasting triglycerides is 460 um but 416 but how long was he fasted for it that makes a difference as well so um this goes for everyone I've said this before but it's good if people haven't heard this before take note this is how you should take your blood tests for the rest of your life first thing in the morning between 8 and 9:00 a.m. fasted from the night before 900 p.m. only clear water after that same hydration status at least two glasses of water in the morning 2 8 O glasses of water in the morning an hour or two before you get your blood test done no more than four glasses of 8 o 8 O water before okay you be very sedate very um calm relaxed and sedentary the day before really a couple days leading up chill out don't get road rage on their way to the the clinic don't someone cut you God damn it that will change things that will screw up your tests okay certainly your hormones and and your good with your cholesterol as well and and so and no exercise or sexual activity the morning of or the day before okay and then don't take any pills or medications or supplements the morning of take them after your blood test okay that makes a difference it makes a a big difference so get these things consistently and always remember a test is only as good as a retest and so if you get some weird aberant tests check it again because that's not necessarily um that's not necessarily accurate you know Labs make mistakes or or something in your blood draw was a bit weird and so that's what I would do go carnivore high fat eat until you're satiated and and food meat doesn't taste good anymore tested don't take anything else and then check it again in uh six months time in that way and um Good Luck to him I would I I do expect that that's just an aberant test and that that will go down for whatever reason it's up it will go down doing doing what I re commend it uh Duro all right thank you for the for the"

        "body": "Sunday after the challenge Justin H thank you for the Sunday after the challenge Justin H thank you for the Super Chat hey doct been carnivore for over half a year that's great benefiting a lot except I have very bad keto insomnia uh the night before big competitions any advice um well I'm glad you're doing better um so keto insomnia but only before big competitions I mean that sounds like you're getting nerves and um and that's normal I mean I would you know if I have have something like big the next day it's sometimes very hard for me to sleep I have like a big game and I'm just amped up like no going to sleep and that's not necessarily just from keto that's just from from just being amped up and ready to go and so you know you you try to optimize these things using red you know the the blue blocking glasses turn off the lights be calm and relaxed it's hard to do before the night of a game because like I'm already just getting in in you know in kill mode the night before you know so it's uh it's difficult but you know optimize things you know get get the lights off you know certainly get lights off get away from screens get away from phones right at dusk and at least an hour before you go to bed or want to be asleep you can also try melatonin low dose melatonin if you're in America it's just over the counter and so you can get that like five milligrams 3 to five milligrams a good start you know you work your way up to like 10 milligrams a night again an hour before you go to sleep melatonin only works if the lights are off though if you have lights on just wipes it right out of your brain so uh just recognize that and then uh yeah do you try to sleep you know it if it if you're not getting it on other nights then this is nerves it's not necessarily from being keto uh you can also try to eat you know your bigger meal before bed because that generally makes people very lethargic and and tired and you just naturally go to sleep so you can try all those things worst case scenario you can't none of that works have a glass of milk whole milk you'll have a bit of carbs it'll raise your insulin it'll drop your blood blood sugar um and you'll feel tired and drowsy and if it's the carbs you know some people say they have to have carbs to go to sleep s Norton's one of those people you know she said she she's basically carnivore she basically only eats meat but she cannot sleep unless she has a bit of carbs if you're going to eat those carbs eat animal carbs have just have some milk have a glass of milk I mean don't drink milk because of the carbs and when I do have milk because it's delicious I get tired afterwards I like all of a sudden just pass out on the couch in the middle of the day why the hell is that well because I've just blocked my body's ability to make ketones and I've dropped my blood sugar right so you could sort of use that to your advantage and um and your insulin will be with if with just one glass of milk your insulin should be low enough the next day that you're back in ketosis but you know if you're if you're checking your ketones and things like that check and make sure before you go into a competition um to make sure that you're you're in the in the right metabolic state that you can perform your best um in the timing that you have but I would I would address it from more of a psychological point of view as well it sounds more like nerves and so you just just address it that way and um and hopefully that th at that does the trick amazing shell thank you for the"

        "body": "at that does the trick amazing shell thank you for the at that does the trick amazing shell thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffie my son has autism and ID I'll have to think about what that means diet is high carb which is all he will eat now he has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease at age 20 would uh acetal carnitine be helpful for him well I mean carnitine is good for everybody um and 30% of people don't make enough carnitine it is an essential um protein to those people and uh and so if he's one of those people which that that is um that is a thing that can precipitate autism is a lack of carnitine so I don't know if that's your son's particular issue carbs are not a good thing either but carnitine can be a lack of car carnitine can be an issue as well so definitely getting carnitine is a good idea getting it from red meats even better if you need to supplement if he's not eating a lot of meat then then do what you need to do that's fair enough I would really really really try to get him off the carbohydrates it's the carbohydrates and the sugar uh that are causing the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease it's not the lack of carnitine it's the carbs and the sugar how do we make FR fagra speaking going to France and not eating the gr how do you make you stuff a feeding tube down the throat of a goose and you dump in a bunch of grains and carbs potentially sugar I don't know but but carbs anyway and that just builds up a whole bunch of fat in their liver and that's that you can make F gr and that's how people get F gr like why are we thinking that's a different mechanism you know you you force feed a goose a ton of of grains which they know uh well enough not to eat all that crap uh and they get fatty liver they liver disease and then we think you just eat pizza and carbs and pasta and sugar and cake and all that sort of stuff that you're not going to get it why would you be any different so uh that's what I was suggest you really try to get them off off the carb I I know uh that it can be very difficult um but try to find meats that that he will eat you know bacon other other sorts of things that that that maybe he'll eat try to sort of reduce the amount of carbs and try to replace it with with meat there are multiple studies showing benefit of ketogenic diets with with autism even as adults and uh and certainly as kids and so people watch my interview with Professor Chris Palmer from Harvard you know he talks about how you can reverse many mental health issues including autism but also schizophrenia major depression anxiety OCD bipolar ADHD but also autism autism when your brain is fully developed it there's always remodeling so there's always something you can do and you can always maximize it's its um you know its function as after it's fully developed um but when it's still developing and he is still developing his brain at 20 that's that's still going on then you uh you can actually undo a lot of the MISD development that you get with autism so this can be a metabolic mitochondrial issue the lack of carnitine um according to uh Dr Palmer seems to you know be important for mitochondrial function as well in the brain and so this might be the mechanism by which lack of carnitine is damaging in autism because you need normal mitochondria and metabolic function for your brain to work normally and to develop normally you need carnitine for normal neuronal development and um from what Dr Palmer was saying that this is this because it damages the mitochondria you need them for the mitochondria and you you don't develop properly without proper mitochondria going on a ketogenic diet carnivore diet within a few months you will have four times the number of mitochondria and they are going to be four times as effective so that's a big big big addition to your metabolic health and your brain function and you're going to remove and eliminate out a lot of things that are going to damage and depress the function of your brain so uh good luck with that you can watch there's a number of other people that I've had on the podcast that have had autism or their children had autism and they all found massive benefits from going on a cornivore diet a ketogenic cornivore diet so goo d luck with that weave 860 thank you very much for the"

        "body": "d luck with that weave 860 thank you very much for the d luck with that weave 860 thank you very much for the Super Chat it's very generous of you can you discuss uh the dawn effect I learned about it from Dr siwi uh first and find it liberating to no longer suffer and fear the ups and downs of car BRD mornings and can comfortably skip breakfast okay with some coffee um yeah the dawn effects refers to the morning Spike in cortisol which is very normal that's just just what wakes you up in the morning and that can cause a bit of insulin resistance and cause your blood sugar to go up a bit and um then you have you know um you just gets you up in the morning gets you up and going um all you know going back to the Melatonin thing you know you can actually suppress your morning cortisol if you take too much melatonin and so if you find yourself sort of groggy and sleepy then you'll cut back on the amount of melatonin that you're taking as a supplement because that's probably suppressing the cortisol if you have massive amounts of cortisol then you know that's not necessarily a bad thing that you've uh that you've taken a bit of melatonin but in any case um you know some people find that they get they get a raise in their their blood sugar and and they get freaked out by that but that's normal it's normal for that to go up a bit um again this just goes back to what you are physiologically adapted and designed for we're designed to eat meat um and you know you eat a lot of fatty meat your body's going to do what it's going to do so we can measure these things and we say hey look this is what happens here and this is what happens here and this is what happens here to me that's academic it's interesting but I'm happy to just trust that that's normal that if that is normal right so if these things are happening and then they're supposed to happen right so I'm I'm happy for that that to happen and I wouldn't um yeah it's very nice that you know you don't have all these ups and downs and swings and crashes with insulin and blood sugar that you normally do on on a carbohydrate Rich diet it's generally your blood sugar and Insulin are there maybe bits of fluctuations like with the dawn effect and other sorts of things but generally it's just right there and uh and that's perfect so yeah you don't have to worry about that if you're if you're diabetic type one or type two this is going to reduce the um demand that you have for insulin and other sort of medications which is fantastic you get more of your life back and you're not beholding on these you know drug companies that do they have our best interest at heart I don't know uh some of the researchers and scientists probably got into it for the right reasons people running the show they are running on their business model they want to make money and and I as far as I understand they are heavily invested in the processed food companies and the processed food companies are heavily invested in the pharmaceutical companies why would you think that is because they profit from each other they know that this food is making us sick CI means is a whistleblower and and he was in the board meetings he says I know that they know this is making us sick because I've been in the board meetings with them talking about it right so he's blowing the whistle on this and um and I'm glad he did but you know this is I mean you can see what they're investing in and uh and you can see exactly what uh what their motivations are as well they know this is making us sick they know this is harming us they know it's addictive they know this is doing bad things to us and they know that they can then turn around and sell us the drugs to put a Band-Aid on it and make it not hurt as much well it goes away completely if you just just don't eat that crap and um and then they don't have any power over you you know that's the beauty of a free market is it's free you don't have to do it you don't have to buy this crap if you don't want to and so if you understand that this stuff is poison which it is and that you'll need medications which you will if you just say I'm not going to eat that stuff anymore I'm going to eat a biologically appropriate diet that we've been eating for millions of years because I'm not an idiot and I understand biology then you can do that and you won't need all these medications or at least a lot less of them or the ones that are actually there for an acute issue right accidents happen people have genetic issues people have problems that there are medications to help which is amazing that we have that and I'm I'm not I'm not fully um you know disillusioned by the medical establishment there are things that we can do that really help people the vast majority of is focused in the wrong direction on these chronic issues that are chronic poisoning from eating the wrong thing and so but it's a free market so far is we're not being forced to eat things they're trying they want to force you to eat fake meat force you to not be able to eat uh meat you know give you Alpha gal syndrome and things like that force you to eat bugs force you to do all the other things that's they are trying that so far the systems and structures in place are keeping the tyrants at Bay which is the entire point of the American Constitution it was to keep  like that the hell away from you and I and so thankfully it's still you know it's it's sort of on its last legs it's it's very threadbear and stretched and torn and tattered because of all the assaults that have been on it over the past Century or more since woodro Wilson but and certainly FDR and and and um Johnson and things like that I mean a lot of stuff um uh Lyndon Johnson LBJ but either way you know it's still there and so right now it's still up to you you get to choose if you're going to eat this crap or not and um so i' I've certainly made my choice I'm not I'm never eating that that stuff again and I'm doing much better for it Nur Jimenez thank you so much for the super chats very very generous of you uh for a $50"

        "body": "the super chats very very generous of you uh for a $50 the super chats very very generous of you uh for a $50 Super Chat hi Doc is it normal that my fasting glucose spikes on Carnivore I have type two diabetes um and my A1C was seven but my blood work on okay so in August um August 3rd A1C was seven but blood work on um October 3rd I'm going to say very recently okay and fasting insulin is 4.1 I don't I'm not seeing that the second A1C though uh in any case fasting insulin is 4.1 um shall I stop Dairy with um heavy cream and butter for weight stall thank you for what uh you do best so glucose can can go up and down for a number of reasons you know like we just said here the dawn effect can will certainly affect it in the morning so just keep that in mind if you eat a big meal with a lot of protein that can also raise your insulin it's not going to be like a huge Spike like you ate a whole bunch of carbohydrates however if you are uh diabetic you might still have a bit of of um a bit more of a reaction to that um than others um oh down to six there Jesus Christ why can't I read um so HBC um from August uh was seven and then went down and and two months later went down to six that's great that's fantastic so that's two months normally this is a this is a three-month average um if not maybe a little different than that depending on on the health of your red blood cells um and so going down to six in two months that's fantastic right you know five years ago you you show that to your doctor and be like how the hell did this happen what' you do that doesn't happen that only gets worse what the hell did you do um proof of concept you know that you're eating the wrong thing you get sick wrong things happen start eating the right thing good things happen so that's a good thing that happened so well done and that's only two months you know in another month another two months that's going to come down further than that um so that's great and your fasting insulin is 4.1 that's right there where you want it to be so that's perfect so that's great you're doing really really well I wouldn't worry too much about the spikes if you are only eating meat I would stop the dairy butter normally people don't have a problem with butter people do stall on their weight from from using uh uh cream and other Dairy and so I would just people tend to have eat the exact same amount of dairy regardless of how much meat they eat you know they'll have the same amount of cheese same amount of cream and they'll still eat the same amount of meat and so that seems to be a bit of an issue for people and so um you know uh Dr Paul Mason you know has has mentioned that that there's actually mild you know very mild very small amount but it's there it's present of opiates in in milk right so this is this is to encourage b the baby mammal to like drink more milk this is important for you right so it gives a bit of an addiction just like the carb addiction you just need I need to go eat and that gets them stimulated to eat more because it's very important during that initial growth period so now we're doing that and we just go I want more of this and we end up having more than we necessarily need and this can Pro cause a problem also there's inflammatory uh Pro properties to the um you know the the casan the proteins in milk and um you know so that that can cause a bit of an issue too but for whatever reason people that that that still use Dairy that's very common for them to stall and weight loss or even gain weight after they've lost weight so I would cut that out I would just focus on just whole meat and water fatty meat you want the fat it's very good for you butter is usually okay I would start with the dairy and the heavy cream and cut that out and just eat eat fatty meat you could try using some butter if that if you're still not if you're still not seeing the results you want to see cut out the butter and just stick to meat and also remember that it's not necessarily about your weight on the scale it's about your body composition you could be losing fat and gaining muscle and gaining bone density and the scale stays flat focus on how you feel focus on your health focus on your A1C that's excellent and then secondarily look at your body composition almost never you should you care about the weight on the scale so focus on those things first and again just be patient cut out Dairy cut out things besides meat and water cut out all the variables certainly any artificial sweeteners God those things are awful and uh and just go to meat meat and water okay um all right let me see here I'm gonna see how many questions oh my God okay so there are a lot of questions so please don't put any more um more Super chats in guys because I'm I'm I'm going to have a hard time uh covering all these in the next sort of 10 15 minutes but I am going to do my best um I going to prioritize some of the the the larger ticket uh items um and to make sure you get your questions answered and then I'll answer as many of the of the down the chain there as I can we'll start w ith this one so AB dearani thank you
