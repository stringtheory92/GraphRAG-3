    "transcript": "this was asked earlier by D she wants to know what your opinion on brain development in children with a primarily carnivore diet is like and why schools push high carb foods do people really not know or is it intentional to dummy down the kids you know the teachers and the and the schools I mean at that level they have no idea so they just think this is what you're supposed to do this is what the guidelines are so yeah this is this is great and and of course they wouldn't do that they whoever they are would never promote a diet that's bad for kids because who would do that well and evil people will and they do you know the food companies know damn well that this stuff is really bad it causes disease causes metabolic dysfunction causes harm and you know they they don't care you know they they're happy with that um you know c means has been a whistleblower for the for the food uh Industries and um I believe he's sort of shown with the pharmace itical companies are up to as well but you know he was saying that you know he that all the the food companies know that their processed food cause harm they cause metabolic distress they cause dysfunction they cause disease and they know that and I know they know that because I've been in the board meetings with them while they talked about it so they know at least you know the schools once it gets down to that level I mean they're just worker bees at that point they're just sort of doing what they're told and they're just expecting that everybody above them is a benevolent uh Angel and just wants the best for everybody maybe or maybe they just don't care to to think about it or find out as to brain development on Carnivore yeah I think that's going to be a number one the best thing for kids in brain development think of it this way prior to agriculture the adult male brain capacity was 11% larger than it was 10,000 years ago directly after Agriculture and that's continued to today so there's an 11% drop immediately that has persisted in women it's more pronounced it's 177% so the brain size dropped 17% bam 10,000 years ago and that's persisted so that's developmental that can't really be anything else you've affected the development of that child and now that child could not develop to their genetic potential so that's wrong and just because well I'm smart and I grew up on a it good for you you're not as smart as you would have been you're not as tall as you would have been your brain isn't as developed as it would have been it's not as large as it would have been you are not the person you could have been maybe you're a very nice person but you are not the person you would have been I'm not the person I would have been that I could have been that I should have been none of us are you know unless we were actually raised by a wonderful set of parents that actually did carnivore before we were born during and after pregnancy and that's happening now there are more and more people doing that and their kids are thriving and their brains are are much larger they're off the percentile chart and and so why is that well you're not eating well first of all you're just eating things that you're designed to eat and your body's going to develop the way it's designed to develop pure and simple you can stop right there but if you want to know a bit more detail kids are always in ketosis in infancy and in uh the womb they're in ketosis and when breastfeeding they're in ketosis and early on they're in ketosis why is that because ketones cross the blood brain first of all ketones are your brain's primary energy source for most of your of your the cells in your brain some still run on glucose most run on ketones and that's very important for the fuel and for the mitochondrial health of your brain and development of your brain secondly ketones cross the blood brain barrier and reconstitute into fatty acids which are the used as the building blocks for the physical structures of your brain your brain is made out of fat and cholesterol this is something you have to have in abundance or you will not grow your brain properly and so this gives your brain the building blocks and this is why kids need to be in ketosis because they need ketones in going into their brain so they can build fat that's a major major portion so you keep stuffing in carbs and sugar you are kicking them out of ketosis you are suppressing their Ketone levels and you are suppressing their brain development you're also blocking out necessary nutrients like you need meat and you but you need that to be your sole diet because if you eat other things that's replacing the nutrients in the meat so you're not getting as enough as much meat you're not eating as much meat you're not getting as many nutrients and you're getting other things that can be antinutrients they can block the you Tannis can bind up proteins and other sorts of nutrients and oxalates and Fates and and um so many other things will block and disrupt your body's ability to absorb and utilize different nutrients you have proteas Inhibitors like in wheat and soy and many other things that stop you from absorbing uh amino acids you're doing low fat diets so your brain is made out of fat your body is made out of fat cholesterol you need this stuff and so you're really limiting yourself and you're poisoning yourself you're giving yourself direct toxins neurotoxins there are a lot of neurotoxins that plants develop to to damage the brain caffeine being one of them that's a neurotoxin and an insecticide that was developed to fry the brain's and nervous system of insects trying to eat those plants so you know all there are so many things that we put in our body that really should never be there and again it just comes back to that Sentinel point if you eat what you're designed to eat your body's going to work the way it's designed to work and if you don't it won't so you need to find out what our bodies are designed for what our species is designed for and you look back at biology you look back at our historical past the immutable law of biology is that of adaptation what you have been adapting to the longest is what you're designed for so we've been eating meat we've been apex predators for over 2 million years the definition of an apex predator is a carnivore apex predators eat other animals that is a definition in terms and we were eating meat a long time before that but we were apex predators for at least two million years so we have been evolving and adapting to meat for millions of years so we are designed for it we are optimized for it we've only started eating plants regularly very recently and it caused a huge disruption in our health and development immediately 10,000 years ago which has persisted and you look at Native populations that go from their Hunter gather mostly Hunter past like the Plains Indians in America who in the 1800s were eating a bunch of bison and they were the tallest population on Earth that's a study that came out in 2001 showing that and now that's very different they're not as tall they're suffering from serious chronic disease obesity diabetes cancer and all these sorts of things which did not exist in their population to any great extent prior to the adoption of a western diet and they were called Western diseases back then they're still called Western diseases when you're talking about the context of Native Americans I was just reading a book on this talking about the health and changes like yeah when they started westernizing started getting developed sort of structure they start getting Western diseases and and diseases of civilization and and all these sorts things it was just like this has been written about for for literally recently going back centuries and yet we're not putting it together that that this is this comes about from eating this garbage food and not eating what we're supposed to eat and designed to eat which is fatty meat that's it w who in your opinion would benefit from reducing the population or and the intelligence of the general population oh who would benefit from that oh gosh I don't know any any sort of psychopath but you know I mean there are a lot of people there there you're never going to run shy of of narcissists and makeing Maniacs in the human race and so there's always going to be someone that thinks they can do everything better they can do everything right or that they deserve everything and they should be running everything and they want to control people you know power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely and so when you start gaining power and getting more and more power you want more and so that tends to be the way especially and you know a good way to do that is through government and as Thomas Jefferson said the the nature of the world is for government to grow and for Liberty to yield and so government is going to grow and grow and grow and grow and grow because these are the aspirations and and and machinations of different sorts of power hungry maniacs and people's power is gonna people's Liberty is going to go back and go back and go back and go back and then we're we're sort of we have our backs against the wall at this point and now because we have our backs against the wall now people are saying well we need this is this hasn't worked the American experiment has failed and so now we need to go to you know Glo now we need to try something new and wonderful like Global communism and you and know that that's the WF sort of slogan it's like it's 2030 you owe nothing and you love it I mean how much more like brainwashing propaganda can you get hey you don't own anything and it's great you love it you're like what the hell are you talking about so if I don't own anything who does oh no one owns anything everything's no no no someone owns things that's how the world works so if I don't own anything if you don't own anything if everyone doesn't own anything that means that very select few people own things and so what does that mean that means everyone's a slave so you work but your your the product of your labor is not your own that goes to someone else you are given a place to live you are given food you are given just enough to keep you happy and you keep working like a busy little worker be but you're never going to rise up above that you're always going to be where you are unless you have some sort of you know political sort of connections but that's really it they're going to keep things too class so they they want to go back to aristocracy they want to go back to oligarchy they want to go back to this Gentry class where like they're in charge no one else is and everyone else live is Liv and surf them well we've done that for thousands of years and it and it sucked frankly and um you know we don't we're not we don't want to do that anymore we've had these a few bright spots of freedom and liberty for the common people and that that J that tends to get some sort of megalomaniac that wants to take control and take over and they end up doing it you know the the democracies in ancient Greece lasted about 150 years generally uh democracies generally ended up in tyrannies and autocracies because they just once people figured out they could just vote themselves more money they you know they never work again you know and they just sort vote vote vote vote vote so that's why Rome started a republic you know a representative Republic and that helped disseminate some of the the the power around it wasn't like a direct democracy and that helped for and that lasted hundreds of years lasted longer than America has you know and then you know Caesar came in and said yeah we're going back to Empires and then people said no we're not going to do that so they killed Caesar and then kept the Empire I was like you should have kept Caesar then because he was actually doing a good job and you didn't like cast yourself into Civil War um but then Rome lasted you know another several centuries and um you know and then you had uh America that popped up and that sort of influenced other spheres you know the Magna Carta and all these sorts of things little spots here and there that sort of just gave people back their freedom and control and then and then they just wash up again you know so we're sort of looking at that right now we're we're watching the door of Freedom closed on the end of that and you look back and was like oh thousand years ago thousand years from now I like oh yeah there was this really good spot worked really really well and it sh you know Clos shut and then it took however many hundreds of years to for people to crawl themselves crawl their way out of slavery um that's what we're looking at right now so I you know there are a lot of people there's no there's going to be no shortage of people that are willing to enslave their fellow man and profit from their misery and suffering I mean you have the food companies doing it now you know they know that this stuff causes disease and they do it anyway to keep them addicted and keep them profitable and then they also invest in the in the pharmaceutical companies because they then sell them the diabetes medications and the you know all the different sorts of uh meds to treat the different illnesses that they have you know to me that's that's malice of forethought you know that this is causing harm you know this is causing disease you know this is killing people and then you and then you sell them the drugs that can help mitigate that I mean that that shows you know what you're doing you know it causes harm and you're doing it on purpose so you can profit off that I mean that's that's something you should go to prison for that's something you should probably be executed well it should be think about think about the think about the the cigarette companies you know I mean they they spent de decades denying that cigarettes caused harm or were addictive and that they were going to court and they're saying well you have these studies and those studies then they say oh but our studies say this our studies show the exact opposite so I mean oh oh what can we do well you know then they got those leaked boardroom meetings the tobacco memos showing that they they damn well knew that this stuff caused disease caused harm and of course it was addictive and in fact they were trying to Target kids to get them addicted early like any drug dealer like any any cartel you know they want to they want to addict kids early so that they can have you know an addict for life you know really disgusting human beings and and so they knew they they got done for perjury and all that sort of stuff but you know what they didn't get done for and they got fined for you know $400 billion dollar I think the settlement was and and then the government just took that and you know wasted it um you know and they had some other payouts and things like that but you know what they didn't do is they didn't arrest these people and say Hey you are intentionally poisoning people and you knew it was causing cancer you knew it was causing empyema you knew it was causing death and yet you did it knowingly knowing that it was doing that like that's they caused the deaths of tens of millions of people and destroyed the health of of probably billions why the hell don't they go to jail why don't why don't they face a firing squad I mean they should I mean you know it's it's I think honestly we we we live in a darker time now that we've gotten rid of public executions for like this I mean I I really do you know it used to be that that people that committed treason and sold out the safety of of hundreds of millions of Americans died you know and then you had people selling us out selling secrets you know leaking the nuclear um nuclear um weapon technology to the Soviets because they felt that the Soviets should win and they're better and the communism is so good you need to die you know you potentially cause the death of you know millions and millions of Americans if if those nukes ever hit hit our soil um why why would you ever bat an eye about executing someone like this well you know if you can execute someone like that why aren't you executing someone who is knowingly causing the death and harm to tens of millions of people hundreds of millions of people around the world you someone who goes around and poisons a well just for the sake of poisoning people you know they die you know they were lynched they were hung like how is this any different you you know this is causing harm and unlike the uh the well poisoner it's just this random act of evil I mean you're you're doing you're selling them The Poisoned well water knowing that it's going to kill them that's just sick these are sick people yeah and um and so you know the food companies are doing now you know the Pharmaceuticals companies are you know not much better I mean they're they're they're likely in bed with the food companies and whether they know what's happening I don't know but if they do know then I think that would amount to a criminal act but what they do say and have said is that it's not really a good business model to cure diseases the Better Business model is to find something that they can they can paper over and Band-Aid different symptoms that so they can they can have them again addict them for life so you get put on people on blood pressure medications since they're 30 and you got them for you know the rest of their life or you get people on different you know medications they get diabetes when they're 10 awesome they're on these medications for the rest of their life so I think it was c means it might have been someone else who said that that they they heard a pharmaceutical executive is saying once um asked a question say you do you know what my favorite medication that our company makes is and like oh what's that you know you're curing cancer and kids you know something Noble no my favorite medication that our company makes are any medication that causes side effects that we have medications that treat okay these are sick people you know they're saying they want you to suffer so that they can sell you more drugs that's disgusting to me and these people are disgusting they should be criminally prosecuted if it if if they can prove that this was um you know if this was done knowingly it's never going to happen if if you if you didn't if you're not going to do it to the tobacco companies you know I mean who the hell are you gonna do I'm with you I totally agree with you malice equals murder"
