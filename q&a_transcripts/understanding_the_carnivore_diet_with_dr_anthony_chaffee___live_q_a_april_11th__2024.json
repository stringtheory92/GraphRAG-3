    "title": "\ud83d\udd34Understanding The Carnivore Diet with Dr Anthony Chaffee | LIVE Q&A April 11th, 2024",
    "transcript": "all right hello uh thank you everyone for joining my live today on YouTube Facebook and X um this is for April 12th in Australia and April 11th pretty much everywhere else so thank you all for joining very sorry that a running late I had another interview that I was just finishing up um I saw a comment here from darv said Dr shap is never late nor is he early he arrives precisely what he means to and that's obviously Lord of the Rings reference which is funny so that's just thought I'd pop that up um I wanted to start today with a uh a super chat from last week that just sort of came in right at the end when I was finishing up and um and so we'll just start with this one it's from uh Stephen uh uh has haadi um I'm going to I'm going going to guess that thank you Stephen for the Super Chat uh Stephen uh says from what I understand the body will jettison whatever fat is left over after it has the nutrients it needs from the fat if so how can someone get fat by eating fat so the what what you're referring to there is something I talk about is just basically the the body has a limited capacity to absorb fat and so that has to do with our bile it's very difficult for the body to absorb fat when it's um when it's out of bile so you break down the fat bile msif it and your body absorbs that complex into your lymphatic system as kyom microns and that goes and does its thing but when you run out of bile then you just physically can't absorb fat anymore you you can absorb a bit but it's very difficult it's much much much less and it's a quite often it's more oh it's easier to to absorb medium chain fatty acids MCTS and so you can get a bit more than your body you know wants with the bile but the vast majority of it goes out so I mean you could technically try to just really overwhelm your system and get a lot more it could be that there's there's a limited amount that it sort of goes up to this point and then saturates it and can't even absorb past that I'm not too sure I don't I don't know um if anyone's ever looked at that but if you let's say that it sort of keeps coming in and uh in a very small percentage of it uh and the rest of it goes out you could potentially overwhelm that and that you know if you had you know a fat that was Surplus to demand you know you you put that into your fat but the rest would go out and you'd just have torrential diarrhea constantly and you would not be a happy camp or like it's just like would not be something You' enjoy doing and so it' be very difficult really the only way to overeat fat and over absorb fat is if you take something like ox bile which would force you to absorb more fat so the thing is too is it it also depends on what your body wants and what your body's demanding now you're going to take in energy and you will put on some fat because you want to use that for later you want you eat some fat and then you use it for the next day or weeks or whatever that's how we're designed you're filling up your gas ink and then you you run on that so that's uh that's what that's for you were supposed to have some fat storage so your body is designed to do that but it doesn't want more than it needs at any given time and so it's uh it limits the amount of fat that's coming in so that's what that's referring to um if your metabolism is depressed and you've been doing this yo-yo dieting starvation eating rabbit food you know the two Li of bean and Celery Stock diet then you you're going to depress your metabolism body body gonna say like okay we're in a famine we can't get adequate resources we need to shut it down so that's what it does you know less coming in less is going out your body's very fiscally responsible it's going to take care of you in that regard and so it's trying to get you through a famine all life can weather famines because all life has had to weather famines the ones that couldn't are dead now and so everything has descended from from the ones that that won that lived that survived and so we are all capable of surviving famines and that's how your body does it shutting down the metabolism there's the Minnesota starvation studies that happened in the World War II um and they just basically Bally put these people on concentration camp rations and just starve the hell out of them to see like how little you can give someone um and still live and refeeding and all that sort of stuff after not eating for a long period of time and they found that uh yeah yeah people lost weight but then it sort of plateaued and then they stopped losing weight and they were able to maintain and not really lose more weight than that uh on extremely low amounts of food and you know if it was just a calories in calories out thing then some of these people would have ceased to exist because they would have lost more weight than they started with right so you know another reason why that's a really silly model but um your your if your metabolism is extremely depressed and you start eating a normal amount and your body says oh thank God you know we need to store this it's going to store fat because it thinks you're you're still in a famine but you got to you got a cash of energies okay well we need to store this it's not just like oh great you know I got uh I got you know I I I got a new job let's buy a Ferrari it's like well hold on a second we've been poor and broken miserable for the last six years we need to save something we need to put money in the bank you know and so that's what your body is doing is so as putting that money in the bank and then eventually if you keep eating adequately and you tell your body that you're not in a famine your metabolism just Rises up and you can see this all different sort of um you know molecular markers in your body and your metabolism just starts going up and ramping up and you get healthier and then all of a sudden you start losing weight because your body's like okay great we're not in famine anymore we don't need to hang on to this sort of stuff so it depends on your metabolism depends on if you're taking Ox bile or something silly like that um but no in general your body won't won't absorb more fat than it actually wants and it may want to store fat because of your metabolic State and and uh starving yourself and things like that long term but uh I just I just let my body do what it's supposed to do I think that's that's a good rule of thumb that our bodies know what to do a lot better than we do you just give it the right inputs and it will take care of the rest so a super chat from Beth radmacher thank you very much for that Beth Beth says uh is it okay to eat really lean beef cuts if you eat added fat trimmings with it uh thank you as always you're amazing what's your cat's name uh that's always embarass embarassing with the cat's name because we didn't really name him we were like trying to figure out what to name him and was just sort of no one could decide or agree upon a name and um and so in the meantime he's just this little kitten and so we had to talk to him and so we just he just said hey little boy come here little boy and it just ended up sticking so his name is now the little boy so and he's a very he's a very sweet little boy and that's what that's what he knows his name to be he's actually good because that comes when he's called he's he's sort of half dog and I sort of I was like well if we're going to get a cat like we're going to have a cool cat and get it to come where you're called and things like that and so he does now and um you know I come home from work and I just call out his name and he'll just come running down and he just follows me around the house the rest of the night so it's really sweet um but to your question you know lean beef cuts and added fat trimmings yeah it's perfect you know as long as you're getting enough fat that that's totally fine so however you do that and however you find that it's enjoyable and and um and you prefer you know go for it uh Thomas Jen jankowitz hello doctor uh four months on a strict keto uh well first of all thank you for the Super Chat uh he goes on to say hello drct four months on a strict keto uh diet since last October um from 10th of February on Carnivore after two weeks of carnivore horrible gout attacks in the elbow two weeks later another attack in both elbows uric acid above 430 well um speaking with people that have had G now first of all prefaces by saying that that Dr Salsbury and others have been treating gout since the 1800s by putting people on a pure red meat and water diet so you know that's already in that's already in the established literature and this is something that a lot of people around the world are finding that this helps their gout but one thing that they do report is that they can get a couple gout attacks after going carnivore and that that uh you know they'll still get they may still get a couple gout attacks but then it goes away you sort of weather the storm you get through it and then it goes away and generally doesn't come back um the other thing to remember is that there is more than one cause of gout so when we think of gout as just uric acid crystals in the joint but there's actually five different uh causes for gout one of them is oxalates so oxalate crystals getting in the joints um are are part of gout and um now they're sort of called pseudo gout but that that you know up until you know the 2000s it was called gout and so um you know that's something just to uh just to remember that um that it could be uric acid crystals but however there are people that have high uric acid serum levels that actually don't get gout and there are people with low uric acid levels that do get gout so it's not actually just a direct one to one you have high uric acid levels and you get uric acid in your joints it's a sort of a you know the uric acid is not supposed to get there it's not just because it's in your serum it shouldn't get there no matter what uric acid is one of your body's strongest antioxidants it's actually not a bad thing to have that a bit higher um the way you you diagnose gout you know the uric acid version of gout is you stick a needle in this inflamed painful joint and you aspirate some and you say okay what are the crystals in there uh if they're uric acid crystals fine uric acid crystals but they may not be there's there's four other causes so either way it it may not it may not be an issue it could just pass on its own and it may not be uric acid crystals um you know you went from keto to carnivore so you're eating vegetables and meat and now you're eating just meat sometimes you can get oxalate dumping where your body has stored up a lot of oxalates from these plants like spinach and sweet potatoes and other sorts of things and they store up in your tissues and then your body starts releasing these things to get this stuff out of there and sometimes it can do that in an overwhelming fashion and you can get gout you can get joint pain you can get rashes you can get all sorts of different different symptoms kidney stones things like that so you know one thing you could try doing is having you know putting some lemon juice in water having you know just some you know weak tea or something like that uh just on its own those are going have a bit of oxalates on it you may like 50 75 milligrams of oxalates in in you know in a day and uh and see what happens sometimes that can suppress the the release of oxalates and you know if you find that that helps you then that could be with what going on not necessarily uric acid gout but it could be oxalate gout and that can sort of slow down the release of uh the oxalate crystals and and maybe relieve your symptoms so something to think about either way when people have true gout um sometimes they they have a couple other flare ups but what people have been reporting is that it then goes away and stays away so uh good luck with that hopefully that settles down very soon Preston Meyer thank you very much for the super chat um Preston was there a previous one from Preston not seeing it um oh there's another one okay so I don't know why these got out of order so uh so Preston says hey Doc trying to get off meds on sakil squil and um uh depote for bipolar to how much fat should I be taking in compared to protein just curious because I heard um getting off meds more efficiently you need a lot of fat and then he goes on to say also if I were um to put bipolar into remission with eating excessive protein or calories kick me into gluconeogenesis and mitigate the carnivore diet benefits for bipolar I want to do bodybuilding but I'm uh deterred uh because of it well look you know you're going to your body needs a certain amount of protein and if you're bodybuilding and you and you require protein to build muscles and and to make the different proteins in your you your your genes they all code for proteins they're all all those little base pairs they're all coding for specific amino acids that link in a chain you have this big long chain of of amino acids and then it folds in a complex Manner and that goes off and does things and that runs your body that's what we're made out of right we're made out of these amino acids all the the different molecules your your your DNA codes for are are proteins and so that's what you use protein for and so if you're lifting weights and you need a higher amount of protein then that's what that's going to get used for so I wouldn't worry too much about that if you're eating an appropriate amount of uh protein for what you're doing so you know you're eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good your body pretty much dictate how much you know protein and fat that you need I would shoot for probably two grams of fat to one gram of protein uh and aim for that but don't have so much fat that you get you know loose stools diarrhea because again the body has a limited capacity to absorb fat after that it just goes out and so if you eat a lot more fat than your body can absorb you'll get loose stools if you eat just a bit more than your body can absorb you'll get soft normal stools if you're not eating as much as your body uh wants and it's absorbing everything and not letting anything go you'll get dry hard stools constipated stools so just aim for two grams of fat to one one gram of protein and uh and then see how you go um and then adjust from there for your demands um you know if you eat if you just eat more and more and more protein you're not getting enough fat and your body has to start using some of that protein for energy or a lot of that protein for energy you know that's not ideal but if you're if you have a lot of excess protein at Surplus to requirement your body then does convert that um into uh glucose but it also then turn it into fat and store that because that's sort of how the how the body stores these sorts of things so you know you can still but if you're if you are if you are building muscle then your body has a demand for those proteins and it's not going to do that because that's only it only does that if it's Surplus to demand and can't store it in any other way or or use it in any other capacity so it's um you know it's not uh it's not something that you would necessarily have to worry about uh too much and if you are if you are um just in ketosis that that is um I I you know I don't think that you have to be just in ketosis constantly to to hold bipolar a bay but it's just when you're in ketosis more often than not then you're going through autophagy and your body is turning over your mitochondria stimulating more mitochondri so you go through mitophagy and mitogenesis so you're turning these things over so they're newer faster better and you have more of them and so they work better so your brain works better and you're also getting rid of all these plant toxins which cause a lot of neuroinflammation and damage and stop your brain from working properly and so all of these things will work together so I I don't think that you'll have too much of a problem eating uh you know going trying uh your handed bodybuilding um because you're going to be using all that so just eat fatty meat till it stops tasting good aim two to one and uh and adjust from there you know you can always you can always uh you know change things up and lower the protein lower the fat or you know raise both if if you need to so it's um it's uh yeah it's just just see how your body works and how your body responds to it and get the right amount of of fat and protein for you good luck with that easy mode RL thank you for the Super Chat I heard not going to the bathroom daily is a bad thing because meat pet uh purifies in our gut uh is that true store bought kefir seems to have fixed it anyhow uh no that's not true um first of all the meat you you absorb the meat so they're saying oh my god oh it's it's putrifying well everything's putrifying there's bacteria there so the the fiber is putrifying the vegetable products are putrifying the fruit is putrifying sugars are putrifying all these sorts of things because putri faction is just you know bacteria eating things and so that's what that is and so no you absorb 98 per or more of the meat you're eating if you cut out if you cut out gristle like you'll just basically absorb 100% of that and you won't need to you won't need to go to the bathroom for a long time and so uh no that's not the case you'll you'll um you'll not go every day because you don't have anything to go you know the thought is is that oh you have all this stuff there and it's in there just being e it's being evil to your body and um it's not necessarily the case you know your body is is designed to to hold these contents and eliminate them and um you know it's just just people make these accusations and assumptions that aren't necessarily based on any evidence whatsoever and so if you're if you're not going every day it's just because you don't have anything to go you know and you're eating something else you're trying to move things you take fiber oh okay that's going you're just adding things to put puy in your gut you're not actually helping anything you're just you're just causing more putri action so that's what you want to avoid then probably not what you want to do you know if you want some some kefir or whatever if it's as long as it's uh you know plain live culture all that sort of stuff you know that's fine but um it's not I don't think you need it it's very normal to not go every day I mean animals in the wild don't necessarily go every day certainly not carnivores and so it's not something that you necessarily have to do and um it's just very normal to just you know have that um you know have have in less frequent bowel motions because you don't have all this crud sitting in your body that has to get eliminated in fact when you're eating a whole bunch of plants and fiber that's the problem because you have excess amounts of garbage that your body can't use and it's just sitting there as waist putrifying so uh no that's not the case you absorb you absorb meat and you excrete the waste oh that was from Stephen um another question here is why do people eat higher protein to lose more weight um uh well I mean they they're thinking on the idea that that uh fat makes you fat which is not true they think of fat as just an excess calorie Source well you already have fat so you just don't need it it's not really the same stuff because you know you want actual certain nutrients from fats there's essential fats fatty acids that you have to have or you're not going to be as healthy as you could be may even die you know your brain's not going to work properly DHA and EPA these are essential fatty acids that you need to get from fat and then things like vitamin d and vitamin A and um K2 and all these other sorts of things these fat soluble vitamins you need to eat the fat to get that sort of stuff and and so you know there there are essential nutrients that exist in the fat that you need to have so fat is an essential nutrient it's not just a calorie source and so you know your and your body knows that you know if your body didn't want this fat like why would it be making bile bile is an expensive resource it takes it takes a you know a lot of energy and materials to make it your body's not doing that just for fun your body's doing that because it wants fat it needs fat you'll lose fat so you can anyone can starve them El into a smaller Dr size we all know that you know we talking about the starvation studies but it actually slows down your metabolism and you're telling yourself you're in a famine if you're getting the majority of your calories you know using the major energy I should say from protein degradation then that can actually cause harm over time it's called protein poisoning or rabbit starvation where you're just eating lean protein and you're and you're using those amino acids as as energy to then turn into glucose and ketone and things like that that's actually not really good for you you can get you can get very sick for from that um now is that is that just the case when you run out of your own fat and um and you're just running on proteins and you don't have fat from your own self and other you know that's a good question to ask but it's not necessarily something you necessar want to mess with um so I don't I don't think that that's a great idea to do that you the thing is too is that um you know if you're if you're just eating lean protein it just doesn't taste good after a while and you just be like your body's just like no stop this this is stupid so you eat less okay well that helps you not eat as much and and go on with your life but you know again your metabolism is going to slow down it's not the healthy way to go you know do you want to just starve yourself into smaller clothes or do you want to be healthy and you want to do you want to set up patterns of behavior that are healthy long term that you can maintain for the rest of your life and stay lean strong and healthy for the rest of your life that's what would prefer and that's what I recommend to my patients I find that it's it's a better result you know talking to Dr Rob CIS uh he said that it he he has you know hundreds and hundreds of patients that he's done this with um they said like the lowfat high protein ketogenic carnivore approach he says that he gets really deranged blood markers on his patients and they don't really do well they're hungry all the time they're cranky they're having other sort of symptoms that aren't aren't positive so he he said that you really need that fat so and you know I agree with that it's an essential nutrient also if you want to lose weight it's not about oh it's so so calorie dense okay yeah but it's calorie dense but it's not weight dense right we we weigh things that's what weight is it's it's a unit of of of mass right so not exactly but it's um you know we're measuring like grams have weight right so that has a weight to it calories don't a hot glass of water and a cold glass of water weigh the same amount right calories don't weigh anything okay and so grams weigh something so it's nine calories of fat nine calories per one gram of fat and it's four calories per one gram of protein in carbs right when you're when you're metabolizing protein and using his energy it actually takes energy to use that so it actually ends up getting about 3.4 calories per gram of protein so flip that around because what has the weight grams have the weight you flip that around it's one gram per nine calories of fat so if you're trying to get the same amount of calories then you actually want the fat right because it's you know 2.2 grams per nine calories of carbs and it's actually three grams of protein per 9 calories of of protein right so you're getting more grams and so that's what actually has weight so if you're eating the same amount of calories which are problematic on its face um you have to eat more you have to eat more lean protein you have to eat more carbs then you do the fat so in fact Fat's your friend there uh if you want to lose weight it's also about metabolism it's also about your health it's also about nutrients that's the most important thing I think I've got a cat that wants to go out so I might just pause here for a second and let him let him go one second [Music] Well turns out he didn't want to go he just wanted to sit next to the door so um left it open for him anyway if he wants to go out so um we go from Amelia Crowley uh want to know if this helps with broken bones well it just helps it helps give you collagen and other sorts of things that are going to help your body heal um and recover it's going to improve your immune system and your and and get appropriate inflammatory reactions which can help you uh knit bones back together and just heal in general yeah so the healthier you are and the um um the healthier you are and the better nutrition that you have uh the better you're going to be the better you're going to heal from uh different ill illnesses injuries surgeries all these sorts of things so yeah that can that should should help absolutely um I also wanted to say um you know uh wish um one of our regular uh viewers and commenters uh Donald uh you know wish him wish him well apparently he's in the hospital unfortunately I don't know exactly what he's in there with but apparently he's in the hospital and uh hopefully with nothing too serious and he can get better soon and get back home uh to everybody that he cares about so get well soon Donald I hope you uh I hope it's not something you serious and hope you get better very very soon Tom says love seeing your channel grow Dr sh keep up the good well thank you very much Tom I appreciate that um Mary Hart thank you for the Super Chat looks like your question is bit below Mary says um hi Dr chaffy I'm a 56-year-old male oh mark heart sorry I thought I misread that as Mary uh pardon me uh 5 56-year-old male with no weight issues I've been carnivore for 100 days my cholesterol is LDL 241 HDL 43 doctor wants to put me on a Statin says I'm high risk but are you though uh you know cholesterol just doesn't is isn't the cause of heart disease it just isn't that was a scapegoat invented by the sugar company so I have a uh video on YouTube just called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease and that goes into that um and Dr Paul Mason has a lot of videos on that um on cholesterol and heart disease and the real causes of heart disease there's a book by Dr Malcolm Kendrick um called the clot thickens it's all about that as well how this is nothing to do with cholesterol um and uh and many many many others that cardiologists and Interventional cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons and PhD researchers and professors of everything you can imagine all saying this is complete and utter crap and so uh you know check out that video just the the truth about cholesterol and heart disease there's also a book uh by a cardiologist named Dr Aima HRA called a statin-free life and he goes through the data and the literature you know it's it's not all it's cracked up to be unfortunately uh we have just been inundated with this false information and false sense of Hope from the stattin companies and and what's happened you know we're reducing cholesterol reducing meat reducing saturated fat we've done all these things and putting people on stattin is getting all younger and younger and younger and heart attacks are going up heart disease is going up right and around the world um this is this is the case and and deaths from heart attack around the world are going up out of proportion with the growth in in population so you know the the the deaths and rates of heart disease are going up around the world faster than the population is growing so you know it's um it's just not what it's been we've been told it was the sugar companies made this up they made it up and they paid off a bunch of unscrupulous professors and doctors such as um anel keys and bunch of guys from Harvard who then went on to very you know be head of the AHA and head of the USDA and they start pumping this sou the aha I mean it's just a just a mafia sort of organization they they are just they I mean were just sellouts I mean they sold out immediately I mean they didn't even wait around you know they uh you know as soon as they got on on the scene they were just like yep who has money let's do it and so the sugar companies bought them out you know they lied about the Framingham study that you know said that the Framingham study showed that higher olol um related to or was associated with because epidemiology so it's just Association was associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease mortality and um and in fact the Framingham study showed the opposite it showed that lower levels of total cholesterol uh related was associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease mortality so they lied they were paid to lie that's in the literature that's published data and uh then the American Heart Association was paid off by Proctor and Gamble because Proctor and gam well krisco was invented by the Germans in 1911 um as a as as mechanical lubricant for their ubro right so they're using they're using submarine lubricant they're using this tank lubricants in their in World War I and then Proctor and Gamble bought this from them and they uh then went on to pay U pay off the American Heart Association $20 million in today's valuation to lie and say it was better for your heart than animal fat such as butter and Lord so I mean they're just they're just a bunch of sellouts you know and and they didn't even sell out for much I mean I guess 20 million but a lot of these professors they they did it for like six grand you know it's equivalent of of $55,000 today they got $6,500 back then it's nothing you know they they just they sold out real cheap so your health means not much to them it's your health is worth about 55 grand of them that's that's what they'll sell your health for um and the health of the world so uh just just you know don't buy into these people it's um it's pretty bad and then you can look at that and you can look at the work of Dave Feldman Nick norwitz I had Nick Noritz on my podcast and we talked about the research they're doing just showing that this is crap uh this is not this is not actually something that um is is causing disease and in fact it the treatment is causing harm as well so I would look into those resources before you consider taking any new medications so this is a question from uh someone who wanted to stay Anonymous um but they said will carnivore diet help with temporal low epilepsy and possible mesial temporal sclerosis so the sclerosis part of that that's scarring so you know something's causing scarring to the temporal lobe generally scarring is permanent that's permanent damage to tissue and that doesn't come back sometimes scars can soften maybe you can stop the underlying problem that's causing sclerosis but uh It generally doesn't Undo You Know permanent damage which which scarring generally is permanent damage but you know it's um it can potentially help mitigate the situation and maybe help slow it down or stop it never know it depends on what's causing it and um you know because because sclerosis in the brain is could be caused by anything it's just scarring you know so it's um it depends on what's causing it temporal lob epilepsy epilepsy in general can be helped significantly by a ketogenic carnivore diet or ketogenic diet in general um temporal lobe epilepsy I believe is one of the ones that don't respond as well to uh ketogenic diet however um that doesn't mean that it doesn't respond it doesn't mean that someone can't have a very good resp response to it and it doesn't mean that it can't really help the situation to get them uh much better off and have it be much more manageable sometimes the definitive treatment is to identify where exactly in the temporal lobe that these seizures are originate from and you actually re resect that part out as long as it's not in like a speech and language Center or something very important like that and uh if that's possible then you can you can remove that piece and that can sometimes cure the epilepsy because you sort of take it out like a tumor there's just a little spot that's just going a bit Haywire but um you know long-term carnivore diet maybe uh will help with that if they want to avoid surgery and maybe um surgery can help too so it's it's definitely something that can help it's definitely something that can raise the seizure uh threshold and make it more difficult to get seizures and a lot of people it can cure them um even in temporal Lo epilepsy however you know in in some of the the literature that I've read it's um it can be a bit more difficult to to treat with um things like temporal Lo epilepsy where you have a distinct part of the brain that's just firing funny so just keep that in mind but 100% it's definitely worth a try and uh and should be tried because it's it's free it's cheap and easy keep the ketones up higher ketones seem to help that and uh really avoid anything else that can that can trigger these sorts of things so um I yeah good luck with that hopefully they they do well uh Mapes 2751 um thank you very much uh for the Super Chat so it says hey Dr chaffy can you talk about steroid homone binding globon level and cortisol and carnivore I keep hearing bad things and it's concerning otherwise doing great on Carnivore things yeah so this is a bit of a myth that that runs around both steroid hormone binding globulin and cortisol that you know if your ketos is too long that both of those start spiking up and you get all these problems uh first of all the answer to that is no that does not happen um but the I mean you know simply put I mean think about it this way like you know this is this is what we've been eating you what were we eating during the ice ages what what carbs were there to eat during the ice ages you know none right if you're in the Arctic Circle during an ice age you eating meat or you're dead like that's it you're eating meat and snow and so you're not getting any carbs right I mean there's going to be some little glycogen things like that in um in in muscle and and you know more in liver but it's not all that much and either way you're getting it right you get whatever you whatever you need you get for meat and that's the whole idea and if there's a bit of carbs and that does something right that's fine but you know what you know when people fast for periods of time or or they fast because of you know famine or because they're just animals you know can't get killed more than once a week or something like that their body doesn't just break down and freak out in fact people say oh fasting is really good for you and there's all these books you know uh talking about how great fasting is and you know all these studies talking about how great fasting is it's like okay so uh you're just in the same metabolism right you're not eating carbs then either you're in ketosis there as well you know uh so you know it'd be strange to that started harming you and I guess the argument is drink ketosis for longer than that then that's a problem but why would it be because you have entire populations that have never eaten carbs in their entire existence as a population right they don't have these problems so I did a whole thing on on cortisol and just ketosis and it's just called these ketosis uh harmful and so I did that with my friend Richard Smith and we we um just went through a lot of the data and the arguments um this is sort of the ray Pat um school of thought uh which I don't agree with and a lot of other people don't agree with it either you know I mean there's there's a lot of very mainstream medical doctors you know like Doctor Eric Westman at Duke uh who's been using ketogenic diets in their patients and even carnivore diets in their patients for years if not decades that you don't get these problems you don't get the problems that uh that they're describing you know and um and so you know it's um it's just this is not what you see so one of the things is oh your s shbg will go up U never seen that you know I've checked my uh my levels U I guess three times in the past six years they're always actually quite low very low normal you know and so that's never been a problem for me it's never been a problem for my patient population and never seen any actual evidence for that in the literature so um I no I don't I don't think that that's what it is you know that's something that some people say oh well I heard of a guy who once did this and his shbg went up it's like okay well there's a lot of things that can affect your your steroid horon binding globulin a lot of things and you should look those up because you know this is something that that uh you know maybe you can uh change in other ways you know uh but no being ketosis does not make that worse um I I can't say that it's going to make it better or worse or anything like that but I've certainly never seen it get worse uh in myself or in my patients and in fact I just see people's total testosterone and free testosterone go up dramatically so I have patients that that double even triple their testosterone uh by going on a carnivore diet and they maintain that I have patients that have been on testosterone replacement therapy that I I've inherited from other doctors I put them on a carnivore diet and all of a sudden their testosterone way too high because their bodies all of a sudden kicked into gear and started making a lot of testosterone okay so we need to wean this down wean this down I've actually taken off a lot of people off of trt they just don't need it anymore I just took a guy off yesterday you know he um you know he was um uh yeah he was he was like 300 points High you know it was like crazy you know this is this is like a 65y old man he' been on trt for years and it was just his his testr was just creeping up creeping up creeping up now all of a sudden you know it's 300 points higher than than what you know I would consider optimal for a 25-year-old right and so it's just like okay well hey he was on a very low dose of trt at that point because they sort of weaned down already so it's just like hey why don't you just cut it out we'll check it again in two months and see where you're at you know so you know this is something that's I I see the exact opposite of all of these things and um uh but if you want to check out more on the cortisol things specifically or just is ketosis harmful for you um check that out check that video out that I do with Richard Smith and here's uh my sweet little Ellie Melly saying hello um with a super chat which is very sweet and uh not necessary but thank you for that um El says thank you for curing my chill Blain psoriasis restless leg syndrome along with anym uh but these things annoyed me the most I suffered every day with these ever since I was a little girl you're the best well that's good I'm really glad that helped I still don't believe chill blaines are real but I'm glad that you think that they're gone and so I love you very much and I'm glad to see you thank you for watching it's good to see you uh let's see where were we here um there's a question for Michael qan but I'm not seeing something oh there we go so thank you very much for the Super Chat Michael Michael says what is a correct percentage of calories from fat versus protein to lose weight without much exercise miss my super duper chat for uh $20 uh yeah so it is uh it is dependent on the individual so again you need a a certain amount of fat you need a certain amount of protein and so you know your body's is should tell you that and that goes by taste so you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good aim for one to one to two grams of fat to one gram of protein so that goes anywhere from 70 to 80% calories from fat um and then the rest from protein mostly the rest from protein and that is is typically what people need and require and if you're just eating what your body demands and you're giving your body what ites and's for it will start properly and your metab will start working properly start working properly and your um and your I think there's some I a message here that my Wi-Fi might be a bit compromised so if that is a problem I apologize but hopefully it works and um but if you're if you're eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good you're aiming for that range um then you just eat until your body tells you to stop as long as you're only eating meat and you're not on medications that increase your hunger that's important too so so as long as all those things are the case then um then your body should just take care of itself if most people lose weight pretty early on and they continue to lose weight some people don't some people because of hormonal disturbances metabolic disturbances it takes longer but eventually they heal and their bodies get better and their hormones heal and their metabolism boosts up and then they start losing weight and uh so it'll happen and so uh aim for that ratio but just get enough prot R get enough fat eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good um eat enough fat so that you're getting soft stools but not so much that you're getting loose stools and you should be fine uh get Western thank you very much for the Super Chat I have Moya Moya is are are there concerns uh to my blood flow to the brain I I mooya there are concerns to my blood flow in the B so yeah mooya is uh it's a rare but very serious disease um it's I think I actually did see a study on ketogenic diets helping moyao because someone else asked this and so uh it's it's definitely going to help you in a lot of other ways we know all the other ways that keto carnivore diets help um you with different sorts of INF inflammatory diseases and vasculitis and things like that it's going to lower inflammation it's going to help with those sorts of things I am almost positive that I saw a study on ketogenic diets and Moya Moya um I'm going to have to go back and look that up again but you can do this in your own time you don't have to wait for me if you go on uh PubMed or even Google Scholar you know everyone has access to that um and so you just go on there and just put in Moya Moya and ketogenic diet and um should should have things come up and take a look at that but I am fairly certain I looked that up I'll write it down to for myself again to um look up again um but I'm I'm pretty damn sure it's going to help you in a lot of other ways as well though it's going to reduce inflammation and and improve uh your health in many other ways and so I think I still think it's definitely worth it but uh I I actually do think that that is something that has been studied so uh worth a shot anyway and um uh give it a shot and see how you go it's it's it's not going to hurt anyway it's certainly only have you only have room for improvement and it's not going to it's not going to make it worse Voit Bernard thank you for the Super Chat hey Doc or hey doctor ever since going full carnivore last three months I get vivid dreams not scary just like my brain is like a new machine I feel overall great and like a new uh Baseline Baseline what do you think well I think that's awesome um and that's great that your brain is is sort of working like that I know El gets crazy vivid dreams uh because I have to hear about them uh every day and it's like oh I had this crazy dream and all these things um that didn't happen and aren't real you know went through my head and so I was like oh wow that's that's great so um you know enjoy them hopefully that's uh you know that I mean it's fun to have vivid dreams and remember them and sometimes having lucid dreams where you actually realize you're dreaming if you go to bed trying to think like okay I'm going to try to realize I'm Dreaming sometimes you'll have U be able to do that and you sort of wake up in your dream you're like oh I'm dreaming and instant superpowers right because you're alive in your own imagination you just do whatever the hell you want it's it's pretty fun every time I'm able to do that I instantly start flying shooting lightning bolts out of my hand like the emperor from uh Star Wars and and like materialize like diamonds and things like that and uh and when I was a kid women so like it's that was it it was just like it was like clockwork that was it instantly was like floating up shooting lasers out of or lightning bolts out of my hands and then you know jewels and and women would show up so it's it's kind of funny what what your brain comes up with in those situations and um but uh so B vitamins can do that too so if you take if you take more B vitamins you get your B vitamins up to Snuff you you tend to have more vivid dreams and even lucid dreams and that's what I I learned when I was a kid and so I would take a a multi vitamin A B multivitamin before I went to bed every night and um more often than not I would get lucid dreams when I would would take a B vitamin before I went to bed which is kind of fun so I would expect that that's probably something to do with it at least that the B vitamins were affecting you in some way so that's good you're getting you're getting healthier and getting more nutrients Andrew G thank you for the Super Chat was keto for years worst Scout attack in my life was when I went carnivore haven't had one since over a year now so perfect that goes back to what we're we were talking about earlier that sometimes people have do have more gout attacks when they go carnivore but then they go away and so that's perfect so really glad to hear that um that you you haven't had any since then and hopefully that continues Annabella the happy carnivore thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr Anthony uh love your cat yeah thank you um it's 287 days carnivore for me I'm off blood pressure meds and one diabetes tablet I've lost 30 to 40 kgs and I'm so happy and strong well that's amazing thank you so much for sharing that that's absolutely fantastic and that's always what we want to see you know people getting healthy and coming off medications and and instead of going on them you know you should be able you know I mean that that should be the marker of health is coming off medications as opposed to going on medications to try to keep you healthy you're obviously unhealthy if you have to take medications now sometimes you need them and they're very useful and I still prescribe medications for people when when it's necessary and it's and it's helpful for them um but more often than not it's something temporary right you know some antibiotics that get them through you know a rough infection or post-operative infection or you know something being used in surgery obviously there's different medications that you just have to use and but in my in my uh you know metabolic Health medic patients really don't need to use all that much and often it's it's a stop Gap while their body's healing and then you you can come off of that so they're on you know someone had their thyroids not producing you know functioning normally it can take a while for the thyroid to get get back going again even on a carnivore diet they're sick now you know and uh and so you know you put them on some thyroid medication for a few months and you get them on a carnivore diet during that time time you take them off and check them again and they don't need it so you know that's that's what I like to do and so it's great to see people getting off medication as opposed to going on medication so uh thank you very much for that and uh good luck with it thank you very much for sharing hopefully that's helpful to others uh Maya thank you for the Super Chat being in menopause is it more difficult to lose weight on Carnivore any suggestions should I avoid dairy uh probably good idea to avoid area that's pretty classic weight loss stall as are um artificial sweeteners just basically just just cut out the junk I mean that's the first first and foremost you cut out all the processed garbage right and then you just eat whole meats and you just drink water and that's it um and yeah avoid Dairy U butter usually fine otherwise uh don't and it's certainly not milk because of the carbs and that that can spike your your insulin so yes people can can have a more difficult time in menopause um just due to the the changes in your hormones however I see a lot of women in menopause that do very well sometimes it takes sort of a bit of a slow burn and it it takes a bit longer to get going but then it does and so sometimes their hormones have to improve their health has to improve their metabolism has to improve it also matters on your history with with weight loss and if you're doing these yo-yo diets and starving yourself and generally eating a lot of carbs and sugar you know that can give you leptin resistance insulin resistance lowered metabolism so that all needs to heal um sometimes before you get get uh the weight loss that you want and also weight loss is not the same thing as fat loss because you can lose fat and put on muscle and stay the same weight and so be more interested in your health and how you feel and as a very distant second your body composition basically never what you weigh because that's not an accurate dep pictor of your body composition so look at how you look look at how your clothes are fitting you know if you're you you can get you know the your body circumference sort of things I had a patient that just came in uh yesterday and she uh was overweight and she hadn't really been able to lose weight in a lot of way in by a number of different ways and she went carnivore she was able to do it she said it's amazing I feel absolutely fantastic and she said I haven't lost all that much weight but like I look different and I feel different and I think she said she lost like 9 cm off her her chest her bust and then like 11 centimeters off her hips right so off her hip circumference so you know dramatic Improvement right away right and so but it wasn't as reflected on the scales as it was on her body measurements so she knew that that the fat was leaving right but the the scale now to be fair she did lose I think it was like six or so kilos you know so that's that's a solid 14 pounds you know and so that's not that's nothing to to laugh at right but uh but she she saw you know a very big difference in in her uh measurements as well and that's and that's what you want right you want you want to focus on your health how you feel first and foremost and then um secondarily dist second you want body composition and weight M weight can can be tricky right uh but just eat fatty meat till it stops tasting good drink water and avoid everything else and you'll get healthy the weight come with that as a product of that you know if you're having other sorts of issues and health issues you know that you may need support with from your doctor sometimes that needs to be addressed too um and then that can help further weight loss as well so um think about that as well if you're if you're sort of being really stubborn and it's been like you know several months and things aren't really going the direction you want you know get a blood panel see what what's going on in your body you know maybe there's something that that you that that needs to be addressed um that uh you know you need a bit of help with and you know see how you go with that so T lady from X says hi for Maine well hello Maine uh nice to see you here thank you very much for joining Jennifer P thank you for the Super Chat my creatinine was uh 36 and my egfr was normal do I need to be concerned about possible kidney disease also do I have also could you also could have too much cinnamon could too much cinnamon have lowered creatinine I don't know why it would um your creatinine is great I mean you know having having low creatinine is just fine I means your kidneys are are you know just pumping things out so I wouldn't worry about that so no I mean you don't you don't have kidney disease you know your your kidneys are working just fine um so no I wouldn't don't worry about that no you don't get kidney disease from going carnivore in fact a lot of people are curing their kidney disease by going carnivore you're removing a lot of nephrotoxic substances from plants like oxalates and you're improving your nutrition protein fat profile from getting more meat and studies actually show that increased protein actually increases kidney function it doesn't decrease it so oh yeah I can't have all this protein it's just you know you need a low protein diet so that your kidneys aren't working so hard that's stupid you're not giving your body and your kidneys and your DNA enough uh building blocks actually function properly so that doesn't uh that doesn't wash and um and so you know that's uh that's not something you need to worry about you're generally people's kidneys function get a lot better when they go on Carnivore diet so uh I think that you you'll be just fine and by those numbers you are oh um allarus thank you for the Super Chat is carnivore okay without an ILO SQL valve yeah absolutely and it's probably even better because you're going to have much less residue you're going to absorb a lot more of your food before it ever reaches the ilal SQL valve that's the valve that connects the small intestine to the large intestine and so yes uh you can absolutely do that uh if you're eating a whole bunch of fiber and all these other sorts of things it's just clogging the works and and delaying absorption and all these other sorts of things so uh yes it can absolutely help you in that situation really any situation because it's it's the most nutrient-dense thing that we're ever going to eat it's the best thing for us it's what we're designed for and it's what our body is best capable of absorbing and extracting nutrients from and benefiting from and so it's uh yes it's beneficial in really all situations so uh good luck with that I'm sure you'll do really well Tony Vargas thank you for the Super Chat how would you explain calories to a professional that still believes in counting them uh yeah so I mean I've I've done some videos on this but basically and and many people have too you know Dr Robert lustic does one called a calorie is not a calorie and I think I think um other people have as well who else has I think Zoe harkham has um I have um and I yeah I just sort of put one out recently like calories not a calorie think of it this way carbohydrates are all different sorts of carbohydrates all different sorts of amino acids all different sorts of fats they all are unique organic complex molecules that have complex or chemical interactions in your body right because we're a chemical Factor we're not a combustion engine these don't just go into a a burner and and burst and and and burn up and you we're not locomotives we're not steam engines we're not combustion engines so we don't we don't burn things that's what a calorie is it's the heat that escapes when you burn something well we don't burn them so it's completely uh it's not applicable to our system at all we're chemical factories and we use chemicals in chemical Fashions they have chemical interactions we're just bags of chemicals that's all it is there all chemical interactions going on so when you have all these carbohydrates you know you know dozens of different carbohy hydrates they all are unique individual organic molecules that have unique individual chemical interactions in your body they do different things in your body then they have hormonal responses they trigger different hormones in different ways and or block them in different ways like glucose will raise blood sugar a lot of other things will will um raise your glucose levels and stimulate insulin insulin affects a hundred different processes in your body actually more than a 100 one of them is blood sugar control but as it goes up to control your blood sugar it's now up and affecting everything at that heightened level right so that's C causing going to cause a very uh big imbalance in your hormones and it's going to shut down autophagy it's going to block your growth hormone it's going to uh cause a lot of other problems in your body as well uh it's going to block the conversion of testosterone and estrogen in women so they have too little estrogen can cause PCOS cause insulin resistance you get insulin resistance of the brain it's called Alzheimer's it's called type three diabetes PCOS polycystic ovarian syndromes leading caus of infertility in women that's called type four diabetes you know i' I've sort of coined the the term the other day that cancer is type five diabetes you know so you raise your insulin you stuff up a lot of pro a lot of things and you cause a lot of problems and so that's not what you want to do you eat carbohydrates it does that does not happen when you eat fat right so that's a different different thing that happens fructose is a different carbohydrate molecule it directly blocks leptin insulin will block leptin too that's your satiety hormone you end end up overeating right fructose will on its own block uh uh leptin in the hypothalamus leptin needs to go to the hypothalamus tell your brain how much energy have but it also influences the hypothalamus and all the hormones that come out of your hypothalamus in pituitary so there's knock on effects even further right fructose blocks that insulin blocks that fructose will also upregulate gin which is your hunger hormone that says my God I'm hungry right and so again you overeat so there are different hormonal and chemical interactions in your body that these things have you cannot just boil them down to how much energy escapes when you burn them because we don't burn them we use them as chemicals protein amino acids again you have all these complex organic molecules that have different interactions in your body first of all protein is generally not used as energy it's used as the physical structures and building blocks for the molecules in our body everything that your DNA codes for is a protein it's a string of amino acids that's what those base pairs are you're you're you're coding for different amino acids and you have this string of amino acids they fold up into a protein that goes off and does its job right your body makes proteins it's made out of proteins so you're using that to build your body and build your cells and the molecules in your cells you're not using that for energy right so you eat a whole bunch of protein oh I got all those calories I got all that no you didn't you're using that to run your body right and they have different hormonal interactions in your body you know you have cartine it helps process and run your mitochondria that doesn't matter how many calories you get from burning carnitine you're not burning it not burning anything but you're not even using it as a as a uh fuel source then you have fat it's the same thing you have all these different fatty acids they all work completely differently in your body and none of them uh can be simplified down to burning them and the heat Escape some of these things you use structurally DHA and EPA 20% of your brain the physical structures of your brain is DHA is made out of fats you have physical structures in your brain and your body and your nervous system and your cells that are fat and cholesterol they're not being used as being used as um as energy sources cholesterol not used as an energy source that's the building blocks for your whole body again for large parts of your brain the myelination of your nerve cells and for your hormones all your hormones are synthesized from from cholesterol uh as is uh vitamin D which is a hormone and every cell in your body is made out of cholesterol the the membrane is a lipid bil layer of cholesterol molecules your bile is made out of cholesterol so these things aren't just used to burn up oh I ate 2,000 calories did you right because you're not using all that as energy most of that's getting used other in in other ways also what about Fiber Well fiber has calories you can't access them right because no one you don't have cellulase and you don't ferment the the the food in your body before you absorb it right so you're not getting anything from fiber and in fact fiber can block out the absorption of up to 30% of the nutrients that in the food you eat okay so now you're even getting less calories you're getting less nutrients so what does that mean so you you put something in your mouth that doesn't actually mean that that's translating into energy in your body we're not just putting something down the pipe and that's just throwing something in a furnace right it's way too simplistic is an idea that that someone came up with uh something almost 200 years ago now and um you know he was trying his best but like I'm sorry it's just not it's not good enough you know and so H you know when you when you break down U amino acids for energy like I said before it actually you actually have to use some energy to uh to do that to process it to get it ready to be used as fuel because that's not what you use that's not your primary fuel source it's not even your secondary fuel source um so as as far as the macros go because your your body will use carbohydrates long before it uses proteins and fat to too especially so when you're doing that you end up only getting about 3.4 calories if we're going to use that stupid outdated term um because it's uh it has to take some energy to to make it turn it into energy you got you need money to make money right so again you flip it around because you you it's nine calories per gram of fat and it's 4 calories per gram of carbohydrates and 3.4 calories per gram of protein but calories don't weigh anything right and they're not all used as energy anyway so you flip that around and you have 1 gram per 9 calories of fat 2.2 gram of carbohydrates per 9 calories of carbs and then three grams of protein per nine calories of of protein right so you know that is a very different model right and so you know and and again you know going back to the the Minnesota starvation uh study um people were eating so little that if it was just calories in calories out they would have lost more weight than they started with so it's not calories in calories out it's hormonal it's metabolic your body can shut this down say Okay less it's coming in less is going out you know and what you eat that's going into fat and we're just going to run on the bare minimum here and people feel slow and tired and sluggish and they're miserable that's because they don't have energy because their body is not allowing them to use that energy it needs to store that energy and just we are just on life support here and we're not going to let you blow it out and then just blow out our spendings and we're dead right so they lost a whole bunch of weight and then you just plateaued right and there is very slow creep after that right you can starve to death you certainly can do that takes a long time and if you're getting anything in your body will get your metabolism down and try to reach homeostasis even with a very small amount of of nutrients coming in so hopefully that was helpful maybe we can clip that and just put on that on YouTube and and get that um get that out there so that we can just direct people to that because it's um it's a calorie is not a calorie it's not a calorie and we don't run on calories we run on chemical energy anyway and uh and you don't use all of these molecules as energy to begin with a lot of times you're using them as physical structures and uh and building blocks and for different processes in your body so um yeah that's what I would say to your your friend who still believes in counting calories Leisa c um had a question here it says when I was growing up I never would have believed believed I would be talking with people all over the world uh while a guy lets a cat out uh yeah well there you go your dreams have come true and uh now you can uh now you can rest easy so um all right Annabelle the happy carnivore thank you very much for the Super Chat Dr a do you watch state of origin rugby league I really need to I mean I'm in Australia I have access to to rugby all the time and I I don't watch it and that's it's because I'm just used to not watching because it's so difficult to watch rugby in America it's it was almost impossible for me growing up and now when it's just like oh yeah I could just turn it on I don't I mean I don't even have TV really I mean I have um I don't have I don't know how to get that I have to get on some streaming servers or something like that um because I just don't I don't watch actual television you know I don't even know I don't even know if I'm connected to actual television um I certainly don't have a plan or anything like that so I'll have to figure that out but um maybe I'll write a note to myself when I look up Moya MOA watch rugby um because I need to remember that because I like that I I like rugby because I love playing rugby that's my main thing and it's it's definitely fun to watch but um I I love I've really I was you know I was I was never a fan of of this of the game as as a spectator because I never was a spectator I never watched it you know the first rugby game I ever saw was the one I first played in you know so that's that's what I really love because I was like this is awesome I just absolutely love this and and so and I I just had no access to rugby games growing up or even into adulthood until I was like living in in Europe and um and that was great but it was uh it was just I you know I played rugby because I love playing rugby you know not because I I I loved watch watching rugby I'd never watched rugby you know I just love playing it um but I do love watching rugby and I went to the you know World Cup watched some quarterfinals games that was awesome and I was like I need to keep doing this you know there's a super 15 team here in Perth why am I not there you know like that's uh well I know why because I work Saturdays and I work pretty much every day but I need to start doing that where I just um you know take some Saturdays for for games because that it's uh silly that they're just sitting right here and I can watching super 15 games and and I'm not so uh but uh I haven't been watching rugby all that often but um thank you for the reminder I'm going to start doing that Patrice Thomas thank you for the Super Chat I'm not seeing Oh there's there's another one down here maybe that's it um well thank you for the next Super Chat too appreciate that Patrice uh hi Dr chaffy I have moderate calcium score and on Carnivore for a month now I was taking um serapeptase and uh Nic ninas with some lipas in the formula as I am a bit worried uh your opinion on glycation so uh I can't I can't speak too much on the on the um you know on the meds that you're taking and supplements that you're taking uh because I I don't I don't use those and I don't prescribe those so I don't I don't know much about them um but as far as glycation is concerned that's really really to do with uh getting your blood sugar down so you're on a carnivore diet that's going to do that you know do a high fat version of that you know keep your blood sugar nice and low and um you know calcium score you can have a moderate plaque or not much plaque or reducing plaque your calcium score can go up slightly because it's just sort of calcifying that stuff that's already there um it doesn't really tell you how much soft plaque you have so you know only an angiogram would do that but it is good information and you can just check this a few years down the road after you've done this and see what it is just know that you can actually get reduction in your soft plaque and an increase in your CAC score just because there's just a bit more calcification even though the total plaque burden is actually recing so just keep that in mind that it's not it's not a perfect measure and you know otherwise you know you just you just um uh you just live a healthy life and then you just check this you have this data point and then you just get data points down the road uh you if you look at the lean mass hyperresponders studies uh data put out by um Dave Feldman you have people on keto carnivore high fat meat-based ketogenic diets which carnivore diet fits into uh and these people had elevated so-called elevated LDL I think it's perfectly fine way it is because your body's doing it on purpose so it's physiologic iCal that they uh were doing this for 4.7 years on average and the trend was to actually reduce their aosc orotic burden on angiogram right so that's what you need to know and uh I would just use these data points and just check data points sleep matters stress matters other sorts of outside influences medications smoking drinking those sorts of things those all matter so you need to address all those things too Food Matters too it's a big one and you've got that one I think you've got that one very much correct and so I think good things will happen because of that don't neglect all the other things too those are all very important as well good luck with that M thank you for the Super Chat 11 months carnivore and still have HBP high blood pressure no sugar except in beef um and bacon Hashimoto low T3 so for Hashimoto you um HBP are we are we talking Hashimoto or we talking high blood pressure I'm thinking he's saying high blood pressure anyway so with Hashimoto you really want to just be just red meat and water that's how you're going to do the best that's how you're going to get your your your um antibodies down down down to nothing and then you're hope hoping that your thyroid heals because you're being it's being damaged right now with your thyroid antibodies the Hashimoto's antibodies so you need to get those down and out um if if you stay on a line diet just red meat and water high fat red meat and water diet um then you will get those antibodies down Mo it Hashim Moto is a stubborn one those those those antibodies linger around for a long time especially when you get them into the lower regions and uh but eventually they go away for most people I mean I I I do track my patients antibodies and I see these just come right down and they keep going down until they're undetectable when they are you know your body's going to try to heal your thyroid but it may not completely heal it all the way there is such a thing as Damage Done you get scarred damaged tissue and it's just not going to work properly and so you may need to continue taking thyroid medication but a lot of people are able to reduce their thyroid medication and potentially come off their thyroid medication so but just you know if you have low T3 then you should probably take um thyroid medication to to correct that because you have this damage to your thyroid um if HB PP is indicating high blood pressure not all uh causes of high blood pressure are to do with what we eat um you check your homosysteine though and your B12 if your homocysteine is high that can cause irritation of the vessels and cause contraction and it can also um uh yeah so that that can cause high blood pressure and you know when you increase your B12 and your folate that generally uh suppresses homocysteine is sort of counterbalance each other so you increase your B12 and folate and Homo goes down eat liver that's what that does um that's the great source of that and uh you get your B12 up and um you don't have to eat excessive amounts of liver just you know just a bit you know you know once you know once a day or three days a week something like that just as much as you need and um but not all causes of high blood pressure are dietary so people can have still have uh high blood BL pressure may need High you know medications there are other reasons and causes for high blood pressure those should be investigated most doctors just go like ah blood pressure medications work we don't need to investigate it why not because some of these things are reversible you can address and they cause other problems um and foch chromosoma you know 5% of refractory U hypertensive patients have a FOC chromosoma which is just pumping out adrenaline all the time okay well that raises your blood pressure but also do a lot of other things in your body that you don't want and so it's important to to get on top of that so there there are you know sort of three major causes of of um of high blood pressure that can be addressed and reversed and um and the rest you do with diet and if if something left over you know take medications that's not uh that's not a bad thing to do if you need it uh Kylie kle thank you for the Super Chat will this diet repair my squashed brain line received by my car accident so possibly your like nerves peripheral nerves or um maybe like axonal injury sometimes people get axonal damage which are the you know the the wires coming down from the neurons um it can it can definitely help the thing is is that uh there is such a thing as damage done but there are a lot of people that have dramatically improved their health and their neurological Health from going on to a carnivore diet and ketogenic diets in general which a carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet so if you do it ketogenic then uh that has been shown to help heal from traumatic brain injury so that that's what you're you're talking about there you know you had a you had a car accident and you know what sounds like a traumatic brain injury and yes that can help you know how far you are distant from that injury you know May mean that you get Maybe be more or less good out of it but it's going to help you it's uh has been shown to improve U TBI outcomes uh traumatic brain injury recovery U just running on ketones just your brain running on ketones it will run better because your brain likes ketones better it works better on ketones and you're getting more fat you're getting more DHEA you're getting or DHA you're also getting more DHEA but you're getting more DHA EPA and cholesterol in your body and your brain is able to heal and it's able to run better more properly so yes I would expect that to help if there's permanent damage that can't be healed then unfortunately it's not going to be able to you know undo that uh but the body can healed from so many things and I've seen so many people that have had Strokes 30 years earlier and they you know Dave Mack his YouTube channel he had a stroke 30 years ago he'd weakness down his right side and he'd done keto he' done Atkins you know he had very stable neurology for 30 years now he's walking normal and he doesn't have uh the the same amount of weakness he says it's not perfect it's not exactly where the left is but it's a hell a lot better it doesn't it doesn't uh hold him back like it used to so is 100% worth it worth trying and um you know so good luck with that I hope it I hope that works out um Sor I'm just reading some of the comments here okay so all right well good luck with that um it can absolutely help it can just improve the energy of the brain as well and even if it doesn't heal you know some of the damage if that that damage is permanent it can still really help a lot and so uh good luck with that I hope that that really helps um all right guys I think I'm going to say just let's stop the super chats now because I want to try to get through most of these but actually do have to run to work in about half an hour so let's try and and not do anymore uh from now and I'll um try to get through all of these if if I can and uh and go from there uh keto tobet thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy a significant association between low or lowered cholesterol levels and violence is found across many types of studies why do you think that's the case love the carnivore is then appreciate what you do yeah I've I've seen that as well um and depression and mental health issues as well I think that's exactly it your brain is made out of cholesterol your body's made out of cholesterol your hormones are made out of cholesterol you are unhealthy if you don't have enough cholesterol that is just a fact and that's a fact that the drug companies and you know and the sugar companies have been trying to hide from you for the last 60 70 years but it's true and so it's this this is not something that you want to play with and so I think that's why you're just unhealthy your brain's not working properly you don't have the physical structures that that that can help you properly you're also doing other things that that um to lower you know you're doing things uh that lower your your cholesterol or eating a certain way that lowers your cholesterol that's also going to cause other problems you you're eating lowfat you know high carb diets and your body doesn't work properly your brain doesn't work properly you you're not eating enough meat and your your brain doesn't work properly there's that that study out of Oxford in 2008 where they found that after five years uh vegan brains it shrank by over 5% right so you're not get enough B12 you're not getting enough U of these other things as well your brain's shrinking your your axons are melinated with cholesterol so you don't have enough cholesterol your brain doesn't work properly your body doesn't work properly your hormones aren't able as abundant you can't make them you're going to have uh a lot of problems in fact you know that might just be one of the things right there you know people say it's like oh when someone's their testosterone is super high you know they get Roid Rage and yeah that's possible to freak out if you're if you're just completely off the charts on your hormones but if you're off the charts on the other direction if your testosterone is too low you also get really agitated and really aggressive and really angry and you're really sharp and you like snap at people and so I've spoken to so many doctors that deal with that sort of hormonal side of things and they have men that have low testosterone and they say that you know they're you know you put them on some testosterone you just bump that up into more youthful numbers and and their wives come in with them next time and go thank you he's so much nicer now you know and so you that could be part of it as well if you don't have enough cholesterol you don't have enough testosterone testosterone is made from cholesterol and so if you don't have enough cholesterol you're not making enough testosterone if you're getting a bunch of plant oils they have plant sterols that's plant cholesterol and that lowers our cholesterol because our brain our body thinks we don't need as much cholesterol and so you don't make as much you can't make hormones out of plant steroids so you're not going to make hormones properly and you're going to have low testosterone and you're going to be grumpy and you're going to be uh grouchy and angry and all that sort of stuff and obviously that can lead to violence as well although it doesn't always but uh yeah I think that those are some some significant reasons why that could be golf shrimp thank you very much for the Super Chat one will carnivore help me heal faster from gomasa surgery two I'm gaining a lot of body fat eating uh 7327 ground beef why is that uh well as far as as far as surgery is concerned yeah you know it'll just it'll help your body heal in general and it will help you uh just get better overall and um you know if your body's working better and you're healing better and you have more protein and fats and all these sorts of things you know these are the building blocks materials your body is using to heal you so yes you will heal better from surgery um and with a proper uh diet and gaining a lot of fat eating ground beef well you know if you're if you're eating other things with it that can influence things if you're eating any dairy or artificial sweeteners or anything like that that can influence it you know if you have gyom it could be that your hormones are out of balance and that could be influencing that as well what I would do is just cut out absolutely everything besides meat and water and then just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good if you're on medications that may bump up your hunger signals then you know then you you may a want to get off those medications or B um understand that your hunger signals are are artificially raise and maybe you limit it at that point it's very uncommon that uh people have to do that but some people are on like hydrocortisone cortisol sort of mimicking agents those glucocorticoids they will ramp up your appetite you're on different sorts of um um you know antis psychotics and things like that you that that does make people more hungry and put on weight and uh just just jacks up your hunger signals and you just you just eat more than your body actually wants so if it's only if you're getting the proper signals you can actually listen to your body and and not count calories and macros and all that sort of stuff but when you are not in that situation when you are taking a medication or have an illness or something that uh that will change that hunger signals or you're eating something that will change your hunger signals well then you have to be then you have to sort of have some input on what you eat as well and so just you know keep that in mind as well but a lot of time um you know if you're it depends on where you're coming from with your hormones and your metabolism and just eventually just eating enough meat you know until it stops tasting good and um you know and that's going to bolster your metabolism and you're going to eventually lose weight some people do gain weight early on but it has to do with their metabolism and their hormones and when it's when those things get into balance and those and their body is happy with where at that's when you start losing losing weight and body fat so good luck with that I'm sure you'll be fine just keep going with it give it time it's it is a process you know as as the saying goes you know there are no shortcuts you walk 10 miles into the woods you walk you got to walk 10 miles out so you know just give it time it you know it's not going to take you know it took decades to to get us into the situation that we're in it doesn't take decades to come out but it may take months or even years and so just keep that in mind and just uh just understand that this is the healthiest way that we can eat focus on your health and how you feel and the improvements that you're seeing there the weight will come working out helps lifting weights doing sprints those are both good things uh Katie Rose thank you for the Super Chat will sibo go away eventually without treatment well uh we don't know 100% but there are a lot of people that are experiencing that there are small small case series with like six patients that um with sibo going on specifically a carnivore diet not even a ketogenic diet but a carnivore diet and uh and then uh you know fixing that and and solving that within within you know four several weeks actually and so um yeah and so that that can definitely help and U most people that I've spoken to I haven't actually spoken to anybody that hasn't had a positive result with CBO and carnivore you know they may exist um but there's probably reasons for that um so yeah give it a give it a shot you know if it's not if it's not shifting and you need help with treatment then then go for that you know do get help I think the medicine is still helpful in these sort of acute circumstances but the body can heal from just so much it's just ridiculous so I would give that a go anyway Edson Melendez thank you for the Super Chat thank you for the amazing work you do for all of humanity oh thank you very much I appreciate that um do you supplement with iodine if so what dose and how often any other supplements you think are worth uh paying attention to I I don't personally I I sort of you know when when Dr Barry and and Dr Bri talking about like hey iodine iodine iodine you should use this I was just like oh really should I I guess it's not that big of a deal and um and so I sort of maybe put like a drop or two of that sort of Lugal I I don't know what that dose is uh what that comes out to be I sort of tried it and I did I did that for a while I didn't really notice any difference um I had already checked my thyroid though and it was actually in optimal levels so I wasn't too worried about it if you so my view on it now is if you have an iodine deficiency supplement with iodine you should be able to get all the stuff from the meat that you're eating now the meat that we're eating isn't the Wild game that we grew up on right and so so you know and and the fields and land that they're being raised on is not the wild west that it used to be so you know there is that and so it could be a difference in in um nutrient profiles and potentially with iodine as well but you can check if your thy if your thyroid is doing great you're fine if your you check your iodine your thyroid levels if they're all fine then you probably don't need to you're getting everything you need from from your sub from your food um you maybe you add in some some organs and things like that you add in some seafood and um and those sorts of things now jump that right up as well so I don't think most people need to do that uh I certainly don't uh feel the need to supplement with it my my thyroid does great I haven't actually checked my iodine but um but my my thyroid is working well and that's the whole point of taking iodine is to support your thyroid the other caveat is that Hashim Oto thyroiditis you we had a person on here before with that that is one of the most common autoimmune diseases and I see it all the time it is really underdiagnosed and that if you take iodine when you have hashimotos it can actually exacerbate the hashimotos and make it worse and make your thyroid function worse so be careful with that so um you know if you may have something in the background and iodine sort of makes it worse you know most people should be fine with it and and um you know is it is it does it make it worse in the context of a carnivore diet as opposed to just the standard diet I don't know I don't know if there's a difference in there but that is what is um you know reported in in the literature is that you take iodine when you're have Hashimoto it can make it worse so just be mindful of that if you have Hashimoto you know and your iodine's normal really I wouldn't worry about it and I would avoid it you know eating food with iodine in it you know fine but you know just taking excessive amounts probably not fine so uh but yeah just check your iDine if you need it you know uh and you're not getting everything you need from the meat you're eating because the meat doesn't quite have enough of it because of how it was raised and where it was raised you know fine that's myy um I think for most people it's perfectly fine and fairly safe you know as Dr Barry points out people in Japan have uh much higher levels of iodine uh consumption just because of their normal Seafood diet then then people would get from from a couple drops of Lugal uh iodine in their in their uh water so um personal choice but I don't feel the need for it and I I certainly haven't seen the need for it in my own in my own live check you know that's that that's the best way to do it Triple L thank you for the Super Chat I yeah there we go there's your question there um question is hi Dr chaffy I been on Carnival for 9 days I am on high blood pressure meds and wake up five times a night to pee is this for my meds or salt I use element daily and add salt to food well just salt to taste um you can use element te don't use the ones that have um sweeteners like Stevia or anything else or any flavorings just just the normal electrolytes that's what you should use and um and then um you know waking up five times a night to pee I'm guessing that's probably predates this and so that just be prostate issue and just need to you know give it time because a lot of people find that they actually improve that too so hopefully that will as well um so you know and uh it depends on what high blood pressure meds you're on I mean sometimes people put on diuretics for their high blood pressure and that will make you pee a lot um and so it depends on when you're taking that also um and just how much water you're drinking and when you're drinking the water as well so you know try to frontload the water on in the morning I don't think you need to use excessive amounts of electrolytes or salt or anything just salt to taste and you probably don't need the element um just eat meat drink water and uh eat to eat to taste and drink to thirst salt to taste and I think just leave it at that and uh you know try not to have too much water later on in the evening go luck with that so Kylie kle this is the the question about the traumatic brain injury Kylie says that I had a bad car accident 39 years ago and I got a severe head injury to my left side and was paralyzed now I've started this diet and I'm getting some um slight movement in my left toes that's amazing well I'm really sorry to hear that that is a devastating injury and I'm very sorry to hear that that happened to you hopefully it does get better I I mean I've seen some amazing things happen you know we have such serious damage you can't really hope for full recovery but you know even anything is is um you know really good sign and really good uh you know because it's more than you had before know even people with cerebral poy which is sort of a stable neurological condition from birth some of these people are finding they're getting a bit more movement a bit less spasticity they can would be AIT more functional which is great and then people with strokes and other sorts of neurological issues pain issues pinch nerves things like that finding they're improving their symptoms reducing their their um pain and even sometimes improving their strength which uh which is amazing so um good luck with that I just just keep it going um you know you just started so it's early days high fat lots of fat lots of good healthy fats a lot of DH a EPA the know grass-fed butter grass-fed Tallow and grass-fed steaks if you can get them and just grass-fed fat and um you know so good luck with that I I really hope that you uh get better and that just keeps improving good luck with that um paber thank you for the Super Chat uh they say hey Doc down 150 plus pounds hit uh 348 this week uh heading for 300 that's amazing day 236 on Carnivore and loving that's amazing man like you've you've lost nearly a pound a day I mean that's that's incredible so you know really well done and uh just keep it up you know you just keep getting these this amazing uh results so that's really really good thank you very much for for um sharing that with us Bobby Quinn thank you for the Super Chat what are your thoughts on ghee butter for those with dairy sensitivity yeah ghee can be a really good option and it gets rid of all the milk solid so it's just the fat and a lot of people do a lot better with those fats and so if that's you grass-fed ghee obviously is going to be the best way to go and so if you uh do well with that then go for it if you don't do well with that and you need non-dairy completely then I would go with things like grass-fed Tallow and and use that instead so good luck with that Humble Pie thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy my mind is blown I started carnivore diet two weeks ago my blood pressure was 2011 over 103 and today it's 127 over 67 that's amazing really well done that's that's fantastic you know a lot of yeah know we we just call these things idopathic we just oh yeah it just happened just high blood pressure whatever and uh and they just ignore it and just give you a pill it's so lazy it's lazy thinking it's lazy medicine um you need to actually do some work for your patients and because unfortunately doctors aren't trained like that anymore you have to do work for yourself and try to find these other sorts of methods that you can heal yourself and then you only go to the doctor for the things that you can't sort out yourself that's what we used to do and that that I think that worked a lot better so really well done I'm really glad to hear that that had such a dramatic result that's really fantastic good job uh Shane thank you for the Super Chat I'm not seeing a question attached and I'm not seeing one down the pipe but maybe maybe we'll see one um New Zealand Adventure family thank you for the Super Chat is a pcus carinatum pigeon chest caused by malnutrition my son suffered from this a few years ago when we were eating we weren't eating much red meat uh that's a good question I oh you know a lot of things are caused by by poor nutrition um I don't know exactly I mean that's something where you sort pigeon chest where sort of the sternum is sort of pointed out here and you get excavatum which is sort of pinched in like that you have this ditch in your chest and like it's going to be mushing the organs to the side uh which is a bit unfortunate but uh it could very well be uh that's a malnutrition issue I don't I don't know one way or the other it's something that we have seen in the literature going back a long way but it's um I haven't actually seen anything on that but there so many things are so many things are are laid down by our nutrition and we just develop in different ways because of that and you weren't eating you know much red meat you know maybe it's um you know it's going to be with the genetically susceptible um but uh potentially it's hard to say um the only thing to be done now really is just you know feed them a lot of of meat feed him a lot of beef and uh and you know if if he's young enough you know maybe this can sort of Reform a bit and get into sort of a more normal sort of chest shape which is helpful for a lot of reasons um although if it doesn't change it's not the end of the world it's probably not going to cause him too much too many problems so uh and the and the good diet change is going to just improve his life in a lot of other ways as well so you know hopefully that that helps but um oh goodness what's going on here um so it's um you know uh it will be interesting though that's a good question I'll have to have to think about that or look into it see if there's any any literature on it Tony Vargas thank you for the super chat um just says you are the best thank you well thank you I appreciate that that's really kind of you um Annabel uh the happy carnivore thank you for the Super Chat uh you need to be a queen for the state of origin okay uh yeah probably but you know it's it's it's fun to watch anybody can can watch that so it's um yeah I I I need to watch more rugby that's that's a fact that's a sort of a um midyear resolution watch more rugby pippy thank you for the Super Chat can carnivore reverse hair loss caused by type 2 diabetes potentially so high insulin uh can can trigger hair hair loss and so type two diabetes you know having hair loss you actually get hair loss on your body you lose your leg hairs and other sorts of things peripheral vascular disease can do that too a lot of things can do that but it's uh if it's if it's something that the hair follicles are not dead yet then that's something that you can reverse but if it's if the follicles have just sort of you know really died out then maybe not you know sometimes they just go dormant and then they they can come back but if they've just died then you know probably not so it just depends but um potentially because you're you're going to reverse the type two diabetes and so you know some of the damage that you're going to get from the type two diabetes will reverse as well so hopefully it does just depends on how far gone they are so Anthony larat thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm so sorry for butchering people's names like just not going to be able to get all of these unfortunately um so hi Dr chaffy 60 years old carnivore six months uh lime pain and arthritis 80% gone fantastic HDL was 35 now it's 58 amazing triglyceride 124 and now 51 fantastic A1C is 5.3 CRP 36 now 14 how to lower CRP keep doing what you're doing you've already lowered your CRP so that's already dropped by what 66% I mean that's amazing so it's uh everything's going in the right direction you know it's still early days um you know it's carnivore for six months and that's fantastic but you know it it's six months and you're 60 years old right so like you've had 120 segments that long till now right so you know that's uh you know so you have that in perspective so you know you keep going with this this will keep improving and your life will keep getting better and that's that's really exciting you know it doesn't stop here it keeps getting better from here and uh CRP will keep getting better too you know you obviously want to remove out everything from your diet and your your environment that can trigger CRP so you know any sort of artificial sweeteners or uh those sorts of things even even Dairy can be pro-inflammatory and uh chicken pork eggs and farmed fish they can be pro-inflammatory also so to stick mostly to red meat and water and hopefully they'll just keep coming down but it is coming down and all these other things are improving as well so you're you're you're doing really really well and um uh I just keep going with it you're doing great Metalhead hippie thank you for the Super Chat I have a friend with MS and he's getting uh the meat is bad runaround oh God that's unfortunate any advice can you talk about Ms and carnivore thank you doc yeah I I mean that's that's that's really sucks because the meat's the only thing that's good for him and everything else is going to be triggering his Ms so every autoimmune disease uh that I've ever seen uh is going to has improved on a carnivore diet especially red meat and water diet you stick to red meat and water you stick to beef lamb goat and Venison and nothing else just water besides that salt to taste he's going to improve I had a a video with uh a lady named Dr Sarah she wanted to keep her her anonymity a little bit um from from her name for obviously you know uh for professional reasons and um but she had Ms and she's a a PhD in biostatistics so she does high level research on different different projects and um and so she knows how to read studies because she writes a lot of them and does the statistics for them and she had very bad Ms she was in her early 30s she was had previously been a ballerina and very high functioning very intelligent very athletic and then all of a sudden she's in a wheelchair and she can't move and she can't live properly and she needs people to help her with with normal daily functions and she came across carnivore diet and she started looking into it and reading studies and and she was like no they're they're on to something here there is there is something here and so she went on a carnivore diet and then high vitamin D protocol and in 6 months she was not only out of her wheelchair but she was back doing ballet and on her MRI the legions had he were healing right so and I've seen that time and time and time again with MS and every other autoimmune disease meat is not bad meat is the only thing that's going to save this guy's life um it's all the other crap that's bad and is killing him and that's what's causing the antibodies to form you get these plant toxins that get in your body and they start causing merry hell in your body and your body tries to attack them and get them the hell out of there and your nerves in the case of Ms are getting hit in the crossfire right whether that's because these things are sticking on there and attacking the nerves and your body's trying to attack them for attacking you uh or or you're getting cross reaction from molecular mimicry which I think is less likely um then either way you get rid of those toxins antibodies go away and this is what I see on a daily basis with my autoimmune patients you for autoimmune diseases that you can measure uh antibodies I measure their antibodies they go on a a red meat and water diet only antibodies come right down disease goes away so that is objective proof of what's Happening Here so um I would I would tell your friend that um find that video it's it's almost impossible to find like it just doesn't come up like YouTu is just I think they might be the algorithm is sort of hidden things in ways even if you type in like you know Anthony chaffy and Dr Sarah and uh from wheelchair to walking Ms multiple sclerosis like I have trouble finding it they just something wants to hide that video for some reason and I don't know that probably tells you you might want to watch it um so do look for that uh try and find that and show it to your friend and hopefully that will bring them around because if he stops eating plants and only eats red meat and water he will not have MS I I can guarantee that you have to do the other things as well you need to get your sleep right you get your stress under control you get rid of other sort of outside uh influencing factors any sort of chemicals or anything he's putting in his body that's not supposed to be there alcohol cigarettes all these other sorts of things sweeteners get all that crap out of there and your body's a temple don't put in anything in there that's not holy and um and uh and and good luck with that he will get better if he gets if he does that he will promise it's not g to hurt him right try for three months see what happens it'll help he'll get better and um and he'll objectively improve on his MRI as well as uh uh with his symptoms as well very sorry to hear about that I hope he does well good luck with that um Mike huitt thank you for the Super Chat I'm not seeing a question but um uh maybe if one pops up we'll we'll grab it U this might be the last question guys unless Mike hu's one is found unless we can find that one that's question from Shane uh which is from a previous Super Chat so we're able to find that uh so thank you for the Super Chat Shane is there any benefit or detriment to taking one tablespoon of celium husk daily while eating a carnivore diet I've done it for years but just can't bring myself to stop um it's going to prevent some of the absorption of your nutrients if you're taking it away from when you're eating meat maybe it doesn't have that much of an issue um it will bind to bile and will strip that out so you'll lose that nutrient not what you want to do that that's good for you it's something you're supposed to have and it can cause microabrasions and and damage to the inside lining of your intestines and cause a bit of harm uh is it going to cause all that much harm probably not uh in the grand scheme of things if you cut out all these other sorts of things um I don't think it's going to help you I don't think there's anything positive that's it's going to do um it can get into your lower intestine and the bacteria will get on it and you'll propagate the um bacteria that like eating fiber and like eating carbs and those aren't necessarily the ones you want and so you can can screw up your microbiome as well and um so I don't think that um that's necessarily a benefit is it going to cause a huge amount of of harm to you uh not as much as as you know getting rid of all the other sorts of things uh were but you know it's uh it's it's not going to benefit you anyway you know if you were getting runny stools and all that sort of stuff you just couldn't figure out how to do it and you're adjusting all these things you're having a bit of of uh you know insol soluble F things like that that can just thicken things up and and help you from a a uh you know sort of a convenience point of view but it's not really doing anything else for you besides that so you know you can think about it you can always just try coming off of it you know for a month and see how you feel you know if if you're doing well then then no worries about it it's uh I don't think it's gon to hurt you all that much uh but I don't think it's going to help you necessarily and I wouldn't take it around the time that you're eating because it can it can stop you and prevent you from absorbing things and it can potentially contribute to Leaky cut and other sorts of things which you don't want so I would avoid it myself I do avoid it myself but um you know if that's the only thing you do and you're just eating meat otherwise you're gonna be doing a lot better than you were anyway you're gonna be doing a lot better than everyone else so you know just you know you just got to do what's right for you and see how you go um okay um okay uh I think we're going to have to oh Mike hu there we go okay we're going to end with this one uh guys thank you very much um for for the questions and thank you Mike for the Super Chat Mike says yes just wondering I've been having kidney pain and not really losing weight um also my keto strips say I have little to no ketones so is that urine strips uh if they are they're not really accurate I wouldn't worry about those I would get the finger prick blood test for keto ketones and uh and you can see that if you're really not getting into ketosis you you could try upping the fat getting two to one grams of fat to protein um kidney pain it's not really going to be caused by uh carnivore diet but you could be sort of it could be pain in that area that's maybe from something else or it could be stripping oxalates or other sorts of things um drink a lot of water that's a good thing for your kidneys uh eat a lot of fat that's also good for your body and your life in general enal and just eat enough losing weight uh again is problematic you could be putting on muscle and losing fat and then you don't lose weight so if you're exercising if you're lifting weights if you're doing sprinting all great things you're going to be putting on muscle and so that's going to offset the the fat that you lose on the scale and so you know don't worry about that get enough water get enough food get enough fat cut out everything else and then just give your body time exercise when you can and uh just be healthy and when you're doing that the weight and the body fat tends to follow but sometimes you have hormonal issues metabolic issues that need to heal and need to take time before they get better and before you get better so good luck with that and um just keep with it you'll be better you'll get better and you'll feel better and you'll be healthier the whole time all right thank you everyone um for joining in I really appreciate it it's always very um you know sort of flattering and humbling when you get you know so many people watching and interested in these sorts of things and my videos still amazes me that anyone cares uh what I have to say but it's I'm glad I appreciate it and I appreciate you all and I hope that it helps that's the most important thing is that I hope that it helps people and thank you for everyone for sharing your stories about the things that helped if other people have stories uh you know please do share in the comments and let other people know uh you know what they they can expect if they try a carnivore diet and what what you've achieved because that's all this is we're just getting experiences and data so seeing you know what we can do to help people and uh that's that's really the only thing that matters is is helping people and so I really appreciate everyone who's shared and everyone for joining today thank you all for the super chats thank you all for the great questions and
