        "body": "hi this is dr chafee uh today i just wanted\u00a0\nto talk a bit about digestion everyone talks\u00a0\u00a0 about the differences between different\u00a0\nanimals and their digestion to say well\u00a0\u00a0 humans are herbivores because we have digestion\u00a0\nlike a cow or an herbivore this than the other\u00a0\u00a0 or we're a carnivore because of you know the same\u00a0\narguments but nobody knows exactly what means\u00a0\u00a0 anything and what the main principles are and what\u00a0\nthe main points are so when you're having these\u00a0\u00a0 discussions here are some of the main points so we\u00a0\nare primates okay so we have a primate digestion\u00a0\u00a0 okay so we're going to have adaptations in one\u00a0\ndirection or another but they're fundamentally\u00a0\u00a0 going to be primate so they're going to be\u00a0\nvery similar to a gorilla or a chimpanzee or a\u00a0\u00a0 tarcy or something like that but we're gonna\u00a0\nbe having have some subtle differences so\u00a0\u00a0 people think that because we have a similar\u00a0\ndigestion to other primates that must mean\u00a0\u00a0 that we're herbivores like those herbivorous\u00a0\nprimates but not all primates are herbivorous and\u00a0\u00a0 you know so that really doesn't uh make a strong\u00a0\nargument we have uh some things that are very\u00a0\u00a0 uh typical for carnivores we have very low stomach\u00a0\nph okay so it actually goes down to around like\u00a0\u00a0 1.4 which is extremely extremely acidic and this\u00a0\nis this is generally what we see with people um or\u00a0\u00a0 sorry animals that are uh even you know scavengers\u00a0\nlike vultures okay it's thought that early on in\u00a0\u00a0 our meat eating heritage millions of years ago\u00a0\nthat we were eating uh carrion and we weren't able\u00a0\u00a0 to take down and kill animals ourselves because we\u00a0\ndidn't have big teeth and cloths we were actually\u00a0\u00a0 eating the remains of what other animals left\u00a0\nand we were figuring out how to do that we're\u00a0\u00a0 getting smarter using tools and you know using\u00a0\nstones to crack open the skulls to get the brains\u00a0\u00a0 and that was giving us nutrition we started\u00a0\nfiguring out other ways of using tools as well\u00a0\u00a0 and that's why our brains developed instead of our\u00a0\nteeth and our claws okay we also have very long\u00a0\u00a0 small intestine okay and this is where all the\u00a0\nproteins and fats and and other nutrients and\u00a0\u00a0 vitamins all get absorbed okay so we get a lot\u00a0\nof our the majority of our nutrition comes from\u00a0\u00a0 there the vast majority of what we eat gets\u00a0\nabsorbed in the small intestine so we need a\u00a0\u00a0 longer small intestine just like other carnivores\u00a0\nour large intestine is actually very small so\u00a0\u00a0 these these things are um a bit you know misnamed\u00a0\nreally but you know small in the sense of length\u00a0\u00a0 not as diameter which is what we call a large\u00a0\nintestine large because it's a bigger diameter\u00a0\u00a0 so this is something that we don't really\u00a0\nsee in in herbivores herbivores have a longer\u00a0\u00a0 large intestine and in fact primates\u00a0\nwhen you look at them specifically\u00a0\u00a0 they are hind gut digesters if they're if\u00a0\nthey're herbivores okay so they have a very long\u00a0\u00a0 large intestine and a very long cecum which\u00a0\nhelps them break down plant material and fiber\u00a0\u00a0 and actually get the majority of the nutrition\u00a0\ncomes from that breakdown of that fiber okay so\u00a0\u00a0 no vertebrate animal can break down fiber okay so\u00a0\ncertain animals like a cow or like a gorilla have\u00a0\u00a0 been able to basically farm bacteria that eat this\u00a0\nthat eat this fiber and as a byproduct basically\u00a0\u00a0 their waste are short chain fatty acids okay which\u00a0\nis or just saturated fats are 100 saturated and so\u00a0\u00a0 that's what the animal actually absorbs okay so\u00a0\nwhat they eat and what they put in their mouths\u00a0\u00a0 is not the same thing as what they absorb okay\u00a0\nwhat they absorb are these short chain fatty acids\u00a0\u00a0 and and proteins that are a byproduct of those\u00a0\nbacteria eating fiber and breaking it down okay\u00a0\u00a0 we can't do that that's how you know we're\u00a0\nnot like other other primates and we're not\u00a0\u00a0 herbivorous because we lost that ability millions\u00a0\nof years ago we have an appendix an appendix\u00a0\u00a0 is a vestigial cecum okay in a gorilla or or a\u00a0\nchimpanzee it was very long like four foot long\u00a0\u00a0 ours is about that big okay vesial meaning that\u00a0\nit it's an organ that used to do something now it\u00a0\u00a0 does nothing and it has it for millions of years\u00a0\nbecause we haven't used it in millions of years\u00a0\u00a0 okay and so the cecum that blinds out pouching\u00a0\nused to be where our ancestors would you know\u00a0\u00a0 get their nutrition from fiber and that's\u00a0\nwhere gorilla gorillas and so forth that's\u00a0\u00a0 where that packs in and they break down that\u00a0\nfiber and get the short chain fatty acids okay\u00a0\u00a0 so we can't do that we've lost that ability\u00a0\nbecause we were eating meat for millions of\u00a0\u00a0 years and that's just further evidence that\u00a0\nwe're carnivores and that our ancestors and we\u00a0\u00a0 are who we are because our ancestors became\u00a0\ncarnivores millions of years ago okay so\u00a0\u00a0 you know all herbivores that eat fibrous plants\u00a0\nare able to break down fiber to to a certain\u00a0\u00a0 extent okay and we can't do that so that that is\u00a0\na cardinal feature of us not being herbivores okay\u00a0\u00a0 so the other issue is bile this is something\u00a0\nthat comes up a lot people talk about\u00a0\u00a0 how you know if you eat meat or you eat fat you're\u00a0\ngoing to get gall stones this is a supposition\u00a0\u00a0 this is something that has been bandied around\u00a0\nbecause it sort of fit the you know the observable\u00a0\u00a0 evidence but it is completely and utterly\u00a0\nwrong okay so in medicine we talk about the\u00a0\u00a0 four f's for gallstones these are risk factors\u00a0\nit's not a guarantee but it's a risk factor\u00a0\u00a0 female fertile 40s fat okay and or and\u00a0\nfair is another one you know people of\u00a0\u00a0 of uh light complexion seem to\u00a0\nget this stuff more often but this is not one-to-one they say well this\u00a0\nperson's fat therefore because they ate fat\u00a0\u00a0 they've got they've gotten fat and they've\u00a0\ngotten gallstones but people don't get fat\u00a0\u00a0 from eating fat they get fat from\u00a0\neating carbohydrates and sugar\u00a0\u00a0 okay so it wasn't the fat in the first place that\u00a0\ngot them fat but what you do see commonly in this\u00a0\u00a0 thread of people i mean think about it you have\u00a0\nyou know a lady who's in her 40s just had a\u00a0\u00a0 couple kids has a little bit extra baby weight\u00a0\nand wants to lose that weight okay wants to get\u00a0\u00a0 her body back and so she goes on a diet well what\u00a0\nhave everybody been told for the last 40 years\u00a0\u00a0 is if you want to lose fat you stop eating\u00a0\nfat and so these people want to lose this\u00a0\u00a0 fat they want to lose the baby weight so they stop\u00a0\neating fat okay and that is actually the problem\u00a0\u00a0 your body makes bile so that you can absorb\u00a0\nfat okay it's very difficult for your body to\u00a0\u00a0 absorb fat without bile there's there's some\u00a0\nmedium chain fatty acids which can just be\u00a0\u00a0 uh you know absorbed you know on their\u00a0\nown but nearly all other fats need bile\u00a0\u00a0 it's very difficult for your body to absorb bile\u00a0\nto absorb fat without bile okay your body makes a\u00a0\u00a0 certain amount of this okay about 800 milliliters\u00a0\nto a liter a day and now you know maybe that can\u00a0\u00a0 change depending on on what you're eating and\u00a0\nwhat your body requires and so forth but there\u00a0\u00a0 is a limit and then there is a finite amount\u00a0\nof bile that it makes okay it's slow processed\u00a0\u00a0 this is made and then stored in your gallbladder\u00a0\nokay then when you eat that it squishes it out\u00a0\u00a0 and bile goes down absorbs that fat so you know\u00a0\ni mean as a side note it's kind of ridiculous\u00a0\u00a0 for people to argue that fat is bad for us if we\u00a0\nhave four organs working in concert just to absorb\u00a0\u00a0 fat liver makes bile your gallbladder stores it\u00a0\nyour pancreas secretes enzymes to break it down\u00a0\u00a0 and your small intestine absorbs it into your body\u00a0\nokay you know that that's a lot of energy uh for\u00a0\u00a0 your for your body and evolutionarily biologically\u00a0\nyou know it doesn't make any sense for you to\u00a0\u00a0 build that system and evolve that system if that\u00a0\nwasn't really really really important okay which\u00a0\u00a0 it is all right so what happens to these people\u00a0\nthat get gallstones problem is they don't eat fat\u00a0\u00a0 right if you were to eat as much fat as you had\u00a0\nbile for which i take to mean as much as your\u00a0\u00a0 body wants okay then you're going to excrete all\u00a0\nthe all the bile that's in your gallbladder right\u00a0\u00a0 every day so even if you were someone who had\u00a0\nsome weird condition that meant that you would\u00a0\u00a0 get gall stones in just one day you could never\u00a0\nget gallstones if you were eating enough fat\u00a0\u00a0 you couldn't possibly because the bile wouldn't\u00a0\nbe there in your gallbladder to form stones in\u00a0\u00a0 the first place okay it physically cannot\u00a0\ntake place if you're eating enough fat\u00a0\u00a0 okay so you get these people that go on a diet\u00a0\nstop eating fat and then all of a sudden six\u00a0\u00a0 weeks later eight weeks later when they go off\u00a0\nthe diet all of a sudden they go oh that hurts\u00a0\u00a0 because now their body's trying to squish out\u00a0\nthe bile but there are stones in it and they get\u00a0\u00a0 stuck and that hurts and they go to the doctor and\u00a0\nthey say it's because you're eating too much fat\u00a0\u00a0 well no actually it's because they weren't\u00a0\neating fat okay and they stopped eating fat\u00a0\u00a0 okay because your bile goes into your gallbladder\u00a0\nbut it doesn't just run you know when it runs out\u00a0\u00a0 of room it doesn't just sit there okay it you\u00a0\nknow it concentrates okay not everyone knows\u00a0\u00a0 this but even in the textbook it describes\u00a0\nbile as being able to get up to 20 times\u00a0\u00a0 more concentrated than when it originally comes\u00a0\nout of the liver so there may be people that\u00a0\u00a0 get more concentrated than other people and maybe\u00a0\nthose people are more predisposed to uh gallstones\u00a0\u00a0 maybe that'd be interesting to look into because\u00a0\ncertainly not everybody gets gallstones even\u00a0\u00a0 if they just stop eating fat entirely okay so\u00a0\nthere's probably something else going on as well\u00a0\u00a0 but you know the take home is if you eat enough\u00a0\nfat it doesn't matter you cannot form stones okay\u00a0\u00a0 so bile goes into your gallbladder it gets more\u00a0\nand more concentrated more and more concentrated\u00a0\u00a0 what happens to any hyper concentrated solution\u00a0\nat rest it forms precipitates you perform it forms\u00a0\u00a0 stones okay that's what bile sludge is that's what\u00a0\ngallstones are okay and you see this in bariatric\u00a0\u00a0 medicine as well because when people remove parts\u00a0\nof the stomach and the lower intes and the the the\u00a0\u00a0 first part of the duodenum and the small intestine\u00a0\nand so forth or put in a sleeve and and what have\u00a0\u00a0 you you know many different different surgeries\u00a0\nin that in that realm but a lot of these people\u00a0\u00a0 much more than the rest of the population even the\u00a0\noverweight population will develop gallstones a\u00a0\u00a0 lot of them do okay and i've heard this described\u00a0\nas well you know something changes metabolically\u00a0\u00a0 when you when you when you lose weight really\u00a0\nfast that somehow that makes you form these stones\u00a0\u00a0 okay maybe it does but you still want won't\u00a0\nform stones if you get enough fat and what is\u00a0\u00a0 the commonality between these people these people\u00a0\nare really serious about losing weight they really\u00a0\u00a0 don't want to be overweight anymore they're going\u00a0\nthrough very dangerous life-threatening surgery\u00a0\u00a0 and can threaten your life and it can threaten\u00a0\nyour quality of life and can threaten your your\u00a0\u00a0 happiness going forward i've seen um several\u00a0\npeople that i know personally have had you know\u00a0\u00a0 very bad results from this and have serious health\u00a0\nissues afterwards so this can seriously affect you\u00a0\u00a0 but they're very serious about this and so what\u00a0\ndo they do they're going to stop eating that all\u00a0\u00a0 together and i've heard people say this when they\u00a0\nget the gallstones they say you know that can't be\u00a0\u00a0 because i have not eaten any fat in months and\u00a0\nyou know to me that that's why they got gallstones\u00a0\u00a0 okay so it's not that they lost a lot of fat\u00a0\nor lost a lot of weight quickly it's how they\u00a0\u00a0 lost a lot of weight quickly it's by just\u00a0\ncompletely eliminating fat altogether okay so\u00a0\u00a0 these are all things that point in the direction\u00a0\nof we're carnivores because we're meant to be\u00a0\u00a0 eating fat right the reason we've been told not\u00a0\nto eat animals and not to eat plants is because\u00a0\u00a0 they have fat but that's actually very obvious\u00a0\nthat we should be doing that because we have\u00a0\u00a0 four organs working together in order to make uh\u00a0\nmake it possible to absorb fat okay and we have\u00a0\u00a0 very low ph uh stomach acid and this is a side\u00a0\nnote so a lot of people will get better digestion\u00a0\u00a0 if you don't drink water sort of two hours before\u00a0\nafter a meal because you keep that that uh stomach\u00a0\u00a0 acid more concentrate so you'll break food\u00a0\ndown better okay so we've got very concentrated\u00a0\u00a0 ph okay we've got a long small intestine we've\u00a0\ngot a short large intestine we have a vestigial\u00a0\u00a0 appendix not a cecum we can't break down fiber\u00a0\nwe've got uh four organs working to absorb fat\u00a0\u00a0 okay um you can argue day and night about the\u00a0\nanatomy of these things i'm sure someone has a\u00a0\u00a0 rebuttal to why i'm completely wrong even though\u00a0\nthey're wrong but it comes down to functionality\u00a0\u00a0 we don't break down fiber at all period okay\u00a0\nso it's really hard for us to process any plant\u00a0\u00a0 material at all that contains fiber okay we break\u00a0\ndown liquefy and absorb meat very easily even even\u00a0\u00a0 infants and studies in the 1950s were showing that\u00a0\nwhen being fed meat for the first time or anything\u00a0\u00a0 for the first time they were being given meat\u00a0\nthey would absorb 98 of what they were given okay\u00a0\u00a0 dr salisbury of the salisbury steak he made the\u00a0\nsalisbury steak specifically because you ground\u00a0\u00a0 the meat in a very specific way to get the gristle\u00a0\nout and you just had the muscle meat and you just\u00a0\u00a0 had the fat you didn't have the gristle and\u00a0\nthe connective tissue and they were finally\u00a0\u00a0 you absorbed basically 100 of that so people that\u00a0\nhad very serious digestive issues like you know\u00a0\u00a0 crohn's and ulcerative colitis and and so forth uh\u00a0\nand it was 100 years before we had any treatments\u00a0\u00a0 for this you know these people had horrible\u00a0\ndigestions they had extreme pain they were at\u00a0\u00a0 bloody diarrhea constantly every day and so these\u00a0\npeople really needed to rest uh their bowels and\u00a0\u00a0 so forth and so that's why salisbury came up with\u00a0\nthe salisbury steak so this had like zero residue\u00a0\u00a0 and they could just rest and this is what we do\u00a0\nin surgery as well for the general surgeons when\u00a0\u00a0 you have diaviculitis appendicitis says you're not\u00a0\ntreating surgically you're treating conservatively\u00a0\u00a0 you will rest the bowel by giving them a low a\u00a0\nlow fiber diet you know if fiber is so good for\u00a0\u00a0 your digestion it's so good for your intestine why\u00a0\nwhy do we need to get rid of it when we're resting\u00a0\u00a0 your bowel you know that that doesn't that should\u00a0\nshould make you ask questions now maybe there's\u00a0\u00a0 an instance that that that that's holds true but\u00a0\nit should make you wonder if this is so good for\u00a0\u00a0 your body wouldn't you wouldn't you want it when\u00a0\nyour body's trying to heal that exact organ no\u00a0\u00a0 in fact there are studies that show that um the\u00a0\nonly you know correlation between you know eating\u00a0\u00a0 all these sorts of things and diverticulosis\u00a0\nwhich is the outpouching the failure of the\u00a0\u00a0 the distal colon that can then get infected and\u00a0\nso forth and get diverticulitis and cause you big\u00a0\u00a0 problems the only things that were associated with\u00a0\nincreased rates of divertic diverticulosis were\u00a0\u00a0 increased number of bowel motions a day increased\u00a0\nfiber intake okay you're overworking the organ\u00a0\u00a0 you're making this work work work work work and it\u00a0\nfinally just fails just like heart failure you're\u00a0\u00a0 pumping against a high gradient of high pressure\u00a0\nall the time and after several years you know\u00a0\u00a0 just wears out you get you get failure well this\u00a0\nis colon failure okay and that's because you're\u00a0\u00a0 overusing it you're overworking it okay whereas if\u00a0\nyou eat a low residue diet like a carnivore diet\u00a0\u00a0 or you're not eliminating waste all that often\u00a0\nbecause there's there's no waste to eliminate\u00a0\u00a0 right then you know that doesn't that doesn't go\u00a0\ninto failure you know and that just just another\u00a0\u00a0 thing you know say that you know you can't you\u00a0\nknow you can't really digest meat that just stays\u00a0\u00a0 in your intestine in rots for years if anybody\u00a0\nthought about that for more than one second\u00a0\u00a0 they realize that's insane because your\u00a0\ndigestion is a tube it's a one-way tube\u00a0\u00a0 it just goes out and so if you\u00a0\nweren't digesting this you'd just be\u00a0\u00a0 crapping out lumps of meat every day but you\u00a0\ndon't you crap out lumps of wood which is fiber\u00a0\u00a0 that's what we're we're excreting and we're being\u00a0\ntold oh no no but that's that's good for you we\u00a0\u00a0 absorb this so easily and yet we don't absorb\u00a0\nit at all we don't break it down at all okay we\u00a0\u00a0 cannot break down the fundamental structure of\u00a0\nplants which is fiber we break down and absorb\u00a0\u00a0 basically 100 percent of animal tissue so i hope\u00a0\nthat was informative i hope you guys like that and\u00a0\u00a0 yeah let me know in the comments what other sorts\u00a0\nof videos you'd like to hear about take care"
