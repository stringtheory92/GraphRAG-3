    "title": "\ud83d\udd34Understanding The Carnivore Diet with Dr Anthony Chaffee | LIVE Q&A Jan 18th, 2024",
    "transcript": "all right hello everyone thank you very much uh for joining for live uh today is January 19th in Australia January 18th in America thank you all very much uh for joining so um we have about an hour just doing q&as just as usual so if people can just put their questions in put QQ QQQ uh especially if it's not a like a super chat things like that just helps pop things up and we'll try to get to as many questions as we can I have about an hour before I have to to go to work so probably 45 minutes in we'll ask to stop the super chats and just try to get through everything that we can so that we don't leave anyone hanging so first question is from Aurora Mata thank you very much for the Super Chat hello Dr Chi um how to cure periodontal disease and dry mouth uh thank thanks and God bless so well I'm I'm not a dentist so you know I don't know perfect ways but having spoken to dentists such as Dr Stephen Lynn and Sydney and Dr Kevin stock in America um apparently and seeing other people's personal experiences with this parodontal disease actually sorts itself out when you start eating a normal diet your your oral biome starts to improve you stop damaging and inflaming your gums and damaging your teeth and this would make sense because his historically and prehistorically uh people had much better teeth and much better dentition so the fossil record was very clear before agriculture very straight strong well-developed teeth and jaws with really no dental decay or tooth decay and then immediately after agriculture pretty wild Mucky crowded hook crowded crooked teeth and a lot of um dental disease and and missing teeth and rotting teeth and things like that so or half rotten teeth so makes a big difference what you're eating what you're what you eat your microbiome eats your oral biome eats and when you're eating things that you're not designed to eat you're going to get bacteria that aren't designed to be there and that's going to damage your teeth you know what animals in nature when eating their natural diet have rotting horrible teeth if animals lose their teeth they lose their life that's it you can't eat you can't defend yourself you can't hunt you can't chew grass you know you need to be a able to chew you need to be able to eat and so if you lose your teeth that's it for you so that's not natural it's not it's very unnatural to lose your teeth and have rotting teeth even without toothbrushes dentists and dental floss and so just eating a normal human diet which is just a biologically appropriate diet which is a carnivore diet and excluding everything else including non- sugar sweeteners then people's dental issues tend to improve and that's something that people like Jordan Peterson noticed and himself and other people have noticed that their gingivitis all improved and different dentists that understand the importance of a of an animal-based diet have also commented on as well and so if you want to sort of have a bit more uh involved answer than that then I would suggest seeking out um Dr Kevin stock and Dr Stephen Lynn's uh work as well so thank you for the Super Chat Michelle C uh thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy I love your content thank you very much I appreciate that have a friend with breast cancer and told her about the carnivore diet and its benefits her oncologist told her to stay away from red meat thoughts I appreciate you uh thank you yeah well look it's um it's it's just a common misconception out there but I would I would challenge her oncologist to find one one piece of serious research that would show that eating meat is bad for cancer the University of Washington published in I think 2022 massive literature review looking at something like 800 studies on the connection between meat and red meat and cancer and they found that the ones that showed a very tenuous weak barely link association between the two were extremely poorly designed junk studies trash science that was how they describe these things uh paraphrasing of course and but they call them junk studies they call it it's lazy lazy science and they found that the better design studies the higher levels of evidence found no association between meat consumption and cancer and particularly not in unprocessed rine so that's it's just it's just a myth it's just a con and it is not something that you need to worry about so um that's how I would respond to that um I would you know I I would just push back on these sorts of things you know just say like be nice about it just be like hey okay you know um that's interesting can you can you show me any research that you know says that right oh well and they might just put out some you know platitudes and just oh well you know every nose or or or you know all the hormones that are in beef and all these sorts of things and it's just like oh okay because I I read an article and it said that you know UNH hormon treated beef had about two nanograms of estrogen in it for 3 ounces of lean meat and hormon treated cattle had about 3.9 nanograms which is like twice as much and that's kind of scary except when you realize that the birth control pill has 35,000 nanograms cabbage has 400 Nan Nan and fertile women make between 150 and 180,000 nanog and soy has over a million nanog and so if I I wasn't to eat meat you know what else should I eat because all these other things if all these other plants they actually have more estrogens than than meat does and it doesn't really seem like it's there's all that much estrogen in there but I've heard oncologists say that don't eat red meat because of all the estrogen in it I mean these people simply are are speaking out of pure ignorance and Prejudice and it's honestly at at this borders on criminal neglect and malpractice when you're you're giving wrong information you have no idea what you're talking about and you're just spitting nonsense it's dead ass wrong and it could hurt somebody because you know especially when you're going through cancer treatment you need proper nutrition and that's what meat is so people are telling you go vegetarian things like that you're just poisoning your body and you're not getting proper nutrition that's that's disgusting in my mind and and it's it's it's more disgusting that these people clearly don't know what the hell they're talking about they have not looked into this this is just their own pure prejudices and ignorance speaking and you have no no place that is no place in medicine if you don't know something say you don't know if you say I don't know about that because X Y and Z you speak like an authority because you're used to speaking like an authority because you're an authority in certain measures and then other things go oh what this is what it is people listen to you and that's utterly irresponsible and dangerous and Reckless and if it's not criminal it should be and so I really really don't like uh when that that happens so um yeah well hopefully your friend you know watches things like my interview with Professor Thomas CED he's one of the top cancer researchers in the world and by the way oncologists generally aren't all that well researched in cancer biology ology sorry you know they don't get taught cancer biology I took cancer biology in my undergrad that was not a prerequisite that was not part of medical school that's not part of residency they don't learn this you know and so I mean they learn Pathways for drugs and chemo and oh well this this sort of works in this and this is what this cell looks like it's it's not actual cancer biology what's the fundamental underlying uh pathology and physiology of cancer tissue and cancer metabolism they just don't learn that you know maybe maybe some residency programs are better than others but I I have you know very little faith that they have have had a robust deep uh you know education in cancer biology so talk to a cancer biologist like Professor Thomas CED who's published over 150 peer-reviewed studies and papers on this subject and he'll tell you you don't stop eating meat so there's a question from Relentless heart who says is it safe to do 3 five 10 day fast with Hashimoto I mean yes it's not it's not the Hashimoto that's going to hold you back it's you know what what sort of level of nutritional uh you know what sort of level of nutrition are you are you at you know are you very skinny are you emaciated you know would this be detrimental to your health to do a longer fast um I don't think that there's necessarily a good reason to fast further than not eating plants and carbs and sugar and alcohol and things like that uh a lot of the studies that I've seen on ketogenic diets versus fasting so so-called fasting mimicking diets which you're getting into the metabolism that you be in at fasting so they're saying it mimics fasting but really fasting just mimics the metabolic State you'd be in if you were just eating a normal diet which is a carnivore diet and so so the the studies that I've seen obviously I haven't seen every study in the world but the ones that I've I've read numerous studies on um the fasting mimicking diets compared to fasting for certain endpoints so that's not going to be every endpoint but certain endpoints they found it it's just as good sometimes even a little better with less side effects like uh no hair loss things like that and then you know that sort of hair loss is going to be temporary anyway um and so you know I I don't I don't think that there's much benefit past that I think the majority of benefit you get from fasting is from just not eating the wrong things and you're just you're just eliminating it's just like a carnivore dot you're eliminating out all this bad stuff and wow my health improved right because you're not eating things that are toxic to you and that is very helpful and so people can fast and then eat crap and then fast and eat crap and they'll they'll be a lot better when they're fasting if you're just eating red meat if if you're just drinking water you you're going to be fine anyway um I don't I don't know of any reason why Hashimoto fasting with Hashimoto would be any worse than than anything else so I would I would imagine that it's it's as safe to fast with Hashim Modas as other things I'm not 100% sure on that because I'm not an expert in fasting because I I don't think it's all that necessary if you're already eating a proper diet um once you get past five days though you people run into you know theor theoretical issues of of refeeding issues so just take it slow if you're ever going to uh fast over five days uh start eating again slowly just to take a little bit of meat you know always break your fast with the only thing you should be ever be eating meat and um just have a bit of it have a little bit see how you feel a couple hours later have a little bit just sort of ease yourself back into it just to avoid any problems especially with the long long fast you know some people fast you know my friend um Fred everard fasted for 21 days when he found out he had bowel cancer it worked very well for him his his tumor receded by 50% which is without chemo and radiation at that point which is massive so you know that was that was you know what he wanted to do in order to help his situation and but 21 days is a long time and so you know after that you definitely want to be easing back into eating so you don't get a problem repeating Joanna Hunter thank you very much for the Super Chat 70 years old keto 5 months now 4 and a half months uh carnivore labs are good still experiencing migraine Associated vertigo even more frequently as of late are migrain something I can expect to stop being on Carnivore a lot of people improve a lot of people improve on just key to diets in general I mean that's then we have studies going back to to I don't know the 1920s about then maybe a bit earlier where uh they found very favorable outcomes with migraines and you know quite a lot of people recovered and resolved their their issues not everyone did but a lot of people did and I think the majority of people did there's a very very large number of people that that improved and uh and and a a very large proportion of that who completely resol their symptoms there can be other things that you you can um have in your environment that can trigger migraines I would eliminate everything I'd be as as pure as you can be of just red meat and water you know even things like bacon and chicken and farmed fish in particular they might have things in that from being fed an improper diet for them that you know is going to pass through to you in the meat and so I would just just be very mindful of that and very careful of that and just try to eat just red meat and water and see how you go drink plenty of water most people aren't drinking enough water first thing that happens when someone goes into the emergency room with a migraine they get put on a bag of water you know they get just here's a liter of water that's it and then they get they get other medications as well so drink a lot of water be as clean crisp and pure as you can no artificial sweeteners you know no spices and seasonings and even try to avoid other meats besides red meat and see how you go give it 30 days you know and the longer you go with these sorts of things you know generally the better people's um Improvement becomes especially neurological Improvement it's not it's not to guarantee it can't guarantee that everyone's going to respond the same to this but quite a lot of people improve their migraines by switching their diet and then they go back to the other diet and they start having migraines again so something's in the food that they're eating that their body's responding to negativ and precipitating a migraine hopefully that gets covered by you eliminating out everything except red meat and water and a bit of salt if you want it um otherwise you know there might be something else in your environment or something else that's going on that's that's triggering that as well so hopefully it resolves but if not you know think about what else can be uh affecting you Sherry Deval Cody says I have no gallbladder do I need to take oxal generally not most people who H don't have a gallbladder just may need to space out their fatty meals throughout the day it's very common question a lot of people have their gallbladder out specifically because they didn't eat enough fat previously because they were told don't eat fat or it'll give you gall stones and it'll make you fat and all these sorts of things nonsense um you bile stores in our gallbladder and then gets concentrated until you use it if it doesn't get used by you eating fat it's just going to stay in your gall BL lad is going to get more and more concentrated and eventually uh crystallize and that's what gallstones are so um unfortunately we've all been uh misled not intentionally I don't think in in this case but uh still it you know it we gave people the wrong advice and we were given the wrong advice um most people or a lot of people who get their gallbladder taken out eventually at some point will form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is an out pouch of their common B duct and this acts very similarly to a a gallbladder and they can eat just one big meal and one go and they don't have any problems because they have big bis of bile that they can push out there um not everybody does and so I I don't know why some people do and some people don't but uh it's just that's just what's what's being observed so those people that don't form a pseudo gallbladder what they need to do is they just need to um space out their meals and eat just eat as much fat as you can handle that's not giving you diarrhea and then eat more fat later on because you're you're going still going to need as much fat as your as your liver is making bile for over a 24-hour period so you just need to sort of space that out because your liver is gonna still make bile it's just going to just constantly sort of drip out into your intestines and it'll just sort of pull in your intestines and then you just eat fat and it gets used up and then it pulls up again right so that's what I would recommend you know if you're going to you know like like one of those Brazilian barbecues or going to some sort of like feast and you're like I really want to take part in this that would be the only situation where I would I would think that you know that would be what you wanted to do because the thing is is that you you know people say that well you don't want to overeat fat I don't I don't think that that's physiologically possible because I think that you you you know your body's not making a mistake on how much bile you're making and you can't really absorb fat without B it's very small about 10% maybe is depending on the person depending on the kind of fat as well and so if you're you're only if you have a limited capacity and then you have a spill over and you can't absorb anything after that well then how how are you going to eat too much fat if your body physically can't absorb it I don't I just don't that doesn't make sense to me I don't think our body made a mistake like that so you know it does things exacting details and everything else and that one they just they just phone it in whatever just throw it out there I I just don't buy that so you know if you're eating if you're taking in Ox pile then you could potentially take in more fat than your body actually wants and I I don't know what that does probably just gets stored as fat but you know it's h that would be potentially too much fat so you know if you had if you had uh you know something that you wanted to like I I'm going to have this whole thing maybe I take some ox B you know I think it's a situational thing I don't think you you need to though if you have your gallbladder out certainly not on a daily basis you just need to be a bit more you know uh just space things out a bit more it's just a logistical issue at that point and then again a lot of people form a pseudo gallbladder it may not even be applicable to you so it could be a moot point so just test it out you know if you eat a big steak and you get you know the runs then it's like okay can't eat that much fat you know how much can I eat half of that that's fine great I'll eat the other half later things like that Malia Neville thank you very much for the Super Chat I took your advice for heartburn and took pen topers all for a week no improvement still chronic heartburn uh four months red meat salt water what's the next step I need relief well generally it's about a a four-week course like a month of um of a PPI for standard heartburn these sorts of things uh I'm not a GI specialist but um you know if you're having if you take do take about 30 days of penp resol and that doesn't sort of calm things down you sort of need to investigate these things at that point um if you've got you also need to think of anything else that could be in your system you're drinking coffee you're you're taking an artificial sweeteners you have different spices or anything besides just red meat and water cut it out you know you always want to cut down to your Baseline when you're trying to figure out why is this happening why is that happening if you're not down to just red meat and water you need to you need to do those first you cut all of those things out and you just get to red meat and water if if that's still a problem it's likely not to do with the things that you're eating it could be something else going on that you need to investigate so in this case that's what I would do I would I would keep taking it not for a week but for a month that's a pretty standard sort of minimum that you take for like gastri or reflux and things like that and quite often it can calm down after that uh sometimes it takes longer but you know start with that and cut down purely down to just red meat and water and you know if if it persists after that and it's just really not going away I would talk to your doctor and and try to get that investigated it might be necessary to do a scope and see if you have a gastritis or an ulcer or something else that's you know separate from the diet because a lot of people's reflux actually improves once they just get rid of carbohydrates and uh spicy food and coffee and things like that actually improves a lot so you know if if you're having that persist after that there could be something else going on and and that would be worth investigating so thank you for the Super Chat Joe there isn't a question attached but maybe there's one one down the chain Jason Tacoma thank you for the Super Chat I have um mcast I can't eat anything because of food sensitivities I and I've lived off powder formula for years or for seven years I have severe histamine intolerance Health got very bad after my gut got bad um and he helped so well I'm very sorry to hear that I you know the the thing is I I don't know if you've pred just just a strict meat and water diet uh red meat in particular you know some people have is issues with histamines um sometimes you know uh aged meat is is is a bit more of a culprit for that so you try things like lamb but you know if if you haven't tried that you know that's worth it you know it's it's um you know one of the things that um Mass Cell Activation Syndrome has been attributed to uh by people such as Sally Norton is uh it can be a consequence of oxalate poisoning and dumping and all these sorts of things and so you know obviously eating eating a correct low to no oxalate diet um can help that if you're if you're having dumping sort of things and there's other protocols very low oxalate tea and things like that added into a carnivore diet to then sort of temper the amount that's being leeched out so you're not getting overwhelmed and and damaged so it's something that could potentially be improved I mean there are people with mcast that have improved on a carnivore diet and so you're just you're just eliminating out a lot of things that your body would react to and respond to and that's just like everybody else you know we have we we respond to these things in different ways but everyone's going to respond somewhat negatively to things that are toxic for us to varying degrees some things are not very toxic and we just get a bit of a stuffy nose or an itchy face or something like that and other times people get horribly unwell and you know I have bloody diarrhea for three days you know so it's it's you know it's variable between people it's variable between toxins but toxins are generally toxic that's why they got that name and so when you eliminate out all of these sorts of things at least what you're doing is you're getting down to a baseline of of just nutrition and nothing that's directly toxic now you may respond sensitively to certain things that aren't necessarily a specific toxin but you know that that's a bit different so you know try you know just eating red meat and water and see how you go and you know if you think that there's other signs of oxalate dumping and poisoning things like that you know look at look at the you know Sally Norton's uh stuff and and see if you think that her protocol might help you try it out but I would at least cut down to that Baseline of just red meat and water that's always the default always the default you know if you oh I have this problem that problem red meat and water nothing else see how you go with it and more often than not this will improve your issues so you know like you said you have a lot of food sensitivities cut out basically everything except me um you know powdered formula and things like that I mean that's that's not that's not fun that you have to live like that because you know there's so I mean there there's just more and more reports coming out that there's like over 50,000 unique uh micronutrients in meat that don't exist in Plants we don't even know about how are you supposed to supplement that like you're not and you know we have um you know studies with the AI cuyu and the Messiah back in the in the 20s and early 30s and they found that dyu who were you know largely plant-based were very nutritionally deficient but when they replaced their nutrients and with supplementation they didn't actually improve their health they were very sick compared to the Messiah who were who were almost purely carnivore they although they had started sneaking in some millets and corn and you know grains and things like that now it's a lot more so and they're a lot more sick and so oh in the 1970s they said the the Messiah had heart disease they didn't in the 19 1930s so you know what changed in that time they started eating a lot more grain and more plants so thanks for proving my point and so you know they replaced the nutrients of the akuu and it didn't improve their health obviously because they were deficient in other things that they didn't even know about and there's toxins in plants so you eliminate out all those sorts of things and you just eat meat which is is what you're born to do anyway and hopefully that that at least helps the situation and you try to eat the different meats that don't give you you know the histamine sort of response you know is that is that a is that a true histamine response I'm not sure you know a lot of people attribute these things to well this is a histamine reaction it's like is it a histamine reaction I don't know I don't know if we have much evidence of that or if it is I don't know what it is but people seem to be reacting it doesn't matter what it what it is it doesn't matter if it's histamines it doesn't matter if it's you know apoxin it's just like you're reacting to something great don't eat it eat something that you don't react to um and so you can do that too so just cut down just to to fatty meat and water and and try to just eat the meats that don't give you a bad reaction and hopefully this this uh you can get you can get through this so Joseph thank you for the super sticker that's very kind of you and El Marie thank you very very much for saying hi it's good to see you Evan Hoffman thank you very much for the Super Chat question I need to find a new primary care physician how should I go about finding one that won't immediately just say your cholesterol is high red meat is bad yeah so you want to find people that are in in the sort of the the the ketogenic space so I mean these do exist if you look for ketogenic doctors in your area on just Google generally you you'll find something generally you'll find a uh website or some sort of you know group that um has links in that so in Australia a good resource is low carb down under so they you know they put on medical conferences that are low carb and Orient and as the name would suggest and um and they have list of of doctors you know in different in different parts of Australia who you know would subscribe to you know low carb uh sort of treatments for patients and generally you know if you're doing that then what do you replace carbohydrates with it's it's fat and protein right so that really going to come from meat largely and so this is going to be these These are going to be the the people that understand that cholesterol was was a farce and a con in the first place and so um that's that's probably the best the best thing to do is is is do that there are going to be different groups and and lists in different countries in different areas of countries and so I I don't know all of them uh but every time I've sort of looked and just tried to Google ketogenic doctors and the city that I'm in or I'm near I I generally find uh you know lists of of people and websites to that to that nature so uh that's what I would do if I were you uh Joe yeah so I think I messed up the last message attempt yeah so this this was on the super chat before um Dr chaffy what is your opinion on lactose-free whole milk as compared to regular whole milk same thing unless you're lactose intolerant so the lactose free doesn't mean no sugar it means that uh they've put in lactase the enzyme which just breaks apart uh lactose into his constituent carbohydrates glucose and galactose so you're still getting carbs you're still getting sugar you're still going to get an insulin Spike to exactly the same degree as you would with normal whole milk it's just that if you don't make lactase the enzyme you know job you know work is done for you so you know um it's not uh it's it's you know it's not any better from a carbohydrate point of view so there are they're called Ultra filtered milks they probably have other bad know things wrong with them but you know at least what they do is they they filter out a lot of the carbs in the sugar and they have more protein they have like double the protein they are delicious I don't think I've ever tasted milk that was better than these things if they could do it with raw milk I think I'd bloody die I'd probably good thing that I don't have access to that because I would I would drink it and I have a hard time stopping myself I would drink it I I drink it sometimes but um I would I I don't like the the the amount of lactose and those sort things but a lot of these Ultra filtered milks have a lot less sugar in general have a lot more protein and fat as you know as a percentage and as a total number especially with the protein so those are something you can find but I would I would just strongly recommend people avoid milk you know raw milk has a ton of nutrients just a ton of nutrients they're fantastic and if you're nutrient deprived it's a fantastic resource but it does have a lot of lacto it does have a lot of sugar that will spike your insulin and that can cause its own problems and a lot of people respond negatively to the casan as well uh from an inflammatory point of view and so you know if if you're if you just if you want to optimize your health I think that it's best to have milk as an infrequent treat uh or not at all as opposed to you know something that you'd have daily Joseph this is sort of the attached um super chat so knee replacement surgery should you stick with carnivore during recovery 100% um that that's a you know that's that's yeah no no doubt in my mind look you should you should always do a cornor diet you should always eat an appropriate diet at any stage in a lion's life you know past weaning it should eat what a lion eats right same thing with dolphins you know if you're giving a hip replacement to to a lion you know lion should still eat meat Lions should eat what lions are supposed to eat humans should eat what humans are supposed to eat and we're supposed to eat what we're designed what we're we've been eating for millions and millions of years and that's what our body is biologically adapted and designed to eat at this point point so yes you should definitely do that it will help with recovery it will improve your immune system it will it provide the the protein and nutrients that you need to heal your tissue and um and and make a make a very positive recovery so yes 100% I think it's very important in these times of stress that you really dial in your nutrition I mean sitting on the couch on a you know Sunday afternoon the best thing for you to eat is a carnivore diet any more stressful times of your life it's even more important to to eat a carnivore diet because that's what your body needs um so good luck with that I hope that the knee surgery uh goes well or if it has gone I hope it did go well and the recovery goes well Lori pal palmary thank you very much for the Super Chat just got lipid panel done HDL 43 triglycerides 212 HDL 160 should I be worried depends on what you're eating are you on a carnivore diet if so how long uh what were your lipids like before um you know HDL women want to be above 50 triglycerides want to be lower than that HDL I couldn't care less um it's um actually in fact higher LDL has been shown to be uh associated with longevity and in many studies it's total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol have shown an inverse relationship uh with cardiovascular disease so um I I I I simply do not look at uh cholesterol for heart disease purposes I don't I just don't think it's useful um it's a con you know we were con we were lied to this is not my opinion this is not in contention this is a matter of record this is well documented that the sugar Research Foundation paid off multiple doctors and clinicians and or and researchers and professors at Harvard and elsewhere to fake the numbers and make it look as if cholesterol caused heart disease you know it cast the blame away from sugar right and so you know one of those professors named head of the USDA and he was the one who authored and published the USDA declaration saying that cholesterol caus heart disease saturated fact creas cholesterol stop eating both right so this is a fraud the the their internal memos were published in the journal American Medical Association 2016 game over you know LDL is not the problem so um you know with HDL a bit lower and triglycerides a bit higher that does denote a bit of metabolic distress you know that's one point against you for metabolic syndrome you there's other things that have to be off for you to have metabolic syndrome but metabolic syndrome does increase your risk of heart disease by a factor of six and type to diabetes increases your risk of of um heart disease by a factor of 10 so that's up there with smoking and so that shows a bit of derangement and metabolic distress so if you're not on a carnivore diet I would suggest you go on one and it suggests you really do it properly only fatty meat and only water so no fake sweeteners or anything they they don't it's not oh they don't count because they're not sh they count they are not bad they are not good for you you know we are not combustion engines like oh it doesn't burn therefore it's eat okay eat a rock then you know what's that doing for you um you're you're a chemical Factory and you put chemicals in your body they're going to have chemical reactions with your body so why are you putting random ass chemicals in your body you know that's not a smart thing to do and it's not what you want to do I'm not going to put any chemicals in my body that aren't supposed to be there don't have a a specific medicinal use for the situation at hand should I need it or you know something that hasn't existed and that we ate and put in our body 50,000 years ago during an ice age that's sort of my litness test for that so should you be worried it depends on what you're doing with your life if you're if you're going on a carnivore diet a high fat carnivore diet and cutting out absolutely everything else no because that's going to improve your HDL is going to go up your triglycerides are going to go down your LDL is going to do what it's going to do and um you know if you're in a fat you know fat burning metabolism and you're having mobilized fat around your body guess what mobilizes that LDL and so guess what that might go up it often does and uh so what you know uh it's going to if you eat a whole bunch of carbs and sugar and posa and alcohol they'll come right down okay is that good for your heart then no of course not I mean this this is just just a nonsense the whole idea of just the whatever your LDL is over time that equals heart disease it's  it's complete and utter  um and so you know and people talk about you know there like you know Dr petera I have ton of respect for it very bright guy but I just think he gets I think he just gets this one wrong and he talks about well the familial hypercholesteremia this you know proves that this is a problem it really doesn't actually if you if you look at at it proper you'll see that it actually disproves it because people with familiar hypercholesterolemia they have very high LDL oh my god look their heart diseases up first of all it's not all that much up it's only in the earlier decades it evens out with the rest of the population by the fifth decade and onwards in the seventh decade they're actually lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease and heart attack and stroke and they're more genetically prone to clot more which is what heart attacks and strokes often are caused by they get a damage to the to the anal lining of the artery and it clots and that's a problem this is why aspirin works so well it stops that from being a major clot and having a predisposition to clot is going to make you more prone for heart attacks and strokes and we have other people that have you know other sort of clotting disorders they are more like you know to clot more they are more likely to have these problems right so we know that and then you look at some smart carrot cookies you know decided to say okay well some of these people have this clotting disorder and high cholesterol some just have the high cholesterol let's separate the two right what does that show well that shows that the ones that have just a high cholesterol and no clotting disorder they have the exact same risk of heart disease as the rest of the population and it's only the ones with the clotting disorder and the high cholesterol that have increased rates of heart disease so it's not the cholesterol is it no it's a clotting issue or it's something else there's there's other mechanisms going on LDL was never the problem it was a fraud from the beginning it was a farce it was a con it was a lie and the evidence shows that so Louis Roy thank you very much for the Super Chat I've been struggling with Scleroderma rain out syndrome and uh interstitial lung disease I'm scared because I'm already living with an oxygen concentrator do you think carnivore will cure me and regenerate my lung fibrosis I don't think it's going to cure you I don't think it's going to remove all the fibrosis because fibrosis is scarring and that's that's generally a permanent change people do notice that at least superficial scarring seems to soften and seems to get less noticeable however it's not going to undo and just make a scar go away unfortunately it may improve things and I have actually spoken to a number of people with COPD they've do just just damaged their lungs to a significant extent and they actually find that they have a lot of improvement um which is great you know and the thing is too is that you if you have a damaged organ the last thing you want to do is put more stress on it with an improper diet and have your body having to struggle and cope with that as well you already have a damaged organ and so why don't we optimize your health in other ways and so that's you know that's you you don't have other worries to contend with Scleroderma rain outs actually can be helped and so interstitial lung disease depends on what's being caus causing lungs disease but depending on the cause it could potentially help slow or halt the progression will it make it just go backwards and make it go back to to when you were 13 and had no problems no you know but can absolutely improve your life in a lot of ways I would do this very strictly I would just do red meat water that's it um especially with rain out claraderma those sorts of things you just need to be really on top of this and so uh red meat and water is going to do the best you know follow the same protocol that people with autoimmune diseases around the world uh do and do best with which is just you know red meat and water so the ruminant animals beef lamb goat venison those sorts of things they're going to be able to filter out more of the plant toxins and make it so they don't get to you you know the the pork chicken and farmed fish they're being fed things they're not designed to eat they're not going to be able to filter that out properly right plant toxins are bad for everyone you know unless you're designed to eat a specific plant that plant is bad for you and you don't and you may not have the capacity to detoxify this stuff completely and so you know you need to you need to be aware of that and you need to be aware of that in the animals that you eat because we're designed to eat animals but those animals are designed to eat something too and if they're not eating what they're designed to eat you know you may not you may not be getting uh the the benefits that you that you set out to get so hopefully that that helps I would seriously urge you to to try a carnivore diet and do it for at least three months you know 100 days at 100% just red meat and water if you can do that three months of your life you know you have you have literally nothing to lose you have everything to gain so give it a shot give it a an honest full trial for three months I I don't think you'll go back and let me know how it goes because I would be very interested to see how you do Chef Bruno cornor thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat that's very kind of you hi Dr chaffy my wife being GP is worried that I will get problems with my eyes retina because there is something that is not available able in meat that protects people's retina um she did say I forgot the name um but she told me it's not in meat um okay I I haven't heard that um but I would I would you know I would reassure you know both you and your wife that there is nothing in plants that we have to have that we can't get from meat there's there can't be anything essential there meaning that if we don't get it we get serious harm or we die because this is how we evolved and so what else were we eating during the ice ages you know people say well everyone was moving towards the equator that's a lie that I've heard vegans try to push out there to try to say that you know humans are herbivores it's just Insanity I mean that's just that's just dumb since when did that happen you know all those cave paintings of salads obviously you know made them think that that we weren't carnivores I guess but um actually when the ice shell SC started coming down two million years ago homo bilis actually tacked up into the ice they didn't oh good all run away they right into it so that's exactly the opposite of what the the fossil record shows right so when you're going up into the ice shelves during an ice age you know what are you eating you know besides meat you know what is there in the Arctic Circle for the Inuit to eat I mean they don't have their their eye problems when they're eating a regular diet in fact there are a number of opthalmologists specifically who promote keto carnivore diets and um and and that more ancestral Primal approach to things and in fact they found that this radically helps things such as macular degeneration and other sorts of vision issues um there was a live that I did last month or or so and uh some of these questions came up and there was a lot of people saying how they they actually improved their Vision they actually were able to stop using glasses and um and you every time time they went into their doctor they were their Vision was improving they were getting worse and worse and worse and all of a sudden it started improving and the doctor's like what the hell is that um and so I I sort of you know that was something that I'd seen more and more and more so I asked people say Hey you know this has happened to you please talk about it just tons of people that had the exact same experience so you know I would I would you know encourage uh you both to you know to see things like um you take a look at at sort of the evidence for that that you know humans really have been apex predators for millions of years and what we're biologically you know designed to eat uh is meat and there are periods of time and there are people alive right now who have only eaten meat their entire life and have had beautiful Health as a result of that and also you know what you know what are these um you know what is this chemical that's found in plants which plant is that available to everybody at every part of the world world at all times or is this something that maybe is more introduced now and oh you should have this but if people in indigenous areas haven't had this from time in Memorial and we haven't all eaten this as a species and every part of the world on every continent on the of the world maybe it's not essential maybe it's not something that you have to have and so you know I mean there's beta katene but you know that's a poor man's vitamin A and um you know vitamin A which is retinol they don't don't it's not made in plants and so you know you're actually get you have to eat like six pounds of carrots to get enough beta carotene to make enough uh Retinol for the day and some people don't even do that some people are um you know very poor at converting retinol into vitamin A and some others just can't do it at all so no I I don't think that that's correct uh in fact I know that's not correct uh but you know it's it's a it's a legitimate concern and but I would you know I would just say hey you know think about it from those those standpoints you know what are the Inuit eating what plants are they eating are they eating that plant are they getting that nutrient how are they getting it you know they're only eating meat traditionally and they were very healthy traditionally and now they're not they're not eating what they're designed to eat they're not eating uh just a meaton diet and their health is getting worse same with the Messi same with the Plains Indians in America same with the Australian aboriginals you know the Plains Indians in America when they're just eating bison uh the study in 2001 showed that they were the tallest population of humans on Earth at the time now they are not now their health is far worse than the average American they have four times as likely to get all the different chronic diseases obesity cancer heart disease diabetes autoimmune diseases and the rest because they've had a hundred years to adapt to agricultural food and and Europeans have had 8,000 to 10,000 other populations similar and you know either way 8,000 years is not nearly long enough 100 years is nothing you know there is no adaptation at that point they're just they just got hit in the face with this so you know they they were not eating plants and and people well maybe they ate this and that the records are pretty pretty clear that they really didn't eat plants they really just ate bison all year round uh in that area if they had it available if they didn't then they you know they might know which plants to eat or which plants to use medically there is no option for that in the Arctic Circle so that's why I use the Inuit very clear you're on an ice flow nothing grows so what do you eat you eat meat and uh if you're not thriving in those conditions you are dead because those are the most harsh conditions on earth besides the middle of a active volcano and so you are not going to survive if you are not thriving and we not only thrived during the ice ages we became the most dominant species that has ever walked the Earth so you do get everything you need from meat and then some and then you don't get all the toxins that come with plants too Logan P smithberg thank you very much for the Super Chat hey Dr chaffy carnivore for almost two months and curious about your thoughts on hydration and electrolytes and how much hydration affects uh how good or not good you feel throughout the day yeah well I think hydration is very important I think it's it's um you drink to thirst you eat to hunger you know salt to taste all these sorts of things you have to relearn your hunger signals so obviously you have to eat until fatty meat stops tasting good that's what actual satiation is um same thing with thirst not everybody realizes how thirsty they can be you know I talk to people oh I drink a ton of water oh my God I'm all the way drinking water and okay how much do you think that would be oh at least a liter if not two liters a day like okay all right so you you know that's that's that's one liter I mean I I have like nine of these a day sometimes you know so it's like um I think that when sort of encourage people especially if they're having symptoms that I would attribute to maybe not getting enough water I'd say okay you know maybe try to go for three or four liters see how you go a lot of times people tell me they get just sort of three four liters and they say I just can't stop drinking after that I get so thirsty you know when you get past a certain point of thirst you actually dampens down your thirst signal and so your body's just like okay we're in a drought you know we just don't have access to water we're just not going to keep bugging you we're just going to you know trim sails and and survive and then you drink more water and yourbody goes oh hey look hey we're at we're at a spring we have access get more in you you know and you and you get more thirsty and so you know that's that's what I would suggest just try just try having you know something in that level you know three to four lers just try it and if you're getting to the point where you're just like I just I just can't drink this much water I don't want it fine stop don't do it um the other side of the coin is is dyum you know that's something that's that's I'm becoming more and more interested in from the work of Dr lzo borash and Gabor somi uh really interesting stuff you know water has different amounts of dyum sort of rainwater in the mountains and Northern latitudes quite a lot less apparently and so uh Pro I don't know if that makes the difference as far as you know people you know in different um historical context is swearing by you know just drinking rain water out of the rain barrel and how this is so much better um maybe it has something to do with that I don't know but I think for just normal hydration it's you know just drink to thirst and uh just challenge yourself see if you're actually getting enough as far as electrolytes are concerned salt to taste uh especially early on some people just need a bit more salt it's they getting sort of fluid shifts and balances and how their body's processing electrolytes almost no one needs to take more electrolytes like you know the sodium pottassium magnesium supplements some some actually do benefit from that I have yet to see anybody with an actual deficiency in uh sodium or potassium when going on a cornivore diet on a lab test and I test people I don't test everyone but I test my patients and so I I have yet to see that um and I have yet to see anyone go down on their magnesium it really just goes up when they go on a cornivore diet especially when they cut out coffee coffee will strip magnesium out of your body and it dehydrates you and that's a perfect storm for uh cramps almost always when people get cramps it's dehydration it's not electrolytes um could be electrolytes it's almost never electrolytes it's almost always dehydration and you see people that take a bunch of electrolytes they're still getting cramps still getting cramps I'm drinking see water and this it's like okay well try drinking more water and cut down the electrolytes gone so if you feel that you're having some weird symptoms you're not feeling great you know you can try adding in some electrolytes never get the ones with with the sweeteners and the flavorings and all that sort of stuff just avoid that stuff at all cost just get there just the normal electrolytes and they exist you know and just you know just don't put any of that slop in your body it's it's not design to be there don't don't do it um and if you find that it helps great you know you shouldn't need it long term though you shouldn't this shouldn't be something that your body just requires for the rest of your life your body knows how to how to regulate your potassium and sodium especially and uh and you'll get plenty of magnesium in your in your meat uh just don't drink coffee and other sorts of and tea and things like that they can strip magnesium out of your body just going to say to everyone I have about 20 minutes left so um please uh let's probably cut the super chats there um and um I'll Trust I'll need to get through these and uh and get to work I'll have to sort of I'll just answer the rest of the super chats that have been asked now and I may or may not have time to get uh to any others so just so you know um rat Keller thank you very much for the Super Chat Dr chaffy on day 90 to 100 I began getting charlie horses in my toes Cal's muscles is this from low magnesium can you elaborate so perfect addition onto the the last question it's almost always dehydration you can check your magnesium if it's exceptionally low sure um but I would doubt I would doubt that unless you're drinking coffee things like that you want to take some electrolytes you can I wouldn't just be dumping tons of salt and electrolytes and things like that in your water all that stuff you know you take more of these electrolytes and they actually increase your demand for water and if you're a bit dehydrated anyway and that's why you're getting these cramps that's just going to exacerbate things so you know a lot of people will will take these electrolytes and they'll still get cramps clearly it's not the electrolytes at that point they've already addressed that um it's something else try more water if that doesn't work you can add in some uh magnesium or um you know some of the the unsweetened electrolytes and that could help but it's almost always uh not enough water so start there and and see how you go Gabriel Manriquez thank you very much for the Super Chat do I supplement with vitamin C if I will not be eating liver no you don't need to I've eaten liver maybe five or six times in the last decade uh you don't need Vitamin C to the same extent as uh as you would if you were not eating a meat-based diet because you need Vitamin C to make proper collagen if you don't have a proper supply of collagen and his precursors you do on red meat so you know you don't actually need Vitamin C to make hydroline and hydroly you already get that from your food and so you don't need to you don't need to make it denovo and so um you know the amount of vitamin C that you need for other purposes is is minuscule and if you're not eating carbohydrates then you're not blocking out the absorption of vitamin C meat that you're eating so what little is there you get um but you you will not get scurvy if you're only eating meat you just won't the Inuit don't I don't and um and I've check my vitamin C very low it's not it not super high now at the time I was drinking um I I sort of did a self experiment I drank like three gallons of milk in three days um and so that's going to really knock out and not allow me to absorb really any vitamin C so would it be higher I don't know I'm going to check it again at some point just out of curiosity but it it was I had to Trace Amounts not bleeding you know everything's fine so uh you don't you don't need to supplement vitamin C on a corner board diet uh Super Chat from Anthony thank you very much hi doc I got my I just got my blood test and my apple b is at uh 129 and my HDL is 207 29 years old athletic thoughts on getting prescribed um uh PCA uh pcs9 um you know I'm of the opinion that that cholesterol is not the cause of heart disease so you know my personal opinion that's not something that that I would personally worry about also the Apple B test is not actually testing the free damaged floating around Appo that gets damaged from glycation from sugar from carbs from seed oil it's measuring all the Applebee that's there right so even even apple b 100 that's on the healthy large buoyant LDL molecules that are not causing any harm in your body you know when they get glycated they can knock that sucker off and they're oh well that's bad if you have all that yeah okay that's from glycation that's from eating carbs that's from drinking alcohol that's from having seed oils okay don't do those and then that would be that you measure just going to be the ones still attached and still working that's the the receptor for your liver you know so that's how that's how your liver recognizes LDL grabs it pulls it in processes the triglycerides and fats and things like that so it's not um it's not it's not what it's cracked up to be there's a fantastic uh video by Dr Paul Mason on um uh someone took it as an excerpt it's just a quick clip and it's fantastic and uh it says just look up Dr Paul Mason Appo it's like under five minutes and um should clear that up but you know I mean look at the the lean mass hyperr studies from uh Dave Felman and Nick norwitz you know these people have been on ketogen di with massively elevated LDL for you know average of 4.5 years and no progression in hard disease and atherosclerosis uh and in fact the trend was it was resolving again it goes back to the fact that there's a fraud in the first place and so I I think it's wonderful that that you know Dave and and Nick are doing these sorts of work because it's just I mean people just need to shut up about this you know uh I was already on that that that side years ago because I just saw what fraud was perpetrated and what the data actually shows is very different in fact it's the opposite this is very important to our body and so you know I just I just thought that was a bit of a force but you know people are still you know entrenched in their ideology or their you know Financial interests in the pharmaceutical companies and just they just don't want to change you know just you know dinosaurs that don't know how to evolve and so you know that that you obviously there needs to be you know more push back and more things like you know Dave Feldman's work and Nick norwich's work and he's coming out with a with a very interesting study um that came out it's an N of one but it's a it's a it's a very well-designed crossover study and um you know and it looks at uh uh this relationship of of LDL being actual a consequence of your metabolic system and Just mobilizing Energy throughout your body so we talked about that on interview that we had together that will be going out probably next week or the week after and um depending on when when this this paper gets published so that should be published sometime next week or the week after and once it is it's already been accepted and once it's actually published then uh I'll I'll post our interview the Sunday after that in America so I don't think you need to lower anyone needs to lower their cholesterol to to combat heart disease because I don't think that LDL and cholesterol are a cause of heart disease and I don't even think they're inv involved in heart disease if anything I think they're protective against heart disease so I I would never lower my colesterol as uh as it stands at this moment so everyone's free to do what they they will I don't know what diet you're on if you're not on a carnivore diet get yourself on a carnivore diet and I think that's going to be the most important thing to improve your uh health and your risk of cardiovascular disease a number one there's no medication that's going to that's going to improve your life better than a proper diet Cameron fitter thank you very much for the Super Chat as a expr rugby player um had a test decline do you see any disadvantage with supplementation of Ash waganda uh tonat and deha or is it DHEA maybe I have dropped you a private message if You' be so kind to if you'd be kind enough to uh respond uh um okay was that I don't know if you'll be able to to to see this and put in the chat but or if I'll see that the response but um was that in in Instagram if it was uh great I you know there's so many different you know communication platforms that I I don't uh I don't I don't know all the the sort of the the um the message requests I don't always I don't always SAR to see them um but that's great you know so test test testosterone decline you know can happen uh but when I when I see people on a carnivore diet I see their their testosterone levels go up dramatically and so I I see old men that their testosterone levels double or even triple so it it makes a big difference you know supplementation with those sorts of with DHEA I mean DHEA is a hormone that your body makes anyway that's like a bioidentical you're not going to get a whole bunch of other crap in there if you bring that up to more physiological levels you know will it raise your testosterone you know maybe marginally you know DHE is a hormone in its own right though it does its own things and is you know is uh you know it's good to have in physiological levels as well you know just like it is to have testosterone in physiological levels DHEA turns into andrine Dion that turns into testosterone but it's it's not just a reservoir for testosterone it does its own thing just like testosterone turns into estrogen but testosterone is not just a reservoir for estrogen it has its own purpose and function in your body so you could take those things I don't know the evidence on whether they actually improve your testosterone or not the thing you have to think about though with herbal supplements is that they're they may have something that you want in there they're going to have a lot of things you don't want in there and so you know what are those sorts of doing what are those sorts of things uh going on I would first and foremost go to a high fat meat-based carnivore diet cholesterol is what testosterone is made out of so you know people are combating their their cholesterol they're combating their own hormones all your hormones are made out of testosterone all your sex steroids made out of Testo or made out of cholesterol vitamin D is made out of cholesterol all these things so your your skin your hair your your every cell in your body your brain bile all these things are all uh derived from or at least used in part uh cholesterol is at least used in part so very important stuff very important for hormonal Health you go on a high fat red meat only diet your testosterone will go up you you get rid of carbs you go on a car ketogenic diet you start eating sort of you know once or twice a day in a short window your testosterone is going to go up your growth hormone is going to go up you improve your sleep your testosterone is going to go up you get out in the sun for 30 minutes a day three days a week your testosterone is going to go up all these things matter if you lift weights if you sprint your testosterone is going to go up and your cortisol is going to go down if you long endurance running your cortisol will go up your testosterone will go down your growth hormone will go down right if you eat carbohydrates if you process crap if you drink alcohol your testosterone will go down your growth hormone will go down so I would address those things first that's where you're going to get the most bang for your buck that's where your money is and so after that if your body's really not producing you know an adequate amount of testosterone you could try DHEA it's over-the-counter in most countries uh it's very safe if you're taking it in you know physiological doses um uh but you know it's over the- counter so you know you get to make that decision in countries that have it as prescription you know you need to talk to your doctor about it um and you know if that's if that's all not enough and you're not feeling your best you know I would talk to your doctor about uh bioidentical testosterone replacement trt I think that's going to be safer than the the herbals you know because you're you're you're just getting what you want and you're getting the right chemical you're not getting all this other stuff but I promise you if you go on uh high fat red meat and water diet only and you do those other sorts of lifestyle modifications you're you're not going to want to use any of those things I mean I have I have patients coming off trt and they and they're and they're actually they get a rebounding of their testosterone when they do and um you people say you can never come off trt that's you can actually rest your goads and then when but if you you go back onto this normal crappy diet yeah sure it's going to be just as suppressed because your your testosterone suppressed in the first place because of your crappy diet and lifestyle you change your diet and lifestyle you go into a cornivore diet you start exercising properly sleeping properly getting outside in the sun and your goads are now rested and fresh and ready to go and Wham you know it goes right up I had a patient that went he was in his 50s he came off trt with trt his testosterone was 450 off trt 3 months later was it was like 690 something like that it was nearly 700 so that was that's that's off that's off the um the medication so it it makes a massive difference just D and lifestyle so that's what I would try first the bush rang rang rangan order okay question uh thank you for the Super Chat I've been carnivore for three months I'm still having digestive issues where it feels like I've got too much acid I take uh betane HCL pepsin and Nexium when needed but it doesn't solve the issue well I me if you're taking BTA and HCL and next te they're sort of you know sort of counteracting each other right you're taking Nexium that it's a proton pump inhibitor that reduces the amount of acid that's put out in your stomach and taking things that increases your stomach acid so it's like probably not going to be helpful you sort of be one or the other um digestive issues for you like too much acid if you feel like I don't know what that would feel like having too much acid generally people have too much acid have heartburn reflux pain um usually when they don't eat and then we have an empty stomach and have just really intense acid so I I I would try one at a time maybe um and and and see if any of those help sometimes we can have and I don't know what your dig specific digestive issues are so I can't really you know give you more advice than that but you know sometimes people even just have you know a you know the these sorts of issues with with eating fatty red meat and they sort of get I mean I used to eat fatty meat and it just smelled amazing I have a piece of fat I can't believe I did that and I get i' get an upset stomach I'd feel queasy and nauseous and now I know that that's not bad for me so I don't have that psychosomatic response so it might be something like that I certainly wouldn't take all of those together at the same time maybe try one at a time and see how you go and um also sometimes it's just people just need to get used to eating in a very different way and there can be that psychosomatic response just remind yourself meat and fatty meat is really good for you it's not bad for you and um and so you shouldn't feel un you shouldn't make yourself feel unwell as a result anyway if it's one of these other things try them one at a time don't try them all together Lindsay Jacobs thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm waiting a followup with Neurology for an abnormal MRI with calcification recommendations for using a cornivore diet to benefit the brain well there's massive benefits uh to the brain first of all you go into ketosis and that's your brain's primary energy source why do I say that because if you have an abundance of glucose and an abundance of ketones your brain only runs on the ketones so that's a preference right and certain parts of your brain still run on glucose but the majority will run on ketones if you have ketones available um they also cross over the blood brain barrier ketones do and they reconstitute into fatty acids which help rebuild physical structures of your brain your brain is made out of fat predominantly um you're also eliminating out things from your diet that are going to damage your brain things that could potentially cause calcification I mean calcification where I don't know is it going to reverse those those calcifications that you have I don't know because I don't know what what caused them but it will optimize your physiology you'll get into a physiological State a metabolic state that you're designed to be in and your body just works a lot better if you put in if if you eat what your body's designed to eat your body's going to work the way it's designed to work and it can undo a lot of damage it can't undo everything there is such thing as damage done but it will improve your life in a lot of different ways and so I would especially for neurological issues I've just seen staggering recoveries uh from that so uh definitely encourage that kaf thank you very much for the Super Chat not carnivore yet but should people with Miller hypercholesterolemia very high LDL only eat a carnivore diet or else uh they must take a stat so yeah so this sort of ties into what I was previously saying uh no I don't I don't think that it's the LDL that's the problem and I think that was shown very clearly with with the studies that differentiated out people with familial hypercholesterolemia and the clotting disorders it was those with the clotting disorders that had increased risk of heart disease and stroke or heart attack and stroke not the LDL people with just high LDL didn't have any increased uh relative risk um so staten's not going to help that you know because LDL is not the problem you're we're we're we're you know we're fixing a problem that that doesn't exist you know your house is on fire and it's like okay I'm going to wash your car like what what's that going to do is just like well because I mean you know the house is on fire and there's suit all over it I mean I mean obviously you know we got to we've got to wash a car it's like how about we put out the fire this a completely separate issue right so I just I just don't think that that's um you know I mean satins do lower cholesterol they stop your body from making cholesterol fine if that's what you want to do do it I don't you know I don't think that it's a problem I don't think that L that cholesterol is a disease we make cholesterol we're supposed to make cholesterol why are we fighting our body's natural biomechanics and Physiology I I just think that's a bit uh uninformed and so um you know if that's not a problem if LDL is not a problem and never was a problem which it I believe it isn't and wasn't then there's no need to lower it in my opinion John thank you very much for the Super Chat gastritis 15 months lost a lot of weight now underweight 6 months carnivore only meat uh water and salt nothing else 90% red meat avoid ppis because uh how to adust meat without stomach acid not much improvement what to do good question you know sometimes well you'll still digest meat even with a PPI U that's first of all but sometimes you know it's you know these sort of medicines can actually help and if you have gastritis you just sort of need to let your your body rest so a period of time with a PPI you will you will still absorb meat it's h maybe it's not as good maybe it's not as um you know uh you're not as well able to to break it down but you you you'll still do really well um most people don't even notice you they go on a PPI for a certain period of time they don't they don't notice differences in their digestion I'm sure there is some but for all practical purposes it doesn't seem to uh make all that much of a difference for most people so I think there might be a good idea to try that I would speak to your doctor as well you know see about you know if a pro you know PPI would be of benefit you know go on that for you know however long they suggest and you know if that's not enough you probably get a scope I mean it could be ulcers and all these other sorts of things that that hiatal hernia is just s you know a physical abnormality that that may be causing these problems so I would uh yeah I I wouldn't I wouldn't discount the ppis anyway do you want to be them on the rest of your life no of course not but if you can be on them and heal your gut and then get on with life you know that's worth it uh deeli thank you very much for the Super Chat do you take any digestion enzymes vitamin supplements uh thanks Doc uh no I don't take any digestive enzymes or anything like that um I've checked my vitamins and my minerals they're all uh in great working order um I was sort of wondering about you know my my uh folate because that is something that some people can find they have bit low folate and they just need to add in a bit of liver basically mine seem to be fine with just on skeletal muscle meat and fat great um what a bit of you know a vitamin supplementation or nutrient supplementation for corn carnivores it's really just liver you know and it's not even a supplement you should you know they're just they're just very nutritious it's is very high dense nutrition so if you if you need something like that you know I would just add in a bit of liver a couple times a week um folate is probably a good one to check for most people you know it is one that that people can be lacking in uh they maybe low methylators maybe they have the mthf FRG mutation and just need a bit more exposure to uh folate you know and it in its proper form which is not folic acid in a pill so uh add liver people oh my God liver it tastes disgusting it's not that bad cook it less less is more sear each side leave the inside rare it's like the difference between seared Ai and canant tuna it's a massive difference that's the only way I'll eat liver it's either raw or um or uh just just seared Raw Liver tastes way better than cooked liver and just seared on each side with raw in the middle that tastes the best to me anyway so that that's what I would recommend for people but no you generally don't need to take any of that stuff um you we're not eating wild animals anymore that aren't as nutrient dense as they could be if you're getting regeneratively raised grass-fed and finished uh beef you're fine if you're eating Wild game you're fine uh everybody else you're fine generally it's just some people may not get quite enough of these of these vitamins minerals and micronutrients from that just check you know if your Folly's a bit low you're not feeling uh as as good as you could be add in a bit of liver should come right up your body should be uh you know well able to um get everything it needs from skeletal muscle meat and fat and a little bit of liver if if you if you're not quite there okay this is going to be the last question guys and then I've got to I've got to run to work uh but thank you very much um for joining and next week I'll be able to be on longer because it's uh striad Australia die and so I'll have a bit more time because we won't be in the uh uh you know don't have have work that day um and of course we have the premiere on Sunday us uh Monday morning um in Australia middle of the damn night in Europe so I apologize um but that will be you know always new episodes every Sunday so if people can join those premieres I I like to chat live with people in the text chat um and answer questions if I can and uh but it's also just nice to to sort of watch it with everybody and um and it's very helpful when people uh join the premiere and leave comments and things like that because it it lets the algorithm know that this is something that interests people and it suggests it to more people so final question from Michael kesselman thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy you're the man thank you appreciate that um I like to work out first thing in the morning but also enjoy omad end of the day better to eat right after you work out question mark um like being fasted and sharp all day but want to be ripped uh yeah look that that's a good question you know there was a there was a recent study that just came out showing that if you have 100 grams of protein straight after you work out it actually increases your anabolic window of of of muscle growth for like 12 hours so you know people talk about this you know when I was when I was um you know an athlete and that was a big part of my life there was a lot of trainers talking about this anabolic window that um that you you just want to eat straight after you uh worked out that you trained things like that didn't matter what you ate just ate of course it matters what you eat um but that you know but if you ate a lot of meat and protein things like that you know they thought that this was this this was a good thing so it's um you know it it could be the case that [Music] um that uh that you could get a benefit from this so you know if that that study is correct that if you eat 100 and this was sort of compared 100 grams of protein straight after you work out as compared to uh 25 grams of protein straight after you work out and there there was a much bigger anabolic effect and and muscle growth effect from getting the 100 grams as opposed to 25 grams you know throws on its head the whole idea oh you can only absorb 40 grams of protein a day Ian or in one sitting to utter nonsense like I don't I have no idea where that came from again this is these sorts of things I've said this before but there's so many things in medicine and just in the world that have no basis in reality but they've just been repeated so many times that people oh well that's just what it is no not necessarily so um you know a lion may eat once a week it's just 40 grams of protein once a week probably not the Mongols genghiskhan you know they would they would go 5 days without eating you know slaughtering their way up and down the countryside eat 10 pounds of Hors meat do it again they're only getting 40 grams of protein from those 10 pounds of hem meat doubt it so you know that that mean it's not compatible with Life is it and so you know I eat once a day and I'm eating you know two three pounds of beef and here I am you know I'm getting more than 40 grams a day I guarantee you that so it might be a good idea to have something you know throw in some eggs or meat or something like that straight after you work out and then have your biggest meal at the end of the day um it's uh it's not as you know I I you know just because of my old habits maybe but I I I sort of like the idea of eating after I I work out I've always thought about this long before I did carnivore but I thought about this that was a funny thing you know I I I ate different ways at different times but I always remembered we were Hunters forever we were predators forever and I thought of it as you know I always want to play hungry because you're like you have to go out you have to make a kill you know you always play hungry because your body's telling you like you need to go and you need to fight a lion and bring down an ox and kill it you know so you're going to have more aggression you're going to have more energy and your body's going to be more tuned to this physical EXP depression and uh when I ate body's just like yep no take it easy sleep under a tree you know that's uh that's what you want to do um and I always sort of thought about it like well you've chased down you've hunted down something you've exerted yourself hard and you got your kill you got your reward and then you eat eat your kill and that's your reward I think you do just fine um just having this stuff in your system but you know there are are studies that suggest that having a big dose of you know food protein meat after you make your kill might actually have have some sort of physiological benefit which I think actually doesn't doesn't um you know go too far against what you would you would expect to see in the wild you know a line exerts itself maximally takes down a gazelle it kills it then it gets to eat it so you know is there some sort of physiological setup for us to better utilize nutrients straight after high intense exercise maybe and so you know I would I would play around with that obviously you don't want to eat too much or you will be tired and lethargic throughout the day so you know just eat enough that you sort of you know get get something in you and uh and and sort of take that bit of an edge off give your body some nutrients to start you know rebuilding you know then go on with your day I mean I I generally eat after I work out but I often work out later in the day just because uh that's I don't know that's what I prefer I like working out later in the day um so give it a try see how you go just don't eat so much that you get tired okay all right everyone thank you all very very much I really appreciate that I wish I could uh keep going but um unfortunately I have uh I have have patients uh coming in in about 20 minutes so I've got to I've got to make a run and I will see you all next week for the live and we'll be able to go a bit longer next time and um and then for the the premiere this Sunday thanks a lot everyone really appreciate it and uh have a great great weekend"
