    "body": "[Music] hey Dr chaffy I'm starting carnivore my trainer has me drink a mass gainer for muscle growth within 30 minutes after what are your thoughts about how to replace that on carnivore or do you have a certain product to use uh steak just fatty steak cut up you know just cook up a big big fat ribey something like that put some butter on it cut it up into chunks take that with you to the gym soon as you finish just eat it you know you just get that right away it's it's everything that you need the mass gain is a bunch of carbs and sugar and that sort of yeah you'll gain Mass you you'll gain mass in a fat ass it's just gonna it's just carbs it's just going to put on fat you're not going to put on muscle like you will put on muscle you know but it's not going to be because of the carbs like you'll put on muscle because of the work that you did in the protein that you eat um you know you you do raise insulin insulin does put carbohydrates as as well as protein into your cells but you know what you already have insulin and protein does give a bit of a bump of insulin as well for exactly that reason and so you know the idea that just oh if you don't eat protein with carbs and you're just not going to get you're not going to get enough insulin put in get your protein in your cells like who told you that uh what was that where where was that written down I missed that day on biochemistry class I guess it's complete another nonsense you know so uh I mean what 70% of animal species are carnivores and they I guess they're just not they're just not getting any protein because they're just they're not eating with carbs um that's nonsense so you don't need carbs in order to build muscle in fact it's counterproductive because you're just putting on fat as opposed to muscle and you're getting intramuscular fat you're getting uh more glycogen storage and deposition and water retention as a result of that so you look more bloated you look more bulky but that's fat water and glycogen it's not muscle you know so you want to put on lean muscle mass you just eat meat you just eat fatty meat and uh yeah absolutely so the same thing that You' eat at any other time you eat then right so if you want to if you want to you know that you call like an anabolic window straight after uh working out and some people say that that's a thing some people say it's not a thing I don't really care one way or the other if you find that you like doing that and you and it benefits you do it I I you know I think of it you know and uh I I don't think it's it's farfetched from an evolutionary biology point of view because you know when you maximally abser exerting yourself as a carnivore when you're running the hell away from something fighting for mating rights or hunting and trying to physically dominate something and kill it that's when you're working the hardest physically and so what happens directly after that big large exertion you get your kill you eat your kill you know so maybe there is something to that um either way I don't think it's it's unnatural to eat directly after you work out for that exact reason and so you know if that's what you want to do then do it but just do it with meat always do it with just fatty meat if you're in a stretch and you're in a bind and you and you just don't have access to that at that moment there are proteins protein powders that only have animal proteins like whey protein or egg protein or beef protein that um that I I have one of them um I I think I've used a quarter of it over the last three four years something like that and it would be for exactly that reason like I just worked out and I wanted to go and I want and I didn't have time to eat I had to go you know back into the hospital I had to go you know do something and I was like okay I'm just going to I'm just going to grab some protein and then get on with my with my day um and that's it but I I wouldn't do any other products of that I just eat meat really you know you can get you can get those protein shakes that don't have anything else um but I would really make sure they don't have anything else you know so some things that have way protein and that's it that's a single ingredient um or you know egg protein that's it single ingredient beef protein icelet that's it single ingredient if it has more than one ingredient besides animal protein don't get it they tend to cost more even though there's less in it don't know why probably just because you know there there's not as much of a market for it and so people are willing to pay more but just aren't aren't as many available but in any case you just eat meat if you're planning ahead and you're planning on having this muscle Gainer and all that sort of stuff you know just just just bring a steak just bring chopped up steak just eat crush it down and uh and you'll do great you'll you'll you'll slam on muscle you you'll uh uh yeah you'll find this easy very easy to to put on muscle actually more easy to put on muscle now than ever before um if you're working out hard is making sure you're eating enough so eat right after sure make sure you're eating enough after that maximally until it stops tasting good you have to do that a couple times a day to make sure you're getting enough meat um or else you'll you'll miss it and uh you won't uh you won't build as much muscle as you can you don't need to be in a caloric Surplus that's nonsense a surplus means Surplus to demand mean you're going stor is fat so again you want to put on mass fine but you want to put on muscle that's a different story so you don't need a surplus you need enough so you eat until it stops tasting good your body's going to tell you uh when I start working out I double my Hunger easily and so I'm eating like you know two two and a half pounds of very fatty meat a day and then I start working out that goes up to four four and a half easily you know and um and that's that's pretty normal and when I do that and I'm eating enough slamming all muscle I'm at 44 and it's easier for me to put on muscle now than at any period in my entire life except 20 to 25 when I was also doing this exact same diet and um I was jacked and when I was down in um before that when I was in Seattle I wasn't lifting weights as much but I was like my legs were like tree trunks just because of the amount of of running and sprinting I was doing and um and and I every now and then I would go do squats it was just like am I and I was squatting what was I squatting 495 I us sets of 10 it was just easy but it was like but my it hurt my back so much it was like I didn't use weight belt probably should have used the weight belt um but it just put so much pressure on my back and I was just like I couldn't do more weight than that because it hurt my back so much um and uh or put a lot so much pressure on my lower back which I've always had problems with my lower back um for whatever reason and uh but for my legs it was nothing it was nothing you know I could I could squat that easily so I use like sets of 10 and then I'd rest I do like four sets of 10 just from my sprinting workout I didn't I didn't squat much at all just every now and then I just would throw it in there but just because the amount that I was sprinting it was like six to eight hours a day I was just at a dead Sprint and um you know in interval right because bre in between sort of drills and games and plays and things like that but uh massive massive gain then when I was down in in Arizona for a year uh and I was with friends that were you know regularly in the gym I started getting back into like a regular lifting cycle and so it was just like four days a week rain or hail it's never rain or hail in Arizona so that's easy um that uh that we were in the gym and I I I got absolutely massive I got absolutely M jacked um so and now it's the same thing you know if I'm if I'm working out consistently and I'm eating enough you know I absolutely very easy to put on muscle I just put on muscle very easy and you'll find the same thing eat enough to eat enough meat you don't need supplements or or products yeah you don't so good luck with that man you you'll kill it hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys they say my question is I'm only eating once a day because I'm not hungry otherwise is that okay uh also I've been experiencing indigestion like symptoms with burping is this normal I've been lying for two weeks so eating once a day is is definitely is fine do remember that your hunger signals do change and they're much more subtle and so maybe you are hungry you just not realizing it so eat H fatty meat until it stops tasting good if that if once a day is fine then that's fine if you're feeling a bit off or a bit weird or H don't really know what's going on there or you're getting carb Cravings or like something else besides me just looking good or a steak sounds really good ask yourself am I hungry right now try eating meat and if it tastes good then you're hungry keep eating until it stops tasting good and and just go on like that um getting a bit of indigestion and sometimes you can get some uh again that psychosomatic sort of upset stomach because you're eating something that you're not used to and you're and you're doing it in a way that your your body's not used to and so you just need to ease into that the burping side of things I've seen that a couple times S I don't really know why that is it typically goes away um just see how you go and hopefully everything just sort of settles down and um doesn't cause a problem but um you know the you've been doing this for two weeks which is great you're just about to get into like the really exciting time where your body starts working so much better and you start shredding fat stacking on muscle if you're especially if you're working out and you just start feeling better and better and better and better and better some people are a bit more Slow Burn on their weight loss or fat loss I should say um but but typically people lose a lot of weight even early on and they just feel a lot better anyway some people who you know because one reason their leptin is very elevated their fasting insulin is very elevated their all of this means their metabolism is very depressed it's it may take a little longer some people snap right back and their bodies recover and they lose a lot of weight really quickly and others it takes longer so uh either way just just keep going with it you're just about to get in that time where you're just starting better and better and better and better and better so I'm really excited for you because that's a very exciting time I remember that time that was my favorite time because I just felt it so good and it was just really exciting to see how much better I could get as I went um but yeah if you only need to eat once a week then you only need to eat or once a day then you only need to eat once a day just listen to your body eat more often if it's telling you to and uh and try to relearn your hunger signals because they can they can be very subtle and you it's very easy to undereat on a on Carnivore diet so at least try to eat once a day if that first bite tastes like cardboard fine you don't need to eat that day but at least try once a day and uh and you'll be fine two three times a day it's perfectly fine too if that's what your body is telling you to do good luck gun SB thank you very much for the"

    "body": "you to do good luck gun SB thank you very much for the you to do good luck gun SB thank you very much for the Super Chat I love your plants are trying to kill you message uh in an old book I read that a few fermented vegetables have probiotics do those also have toxins and is it best to avoid them they do have toxins the fermentation process does lower the toxic load and increase the bioavailability of the nutrients so that's better uh it's still optimal to avoid them though I would say if you're trying to get them for that probiotic purpose fine but remember that you when you establish a microbiome that's healthy you will perpetuate it with the meat that you're eating and so you don't need to continue doing that there are also probiotics in live culture fermented d so you're going to have fermented dairy as opposed to fermented vegetables that's what I would personally do that's what I've personally done I don't use ferments at all uh to any great extent not not plants anyway I do have occasional yogurt but it's but I I do it in the same way that my friend Dr Shan omara would do with recommend with other prob fermented vegetable probiotics which is a little tiny bit put on meat chewed up together in the same bite so you're mixing that stuff into the meat so that you swallow that down and the bacteria survive your stomach acid which is you if you're just eating it straight probably won't happen and so when you do that um you can get that bacteria past the guard of your stomach acid and get that into your lower intestine where it's supposed to be and but once you have it established there it's established you don't need to keep you know you know planting crops they just keep going they keep they're they're they're you know uh they're plants that just keep keep growing growing and growing so um they're you know not they're not like the the wheat that just like grows and dies and grows and dies you have to keep replanting them um you know these these will perpetuate themselves if you're just eating properly so and a lot of people don't use probiotics and they have excellent microbiomes so but the the fermentation um process does lower the toxic load yes um and those probiotics are fine you know if you need so you had antibiotics or something like that yeah maybe have some of those things I wouldn't take probiotics from the from the store because those have been shown to be pretty useless and so you know if either do it with fermented vegetables but I would really stick to fermented dairy that's what I stick with and um know not that I've had to take antibiotics uh in a very long time but uh that's something that people typically do is take is have a bit of yogurt uh for a week or two after they take antibiotics and that can just sort of replenish their gut mic mome and be be pretty healthy so that's that's what I do but then eventually you're just going to have an established microbiome and your meat's going to perpetuate that just like the Inuit they um they just have very healthy microbiomes and uh and so that just get pretu also your oral biome changes and so that bacteria is going to get seeded into the meat and then swallowed with each bite so if you have healthy oral biome that can give you healthy gut biome it's just when we're eating a bunch of plants and carbs and things like that you actually don't have very healthy oral uh oral microbes and so those aren't necessarily seeding the right microbes down to your gut as well so you know those sorts of things probably a good idea but uh but not in our case and certainly not long term I don't think you need them"

    "body": "ys Leah ller thank you very much for the very generous ys Leah ller thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat I appreciate it um brand new carnivore from Texas with uh with questions first your thoughts on fasting to help us loose skin from weight loss I have heard it's important I don't necessarily think it's that important I don't think you necessarily have to to um to fast at all um I haven't seen one way or the other on on fasting helping uh skin loose skin um people have fast did and their skin has you shun there's you know famous guy famous story in the UK where a guy I think it's Scotland was very overweight and he just basically stopped eating for over a year and just drank water and took a multivitamin every day and he lost all this weight and he walked to work every day he just lost all this weight and it was very skinny and the skin came down with him now you can do that if you lose a lot of weight your skin will come down but if you gain it back up and then you lose it and you gain it and you lose it and you gain it and you lose it after about the third fourth time the Integrity of your skin and elasticity just sort of gives up and so it just depends on where you are with that but um if you are if you are just eating the proper amount of protein and fat and all these sorts of things and eating the right things that should stimulate the the skin to come down as well um I you know people probably talking about like oh you need to fast for autophagy and this is going to break down the cells that is that is really big reach um on what autophagy is for and does and also how it comes about because you get autophagy just from not eating carbs when your insulin goes down autophagy goes on and so it's insulin that blocks autophagy and so when you fast yes you go through autophagy because your insulin is coming down not because you're starving yourself and your body's trying to eat things your body eats the fat your body runs on fat that's what it runs on when you're fasting and or when you're starving and um it's not just going around because it's it's breaking down the mitochondria and it's replacing them and increasing their number so it's not looking around Scavenging for materials you know it's it's it's making new things it's making new mitochondri it's making new cells and so no that's not what's happening there so I don't think you need to fast if you if you are going and you're on a carnivore for several months and and um and you're not really getting the results that you want want to try fasting for periods of time go for it but uh I don't typically recommend it and I don't think it's necessary in this case um two will carnivore help nail skin and hair Health my nails are not in great shape yes absolutely it absolutely helps um all of those and a lot of people find that it's it's really really beneficial especially with skin and nails and hair the one caveat to that is that some people find when they go on to any ketogenic diet and you have this metabolic State change it can actually trigger a Fallout phase in your hair and so you can lose a bit of hair it's very much more noticeable for women especially because hair is longer and so you squeezing your ponytail it's just like like oh that's not as thick anymore you're seeing it in the drain and all these sorts of things and you're like you know it's like a w you took a bath in your in your tub or something like that and you're just like well this is this isn't good and um you know so it's uh it's it's temporary though so it triggers a Fallout phase it's not that the hair is dying it's that it's a Fallout phase and they actually typically grow back and they typically grow back thicker and so it's not necessarily you get more hairs but the hairs that grow back are thicker and so it looks thicker and Fuller as well and so you know that's something that a lot of people experience as well so just be mindful of that because some people do experience that do make sure that you have all your nutrients right so you check your B12 and your folate and your zinc and magnesium and D and thyroid thyroid is a is a when people have thyroid dysfunction you know that's a very common cause of of having hair sort of fall out and not be supported you need you need thyroid for every single cell in your body and you need your thyroid hormone for every cell in your body and so I would uh you know just check those things if people are experiencing hair loss you just check your Bloods you check your thyroid you check all those sorts of things as long as those things are okay and everything's great like okay it's just a Fallout phase it'll come back um keep an eye on it and you'll see your your hair stylist or your Barber will look at it and be like yeah you know there's there's little hairs growing up and you have a whole bunch of these things takes a while for women to grow back they do come back by and large so uh and yes your your hair skin and nails get a lot more healthy put Tallow on your skin probably the best thing you'll ever put on your skin is beef Tallow just straight up cooking Tallow unused cooking Tallow you know just scrape it out of a pan and um and just put it on your skin you your skin will never look better or or be healthier than if you use Tor on your skin good luck that actually changes your odor and so that can be a thing too it's not necessarily butter and Tallow it could be because your hormones are changing that's affecting the way your body smells and so uh that's not necessarily A Bad Thing butter smells nice that's just my opinion but I'm not wrong and so I you know it may be different but it's it's probably not that much of an issue um"
