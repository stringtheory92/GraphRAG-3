    "transcript": "okay also do a new introduction hello everyone we're doing a zoom live today we just did one question but forgot to forget to record it so sorry about that uh that was um uh that was from uh d-a-h-a-e i'm sorry i don't know how to pronounce that um but uh apparently they were saying that they might be able to make the zoom call but they were asking about um they saw something like ken barry's q a session from last month and someone said that there were long-term carnivores 13 to 14 years and they noticed that they're they had higher hpa1cs and glucose was higher and one of them was diagnosed uh newly diabetic and and they so they they were dramatically lowering their protein and upping their fat um and then uh you know talking about how i recommend sort of going between 70 80 calories from fat and uh that some of these people are yeah just just getting your glucose levels like below 100 grams of protein uh per day to manage your glucose numbers so my my answer to that was um i would have to know a lot more about that because like you know i've really heard that you know i've sort of seen the opposite with that you know me personally i've had the opposite happen with with me i've been doing this for 22 years or so and the you know first five years or so it was very strict and actually quite high protein low fat and then after that i was hyping hyper carnivore you know uh 70 or more uh of my calories came from me and actually quite lean meat because that's just what people were doing and then the last sort of five six years i've been high fat carnivore and um and uh and never had a problem and i just had my hp 1c checked again at ketocon and it was perfect so the the people that i've seen that are that are longer term carnivore than that like you know like daniel um dana shoot and uh charles washington kelly hogan the andersons all these people who've been doing this for 15 20 years or more uh they don't have that problem in fact dana talks about how she she finds her body works better with higher protein than fat now so she's she's gone down to more leaner meats uh dr baker finds that he you know sometimes he likes a bit you know leaner cuts as well so i've really seen the opposite of that and i don't think that if you know eating physiological like you know aiming for 70 80 percent calories from fat and then adjusting based on what your body needs and can absorb uh is going to really be far off because you know you're just you're if you're just eating the animal and just letting your body do its thing you your you know this is what humans have been doing for millions upon millions upon millions of years so you know i i don't see how that's going to screw with your biochemistry and you know while you do make you know glucose um from what you're eating uh it's not necessarily you know substrate driven whereas like you know if you eat carbohydrates it will just drive up your blood sugar if you're just eating more protein it doesn't pops your blood sugar up a bit but it's not a one to one it's not just gonna you got protein it's gonna make blood glucose it's not that's not really how it works so um so i'd be surprised about that so i need to i need to look into that a lot more um all right toby uh sorry you have your hand up if you wanna ask a question i did thank you um thanks for making the time for this too of course um so i guess the tricky part that wasn't my question but it was something i had a question about so that's kind of cool um within newer carnivores because it's like myself as someone who is um a newer carnivore and i know for sure that if i eat the protein that i want like like the steak that i want my blood sugar does go up and it stays elevated for quite some time but i think it's just part of my pre-existing insulin resistance right and yeah um i'm hoping that over time i will be able to eat that amount and not get a reaction like i know um from kelly too that like she can sit down and she can eat like a pound or two and she does not get a blip on her blood glucose whereas i do but i'm not as metabolically healthy as her um so i was kind of curious about what your protein ratios or gram recommendations were because i've done the recently like just with experimenting with people the lower protein and i i did not like it at all like i went to you know 60 to 80 grams of protein a day will give me um a fasting blood sugar of a you know of the low 90s you know some you know ketones which is numerically great but i'm it is we'll get cravings start with carb cravings i haven't had months full perfect because i know i'm not eating enough protein but if i eat like what i like to eat which is closer to you know a gram per pound of like i yield body weight like you know that kind of one to one i know that my blood sugar in the morning is going to be around 122 fasting you know so i don't know about these long-term primers i would agree with you from everything i've heard that's not the case for long term but i'm wondering if i know like um dr lisa wiedemann was she has a history of diabetes in her family immediate family and her blood sugar was a little higher than she wanted so she was kind of experimenting with uh you know actually tracking she was in a tracker her 80 20 ratios now and but she doesn't like she's cutting back her protein like these other like people like me who have returned so i think maybe the newbies have like taken this and ran with it it may be the wrong direction yeah um yeah well i think i think you're right you know i mean if you have if you have a bit of insulin resistance i mean this is your body's gonna make balance right and so your body's gonna produce the amount of glucose that it needs but then you know utilizing that glucose is is the next step and that's the problem that that we have in type 2 diabetes is that you know insulin doesn't work as well and so um you know and there's people talking about like the randall cycle and things like that we're eating carbohydrates and this sort of you know competes uh you know for for action in your cells um i i certainly don't uh i think that that's you know not contributing i i it certainly does but i but i don't i don't think it replaces you know the idea of insulin resistance i don't i don't i think i think there's real you know um you know professor bart kaye thinks that that's the whole message you know is that the randall sucks happening there's not really a thing called called insulin resistance but you know we you know i do kind of see people who actually do have you know display insulin resistance and their insulin you know stays up and their and their glucose control isn't actually that that good even though they're not eating carbohydrates it does it does come down though eventually that does that does settle down but it can take a while it can take months it can and it get and you know and some people it doesn't doesn't fully res well i shouldn't say that um but you know so it sort of seems as if some some people will need some sort of insulin uh uh you know help and boost some some idea some most type 2 diabetics will come off insulin but some won't you know like my mom still needs to take you know like a very very low dose of basal insulin you know and so uh but a lot of people don't but like she was on you know like 64 units of her long-acting uh you know atlantis and then she was taking little bits before meals and things like that now she's on the lowest dose of the lantis and she doesn't take anything else so it's a massive massive massive improvement but you know she was you know hurting herself for a very long time without realizing it and so you know sometimes there's there's just permanent damage done you just have to you just have to deal with that um you know certainly early on you're not going to your body's not going to be in in tuned perfectly and so your your body's making exactly the amount of blood sugar that you need it thinks but because it's not being processed as quickly or as efficiently that's going to you know shows that it's slightly elevated and so but that'll that'll settle that will definitely settle it just takes time how long have you been doing this well this current stretch is um just um two weeks away from six months it'll be six months september 15th but i had first come to carnivore four years ago um from keto and had done six months and then was like that's cool but you know i'm going to go back to more carbs again and quickly realize that was a mistake a huge mistake so and then it was a few years of just trying to get back to its tricks i do have food addiction issues so um so now i've kind of i think i've tinkered with everything and reached new levels of acceptance of i can't have stevia i can't have any sweet taste i can't do the little flavored electrolyte drinks can't do you know just gone through the look i've tested everything so now i just know it's just super strict so it's but this cert current round of what i would call carnivore sobriety is yeah almost six months now so yeah okay so yeah um well that's good yeah i mean it's it's uh you know it can be difficult to kick these things and and i think that i think the artificial sweeteners are absolutely toxic and and they and you know there are a lot of people that say you know it's like oh well you know it doesn't you know artificial sweeteners don't you know screw with your insulin or your blood sugar and this that and the other but there are studies that say that they do and there are studies that say that they don't and there's there's things opposite directions as with literally everything else in in medicine um but this is actually i see this in practice and i see people who use artificial sweeteners and they have you know constant glucose monitors and it absolutely affects their blood sugar and it absolutely affects their energy levels so you know i you know there are certainly studies and certainly um you know reports that that you know that show that and i see it in practice all the time and so that's what i'm going to go with because that's what i see and that's that's what the evidence uh i would suggest to me and um you know it's also you know it's not it's not something we've ever run into in the wild or in nature and so like i i think you're fooling yourself if you think that just adding some random ass chemical to your body is going to be beneficial if it's never been introduced in nature ever it's going to be it's going to be a long shot you know medicines sure in very certain you know isolated circumstances they may they may provide more more benefit than harm but at the same time that's because you're sick and there's something happening you know i'm not i don't really buy that you know these things are just just you know oh they don't have any effect because they're not carbs you know like i don't that's just they're a chemical and they're going to have a chemical reaction in your body and um and so you know maybe that's a beneficial chemical response but it's going to be something and so uh you know what i see is it absolutely affects your blood sugar and and and and that sweet taste sort of keeps you know you you wanting that sweet taste and uh and it's very addictive and and very yeah just very addictive you talk to people and they you know you feel like they're just actually getting withdrawals and they feel like they have the flu just from coming off like artificial sweeteners which is crazy you know so i think that if you have that sort of response to something like that that you know you know this is something that that you shouldn't have in your body and so i just yeah i just avoid that at all costs really um all right let's see okay um let's see the next question um there's a question from serena um serena did you want to ask a question you want me to read it out sorry it takes so long to find the mute button um i can ask it sure yeah i can ask it um i just um you know there's still some questions and you and i have talked about this before but i still find so many questions and so many people having the under eating issue like i had at the beginning and i just wonder if you would address that for people um you know it it just people just don't when when people come to this it is so hard to remember that for so many of us from years and years of under eating and restricting that we don't really know what being hungry and being full feels like and you can feel full very quickly on a carnivore diet and not even realize how little you're eating you know for me it was for eight months and gaining 18 pounds by under eating and people argue and say that's not possible you can't gain weight by under eating but it is true it can happen um and i think so many people and especially women but men too are so scared to eat more and i'm going to try not to cry because it is such an emotional thing for me because for eight months i struggled with that and couldn't find the advice that i needed people people would just say oh you'll figure it out just eat one hungry till full don't track your food and and i know none of us want to track our food and i know calories people argue calories don't mean anything but it's a way to measure it's a way that we understand it's a way that we can all know whether or not we're eating a you know a reasonable amount of food and so i think especially for women though it's so important just to remind them that whether you're tracking or not you can kind of eyeball it but a thousand calories is not enough 1200 calories is not enough 1400 calories is not enough but as as a woman who always felt like a salad was enough food it is so hard to put that into perspective and realize that a pound of meat is about right for a meal and it's so easy to say well you know but i had one hamburger patty with a little bit of cheese on it and i'm done now and then you do that a second time in the day and then you're not really hungry and you're eating you know maybe six or seven hundred calories but it's so easy to feel full so i just wondered if you might address that you know and just kind of explain how that happens and the starvation mode you know and all of that kind of stuff because i know so many people struggle with it yeah yeah no it's a very good question it's something that people run into but you know and and i you know tell people like it's very very easy to under eat when you're on a carnivore diet because your hunger signals just change so dramatically you know when you're eating carbohydrates it raises your insulin insulin blocks leptin leptin tells your brain how much fat you have and how much energy you have and so if it's not seeing that leptin it thinks you don't have any leptin that you don't have any fat stores and so it thinks like oh christ you know we're starving and and also your blood sugar is dropping because that's what also insulin does as well and so you get this your brain gets this panic signal that says you know you don't have any fat stores and your stomach's empty if you don't eat now you will die and this is why you get these panic signals you know you know multiple times a day i have to i have to eat a happy and people you know the term hangry you know coming around like that's just people just just frantic you know just hacking you know freaking out there's like videos on on like you know on youtube it's just like people just losing their mind i haven't eaten at 12 hours in losing their minds and it's and it's funny because you know that they're not starving you know and they you know they're just like oh you're just overreacting this and that but like that is actually the signal that they're getting they're actually getting frantic you're going to die if you don't eat that's a very very very you know powerful you know uh signal that your body's getting it's it's straight survival it's just like i have to you know you're just freaking out because like it's just like this is life or death time you know and so you know that is a very far cry away from my actual hunger what actual hunger feels like of just like oh yeah you know i could be i could use some energy so like the difference when you stop eating that is that you know you're you you just don't feel hungry ever and you just don't eat at all you know i did that for a while when i first started doing this i just never felt hungry and i was just working out so much and i was you know going to class i was just so busy all day that you know i would get home at like you know 10 11 at night you know after you know being in university you know all all morning and afternoon and then you know rugby and training and the gym for you know six to eight hours after that and i get home you're like i gotta be up early i just gotta go to sleep and i was gonna drink a bunch of water and go to bed you know and and it'd be like you know three four days in a stretch i would not eat at all and you know i just didn't know and i was just like oh this is i don't know if this is right like i'm really not eating that much but yeah i'm just not hungry i'm just not hungry and and and it caught up with me i didn't i started not uh being able to to do all that and um and that's why i had my okay again that i don't know what the hell it is but i i know i need more food and so um you know that then i you know sort of learned the biochemistry of this afterwards and and and um you know understood was able to understand it much better the second time around and you know so you have to relearn your hunger signals and one of those is is just by going by taste and and uh satiety whatever but you have to sort of relearn what that means and you have to understand what that means for you and so if you're eating food you're eating like meat you know if it tastes good that's your body rewarding you saying we want this we want this to feel good for you there you go and so it tastes good it tastes good tastes good eventually will stop tasting good and some people have you know sort of portion issues they're so used to eating like very large portions they'll they'll start eating this and they'll start not liking it but they're so used to eating these proportions they'll actually overeat and they'll say like oh i hate this i have to force feed myself it's like no you don't have to force feed yourself if you know the converse is true as well if it doesn't taste good that means you're not hungry that's your body telling you to stop because now it's giving negative feedback saying hey no no too much too much you know stop and so you have to listen to that and so if you're just feeling a bit off or something's a little wrong just you try eating if it tastes good you keep eating the other there's another concept that you've heard with like some of the coaches from like you know and from bella uh steak and butter gal which is like this this um this idea of what they call priming where so the first couple weeks that you start onto a carnivore diet you basically eat three times a day you know and uh and you and you eat until you're you're like thanksgiving stuffed where you're just like you're just overly not not overly full but just you're just like yeah that's it and you just do that three times a day but you know you don't force feed yourself but you just get to that point where like okay i i really like that's it for me and that was a sort of you know force you to see how much food you actually want until you're actually full and and you're doing that sort of three times a day so you're making sure you're getting enough food and after sort of two weeks of that you're just like okay now i understand what this sort of feels like and that that can help i i mean i didn't do that myself um but i i definitely think it sounds good as a concept and so you know people can can play around with that but like you know i i think that you should definitely try to eat until your thanksgiving full every day i do that once a day because that's just how much i need now if i'm working out i have to do that twice a day so i'll literally double the amount because my body wants to you know put on muscle and and use more energy as well and so um you know that's that's now i know what my what hunger feels like and so i can i can tell what my body wants um it kind of feels the same you know like once you relearn these things you know it sort of tracks it sort of slots into the like oh yeah i'm kind of hungry sort of feeling it's not this panic it's never a panic but i can i can i can get sort of the same like to me i i it gives me the same sort of signal so i don't know if it's like because there's definitely different feelings before but then i sort of associated those with hunger like does this mean i'm hungry that he like yeah i was hungry you know now i just sort of have that same sense of like oh i'm hungry so you can relearn these things but you have to make a conscious effort to do it and i totally agree with with serena that you absolutely have to uh get enough food for your body that you know just eating less calories does not mean you'll you'll use more of your own fat that is garbage that is absolute garbage and you know people say it's like oh if you eat fat your body will preferentially use that fat that you eat and it won't use your store fat  that is absolute the uh there have been tons of of uh biochemical um studies showing like like just straight up biochemistry showing that when you eat fat that actually triggers your body to release that you know if you think about this sort of evolutionarily biologically this could be because you know if you're bringing in all this new energy you're not in a time of starvation you're getting food in so your body goes okay hey we don't need to sequester this you know we're not you know we're we're not in the middle of a siege and we have to like you know you know strap up or belts and like you know just starve for the next two years you know you're like it's a time of plenty like great we can ramp up our metabolism we can start mobilizing more fat cells we can actually start using this energy that we have stored up if you don't do that you know and this is something like serena said you know this is a very very widely uh distributed number if you eat less than 1200 calories you will not lose weight i mean you can force the issue i mean people in start you know concentration camps definitely lose weight but you know they last a lot longer than you'd imagine i mean like you know the the the gulags in russia and now in china uh currently and um you know in the concentration camps in in um in you know nazi germany i mean these poor people were living on barely anything for years and decades some cases like in russia and so you know and you just you like the amount of calories that they're getting and like what they're doing the amount of late hard labor they were doing it was just like it was i was reading you know alexander solzhenitsyn's uh gulag archipelago and they were describing the amount they would get like you know six ounces of of of black bread or something like that and like little bits of other thing and that's what they were doing and working like 16 hour days you know like you know but as like you know chopping down wood and preparing all these sorts of things i was just like how the hell did these people even survive you know but your body's really good at conserving energy when it needs to and when you don't have a lot coming in it really really ramps down your your metabolism and and and conserves that energy so you're not going to lose weight in the in those uh cases and if you're eating fatty meat and you're getting as much as your body wants you to your body's going to work optimally you know you try to tinker with that it will mess it up in one direction or another and a lot of times you know people will do this and they'll screw up their metabolism they'll shut down their metabolism and uh and they won't get you know sort of the benefits they want and they any little bit that they eat they'll put on a lot of weight or whatever and so and the whole calories and calories out thing i mean calories do matter in a sense you know maybe this is energy but it's not it's not just energy these are these are you know organic compounds that have you know and chemicals that have chemical reactions in your body and so you know they do other things as well and and it's it's not just calories and calories out because you don't just use x amount of calories per day and then up or down depending on how much extra exercise you have no it dramatically changes based on what you're eating as well as what you're doing physically because you know if you're you know if you're not eating enough like we said your your metabolism is just going to shrink right down and you will not be burning as much calories and you know um and this is this is a very very well known and well-described phenomenon so yeah it's a lot more complex than that and so if you just if you just your your body will understand its biochemistry a hell of a lot better than than you ever will and you know even a professor in biochemistry we just you know we're we're interpreting you know phenomena that we see you know but but your body is actually the one doing it and processing billions of chemical interactions every microsecond you know that is so complex you'll never be able to micromanage that and why would you try your body's doing it for you so just just give your body what it needs and it will it will work out all right um great there's a question from wendy i'll take a look at this so i know a 10 year old who has developed white sausage inside of his elbow tummy torso for the last two months he's keto for the last five months eating meat eggs cheese fruit unfortunately mainly berries and cream occasionally oranges uh could the diet have caused this nope no it wouldn't it wouldn't cause that so i mean he should get that checked out by his his gp or his um or if that has a dermatologist but no that's that shouldn't be caused what certainly won't be caused by you know meat and everything like that he's having like a bit of a weird reaction to like maybe the cheese or the berries or whatever uh if he has a problem with dairy but you can try eliminating all these things out and just just going you know just with the meat um maybe has problem with you know some people have problems with eggs but uh no you shouldn't be getting spots because of this and you certainly won't be getting it because of meat if you you if it's if you are worried that it's something from the diet um a he probably should have been getting this prior to going this because eliminating other things isn't going to like make this present but also you can just you can just eliminate out everything except meat and water and see if it clears up it might and it might clear up for other reasons than than you know you know having a reaction maybe there's other things going on there but uh you know you can you can try that anyway and just just go just pure meat and water with him and see if those spots clear up and then you know that's that's fine for whatever you know whatever was causing it you know it's gone now so it doesn't really matter but i would imagine that that's uh it's probably not to do with that and so just just get just have a doctor take a look at it or a dermatologist [Music] and then there's a general question why do people need to take electrolytes more on keto carnivore when they generally never had on sad i don't know if they actually need to i know a lot of people do but um i don't i never have um actually i don't even use that much salt and a lot of people like like dana and charles washington and all these other guys they never use salt and so you know i don't i don't i don't i know that a lot of people do use electrolytes but i honestly don't i don't think they have to use as much as that as they think they do and then we have you know the elements sort of guys and other sorts of things which is like fine you know you have you have a product and and i have no no problem with that but i don't think that you need that really on on a carnivore diet and you know looking at looking at you know things like um you know magnesium which a lot of people are deficient in and especially in australia because like the soil which is apparently just deficient in magnesium in general and so everyone is deficient in magnesium i came here i had all that stuff checked i was not deficient in magnesium and i don't take magnesium and uh and my you know my my sodium and potassium all that has never been off ever and you know i i've never had that problem i i think that um i think that people are using a lot more uh electrolytes than they actually need honestly and i think you know some people when they're getting you know cramps early on this could be because you're by just taking in different amounts of electrolytes and sort of balancing stuff out maybe you know i have no actual proof of that um but uh you know some people do get get cramps and things like that i i notice for me and for people that i speak to that cramps leg cramps are more often caused by uh dehydration just not getting enough water you know especially i work out i do all these sorts of things and i get i don't get enough water like i'll get i will get leg cramps you know even still i got them you know last week and i thought back i'm like oof i really didn't drink much water today slammed a bunch of water went away some people will have cramps from low magnesium and things like that you can get that quite often it's it's dehydration though and so when people are taking electrolytes and they're taking magnesium and they're taking potassium and adding salt to their water and things like that and they're still getting uh cramps well then you know it's not the electrolytes because you are taking electrolytes and you're still getting cramps and so obviously it's something else right because you've addressed those issues so you've eliminated those as a cause and now it's something else um so i just you know think that people should should think about that but yeah i know i think i think that that people probably take more electrolytes than they actually need maybe early on you know if your body's adjusting i don't think you need to take the long term um and another one uh how exactly does coffee stop nutrient absorption um well it i mean there's different things that are in in plants that will will disrupt nutrient absorption you know there's um uh like protease inhibitors liposuctors there's different sorts of things that will you know bind to the foods that you're eating and so it won't allow them to be absorbed um like tannins will do that as well and so there's a bunch of crap in coffee that sort of are in that that category um i don't know the mechanism behind how it stabs your body of magnesium but that is that is something that's been commonly described that that you know drinking coffee and even just taking caffeine will will strip your body of of uh of magnesium and you're gonna be you're just much more sensitive these things i i've found on a carnivore diet and so you drink coffee you take caffeine you're going to dehydrate yourself and strip yourself magnesium perfect recipe for uh cramps you know to go back to you know to tie into the last question and so um you know that that's another reason and that that's another thing too a lot of people really don't want to get rid of the coffee uh when they go corn of war and it may be that they're just a bit more sensitive now to it i don't know i don't know why that would be necessarily but uh i do find that people you know have one cup of coffee in the morning and they feel good and they feel like crap after that so i have to keep drinking coffee but even if they just have one coffee in the morning they find that their sleep is is seriously affected you know even at night and so and when they cut that out you know it gets a lot better so for whatever reason people seem to be a bit more sensitive um and toby said i heard that coffee also lowers your stomach acid over time i don't know i i hadn't heard that myself but um maybe and what about iodine i don't know if coffee affects iodine i haven't um heard that one way or the other i've just really heard it about the magnesium but you know i haven't i haven't looked into the iodine coffee relationship specifically um what else we got does anyone else have uh questions i've been talking for a while anyone i just want to um spend on the real quick spin on the i overeat like i've only been before for a little over three months and i just eat all the time i probably eat between 25 and 3 000 2500 and 3 000 calories and then um so my first question is is that a problem i'm not gaining weight but i'm not losing i've lost three pounds in three months um and i have about 10 more pounds like i don't care to lose it but i have it to lose so that means that i'm holding you know but what do you think about eating that many calories it's fine you know if that's what your body wants like you know when i first started doing this i wasn't i was you know severely restricting calories i was eating you know a lot of vegetables and filth like that and doing like those green smoothies from hell and uh and then just really limiting the amount of meat that i had and the amount of fat that i had and it uh you know i was you know i wasn't really losing too much weight i was you know you know had a lot of extra weight and you know didn't didn't feel good and then you know i cut out the greens and i just ate to satiation i probably went up to like four to five thousand calories a day um i i don't know at least quadruple the amount of calories i was taking in i just started just dropping weight like just shredding it off you know i lost 23 pounds in the first 10 days you know but then i stayed the same i just like rock solid and but i was but i was just transforming in the mirror you know and i was like shredding fat and stacking on muscle but i weighed the same amount every single damn day and so some people were saying it was just like oh i'm not really losing any weight but they notice that they're you know their clothes fit looser and and you know and things like that so there are other indications i was 243 pounds on the nose every single morning without fail for months months and months and months i had no point was i 242 or 244 it was 243 every single damn day but i was transforming in front of the in front of the mirror so you know like um you know they talk about like having you know non-scale related sort of you know accomplishments and wins and things like that i think that's really good you should focus on how you feel primarily and then you know on on you know the changes that you might see in your appearance clothes fitting looser things like that uh secondarily and then the scale would be a very distant distant uh you know third because muscle weighs more than that very simply and so you can be replacing and toning up muscle and losing fat and your scale's going to look the same but there are people like kelly hogan but it's i don't know it's me you know i think it's less than five percent of people it's it's it's fairly rare but it happens where they like won't lose any weight and they might be gaining weight for the first sort of several months now some people over a year maybe that has to do with undereating maybe it just has to do with their bodies you know you know trying to sort of you know people call that you know healing you know you want to your body's trying to heal or something like that there are a lot of different things going on and you're you know you look at you look at like the the biggest loser that show where everyone like was like you know force fasting just not you know just eating you know like one rice cake a week and like you're just forcing themselves to exercise and these you know these you know slave camps and they and they you know some people you know they lost weight but it wasn't healthy none of them were healthy and and they they tracked their metabolism they tracked their basal metabolic rate and things like that it was severely depressed and so even though they've lost all this weight it actually destroyed their metabolism so they were not using much energy they had or they had low energy they felt like crap all this stuff they tested them again six years later six years later and none of them had recovered you know now that could have been that they you know continued on the same destructive sort of uh lifestyle habits that they picked up during the show or it could just be that caused that much long-term damage but you know if you have depressed your metabolism by the these sorts of pathological dieting methods your metabolism is going to be a bit more screwed up than someone like me who's played professional sports and never restricted calories you know except when i was wrestling you know when i and cutting weight and things like that but you know i probably had a bit of an advantage there too because we never we didn't really have as many uh heavier weight people uh in my school and so because i was one of the bigger people like i i wrestled up i suppose most people like wrestle down but like you know we had we had sort of you know one or two guys that were like 260 pounds they weren't making it down to 215 and everyone else was sort of like at you know 181 you know once 170 180 mark and then here was me at a comfortable weight of 195. so it's like okay we need you to wrestle at 215. so i had i went up so i actually wrestled 20 pounds above my weight you know because so i was trying to put on weight and wrestling season which is like the opposite of what everyone else does because we needed it that's what my team needed and so i was i didn't i didn't have to do all that that sort of you know weird crazy uh you know trying to kill yourself uh sort of things uh to lose weight but um you know but that would be the only time in my life that i really restricted calories as it was if it was in wrestling and i wanted i needed to sort of get down under her weight um and so i know i don't i didn't have the those sort of same sort of things so when i sort of went into it it was bam stuff was just coming off me but there are there are other people you know we see this in clinic where people have like you know leptin sensitive or insensitivity uh and they're leptin levels which is you know the signaling molecule coming from your fat cells that go tell your brain how much energy you have uh you're blocking this your body's making more and more leptin and and you can get insensitive to this you have this mass massive high leptin levels but you're always hungry and um and people can put on weight a lot of people if they say i forget the sort of the units but if it's over a hundred your left is over a hundred supposed to be like between ideally between six and eight and if it's um above 100 a lot of doctrine a lot of a lot of bariatric surgeons will argue you cannot lose weight without surgery you will you have to get surgery after that but i see people you know on a carnivore diet drop it right down you know so you know it's just a matter of how you're doing it how you're losing weight and how you how you know if you're just being healthy and i and i do see those people actually lose weight as well even though their their leptin can be 200 you know but there are some people who for whatever reason they'll they'll eat enough and they'll they'll sort of hold on to that way and it could be that just over time that your body is just like i don't trust this you know we've been basically in a fasting famine starvation state for so long it's just like uh it's gonna take a little more than that that's you know anthropomorphizing you know physiological phenomenon but that's sort of how i think about it your body is is is geared up for fasting for for famine times and you know and then that's and it just is going to take a while to correct your hormones and your biochemistry to the point that it's going to run at a higher higher rate and and allow you to um you know just sort of get back down to a you know a a you know a lower body fat percentage i didn't want to eat that many i didn't want to eat that many calories because people were like oh my god you're you know but the other thing i think what which i would talk about earlier is the fact i think what's happening in the carnivore community is keto meets carnivore and you've got people like dr baz who has this ratio of really low really low protein and high fat to get into ketosis so of course my ms brain right with neurological problems wants to get into ketosis and yet i love to eat two pounds of meat so what i'm doing now is getting i'm like i'm like so i like about 100 to 120 grams of protein but i try to double or triple the fat and so that's what's pushing me into a three thousand calories but i'm not sure that like dr bosh he's not carnivore and i don't know how keto differs but the carnivore that eats a lot of protein and one-to-one ratio is about a seventy five to twenty something right i think yeah that's 70 70 to 30 yeah so i guess i but i don't want to go low protein but i like to be in ketosis so that i think that's the dilemma that that first question and toby have does that make sense so what do you what are you judging your your ketosis off are you getting blood tests are you doing urine you're instruments with keto mojo because yeah the blood test pretty good i'm trying when i was doing before i never tested and i didn't knew anything i just ate meat but then i had digestive problems and i didn't stay carnivore so this time i'm really trying to dial it in and i'm a little sicker with this ms stuff with some more symptoms so i'm trying to utilize carnivore and ketosis kind of thing my blood sugar they're okay i mean my a1c is 5.4 i some people would probably call that pre-diabetic you know i don't i'm not too worried about it but yeah well um what digestive issues were you getting when you were just eating intuitively yeah well the first time i just ate a lot of meat this time i'm trying to really but eat more fat and i was getting i i was just very constipated but then projectile and diarrhea and blood i mean just crazy stuff going on and then i went back to eating vegetables and all that stopped but this time coming carnivore i've been very careful to eat a lot more fat and eat or meat stock so i'm not having those problems anymore yeah well yeah i mean if you're ever getting constipation and constipation defined as dry hard stools as opposed to you know infrequent stools infrequent stools is not constipation it's dry hard stools that's the definition of constipation and was not dried just it wasn't for a long time and then all of a sudden i was having once a week projectile vomiting and diarrhea that's a very strange but um yeah generally if you're getting dry hard stools and you get like um you're definitely not eating enough fat sometimes you get what's called overflow diarrhea which is you'll get so constipated it'll actually cause an obstruction or near obstruction and so and that and that sort of is is um where you would get the vomiting we actually literally get this stuff backed up so much that it just has to come out you know one end or the other because it's just you know it's one way two you know it's just a two it has two ends and that's it and if you can't go out one it's going to come out the other and so um you know that's that's what you see but um and then you can get diarrhea in the sense that it will overflow around this obstruction and only liquid can get around it and then you can have like copies of diarrhea and then all of a sudden you'll have this you know big hard stool and then these things will be sort of you know more diarrhea and things like that and it'll sort of settle down for a bit and then the process will repeat itself i don't know if that was what's happening but that is something that happens um but yeah you know just just getting the the amount of fat right is very important for that as well and so you know making sure that you're getting enough fat is obviously very important um and um you know i i are what you're eating now is it are you at least enjoying like what you're eating or you're getting to the point where you're just like oh i'm not really enjoying this or you have to force feed yourself or you're happy with it i love carnivore i mean i eat a rib eye every day i do a little bit of you know i love my diet yeah i just wanted and you're reassuring me that the calories are okay and i don't have a low protein like i can do i want to do 80 20 but i have to eat more calories of course because if i'm going to stay at 120 grams of protein you've got to get your fat up yeah and and the thing is as long as you're not like force-feeding yourself then like don't worry about it yeah you want that ratio you want that sort you aiming for 70-80 calories from fat and then adjusting i think adjusting based on taste is good but just also your stools like what your body is absorbing like if you're getting dry hard stools your body's absorbing every ounce of fat that you're eating so you know it could maybe need more right and so but if you're getting just a bit of spillovers you are getting some that you're not absorbing that goes in your stools and keeps it soft then you know it could be that uh you know that then your body's absorbing everything it needs and a little more so you know you're saturating the amount of fat absorbed absorption your body's body wants and so i think that's um that's uh exactly where you want to be that's the sweet spot and then you're too much is um you know obviously you're going to get a overflow a lot of overflow and then you're going to get some loose stools so um i think that that's that's how you want to judge it is that you know just based on what your body can absorb so and so if you're not forcing yourself if you're not something like oh i don't like this but i'm going to do it then you're doing okay you can overeat even on carnivore it's just you have to actually try you actually have to like force yourself to do it and your body's not going to be able to absorb more than a certain amount of fat it's just not physiologically possible um you'll only you you primarily absorb fat with bile and you will run out of bile eventually which is it's finite resource after that you can absorb some fat to a small degree and and some you will but most of it will go out you know so it'd be very very good back to fat so if the if the stools are whatever showing that the fat's not digesting dial back to fat yeah yeah you can't well you can you don't you don't have to it's not you're not sick you know it's not an infection it's just going to be inconvenient to your life you know it's so you know but it's but there is an overflow you know you're not really you're if you don't if you eat more than your body can absorb you just won't absorb it you know that's what fiber is i can't use it can't absorb it it has to get rid of it right so that that can happen at a certain point with that as well yeah thank you i think jordan was raising his hand i thought i had a quick question i'm sorry um well i have to do very quick because i actually have a meeting starting at eight um but uh jordan is it a quick question um well if you know jordan if you wanna if you wanna ask me uh just in in the messages i'm happy to answer it personally and um and we can also i'll also be doing a another live event for for all patreon not just the tier 2 and above on wednesday so if you want to want to come if you're able to come back on that we can do that or you can ask me um why don't you just ask me now just what is it real quick it was just referring to bart k talking about um when people transition from the normal western diet to a zero carb diet that invariably he found that people have trouble six nine 12 months down the line it's because they didn't transition into it he recommends like a six week kind of 50 reduction each week of whatever plant material you're taking you know just curious about if that's true yeah well yeah he talks about well look anything in barcade says it has been thoroughly researched you know that guy you know does his homework and and assigns other people homework he's been a professor for 26 years and um you know so i i put i put a lot of uh you know you know credence to pretty much anything that guy says it's you know from i haven't seen that personally though i mean he's talking about the microbiome that you know it takes longer to to sort of you know re-tune your microbiome that certainly didn't happen with me it doesn't have i put people on a carnivore diet just just straight away uh every every day every week you know in clinic and everything and i don't see those problems as much it may be that someone you might have that problem but like you know as long as you're eating meat before that you know you're going to have some of the microbiome that that works well on that and you're just going to starve out the ones that that don't work well on that because you're not eating those things but i've even seen vegans vegetarians like long-term like 20-year vegan or you know 15 20-year vegetarians vegans go go carnivore have no problems um so you know my understanding of the microbiome is it actually changes basically daily depending on what you eat and so it can it can change quite rapidly um that's my understanding the microbiome and you know seeing in practice that's that's what i've noticed so i i i i'll have to look into it i have to look into more why he's asking it or why he's saying that and what he's basing that on but it's not something that i've seen myself uh so i i've made maybe some people and and if you find yourself in that camp then you know keep that in the back of your mind and they say okay well maybe i'll i'll do a bit of a transition um and uh but i've i have not seen um you know really anybody have that problem so i don't i don't know sort of what that's based on but i i haven't seen that um but uh you know maybe that some people do that i would not say invariably though i wouldn't say that because i i think you know a lot of people go carnivore even from like vegetarian and they and they do too great long term so i i don't see that anyway all right we can talk about it more at 10. yeah we have a thing at 10. we have a thing at 10 oh we do that's right so yeah yeah yeah um okay great guys well thank you everyone uh for coming on i'm i'm sorry i had to sort of keep it just to the hour i'm normal i'm happy to spill over but i i do have an appointment at a meeting at 10 at eight now so i do have to run but we'll be doing a live event on wednesday as well and um that should be same time same time different channel and uh but on wednesday and we're doing that on sort of a youtube live thing so we'll send out uh links for that as well and uh yeah so think of any questions and submit them and and and uh and we can we can talk more with them okay and uh yeah all right thanks a lot guys i really appreciate it i hope you guys caught something out of that right all right"
