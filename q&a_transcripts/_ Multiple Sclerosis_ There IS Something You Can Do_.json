    "transcript": "[Music] I have a friend with MS and he's getting uh the meat is bad runaround oh God that's unfortunate any advice can you talk about Ms and carnivore thank you doc yeah I I mean that's that's that's really sucks because the meat's the only thing that's good for him and everything else is going to be triggering his Ms so every autoimmune disease uh that I've ever seen uh is going to has improved on a carnivore diet especially red meat and water diet you stick to red meat and water you stick to beef lamb goat and Venison and nothing else just water besides that salt to taste he's going to improve I had a a video with uh a lady named Dr Sarah she wanted to keep her her anonymity a little bit um from from her name for obviously you know uh for professional reasons and um but she had Ms and she's a a PhD in biostatistics so she does high level research on different different projects and um and so she knows how to read studies because she writes a lot of them and does the statistics for them and she had very bad Ms she was in her early 30s she was had previously been a ballerina and very high functioning very intelligent very athletic and then all of a sudden she's in a wheelchair and she can't move and she can't live properly and she needs people to help her with with normal daily functions and she came across carnivore diet and she started looking into it and reading studies and and she was like no they're they're on to something here there is there is something here and so she went on a carnivore diet and then high vitamin D protocol and in six months she was not only out of her wheelchair but she was back doing ballet and on her MRI the legions had he were healing right so and I've seen that time and time and time again with MS and every other autoimmune disease meat is not bad me is the only thing that's going to save this guy's life um it's all the other crap that's bad and is killing him and that's what's causing the antibodies to form you get these plant toxins that get in your body and they start causing merry hell in your body and your body tries to attack them and get them to hell out of there and your nerves in the case of Ms are getting hit in the crossfire right whether that's because things are sticking on there and attacking the nerves and your body's trying to attack them for attacking you uh or or you're getting cross reaction from molecular mimicry which I think is less likely um then either way you get rid of those toxins antibodies go away and this is what I see on a daily basis with my autoimmune patients you for autoimmune diseases that you can measure uh antibodies I measure their antibodies they go on a a red meat and water diet only antibodies come right down disease goes away so that is objective proof of what's Happening Here so um I would I would tell your friend that um find that video it's it's almost impossible to find like it just doesn't come up like YouTube is just I think they might be the algorithm is sort of hidden things in ways even if you type in like you know Anthony chaffy and Dr Sarah and uh from wheelchair to walking and Mass multiple sclerosis like I have trouble finding it they just something wants to hide that video for some reason and I don't know that probably tells you you might want to watch it um so do look for that uh try and find that and show it to your friend and hopefully that will bring them around because if he stops eating plants and only eats red meat and water he will not have MS I I can guarantee that you have to do the other things as well you need to get your sleep right you get your stress under control you get rid of other sort of outside uh influencing factors any sort of chemicals or anything he's putting in his body that's not supposed to be there alcohol cigarettes all these other sorts of things sweeteners get all that crap out of there and your body's a temple don't put anything in there that's not holy and um and uh and and good luck with that he will get better if he gets if he does that he will promise it's not going to hurt hurt him right try for 3 months see what happens it'll help he'll get better and um and he'll objectively improve on his MRI as well as uh uh with his symptoms as well very sorry to hear about that I hope he does well good luck with that when you're in ketosis more often than not then you're going through autophagy and your body is turning over the mitochondria stimulating more mitochondri you go through mitophagy and mitogenesis so you're turning these things over so they're newer faster better and you have more of them and so they work better so your brain works better and you're also getting rid of all these plant toxins which cause a lot of neuroinflammation and damage and stop your brain from working properly"
