    "transcript": "[Music] CS um super chat from from last week and uh who says what's up cha dog uh my girl and her mother say uh that it's immoral to eat meat I told them it's part of human nature they say it's evil to kill how do you deal with these people well you you can you can point out you just ask him it's like okay do we get rid of all the all the predators in the world 70% of all animal species are carnivores and their predators and say okay so we get rid of them you know we kill all the fish kill all the whales kill all the birds kill all the dolphins kill all the lions kill all the hyenas and the and the foxes and wolves and all these sorts of things and the Bears and they'll just say no well that's just part of Nature and it's like well yes we're part of nature too we don't exist outside of Nature and also you kill 25 times more sentient animals sentient animals than uh um than you do eating meat by by eating crops to grow one pound of plant-based protein you have to kill 25 times the number of sentient animals than to grow one pound of animal-based protein from from large livestock animals like cows and sheep so uh no you know there's no such thing as a bloodless meal and um you know they may remove them have be one step removed you know from that killing but that doesn't mean there's not killing involved and say well you know it's incidental if you're driving on a road you hear all these stupid scenarios no something died and you're responsible for that death and so you own up for it and you own it and just say yes you know we did and I respect this animal and respect their life and I'm going to give them as as good a life as possible as clean a death as as there can be and um and and respect them and appreciate them as opposed to just you know putting my fingers in my ears and and pretending that this isn't happening because it is you know when you grow a single crop you necessarily have to destroy an entire ecosystem you have to kill every plant and every animal that's in that area and grow one crop you destroy the soil you destroy the the soil's microbiome you kill all the plants you kill all the the weeds that come up you kill all the insects that are trying to eat it in America alone with the spraying of pesticides and insecticides we kill over one quadrillion insects every year that's just in America that's the base of the food chain so how many billions of birds and lizards and other sorts of smaller animals that rely on those bugs and insects for for food and life die out starve to death or don't exist in the first place because their parents couldn't get enough food to then support uh babies and eggs right um you're using those those pesticides insecticides that that hurts and injures 700 billion Birds a year just in America and um or was it billions million yeah uh 7 700 million birds in America and about a tenth of those die so you know around 68 million Birds die every year from these pesticides that we spray on crops um we shoot the deer and the pigs and the moose and the other animals that come in the big Harvest um Harvesters just chew up and rip apart all the little animals that are in the crops and you know all the the bunnies and the squirrels and the mice and the snakes and the even deer they're out there in the corn field just get just chewed up and mowed down and chopped to Pieces um you know in these big combine Harvesters and um you know it's pretty you know it's pretty it's pretty wild it's pretty uh destructive um 55% of borneo's rainforests were bulldozed for Palm crops palm seed oil crops so they killed all the orangutans all the snakes all the birds everything they destroy this entire habitat and they bulldozed these things and there are videos and pictures of these orangutans falling out of these trees they bulldoze these trees orangutans fall out and crash and just shatter themselves break their spine and just suffering and just die slowly over the next few days you know it's just disgusting in you know what they're they're doing um for these these crops and then you the vegans will say well no but you yes you you you destroyed this whole you know virgin rainforest but then they replac it with trees so you know same same no it's not same same that's a monocrop that's not an ecosystem and all the and all those animals are dead now you've killed them and then the animals that try to move in and and uh eat that crop because that's why they're there um they get shot right because they're messing with these people's money so uh no it's it's actually extremely immoral to grow crops it's dreme extremely destructive to grow crops it's immoral you're killing 25 times the number of sentient animals you're destroying the E the ecological base of the food chain and and killing quadrillions tens 50 you know you know dozens of quadrillions of uh insects all around the world and and you are um responsible for losing 27.5 billion tons of top soil every single year it takes 500 years to grow a centimeter of top soil right that is a Vanishing resource you know Screw oil like top soil is what's going to run out next right and um you know and we're just when we're pretending that this isn't the case it's already been calculated that we probably only have about 50 growing Cycles left on planet Earth and we're trying to go more plant-based and speed that up right that's dumb right animals regenerate the land they regenerate the nutrients in the land they make top soil and you can run them on arable land which is 4% of the Earth's surface including water but you can also run them on Range land and Forest land which makes up another 25% of the Earth's surface right you can't grow crops on Range land or Forest land and you don't need to tear down the forest to put animals through it you can just you just run them through and they just eat what they eat right so and it's the animals that replenish the nutrients in the soil actually makes the the land more fertile in the first place you cannot have plant agriculture without animal agriculture you have to have it you have to have those nutrients coming from those animals you can't get away from that and and plant agriculture destroys the planet destroys the um the ecosystem destroys the uh animals so no it's actually evil and disgusting to eat plants and you should uh tell them that that they sicken you and uh you don't want to hear anything from morally bankrupt people that are trying to destroy the planet maybe leave that last part out do what you want hey everyone really happy to announce a new sponsor for the show and for everybody down in Australia Stockman Stakes who are delivering High quality grass-fed and finished pasture raised beef and other meats flash frozen and vacuum sealed to your door something that I've been enjoying a lot of myself recently as well they also have a great range of specialty items such as high fat keto mints and carnivore beef and organs mints with liver kidneys and beefart as well so use code cha today for free order of beef mints or another specialty gift along with your order at Stockman steaks.com and I'll see you over there thanks guys it's a question from uh Thomas or Tomas maybe um 3619 from last week how important is it to eat antibi antibiotic free meat something I need to look more into but from from my understanding they give antibiotics long before they're slaughtered so they should be long out of their system uh by the time that you get them and certainly you're not going to like eat a steak and have that be a week's worth of antibiotics or something silly like that because you give them a shot goes throughout their entire body so you're not going to get that whole shot worth in each steak that's going to be distributed out between two years worth of meat right so how much is actually in there I don't I don't uh I don't know but I'm not too sure it's um it's all that significant I haven't looked closely into it that yet but just working on that principle that like well this is this is a certain amount but it's diluted over a whole cow and they're not doing like here's your antibiotic now here's the slaughter housee it doesn't make any sense it's a waste of money they give that to them at the beginning of the slaughter of the feed lot experience because it's an unnatural environment they're packed in tighter with with other cows they're eating an unhealthy diet so they they're more susceptible to uh infections um and so that's another thing too you're getting just wild grass-fed animals um they don't eat antibiotics right U it's only when they go into feed lots and they're being fed things that they're not designed to eat that they end up needing these s of things but they're given that early on so that they don't get sick and lose weight and die in the feed lot so they can they can get them to Market um so you know realistically I think it's probably well out of their system by the time we get them but um other people say you know seem to have a problem with them I know Dr lustig um you know thinks that there's a problem with them I have a lot of respect for Dr lustig but I'm just not convinced that there's much of it left in the me by the time you get to it but you know that there there are ways to avoid it too um if that's something you're worried about then then certainly by all means uh avoid it um super chat from last week from Irish twins um is carnivore okay for kids my daughter loves sake is it is amazing for for kids it's what we've been eating forever and since humans have been humans we and before uh we've been eating meat and uh pretty much exclusively meet except for areas that weren't able to get it uh and then when the meapa died out you know that that increased uh where where people weren't able to get as much fatty meat and they had to go to um plant an egg animal agriculture to fill in the those gaps that were left by the megap of dying out so uh yes is absolutely uh good for kids it's actually optimal for kids and they're going to improve their health they're not going to get sick as much they're going to grow Better Stronger Faster more welldeveloped have bigger Brains it's really important for kids to be in ketosis and have a lot of fat because the brain is made out of fat it also runs primarily on ketones and you want the ketones because they can cross the blood brain barrier reconstitute into fatty acids and that makes up the physical structures of the brain you know around 70% of the brain is fat and so you need that fat from animal fat and you need to be in ketosis to properly deliver that fat and energy into the brain um since the Agricultural Revolution the average brain size of a of men dropped by 11% and you know before you get two snarky women about men losing their brain women lost 17% of their average brain size so it's um it's not good like we that's a that's a losing equation so if you want your kid to actually develop out and have the brain size and the mental capacity and physical capacity that they're designed for genetically then you want them to be carnivore 100% we are seeing people do this and and you know reverse autoimmune diseases no one thought autoimmune diseases were reversible reversing diabetes no one thought diabetes was reversible all these sorts of things that everyone thought no no no you can't reverse that that's just you're just stuck with it that's just it uh that's it for you wrong okay so this could be one of those things that we're wrong about as well I've seen so many other things just uh"
