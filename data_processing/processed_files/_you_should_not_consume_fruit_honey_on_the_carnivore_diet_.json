        "body": "forever question from Lina thank you very much for the forever question from Lina thank you very much for the Super Chat is fat or protein more important I have trouble sleeping on Carnivore any tips also are fruit and honey still bad even though it's different sugar well well the thing the problem is it's not different sugar it's exactly the same kind of sugar it's it's fructose and sucrose and actually Honey has quite a lot of fructose and so that that's the point I mean the idea is is that it's it is the same sugar it's just that it comes with other things that are beneficial but that's the same thing as as that's saying that spinach has you know these different vitamins and minerals and they are good things and so that offsets the bad things that are in there it doesn't you know it's not it's not um good enough to make up for the the stuff that's that's harmful in it in my opinion um so yeah I would I don't have anything to do with fruit and honey I have a video just called fruit and honey are not carnivore and I swear to go through all that um fruit you know it's you the plant wants something to eat the fruit but it doesn't necessarily want you to eat the fruit it wants an animal that it's co-evolved with to eat the fruit and pass it seeds around but a lot of these fruits and berries co-evolve with birds and most most Fruit and Berry on Earth will kill you and if you get if you're out in the woods and you see these little bulbs and berries and things like that that you don't recognize bad idea to eat them because they will likely kill you and you know that was that was a traditional sort of thing when you're out in the wood you never eat red berries you just don't eat random red berries that you don't see because that that's a warning this is a red like don't eat me I'll kill you sort of thing or to attract birds and things like that so anyway it's um it's not a good idea to uh eat random fruit or berries and even though the plant wants something to eat it it doesn't want you to eat it so still the majority of fruit will kill you the C Bird eats about 150 different types of fruit in the tropics and oh these are tropical fruits so tropical fruits are all great no they're not every single one of those fruits will kill you every single one of those fruits will kill anything EX except the catary bird because if those seeds don't go through the gut of a c bird they don't turn into a plant they don't germinate and so if a Cass bird leaves that area those those plants die out so it has to be very attractive to a Cass bird and very detrimental to anything else trying to eat it and so you know it is not the case that even the fruit that we eat even the sweet fruit don't have any toxins they do and they have a lot more toxins when they're not right because the seeds aren't ready yet the problem is we don't pick these things right if you picked them rip in your own yard you had a avocado tree or something like that it's going to be better than than what it would be if you buy it from the store but if you buy it from the store they pick these things green and the plant has to take out the toxins we've seen this in studies with tomatoes that you pick them green they don't actually detoxify s like they just break down in the fruit into harmless by byproducts right they they retain all of those it's the vine ripened ones that have less toxins in them because the plant is pulling out those toxins but if you pick it early when the seeds aren't ready that has still has all of its defenses intact good luck buying a fruit from the store that has not been picked green right because that's just how they travel I mean some of the some of these apples you you eat an apple today it's an apple that was picked a year ago and it was picked green you know so that's but it's it is the same kind of sugar it's fructose and glucose and that's not what you want you know you you get you have four grams of glucose throughout your entire bloodstream at any given time that's just a level teaspoon glucose one more gram up to five grams that's a toxic dose of glucose in your body and it your body reacts to it as a toxin by trying to detoxify it by raising your insulin trying to get that below four gram and if it maintains above four grams and you have diabetes basically not basically literally then that's when people start dying and getting multi-organ failure and getting their limbs hacked off and kidneys failing and dying right it's because of that one extra gram of glucose so we're throwing in hundreds of extra grams of glucose and fructose and and galactose and all these sorts of things that's that's harming you and your body can compensate for that for a while but not forever and so that's not something that that you want to do and certainly not something that I want to do uh what's more important fat or protein both they're both important you need enough fat you need enough protein so it's not that you want one or the other they are both essential nutrients they're essential amino acids that you have to have and even the so-called non-essential amino acids you do better with more of them like torine and carnitin and um the fats are essential fats there are essential fatty acids that you have to have or you get sick and you die or you don't develop properly your brain doesn't work properly your body doesn't work properly and there are essential fat soluble nutrients that come along with the fat that you have to have or you get sick and you may die and you have all these sorts of other problems that you you could get in in development and uh and Beyond so it's it's not just one or the other it's not they're not just calorie sources that's something that we just need throw out because a lot of these things are being used as Structural Materials they being used as precursor to other chemicals hormones and uh proteins that we make in our body everything that our DNA codes for is a protein right and so that's a stack and chain of amino acids in this in line and then they fold and flip around and then you have a folded up protein molecule that goes around and does work in the cell and in the body that's not being used to uh to to as as a fuel source that's a building block and material so doesn't matter how much energy is released when you burn it because it's not being burned in the first place because we're not combustion engines we're chemical factories and we break bonds to create chemical energy and make ATP and then break those bonds to um uh facilitate other chemical interactions so that's just completely I mean that's like that's like saying like how much does left weigh like you're using the wrong units that makes no sense in this context hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys right and so and um you know what temperature is sideways like no this this just like what's wrong with you this is completely unrelated and so um you don't look at it like that you need fat animal fat you need protein animal protein um because there are things like carnitine uh that uh don't exist in plants and that actually only 70% of people make enough of it so so 30% of people do need carnitine from their diet it is an essential amino acid for 30% of people third of the population right and everyone does better with more of it so you just need enough you eat about one gram of fat to one gram of protein up to two gram of fat to one gram of protein or there abouts and you just see what your body needs again your body only has a limited capacity to absorb fat you just eat as much fat as you as you're able to and you check your stools and if you're getting constipation you're not eating enough if you're getting diarrhea you may be eating too much unless you're confounding it by still eating other things I mean that whenever I say any of these things I am talking about in the context of someone only eating meat and only drinking water nothing else goes in your mouth that you swallow that you swallow that you know is is outside of those two things right so you're taking a sports drink or you're taking a pre-workout or you're taking supplements that have sweeteners or you're taking electrolytes that have sweeteners you're out you know that's not you don't qualify for what I'm talking about I'm talking about only meat only water right if you're doing that and you're getting diarrhea it could be that you're eating more fat than than your body can absorb it's likely it is or you're so constipated that you're getting overflow diarrhea and you're getting watery stools and then every now and then you get this Boulder that comes out and then you're back to the watery stools and that means you need a lot more fat but if you are drinking coffee tea non- sugar sweeteners magnesium supplements metformin other medications those can all cause uh they can all have a laxative effect and so it may to cover that up and so you may have loose stools but you may be taking metformin and magnesium and drinking coffee like well you probably will have loose stools on a carnivore diet you don't have a whole bunch of fiber jamming up the works so if you're only eating meat only drinking water which I recommend to everybody then you keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good make sure your stools are soft and then you just eat your body's demand it will change but the thing is is that you don't need to figure that out your body will figure that out for you if you're only eating what you're supposed to eat your body will be able to tell you and you'll be able to listen to it and so you eat until it stops tasting good that's very key and um because you you'll feel like oh I feel satisfied I feel I could stop that's not when you stop on a carnivore diet that's when you stop on a traditional diet when you can't trust your hormones when you can't trust your signals when you're just like I should stop because if I if I keep going I'm going to get fat you don't do that in the carnivore diet you keep eating until fatty meat stops tasting good because if it still tastes good your body's telling you that it still wants those nutrients and then eventually it but it tastes less good and less good and less good until eventually it doesn't taste good at all and that's when you stop you take a bite and say h didn't really enjoy that stop you just naturally stop that's how animals in the wild naturally stop at least that's what I've sort of come to come to realize sugar is an outlier you can have these uh evolutionary traps they're called where you have something like hummingbird that sees something little red little shaped object and they'll go in oh that's a flower I'm going to go get nectar and um in the midwest they have these these little uh wire electric wire ties that sort of were nearly that sort of shape in color and so the little hummingbirds were go in stick their little beak in to try to get the nectar and theyd hit the live wire and they die right and so they had to change the color of these things because they were just every every time when they were red there's and they just they were just dropping like flies unfortunately so that's an evolutionary trap there's there's signals in them saying hey go get this so food scientists have uh taken advantage of those evolutionary traps in humans to make things highly palatable and to say oh we should get this we should eat this eat more eat more eat more eat more eat more eat more eat more sugar is an evolutionary trap we did not find this in great abundance uh historically but we we you know it seems that fructose is the sweetest of the of the carbohydrates because there aren't any plants that are that are acutely poisonous to humans that are deadly to humans that day that contain fructose but fructose itself with long-term exposure at high levels will cause harm and so you know it taste good we oh that's safe I can get energy and I can survive you know we get that signal but you know we're getting little crab apples maybe a bit of Honey every now and then and we're oh that's amazing okay we should get this but now we've refined it we' put it in everything and so we hit that evolutionary trap and so it just takes oh I want more I want more I want more I want more because we're never going to find it in that abundance in the wild you're just not going to and certainly not every day so that's hitting an evolutionary trap meat is not an evolutionary Trend it does not make you want to do more and more and more until you hurt yourself that's actual normal normal biology and so you eat until it stops tasting good that's how you figure that out so that's what you do you aim for about one to two grams of fat for every one gram of protein you eat that fatty meat until it stops tasting good and two to one fat to protein is about 65% lean ground beef with 35% fat that's what that works out to be so a lot thrown at you but uh it actually is fairly straightforward when you sort of break it down"
