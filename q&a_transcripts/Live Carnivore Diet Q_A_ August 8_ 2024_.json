    "title": "Live Carnivore Diet Q&A! August 8, 2024!",
    "transcript": "all right hello everyone thank you for joining me on another YouTube live here today on uh was it August 8th in America August 9th in Australia 2024 so thank you all very much for joining me I want to give a shout out to a special sponsor of the uh of this episode Chris Brandin who is helping me uh uh get the patents on my on my uh videos and podcasts so he's been very helpful with that he's a lawyer he goes by the carnivore lawyer and uh helps uh people in the carnivore Community with uh uh legal issues and can give um sort of free consultations to people who have a problem that need help uh people can find him at brandolin law so uh www.b n DL i n law.com if people want to check him out there and we also did a you we also did a um a episode together so people can can look that up he he reversed some very very serious health issues by going carnivore so everybody check him out when you can so there's a couple questions that didn't sort of pop up and get starred properly so I'll I'll read them out from helmet uh Popple he did a Super Chat uh and where he said um I'm 5 foot eight 17-year-old male and want to grow taller do you think I can still grow after uh the growth grow plates have closed is the animal-based diet from saladino on which I feel better or carnivore better for me well you know it what's better for you depends on your circumstances and how you feel and and uh and you know logistically what's going on from a health perspective I think that uh full carnivore is best for all of us and especially yourself because you're you're still developing and if you want to develop to the best of your ability uh you want to maximize your nutrition and your metabolism and you want to be in ketosis and you you get advantages from being in ketosis both from your body and your brain developing and from a hormonal point of view as well when people go ketogenic their their hormones improve I see this all the time I see men's testosterone and growth hormone improving dramatically I see women's hormones normalizing and growth hormone improving dramatically as well and if you're talking about growing you know you want all those hormones especially growth hormone to uh to be active and and optimal levels they don't go too high it's not like this is you know just gigantism juice it's just it gives you the right amount for your body and your genetics so as far as growing taller when the growth plates are closed no not really you know you're not going to not even not really just they if the growth plates are closed your bones can't grow and so the tissue around it can grow but the bones won't grow you know so the long bones if those growth plates are closed off that's that's sort of it you know is it is sort of weird you see people sort of in in you know well past when their growth place should have closed they sort of get a bit taller like how the hell did that happen you I don't really know maybe they just had some some you know lingering uh open growth plates but um it's uh yeah it's a bit funny the when you see that but it it really must mean that the growth plates were still active in some way so you're 17 there's there's a high likelihood that your growth plates are still open and if they are then you can still grow and so getting uh optimal nutrition should help with that and so I would I would think that a full carnivore ketogenic carnivore diet would would help you in that and uh and just eat a lot of fatty meat uh exercise and uh stimulate your body to grow in all these different sorts of ways and and you will as long as your growth plates are open and so yeah so those are my two cents on it anyway then a super chat from Ellie thank you very much Ellie says thanks for your last answer about this I've treated I've tried eating way less beef way less beef only uh still get very bad bloated an hour or two later no water for hours before and after is it a digestion issue thank you uh [Music] um well so okay so you're just eating way less beef only and still getting variable an hour or two later it's a bit funny um it could be something going on with your digestion it could be something that you know you have uh you know some people have like sibo and things like that you know small intestinal bacterial overgrow and just sort of whatever you eat is going to cause a bit of a reaction um if there if there are different meats that don't make you feel that and make you um feel better than focus on those if it is some sort of you know overgrowth it could be that you know this is just takes time to resolve bloating is a is a bit funny and um you know because most people don't get that so I wonder if something else is going on from medically and uh so that's something that you should sort of think about maybe look into and investigate with your doctor because you really shouldn't be getting bloated just naturally if you're you're on just eating just eating beef and not eating all that much especially um also you think about if you are eating less um and you're just eating beef is has that helped you know you're still getting very bloated an hour or two later but is it is it any different is it exactly the same then okay well well there's something probably else go something else going on that do not really have anything to do with what you're eating it has to do with just how your body's reacting to food in general and so that might be worth looking into if it is something like sibo there are people you know in the published literature case series and things like that of people that have gone full specifically carnivore and resolved their sibo um very quickly actually you know in a matter of weeks and months so it's something that hopefully will just get better you we don't always know why our bodies react in in the way that it does does but um especially when we're transitioning over but you know a lot of things are going on a lot of things are changing when you switch over to you know a very different way of eating and uh your body takes time to adjust and so you know there's a lot of reasons for that some of them we know some of them we don't know but either way most of them resolve on their own so as long as there's nothing medical going on your body should adapt and adjust fairly readily but it sort of makes me wonder if there's there isn't anything else going on here and so I think that it might be a good idea that you get checked out and maybe see your doctor and see if there's something underlying that that might be causing a problem um you can try playing around with the amount of fat that you're eating um sometimes people get sort of feel like they're getting sort of upset stomach if they're eating a lot more fat but really shouldn't cause bloating that's um that's a very specific thing that uh typically you don't get but you know see how you go I I think it I think it is it would be worth sort of getting a bit of an investigation done and uh other than that um just keep doing what you're doing I mean there's nothing wrong with what you're eating so I don't think that's a cause of anything I think there's probably something underlying going on here and that's that's affecting you uh in this way so hopefully hopefully you guys can figure out what that is and hopefully it just goes away on its own because a lot of a lot of times it does a lot of times you just have these weird transition periods and then your body gets over it and you do fine after that so good luck with that um all right um so we had a couple chats here from Debbie k who says this is my first time with a live chat session well well welcome I've only been carnivore for8 weeks and learning On My Own by watching a lot of carnivore videos I'm ready to watch and learn listen toight welcome Debbie and hope you get a lot out of it uh Mariana sharp that's my mom's name uh is is Mariana not sharp um it says Dr chaffy do you know how to help cidp um which is probably chronic inflammatory uh dementing poly neuropathy um it's not something I treat personally but you know I actually just interviewed uh one of the one of the expert researchers on chronic kidney diseases from UC Santa Barbara uh Dr Thomas wimes and he's saying they're finding more and more that chronic kidney conditions are are reversible with a high-fat meat-based ketogenic diet so is if it's something that your body can heal on its own you know it's definitely worth a shot trying a high-fat ketogenic carnivore diet and seeing how your body body uh recovers actually Dr Baker just uh reported today a pretty you know incredible uh recovery of someone that had a very very very serious um uh kidney disease and um and uh something that uh that's like thought to be completely incurable and this and this lady sort of reversed her issue so it's hard to say you we don't necessarily have um you know you know specific data I don't know if there have been ketogenic studies done on CP there may have been there have been thousands of uh clinical trials done with ketogenic metabolic therapy and various medical issues and could very well have been uh done on cidp as well so what I would do is I would I would look that up I'd go on PubMed or Google Scholar even it's actually a very good resource that people have access to and and then just look up CP you know spell out you can do CP or just spell out the whole thing and and ketogenic diet and and you'll see you'll see if something comes up a lot of times it has I mean literally thousands of studies and clinical trials have been done in humans experimental trials randomized control trials have been done in humans to see hey does this do anything and a lot of times it does and so I would I would check that out I think it's it's very very much worth trying um let me just find this Dr Baker thing um let me see what is [Music] it okay yeah so yeah he said that um someone someone reversed stage three mous nephropathy uh nephrotic syndrome uh where they were spilling out 7,000 Mill per deciliter of protein so hair falling out massive muscle wasting and now they've gain and they gained 45 pounds of water headed towards a kidney transplant went carnivore and one year later doctor was forced to write spontaneous remission of membranous nephropathy on her chart and this disease is considered incurable so stranger things have happened and uh I would definitely give it a try it's not going to hurt you and um and so I can't say that it's going to it's going to reverse this issue because I just I don't have patience that have had that um but you know maybe someone in the comments here has or know someone who has uh experience with this and you know they can share in the comments if anyone has experience with this please do share in the comments I I you know have a vague recollection of some people talking about it how it did help them but I can't say for sure so you know it's I don't want to I don't want to say one way or the other but um you know maybe someone else has as well but it's it's not going to hurt you certainly not going to hurt your kidneys and um you know the idea that you and more kid more protein in the diet has actually been shown to be better for kidney function not worse for kidney function that's that's a myth that needs to die just like the whole cholesterol nonsense and about thousand other things in medicine that we that we teach uh to this day uh but good luck with that I definitely give it a try it's 100% worth worth trying and hopefully it will sort you out and maybe someone else uh can can shed some light on their experiences as well so good luck with that and there's another kidney uh kidney issue question here from Michael pile says uh for a chronic kidney disease stage 3B is a cornivore diet the best to stop it or reverse it would you add anything other than uh beef butter bacon and eggs um for most things uh just red meat and water is the best like a lion diet like just just um beef lamb and water that seems to do better for most people I think I think it depends on what's causing your kidney disease that's that's the really important thing what's causing SE your chronic kidney disease is it um you know the most common is is diabetes or pre-diabetes and just high blood sugar and so any ketogenic carnivore diet is going to dramatically help that because you're going to reverse the diabetes and you're going to reverse the Damage Done by glycation so if that's what's causing your CKD then yeah you know beef butter bacon and eggs is is perfectly fine um most people do the best on just beef lamb and water but what I tell people is you for most people just whatever meat that you enjoy that makes you feel the best and that you can afford and have access to that's what you should be eating and so if that's BB and e or if that's just beef for lamb uh or if that's you know chicken and fish it's just you know that's fine just whatever whatever works best for you and that you can afford and uh and tastes good to you but uh yeah it it but again it depends on what's causing the kidney kidney disease but for for most of them yeah like and again more protein helps kidney function it doesn't hurt kidney function and that's what the the actual studies show and the actual science shows science says this no somebody said that and you called it the science it's like that's science is a process of uh of evaluating the evidence in front of you to see what how the world works and and what's going on so um it's it's people just completely misuse that word but a lot of people are reversing their chronic kidney disease a lot of people and like I said uh Professor wimes you can watch that interview that we did together recently and he he talks all about it and how this is basically the best the best way to to reverse chronic kidney disease is by high fat meat-based ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet and I think a carnivore diet specifically is the best because there are plants that don't have carbs that do have nephrotoxic substances like oxalates so nephrotoxic meaning it damages your kidneys and O oxalates do damage your kidneys and other other chemicals damage your kidneys that exist in Plants As Natural plant defenses and so I would um I would definitely avoid all plants uh when you're dealing with this high fat meat-based ketogenic diet really just carnivore diet that's what I would do uh Caroline Greening says um she has a question after an MRI on November 23rd I was told that I may or may not have had heart attacks or strokes and to take a torvest Statin and citicr whilst they do test to find out can I stop them you know that's going to be something that you have to talk to your doctor about obviously that's uh can't I can't give you know direct medical advice to people over the internet and certainly not someone that I haven't you know gone through very thorough history and and and gone through everything uh with them um because uh you know I I I can't tell you if uh if you need to be on CIT girl or anything like that uh torvis sattin you know I mean that that's that's training a problem that doesn't exist really it's um that's you for for a cholesterol lowering standpoint now there are other actions that aoris has which is like a mild anti-inflammatory similar to clal where it sort of makes your blood less likely to clot but cigr is is a very strong anti-inflammatory and really stops your your playlist from being able to clot um so is that going to be is the torvis going to add much to that you know uh maybe maybe not but from a cholesterol lowering point of view I don't think that that's has any use but and that's what the evidence shows that you actually don't want to lower cholesterol because in the in the only randomized control trials that have ever been done on cholesterol and heart disease when you lower cholesterol more people die of heart attacks and strokes or just nothing no benefit anyway but the larger more better better designs randomized control trials show that people die more of of heart attacks and strokes so terrible idea to uh lower your cholesterol but but um there are other actions that these things have cpal you know that's like taking aspirin as a preventative um you know your doctors are playing odds right now and you're just saying like on the balance of evidence you know this is probably going to help you could hurt you you know you could have a fall and crack your head and be on cpit gril and and have a much more serious bleed as a result of that um so there are risks involved in all these sorts of things but um they do help prevent strokes and heart attacks because they they prevent clotting and so what does that tell you I mean it's not preventing cholesterol cholesterol has nothing to do with clotting really it's not not involved in that in that uh you know coagulation Cascade um so why is it that you know anti-clotting agents anti-platelet agents protect against heart attacks and strokes because they're making clots you know so you have this damage and clotting damage clotting damaging clotting oh cholesterol what does cholesterol have to do with anything so um you know you that's something you're going have to take up with your doctor but as far as the statins are concerned you know you can ask them why am I on a Statin um because you know lowering cholesterol doesn't actually lower heart attack rate just doesn't or stroke rate it just doesn't and in fact it uh is inversely related with uh Strokes in particular and even heart attacks in some studies and the randomized control trials lowering uh lowering uh cholesterol and saturated fat uh more people died of heart attacks and strokes so I think we're treating a problem that doesn't exist there the CPR girl is treating a problem that does exist which is clotting but why are you clotting and uh why are you clotting too much and are you clotting too much that's the question so but that those are all things that you have to really talk about with your doctor I can't tell you to to come off or start a medication uh without uh you know seeing you as a as a patient and actually having a deep conversation about everything that's going on so good luck with that but um you know do talk to your doctor about that hopefully everything's fine and um you know if you haven't had heart attacks and strokes and you don't have a problem otherwise you don't have a burden of plaque and disease then you know you don't necessarily need to be on some things some things can provide some some benefits uh from preventative standpoint but you know that's something that um that sort of risk benefit analysis is something that your doctor can help you go through and decide what to do going forward so good luck with that hopefully it's a just a false alarm and you're okay and everything's fine after this uh Damen Williams thank you very much for the Super Chat uh good evening thank you for all you do thank you I appreciate it uh two super chats here last summer I messaged you about getting hamstring uh strains while sprinting and you gave me some great advice see part two well thank you I'm well I'm glad to to see that that helped it was very good to hear um here's the second part there thank you again um anyone sprinting uh research YouTube for anyone sprinting research YouTube Correct form and full Dynamic warm-up include drills for form strong with Kelly Sprint uh 101 is a great warm-up uh Noah ly channel for drills a skips Miami U your thoughts yeah so I I never had like formal training sprinting um for you know growing up and uh I just you know was one those I just ran hard no one actually taught me how how to sprint I didn't do I did track for a bit but then I ended up U like in seventh grade or something like that but I end ended up dropping it and um and doing other sports but um then when I start was getting into rugby and I was I was playing with people that were you know more more properly trained sprinters and I just I sort of had some natural speed um but I I never had like a a form coach and then I was um playing with a guy named Matt dallow who was uh you know who was a premier uh decathlete in Sprinter in in New Zealand and I was a college you know scholarship athlete in America America and and play at super high levels of of rugby in the US and um and New Zealand and he's actually a two-time Olympian in the New Zealand bob sled which is pretty cool and um but he was he he knew how to sprint and he he uh did all these drills with us so I I did you know some of those with him and he sort of started showing me uh those fundamentals and doing those um those drills that you're describing there and then showing me the right form and I started working on that and oh my god did I get faster it was insane it was it was you know I was already faster than a lot of people but you know when I would make a break and I would just I just be running hard and all of a sudden I'd just be running I'd be sort of like keeping ahead of people and I could I could have just run hard and scored a try but then I was just like okay let let's do the sprinting technique I started doing the Sprint technique and I just started pulling away like nothing it was it was it was really dramatic how much faster that I went and I could see that in real time like I'm just I'm just being chased by someone and all of a sudden I just you know start doing the the actual proper technique and I start pulling away from them like it was just you know uh like it was nothing you know so I think I I think it's uh technique is everything in everything you know like what whatever you do the technique matters so if you're a a sprinter you need the right technique you can run as hard as you can and your body's going to have like you know different sort of forces and you're going to be uh faster or slower by nature but you know if you have the right technique you will be faster than that and if you have the proper technique you're always going to be better um as a as a wrestler you know you have the proper perfect technique this is you know that you're going to be a better wrestler and you have all the fitness and all that other stuff that goes and the sort of mental instincts as well but if you have the right technique as well that's just going to you know take you further and this is why wrestlers drill you know shoot 500 you know double legs on the right right against the wall and then 500 on the left and then 500 single legs and five on the left and then on the right and um you know before practice and then they go in and start training they do that every single day um and this is why I always I always tell you know rugby players um you know that I'm I'm playing with or coaching you want to hit the tackle pads you want to get up and slam into that thing and fly into it um and some people like oh well that just teaches you how to how to hit a tackle pad not to tackle a real person like no idiot it teaches you body position and and teaches you muscle memory on how to go at full speed and fly into something at knee height and take it out and um you know tell that to all the Olympic gold medalists in in uh wrestling and all the people aspiring to be Olympic gold medalists that uh you know just doing a a a all the hundreds and thousands of single legs and double legs against the wall just tell them oh that all all that does is teach you how to do a double leg against a wall how to take down a wall no it doesn't it teaches you how to do that in real life it gets that muscle memory and that body form and technique it's really important that technique um surgeons what do you think surgery is it's it's technique and the better you know surgeon is one that has better technique and uh is able to to get a better result so it's all about technique and uh sprinting is no different and so I saw that firsthand would have been nice to have someone teach me how to sprint properly when I was growing up no one did but um I luckily had had a bit of speed naturally anyway but when I was actually taught how to sprint made a massive difference so I would I would definitely encourage anybody and everybody to who is interested in sprinting to get this proper technique right uh because it just it's night and day difference all right let's see and little Ellie Melly is coming to say hi she says hi guys and hello Ellie Melly nice to see you and where were we at before that um oh there we go there's a qu there's a comment from X from raml kabuna says keep the good work talk well thank you very much I really appreciate that um and the next question is from Atilla H thank you very much for the Super Chat started cornivore and the ground beef taste planand um I feel very sluggish at what point do I start eating uh do I start enjoying the ground beef uh it probably you're eating H too lean the ground beef is probably too lean and you might be cooking it overcooking it and cooking out out all the fat so it's just dry and tasteless you need the fat fat is flavor and if you if you cook it well done you're going to get all the fat out of there it's just going to be hard dry and tasteless so try getting fattier Cuts melting butter into it even going to the Butcher and getting a special like 6040 mix of uh ground beef which is you know about two grams of fat to one gram of protein and you're going to lose a bit of that it's actually more than that but you'll actually lose some of that because you'll cook it out um and so you might get down down to around two to one fat to protein so more fat fat is Flavor if something is Bland and from the beginning if you're hungry and it tastes Bland it's not enough fat and uh um so you know try to get try to get ground beef that's fattier it's usually fattier fattier ground beef is cheaper anyway and so if you're doing ground beef because it's you know it's it's affordable and it is then uh just get the fattier stuff and it's even more affordable which is good and um you can get it specially made you know a lot of butchers will make will make ground beef special they might have to do like a big batch you know sort of do like you know 10 pounds at a time 20 pounds at the time something like that depending on the butcher uh but it's well worth it it's fantastic stuff and you can sort of put it in you know smaller badge or containers maybe freeze some of it if if there's like a lot of it um and um you know and and just go that way but more fat I would say if if if it's bland right away if it's bland if it gets Bland later on it tastes amazing at first and it sort of gets Bland could just be that you're just not all that hungry and uh but it could also be that it's not not all that much fat that your body's happy with the lean for a bit and it's like no no no no this is not going to cut it anymore and so uh typically more fat so try to up the fat add grass-fed butter grass-fed butter is fantastic you know has has amazing DHA EPA and arachadonic acid levels those are the Omega-3s and Omega sixes that we need we don't just need generic Omega-3s and generic Omega sixes we need specific Omega-3s and Omega sixes so you say well oh flax seed and has omega-3s and Omega sixes all no no no no those are the wrong Omega-3s and Omega sixes you don't need General Omega-3s you don't just need an omega-3 Bond you need specific ones like um uh arachadonic acid Pro is the omega-6 that we need we don't need linolic acid that's the plant version we need DHA and EPA for our brain we don't need alal linolic acid which is the uh the kind that we get from Plants you don't need those and you don't want those you want the the animal version so uh get fat um get uh animal fat eat animal fat I'm not telling you to get fat yourself I'm eat animal fat and um and uh you know grass-fed butter is a really good good ratio and and uh mix of the actual fats that you want and the fat soluble vitamins that you need as well so Brian Locker thank you very much for the Super Chat very generous of you it's kind of you thank you um Dr chaffy is eating bone marrow sufficient in terms of getting decent amounts of dietary fat is there a difference between the fat on a steak versus the fat in the bone marrow uh well there is a difference I mean it's it's uh it's your bone marrow is where your your your blood is made and your red and white cells are made U so there's there's sort of different components in there but as far as the Fat's concerned it's very healthy fat it's very good fat and um it's a bit harder to come by you know you have to sort of you know cook it differently you have to have a buzz saw to saw through the long bones but obviously those you can buy those um Rec cut and so it's um you know it's a great it's a great source of fat there are there are some differences but um you know the bone marrow is excellent it's excellent excellent fat and the biggest difference is going to come from what the animal was eating if the animal was eating uh pretty much grass its whole life then it's going to be healthier it's going to have a healthier complement of uh of DHA and EPA and and arachadonic acid it's going to have less linic acid and and the other sort of plant fats and things like that that come from eating a bunch of grains and seeds and things like that so if um you know if you're getting you know so that's the main difference there there is a difference but it's not like it's not like bu marrow is bad or or just the normal steak fat is bad they're both great um but bone marrow is excellent and so if um and it's sufficient if you get enough of it you know sometimes a bone marrow is a bit scanty so there's not that much in there you don't get that much out of it so you need to uh you know be mindful of that and so it's just a again you're trying to aim for one to two grams of fat to one gram of protein that's that 70 to 80% calories from fat that's what you know typically does the best for us and and then you just see how much body needs um you go by your stools so if you're getting dry hard constipated stools You Are by definition not eating enough fat if you are getting uh liquid stools inter mixed with normal hard stools then you're really constipated that's called overflow diarrhea where you're sort of getting pseudo obstructions things are almost blocked up to the point of of getting a complete obstruction and there just liquid is just sort of squirting around the outside of it so you're getting liquid diarrhea and then every now and then you get this hard Rocky Clump that comes out as well so that you really need to eat a lot more fat at that point you might have problems with diarrhea for a while until you start clearing out all those big hard chunks and then it'll start normalizing and getting more solid normal uh stools you have to sort of clear the blockages and and the and the issues before you get there and then you sort of get into that normal nice soft stool range and then you sort of can get more liquid again so it's sort of a U-shaped curve but that's how you tell much fat you're getting and so you just eat as much fat as is right for your body and every body's going to have different demands and you're going to make different amounts of bile because bile is what is used to absorb fat and it's very difficult for your body to absorb fat without bile you can do it but it's very small amounts and it's mostly MCTS medium chain triglycerides so yeah so that's how you do that but uh the fat from bone marrow is an excellent choice just make sure you're getting enough of it um so here was a here was a question from real carnivore said down 280 pounds in three years which is amazing congratulations I everybody just congratulate this this gentleman the in the chat because that's a huge accomplishment 280 pounds in three years is amazing I'm assuming pounds give it's kilos it's even more impressive and needs uh saying needs an abdomino plasty any advice on the recovery process uh good better best best meats and seafood Etc so Domin have you know loose skin and things like that um just doing what you're doing so just eating a lot of fatty meat and uh and eating as much as your body is asking you for having a higher protein in your diet is already well known to improve surgical recoveries you know because your body's made out of protein and collagen you need these things to as building blocks to recover and you need energy it's actually a high energy demand recovering from surgery you know just getting cut open your body is it's a big stress State and your body needs a lot of energy and and uh and TLC to recover from that even if it's you know we we don't feel that it's that big of a deal we're just cutting something off and just having some sutures uh it is it's a big deal to your body and so just doing doing what you're doing so high fat red meat is always going to be the best um if you're doing Seafood just make sure it's it's wild caught and not farmed fish um you know farmed muscles and and shellfish they don't feed that particularly anything special or or abnormal um but farmed fish is fed garbage so I wouldn't eat any of that crap um but yeah just a lot of a lot of good meat um fatty beef and lamb are typically the best but you know any meat is going to be good just make sure you're getting enough of it make sure you're getting enough fat and enough protein and your body will do great and just specifically the most important thing is avoiding all the other things that are going to slow your body's uh your metabolism and your your immune system down a lot of people notice that their immune system is much slower uh when they eat plants and when they they just focus on what we've been eating for millions of years they recover much more quickly from injuries from surgeries from cuts and bruises and scrapes and all these other sorts of things so just just do what you're doing and uh you'll be great good job again congratulations on that toed thank you very much for the Super Chat what would a carnivore diet look like for a female who had their gallbladder removed any special instructions or dietary needs same dietary needs the special instructions would be if you're not absorbing as much fat in one go you could get diarrhea and um that's because your liver is still making bile it's just that it's um it's not being stored in the gobl bladder and when it gets stored in the gallbladder it concentrates sits there and it concentrates and so when you need it it is expressed out and then you absorb all that fat in in one big go and that's because Predators have to do that they have to be able to uh go days or even a week or more without eating may not get a kill in that time and so it needs to catch up for all those meals before and so you're making bile constantly you can't just waste that right so you need you need that just store that that and concentrated it concentrates up to 20 times as much um as as much as it was you know made by your liver uh or more but physiologically in the textbooks it says 20 times but there some people that probably concentrate more than that which is probably people that are more prone to getting um gallstones and B Sledge because that's that's what happens when you have any hyperconcentrated solution at rest it forms precipitate and that's what B and gallstones are and so if you're eating enough fat you cannot by definition ever get a gallstone because there's not gonna be any bile in there to begin with to form a stone or sludge or anything like that I even saw someone who commented the other day on something and they're like you know I went carnivore for you know several months and like I I end up getting Gall you know bile sludge and it's like well you weren't eating enough fat then you know that's by definition you cannot get B sludge or gallstones if you're eating enough fat meaning that you're eating as much fat as your body's making bile for because you won't have any bile in your gallbladder it doesn't it doesn't get produced in the G gallbladder just start getting all sludgy that b is coming from your liver stored in the gallbladder and then if you eat fat just squishes it right out so there's nothing in there to begin with and if you have bile sludge and you start eating enough fat that bile sludge just goes right out and so it's gone it's it's cured overnight so you know that person if they you know if they start eating even less fat they are going to get kidney they're going to get gall stones not a doubt in my mind um it it's the fat that keeps you from getting gall stones it's the avoidance of fat that actually causes gall stones and we're we're teaching people it's the other way around oh you eat too much fat you get gall stones no it's because you didn't eat enough fat that's why you got gall stones but people are overweight and so they think well if you're and because people that are overweight have a higher association with gallstones but not everybody does uh is overweight they get skull stones but there's a higher Association female fertile 40s fat some little fair in there as well white people get it more often um and so but the thing is is that that those are people you think about it is a woman in their 40s probably had a couple kids probably has some extra baby weight wants to lose weight and as we all know if you want to lose fat you stop eating fat so they stop eating fat for a long period of time they start losing weight they feel horrible and miserable it's not sustainable they go back to sort of eating uh you know something that actually has some flavor and nutrition and they go oh it's pain and they go to their doctor and go oh got gallstones that's because you're eating too much fat you know and it's like well no actually they didn't eat any fat or they ate very little fat and that's why they got gallstones I see this in in um surgical Wards you see people that have had um bariatric surgery and lost a lot of weight and and this is known people that get bariatric surgery have a very high risk of getting or high proportion of them going on to get gall stones and I say well there's something that changes metabolically when we lose a lot of weight that brings about gallstones maybe I mean that's never been proven that's just pure supposition but what's more likely is how they lost the weight and these people are very serious about losing weight to the point that they have have gotten surgery on their body which can cause very serious side effects and generally 15 years down the road require further surgeries uh because it causes problems you're screwing with your normal anatomy and they are also they just they're like okay I'm just I'm doing everything right I'm just gonna not eat a single I'm gonna starve forc to starve yourself there's no room to put food in and I'm not gonna eat any fat and I've seen so many people that were just so shocked that they had gallstones because we tell people that gallstones come from eating fat and they were like I can't have gall stones because I have not eaten any fat in months and that's why they got gallstones because they didn't eat enough fat so now that your gallbladder is out what do you do uh you do the exact same thing you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good if that gives you loose stools it may be that you're not going to be able to eat as much fat in one go so you just split you eat the same am out you just have to split it up over the course of the day because your liver is just constantly dripping this stuff out it's not going to store it and then express it but a lot of people form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is just an outpouching of the common bile duct that work exactly like a gallbladder and you get gall stones in it and so it's um it's uh possible that you may not need to do that so just give it a trot you know try eating just fatty meat until it stops tasting good if that gives you diarrhea you know 20 30 minutes after you have uh the meal then just reduce the amount of fat that you have at one time and have the rest of it at another time you still need the same amount per day because your body's making the same amount of bile per day you're just not going to be able to access it in one go so you just need to split that the meal up throughout the day good luck with that uh okay Monica say oh my goodness so nice to actually catch a live thanks for all you do well thank you I'm glad you're able to make it um oh goodness so I think we should we should uh stop the super chats here because um uh I I have to go in the next Shor of 20 30 minutes so probably stop these and already got a lot of them so it's a sort of a shorter shorter session today everyone but uh we'll get through all of these if we can so Marne says struggling with acne mainly in chest back and neck been doing the carnivore dive for 40 days and it seems to help but in the past week it's breaking out uh some nasty cysts mainly on the neck well I'm sorry to hear that uh one thing that more and more people are saying is that you know from acne and skin conditions is uh more fat they're eating more fat and they're actually getting less acne so uh a lot of times acne is is hormonally related as well and so getting enough fat and obviously avoiding all the other things that can disrupt your hormones uh can be can can actually really make a a big significant impact in that um so that's what I would try I would try actually increas ing your fat that you're eating add grass-fed butter to things if you need to need help with that um and give it time I mean this is something that um you know people struggle with for years and sometimes never clear up without horrific medications sometimes that's not even enough uh but a lot of people have been uh curing their cystic acne by going carnivore but just make sure you're eating enough fat in particular and I've I've spoken to a lot of people that when they say that that they started really increasing the fat they were eating that just changed everything in their skin just is is always clear now so uh give that a try and see how you go question from Lively Linus thank you so much for the Super Chat high fat brisket ribs and Tallow gives me bloat and heartburn only recently leaner Chuck and New York strip feel good am I getting enough fat on these well look just go with how your body's feeling it is a bit strange that you you are getting that but you know if that's what you're getting that's what you're getting you know is there anything on the brisket or the ribs are there any seasoning spices maybe too much salt these sorts of things um you know or if you're just making it at home and it's just on your own then obviously that makes it that makes it easier to know but um I would wonder about that and but just go go with the meat that you like that you enjoy that makes you feel the best um and and if that's Chuck and New York strip then that's great the way to find out if you're eating enough fat is if you're having constipation or not if you get constipated then yeah you're you're not eating enough fat and so you should try to add something to that be it uh you know butter or or whatever but something that you can you can do well with anyway so just look for that so if you're getting dry hard constipated stools then by definition you're not eating enough fat and U I would just try adding maybe some grass-fed butter to your Chuck and New York strip and my mouth is like watering just saying that um but uh then um and see how you go hopefully that doesn't cause any of that bloat or heartburn but yeah that's how you tell so Chris thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat I appreciate it uh greetings from Seattle Hello Seattle I grew up in Kirkland um I'm three weeks in a carnivore and recently been having trouble sleeping any tips thank you for all you do yeah that's a good question it's it most people actually do better on their sleep so but then there's some people uh like yourself that that seem to do a bit uh worse and have a bit TR of trouble sleeping try to optimize all of your your sleep routine and hygiene so you know turning off the lights you know when when the Sun goes down just get in low light areas get off the TV get off the screens get off your phone get off the computer you know listen to you know uh something interesting a book on tape or read a book in in low light you know have have personal interactions with people instead of virtual interactions and entertainment uh that can really help getting blue blocking glasses blue light blocking glasses can really help some people just have so much more energy that they're just wired all the time because their body is just just ramped up and doing so much better so that can be something that you just eventually will will uh get used to and your body can can um start sleeping better um then you know people can try you know take you can try resetting your body clock with uh you know melatonin as well that can help uh you know just you know couple milligrams you know 3 milligrams 5 milligrams something like that you don't need much um and that can sort of help but again you take that an hour before you want to be asleep and melatonin only works if the lights are off and that's another thing is that your body makes your own melatonin but if you're on screens you're on phones and your lights on all the time you're not making any melatonin and or the Melatonin you're making is gone so you know you need to be really careful with that um some people do have a problem it eventually does get better some people find that they they just can't s they they they sleep better if they eat some carbs so like if someone this is I think this this is probably the origins of drinking a warm glass of milk before bed to help you go to sleep um maybe something to do with that what's that going to do it's going to sort of raise your blood sugar a bit it's G to raise your insulin a bit which is then going to drop your blood sugar give you something called reactive hypoglycemia it's also going to suppress your body's Ketone production and you're just not going to have as much energy in your brain and you're going to be drowsy and tired and go to sleep so you could try that um I wouldn't I personally would try to to go without that and just try all the other things first and foremost and see about you know and wear a sleep mask you know just zero light you need to be in a black cave you know just just pitch black and um you know that that can really help uh Your Sleep Quality and getting to sleep as well but also when you put that sleep mask on it's just a switch in your brain it's just like yep sleep it's time for Sleep we're going to sleep now I I just I don't go anywhere without my sleep mask now I absolutely love that thing and um so that's something I would try as well but if all else fails you can you can try the glass of milk I wouldn't I wouldn't eat like you know bread or other you know plant-based carbs if you're going to do anything I would go milk but I think it's I think it's like relying on on uh sleeping pills you know like it it helps in the in in the short term but then you have an addiction and you're relyant on it and it causes other problems and now you can't get off of it and so I think um that it's best to stay away from that most people when they have this it's it's initially like you're saying you're in it for three weeks you know this tends to go away and people have way better sleep long term it's just your body's sort of getting used to a new system and a new metabolism so that's what I would do I would I would just sort of focus on all the other things to try to improve your sleep and um and not uh and not have to rely on on uh carbs you know because then you then you sort of have to do it every time um melatonin is isn't you know is nice because it's not like a sleeping drug that you get reliant on and you get addicted to or anything like that um it's just something that can just it's just a part of your natural hormonal system and it just sort of you know helps you you jump start the process but you can come off of it very easily and not be reliant on it um so something to think about but uh those are some ideas anyway but typically it does go away eventually just try to do all the other things that are more conducive to a good night's sleep and that that would be better for you anyway sleep mask big big positive sjck thank you very much for the Super Chat what's up doc quick question what's Health your of KFC chicken and vegetables well it depends because you know the KFC chicken is like deep fried in uh seed oils typically and so you know you're getting good nutrition out of the chicken side of things but you're getting a lot of seed oils and and uh you know the the breading and all that stuff is not great you get the roast chicken at KFC oh that's much better and that's that's definitely the clear winter um between seed oil fried chicken and vegetables I guess it depends on the vegetables um some were better than others some were worse than others how they were prepared were they cooked were they this were they that it to lower the toxic load um as far as which one's more toxic there are some toxic vegetables out there but you know the seed oil fried uh carbs and things like that probably worse um and especially if the vegetables are are cooked to Oblivion and just like boil the hell out of them probably going to have a lot less toxins in them they're not going to have any nutrients they're not going to be nutritious so not really all going to be all that healthy they're just going to be not as toxic but the chicken itself is healthy and is good for you and has good nutrients so it's a bit of a tough question because it's sort of comparing apples and oranges you know the vegetables don't have many nutrients and depending on how you cook them and what vegetable you can reduce the toxins but they could have a lot of toxins or could have lower amounts of toxins fried seed oils is toxic totally bad horribly bad for you and you know the breading and things like that as well but the chicken itself is good for you so you know it's a bit of a of a mixed picture I would say um don't do either or just do the roast chicken and KFC that's a probably the best way to go but I mean you can't just live on vegetables like you don't get all the nutrients you need you just don't and so you you need the chicken and so if if you had the choice of only eating vegetables or only eating you know Kentucky Fried Chicken like you probably have to go with the chicken because that's the only thing that actually has basic essential nutrients that you have to have for life so but it's not great because of the seed oils so go with roast chicken instead uh Jennifer Lucas thank you very much for the Super Chat my cholesterol has gone from over 350 to 133 on Carnivore is that too low it's it's so funny you know it's um people's cholesterol you know changes wildly I I just don't I just don't even check it anymore because it's just it's just a worthless study it's not worthless but it's worth very little and it's is not indic indicative of of heart disease it was never the cause of heart disease it will never be the cause of heart disease even though they shift the goal poost every every week they go from total cholesterol oh then it's oh actually LDL and good and bad cholesterol then oh actually there's a hundred different kinds of LDL and some are good LDL and some are bad LDL and oh actually that's wrong too and you know and that's sort of like a bit more complex oh now it's Appo and now it's this and it's that it's just like they just shifting the gold poost it was never cholesterol cholesterol has never been proven to be the cause of heart disease never the only randomized control trials have ever been done in history that could show a cause and effect relationship between cholesterol and heart disease showed the opposite they showed that more people die of heart attacks and strokes when you lowered cholesterol and saturated fat so um to your question uh is is that cholesterol too low if that's what your body's doing and you're eating a physiological diet and your body and and you're just eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you're exercising and doing all these other sorts of things and that's where your cholesterol is and that's where your cholesterol is supposed to be I I just I trust your body a hell of a lot more than I trust any any you Professor with a research Grant from a you know big food company and uh and a and and and you know Financial ties and God knows what else um any day of the week so if you're eating what you're supposed to eat your body's going to do what it's supposed to do a lot of people when they have higher BMI so they're you know have more you know atop posties and more uh you know excess fat on their body they tend to have lower cholesterol and lower LDL cholesterol which is interesting as you get thinner more metabolically healthy that cholesterol starts to go up actually both HDL and LDL start going up and so total cholesterol goes up but triglycerides go down which is very important because high triglycerides is a problem you can actually get pancreatitis from high high triglycerides and so and it's also much more strongly associated with uh metabolic disease and cardiovascular disease as well so higher total cholesterol and higher LDL cholesterol is associated with longer and lower all cause mortality lower rates of uh of U you know well um lower rates of death from cancer and lower rates of death from infectious disease and things like that so and lower rates of cancer in general I believe yeah pretty sure and uh but certainly from from cancer mortality rates and so you don't need to micromanage it though you don't need to do something to manipulate your body into getting more cholesterol if you're eating ay genenic carnivore diet usually just fasting and not eating anything for a period of days will see your cholesterol go up because that's what your body wants to do you want more HDL you want more LDL and you want lower triglycerides and that's what happens when you fast and that's also what happens when you go on a ketogenic carnivore die which is called a fasting metabolism it's not it's not even being called that anymore it's actually switch to a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate metabolism which is much more accurate and um so I wouldn't worry too much about it if you're eating a ketogenic carnivore diet with plenty of fat and you are lifting weights and sprinting if you can and not doing chronic cardio and you're you know have low stress and getting good sleep I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about the numbers um if you're not doing all those things do those things and um and still don't worry about those numbers okay good luck uh Super Chat from EA I'm assuming that's ear uh thank you very much for that I'm a 43y old I'm a male 43 and 45 days on Carnivore lost 16 pounds that's fantastic great job I have phemia minor blood condition hasn't bothered me much can carnivore help or hinder this it's not going to hurt it I have a few patients with uh various phias are different kinds but they uh they don't get worse and I have seen uh some of their anemia improved slightly but it's still sort of early days sort of first three to six months that they've been on it I'm definitely seeing a lot of people with anemia of other descriptions uh resolve that quite quickly and even even people with with um um other sorts of blood dis czas where they have just sort of overall lower uh levels when okay is it a bone marrow failure or something like that and then you sort of you put them on a Caron for diet and then it sorts them out and then maybe you check their B12 and they're like oh it's in the normal range but actually that normal range is not a not a good range it's just the average for the community and that's what all reference ranges are they're just the average for for that patient samp of the patient sample that goes into that lab so every single lab in every single country in every single town and every single area will have different reference ranges and that's because it's just an average and but we look at that as if that's the optimal range we want this to be the optimal because we're looking at say oh you want to be in that range because that range is optimal but that's not even what that's that's not even what they're advertised as they're advertised as the average you don't want to be average the average person is sick and malnourished and typically overweight and metabolically sick so you don't want to be that so a lot of people they say okay well look B12 is oh it's right in in our range and like yeah that range is dumb that's a dumb range and so then you correct their B12 because sometimes have especially as we get older it's it's uh you need much more nutrient-dense food because you just don't absorb things as well and and there can be other reasons why you're not absorbing uh B12 in particular but either way you correct the B12 and all of a sudden all their blood levels come up look at that well you need B12 for DNA synthesis and so all these all these uh cell lines in your body all these tissues that have high turnover require a lot of B12 and when you get so are slightly lower than you than you you want you're going to get you're going to get damaged in your hair skin nails and blood and also the myelination of your axons and your nerves so you're G to get nerve damage as well so yeah um it can definitely help you you have a genetic condition like phemia it may just keep you optimal for your genetics but it's certainly not going to make you worse and hopefully it will will help in a number of ways not least of which being B12 and uh but do check your B12 make sure that's in a good good range so you want in America you want to be between 1100 and 1,600 PS per milliliters pgml in most of the rest of the world it's pea moles per liter so PM o/ L and uh for pamol per liter you want to be between 800 and 1,200 and Below 400 you can get nerve damage and and uh you going to start getting anemic as well uh under four sorry 540 for the American numbers you can start getting problems and demalation as well so that's not what you want so uh good luck with that and um you know it's it's definitely not going to hurt you anyway and it could help hopefully it does joosie dark blade thank you very much for the Super Chat uh let's see here chronic sinus inflammation with Poopsy cils at 106 originally after one year carnivore it's at 71 still elevated other inflam inflammatory markers are normal have you seen people fix this as the line diet needed well you can you can you can still have other problems that that that are separate from your diet and your diet can exacerbate them or mitigate them depending on what you're eating and what you're doing right now is clearly mitigating this problem so it may be that it's not 100% to do with diet that there are other things going on that you have other allergies and exposures in your house in your environment that are making your your blood numbers go uh be a bit elevated but you I mean I I would go really Mo mostly by your uh symptoms you know you're still having chronic inflammation in your sinuses pops these sorts of things um you know then uh then something's still going on obviously uh if if they're resolving I wouldn't worry too much about your numbers as long as you're symptomatically better and and and objectively better like the pops are sort of res resolving and your chronic sintis is is resolving as well um but you know it's already going in the right direction so you know you can try going on you know Pure Line diet and see if that helps further but some of these things just take a long time and so if it if it is something that's that's uh going to be resolved with diet then yeah try line see how that goes give it time it's already going in the right direction if you sort of go and it just sort of levels off well then you know there's obviously something else in your environment that is is influencing this and it could be something in your house you have dust and mold and you know all that sort of stuff in your house that's uh kicking these things off so just be mindful of that as well it's not always just 100% diet there there are other things in this world that can cause uh issues in our body there other things in our body that can cause issues with our body and so just be mindful of that but it's already going in the right direction which is great and just keep try to keep track of it and keep keep watch and see if that keeps getting better line dot is always the the Baseline that you can you can go to to to make sure it's like okay am I doing the best I possibly can and uh you know that's um that's what you want to try so try that and see if that makes a further Improvement and just keep track you know every couple months you know check your numbers and uh and also go by your symptoms as well and see how you're doing hopefully it resolves it keep an eye out for other things in your environment could be triggering things as well and good luck with that I hope it does well um okay so uh Michael McDermot thank you very much for the Super Chat I've had ibsc for many years diagnosis was idiopathic that just means we have no idea um I mean look at the first part of that word is is idiot you know so we're dumb and we don't know what the hell is causing it four months carnivore and it has not resolved even with eating more fat prescribed uh Linds uh good news down 30 pounds and off my BP meds um uh any suggestions and thank you prescribe lindies I I don't know exactly what that is um let me see what that is real quick let's see prescription medication for constipation in adults weird um treatment for adults and children with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation uh chronic idopathic ideologies okay so if you're getting constipation um even when you're eating more fat you need even more fat like it's it's just by definition it's it's it's quite remarkable how much more fat that we actually need and it's it's very strange for all of us because we've all been told don't eat fat never eat fat Fat's horrible that's gonna make you fat it's gonna kill you you're gonna die oh my God it's complete UT nonsense uh it's actually just a Flatout lie and um and there's it's verifiable lie and that's in in the it's a matter of historical record now that's published in in news articles and scientific journals and um of their own memos saying it's a lie so you need more fat and that's that's sort of the long and short of it if you are ever getting constipation as in dry hard constipated stools you need more fat if you're getting in intermixed hard stools with diarrhea you really need more fat because you're getting overflow diarrhea and so you know just really bump up the fat it's just it's so much more fat than we than we've ever eaten before and I've talked to people and they're like I'm just so constipated and it's just like you need to eat more fat then they're like no I'm definitely eating enough fat that's not it no you're definitely not eating enough fat that's the only thing it can be um Dairy can be constipa as well it can add to it but if you have enough fat it's still it you won't get constipated even with dairy um so if you're getting constipated dry hard constipated so you just have to increase the fat um you can try avoiding Dairy too because that can add to that but if you have enough fat you will only absorb a C amount of fat the excess fat will go out into your stools and that's what keeps your stools soft and so if you're absorbing all the fat that you that you're eating then none of that's getting out and none of that's getting into the stool and so it can't keep it soft so you get hard it's a hard you get a hard stool and so that's what's happening and so if you're having hard sool it means there's not enough fat in it you're not eating enough fat so there's no spill over or not enough spill over and there you go so if you eat more fat eventually you eat enough fat you're going to get diarrhea and you're going to just blow out diarrhea you know you're G to have the other problem the opposite problem so stop before that so you you you know you keep going until you say okay not that much just a little bit back from that uh but it's it's always more fat is the answer any time you get constipated you need more fat 100% of the time uh that's what you need there can be other things that contribute to that but if you have enough fat you will have soft stools period so um just remember that you just need a lot more fat than than you think you do and it takes a while to adjust to that and it's it's a bit weird and we get freaked out by it but you know that is the case that we just need more fat uh than we think we do so good luck with that and you're down 30 pounds and off your blood pressure medications which is amazing that's absolutely fantastic I'm really glad to hear that keep it up eat more fat you'll do great my sister Roslin asking where the cat is he was here with me um but then he started getting antsy and I so I had to open the door for him and now he's he's out napping on uh on the bed so uh yeah I wanted him here too but he did not want to be so we had to we had to respect his feelings and his body unfortunately because he's cute and I like keeping him around uh Nikki Tessier thank you very much for the Super Chat four-year-old non-verbal autistic child has has never eaten any type of meter eggs in any way shape or form only carbs I've tried it all what can we do yeah that's very difficult it's well you know a a big big part of this is is trying to be ketogenic and that can help in a number of ways one of the most important ways is it gets ketones up to the brain which is your brain's optimal primary fuel source and I have a suspicion and hypothesis that children adults with autism really do require ketones for their brain far more than other people and I think that's going to be something that's a major you know a major factor in this because we see kids who are non-verbal autistics who then go off carbs and all of a sudden they start speaking and uh and when they whenever they eat carbs and go out of ketosis they're non-verbal until they're back into deep ketosis so I think that that's going to be you know a major thing I mean after months you're going to get better and better mitochondria which Mak the brain work better which Mak the neurons work better and make them uh develop better um which which is going to be a very very big factor in uh in their future development as well but being in but then they they eat carbohydrates and they're out of ketosis brains aren't running on ketones and they they do much worse so I think I think they're we're going to find that kids with autism are are much it's much more important for them to have ketones available to their brain one thing is you can give them exogenous ketones see how that goes sometimes they have they're all going to have like artificial sweeteners and things like that because they taste pretty vile without uh those sweeteners but it might be might be an interesting experiment to see about you know getting them just some of these ketones exogenous ketones have them drink it and sort of like a you know sometimes they have like a fruit punch flavor or something like that and yes they will have a reol which I don't think is good but it might be worth it as an experiment to see like what happens when he gets more ketones in his body and and see how you go um so the biggest thing is getting getting away from carbs getting away from sugar um you can do this quickly you can do it slowly you can just sort of start start weaning off things oh hey sorry kiddo we don't have that right now we don't have your favorite thing but we have this other thing and you when we go to the store you know we'll get that you know next time and just don't do it you know or you can sort of wean this off and just a little bit extra a little bit a little bit more um you know if um it's it's really difficult you know because you don't want to like I mean you need feed your kid you know but um a period of fasting will put them into ketosis but you got to be really careful with that when you're talking about kids because like you know you don't you don't want to starve your kid right but if you get them into a period of ketosis they're going to start you know getting more ketones and it's going to get their brain more active and they're going to be more responsive and uh you're going to be able to talk to them more and talk to them about things more um you can try sort of mixing things in maybe making eggs and meat in in ways that they you could slip in you know maybe like I don't know you know Peno pork panko you know with the crushed up pork rinds you can buy them um crushed up already that um uh and bread over you know chicken fingers fish sticks things like that or some sort of breaded meat you know see if they can get get them to do that with some sort of you know bacon mayonnaise so it's not seed oils and things like that which are just toxic for little brains and big brains and um see if they'll eat that stuff you know if it looks like there's crunchy carbs on the outside it's actually pork rinds uh see if they'll eat that and some sauce mayonnaise bacon mayonnaise on that you know uh maybe he'll be able to do that um and then and then get start weaning out the carbohydrates you could TR exogenous ketones see if that that does something but it might take you know some days and days before things build up and you know months and months for the mitochondria to start recovering the neurons to start forming differently and and running more capably but that's what I would try um it's very difficult it's uh obviously it's it'd be a lot nicer if you could just start at the beginning and just never have given him that stuff in the first place but we are where we are and uh so those are some of the things that that you can try and um you know try dressing up the eggs in ways that that he'll eat or the eggs and meat in ways that he might eat um bacon Mayo it's really easy you just take some some bacon grease that's just just barely melted you add so a cup one cup of uh bacon grease with one egg put it in there bit of salt if you want maybe a bit of lime juice or vinegar or something like that you don't have to um stick blender got a whole jar of May it'll last you you know a week or two um very easy very quick and easy tastes amazing and you can do that with butter you know melt a bit of butter do the same thing um and then you know grass-fed butter all good things so uh that's what I will try and hopefully you can find something that he likes and you can sort of wean out all the other things get him ketogenic that's the big one getting them ketogenic and getting meat in there because there are certainly a proportion of people that have autism because their neurons don't develop properly because they have a lack of carnitine because we say oh you don't need carnitine you make carnitine only 70% of people make enough carnitine fully onethird of the planet does not make enough carnitine they have to get it from their food and they're not uh because we're eating less and less meat and so if you're not getting any meat and you're not getting any carnitine from your food you're in trouble um you know raw milk you know at Le at least there's something in there there's animal nutrients whole whole raw milk things like that I mean it's not ketogenic you know but if you're not ketogenic anyway maybe you getting some nutrients but I mean there is carnitine and milk but it's not all that much like you need like red meat is the best form of of carnitine and and really being ketogenic is the key because not all forms of autism are from a carnitine deficiency um but it does seem that there's uh a lot of them is just from mitochondrial dysfunction and low carnitine causes mitochondrial dysfunction but also carbohydrates cause mitochondrial dysfunction and fructose specifically causes mitochondrial dysfunction High insulin causes mitochondrial dysfunction and so all of these things work together to be bad news for someone who is is much more um sensitive to these things and needs uh you know needs help and that manifest as as autism unfortunately uh so those are some things that you can try sometimes it takes a bit of tough love to sort of move things in the right direction he's four you know he'll he'll you know forgive a lot at four and so um you know it's tough though it's very very tough and so I I definitely feel for your situation um but you know just do the best you can really try to get him ketogenic and and start introducing things in ways that he can eat them um I've actually seen people they were very very finicky autistic kids were very finicky about eating U meat and and things like that um and uh apparently carnivore bars they actually liked you say say hey it's this a a meal bar you want this bar I like oh yeah sure they think of that as a bar of like some some candy bar granola bar something like that they're like oh yeah I like those things they associate that with something they like they eat the carnival bar and they like it and so I have seen that too so you maybe try something something like that you know some some uh you know meat that's that's doesn't look like meat doesn't taste or feel or or have the tactile uh Sensation that you get in meat but has meat and a lot of fat and good healthy fat for the brain because the brain is made out of animal fat DHA EPA ketones cholesterol they the brain has to have that especially as a four-year-old um so good luck with that hopefully hopefully you can find something that uh that works for for you guys and let me know how that goes plant sparing carnivore thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy your thoughts on naysayers copper deficiency theory on a carnivore diet is it as bad as marola's Calcium deficiency theory on a carnivore diet thank you for all you do I haven't actually heard the co copper deficiency Theory a lot of all sort of nonsense well look I've been doing this for seven years I don't have any copper deficiencies then you would have been doing it for Millennia they don't have any copper deficiencies humans have been doing this for millions of years without copper deficiencies in fact if you eat a lot of beef liver you can get copper toxicity so if you worried about your copper and or you have load copper have some more liver beef liver in particular has a has a lot of copper in it or or you usually does anyway um but you know you can always test copper and if you're low on copper which you don't need much of because it's copper um then uh you know eat some more more beef liver you'll be fine and it could just very well be that you don't have any sort of copper deficiency at all calcium deficiencies I mean come on you know like you know like 70% of the animals are carnivores they eat meat they don't chew up a bunch of bones but where do those bones come from you know where did the calcium in those bones come from because a lot of times they're eating animals that ate other animals they ate other animals it's like they ate some grass how much calcium is in Grass you know well it's enough to make bones in cows and the meat in in and milk in cows and there's enough uh calcium in the meat uh of animals big animals eating grass to make the bones in lions that then make milk for their babies to grow bones but then they're weaned as as infants onto meat and then they eat meat the rest of their lives and that's when most of the long bone uh growth happens is when they're just eating meat so of course there's there's there's calcium in meat your body just works differently when you're eating different things you don't have all the oxalates and Fates and all these other sorts of things that block out and disrupt your absorption of calcium so you need less calcium and you're also not screwing up your metabolism and you're not screwing up how your body your osteoclast and osteoblast work in your bones and so your body just gets on with it as you I mean we've been eating meat forever of course there's going to be everything you need in the proportion that you need it um as long as you're eating healthy meat and a bit of organs every now and then you know that's uh but not out of proportion you don't need you don't need more organs than the animal had like if you have a take down a buffalo that's enough meat to feed you the individual for two years or more it's got one liver it's got two kidneys one heart right so eat that in proportion you don't need all that much of it now if you're eating grain finished factory farm stuff they're not eating what they're supposed to eat they're going to be less nutritious liver is probably a good idea if you're not not getting everything you need because it's but most people do perfectly fine with just Safeway grain finish beef and they're certainly doing a lot better than they did you you see there because it's much more nutrient dense and so they improve but if you want to get optimal perfect best you can be throw in some organs uh or get just grass-fed and finished everything like that so that's what you do copper deficiency where's the evidence for that that's what I'd like to know uh where where is the evidence showing that people on Carnivore have rampant uh copper deficiencies or calcium deficiencies where where is that where where's where's the publication showing that we tested 10,000 people on a carnivore diet for over five years and they all had you know 98% had copper deficiency or 60% had copper deficiency or whatever I haven't seen that study haven't heard of it being done and trust me you'd hear about it because there's so many people talking trash about the cornor diet now that anything that came out it would just be plastered over every vegan Channel and every you know mainstream oh my God look at this they're all deficient no we're not um and neither the Inu or the Messiah or anybody else like that so uh yeah those are my thoughts uh Brad Alexander thank you for the Super Chat I'm not seeing a question but um maybe there's one somewhere down the road but thank you very much Brett uh herd bull thank you for the Super Chat hello sir what about wild game if added if fat is added wild caught fish thank you very much uh from Morgan yeah oh I mean wild CAU is absolutely the way to go if you can um it can have lower fat but it typically has good subcutaneous fat and visceral fat they'll have like know mentum and the me mean cherry and they'll have a lot of fat in and around the organs as well you just need to harvest that and you need to take advantage of that as well uh the me which is the the the blood vessels that supply the intestines those are very very very rich in fat they're just completely covered in fat and the momentum is almost entirely fat and there's a lot of fat around the the organs and kidneys and all that sort of stuff as well so um you know just just make sure you take advantage of of the that those parts of the animal you look at Native Americans when they would go hunting uh this is something I learned as a kid you know that they would um skin the animal dress the animal take the parts that they wanted and they cut off the hind quarters and they hang those up as like an offering and a thank you to the spirits and the you know and nature and the animal and they would leave that as an offering um and so you know that's that's very good but also you got to you got to think about this from a practical point of view this is one person or maybe a couple people that took down like a you know 600 pound Stag and uh they got to carry that thing back and it may be you know 20 miles that they're going on foot because they didn't have horses until Europeans came to um to North America and so or any draft animals or anything like that so well they probably could have domesticated the Buffalo they didn't um that would been that would have been kind of interesting riding around on on bison things like that um but um uh they they cut off the high quarter so now they now they just the four quarters and and you know some of the choicer organs that they're that they're Trucking back um so they're lighting the load they're just going for the fattier cuts the hind quarters are typically the leanest and and they would leave them and that's typically what they would do uh so you know oh they use every scrap of the animal well except for the Hine quarters because there wasn't wasn't all that much fat in it um but yeah they would typically use almost everything and and so do we we use everything I mean because that those materials and cost money so they're valuable so we use everything as well um wild caught fish are great um you know if you add grass-fed butter to that even better and um you know just try to get as much of the fat of the wild game Wild game you just got to think about parasites and so uh because they're going to have much more parasites in them so I wouldn't really eat them medium rare you want them more well done and um that uh you know just just to kill the parasites you want to heat them enough that kills parasites and that's pretty much it but yeah Wild game very very healthy stuff because they're eating what they're supposed to eat and so they're going to have you know really really good supply of nutrients so yeah that's a very good good option Jules Anderson thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat it's very kind of you uh hi Dr C 58-year old female longtime carnivore only Aussie lamb be from water uh no issues but swollen big toe joint comes and goes in the past three months does eat fatty meat include the juices produced during cooking I pour the lot over my steak can eat it is that okay yeah that's that's fantastic um you know that's uh those juices are great you know I mean that's a lot of myoglobin a lot of iron and and other other uh vitamins in fact the juices from the roast um is are are uh really good first food for babies when you're sort of just like a spoonful of that and you sort of well that's really good they want more of that because there's all really really good nutrients in there a lot of good iron and and other sorts of things as well and just getting them a taste for for real food and they they really like that you see that so that's um that was traditionally what you would give a baby with their first food their first taste of Real Food uh would be um the juice from the roast that's what my my great-grandfather said who was I think still to date the youngest ever graduate from Columbia Medical School he was 20 years old that was back in the late 1800s um 1890s um and he had the 13th medical license that California ever gave out that's what he uh that's what he did and that's what he told my mom was the best thing to do for for babies for new babies you give them the juice from the roast and so yeah so you can definitely definitely do that for you that's all it's all very good for you um swollen big toe comes and goes after three months you know the thing is is that uh that can come for for a lot of different reasons you know the first thing you sort of think about is a gout well just remember there's five different causes of gout four are now called pseudo gout one is uric acid one is oxalates and there are three others on top of all that so there are other sorts of things so you know you have a bit of oxalate dumping can that cause gout yeah the only way to tell what the cause is is by sticking a big old needle in that little inflamed joint no one ever does that because it's very painful so they just go look we're just going to assume it's uric acid and uh and give you cultes scene may or may not be uh probably not in this case but um otherwise if it's if it's not causing you too much of a problem I wouldn't worry about it if it is something like that it typically just goes away eventually and and doesn't come back if youve hurt yourself there's other some other things going on then you know uh you know see a doctor and and try to sort that out but hopefully it's not causing you too much too much of a problem um but you know the treatment for gout in the 1800s was red meat and water diet nothing else so you're doing you're doing right and so you're doing a great job and yeah eat the you know pour the juices on and and enjoy it those are great Steve large thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr C I'm looking for a butcher shop I live in Seattle seac area um I know you're familiar with that area any recommendations not in CAC unfortunately um you know the local butcher we go to uh is is is by my parents house and they live out in the sticks now so I don't know of any butchers in seac unfortunately Who would know um that's a good question unfortunately I don't I don't have any good recommendations unfortunately um you know if you go out to North Bend you know there's there's a great butcher there on Main Street Northbend uh they do fantastic stuff they you know Source a lot of things from you know grass-fed and finished places they're really helpful and you know work with you about you know if you want extra fat trimmings and chicken skins and all that sort of stuff they're very very uh willing and able to to help out with that but um unfortunately I don't know anybody in CAC uh but you know if you shop around you know you just go to people and and most butchers if if it's like a local butcher you know it's hey it's nice to support local businesses and B if you you go to them they they can they can generally special order things so you say hey I'm really looking for just you know grass-fed finished beef and I want to get a side of beef or a quarter cow or this or that you know can you help me they can usually Source these things uh very easily and so I would I would try to uh just sort of you know just Google around in your area and just and just shop around and see and see who's around and see what what they can do for you and get some you know gr you know grass finished beef fat trimmings and and you know take those home and fry those up things like that and good luck with that hopefully you find somebody local that uh that can help you sorry I don't know anybody off hand I if I if something comes up I'll try to uh relay that and maybe someone in the group is in that area that's always a good one uh people in the group if you can uh if you live in the area maybe give some suggestions on on uh um butchers as well uh Mrs C thank you very much for the Super Chat 42 years old just had labs done one month into carnivore free T3 is 2.2 free T4 uh 1.26 TSH 2.6 any thoughts on why T3 is low uh have never happened before um couple thoughts one use this as a baseline because you you know unless you took your your Labs directly before you started Carnival you don't know exactly where you were up and down before this so just use this as a baseline check it again in a few months most important thing is how you feel you can you can do uh another actual test which is you test your uh um your um temperature and your pulse first thing in the morning first thing you do right when you wake up stick a therometer in your mouth and check your pulse you do that three mornings in a row and if you are sort of you know low uh sort of brat cardic sort of you know below sort of 55 50 uh beats per minute and your temperature sort of below 35.5 celsius um that can that is a is can sometimes a better indicator of hypothyroidism than even blood tests so you do that three days in a row and you take a look and if you're sort of normal on all fronts probably not much to worry about and if you're low then yeah okay look maybe there's something going on but again use this as a baseline see how you go several months from now um Professor Steve finny who's been studying ketogenic diets and Metabolism for decades um he often talks about this how physiologically we just don't need as much uh thyroid hormone when we are in ketosis and we just do a lot better and our metabolism works better because it's more efficient and effective and um so so that could be part of it as well also it really matters how you take these tests you have to take it first thing in the morning right when you uh basically at between 8 and 9:00 a.m. fasting from the night before 900 p.m only water after that only water in the morning no coffee tea cigarettes heroin anything like that no supplements medications just water at least two glasses of water no more than four glasses of water so the same hydration status as well an hour or two before you get your blood test done and you need to be very sedate relaxed and calm certainly the morning of but for 2 days before so 48 hours before no exercise stress or sexual activity for 48 hours before your blood test right it actually makes a difference and be very calm don't get all stressed out on the way to work or on the way I'm sorry on the way to the uh blood test and uh and don't take any B vitamins for three days before because they can or anything that contains biotin which is a B vitamin so avoid bi for 3 days before so any any multi B vitamins or multivitamins just stop taking that for three days before look on any supplements you take anything that says biotin just don't take it for three days because that can disrupt your hormonal panel and and other sorts of things as well so all of these things matter and then you you take it that way and uh once you if you do that in that consistent pattern you'll get more consistent and reliable results so I would do that I would use this as a as a benchmark and and see where you go from there your TS H isn't isn't horrible but getting that below two is is where you want to go and I would expect that it would and also why is your thyroid a bit off is it because you have Hashimoto is it because you have some something else have you been tested for Hashimoto most people don't test for hashimotos until your TSH goes above 10 but that that's when it's a disaster as opposed to when it's early stages and you can do something about it so um you can test for Hashimoto if you are Hashim if you have any any any antibodies for Hashimoto that means you have Hashimoto even if it's below where they say it's okay it's not okay you know I mean it is okay you're fine but it's um it is still Hashimoto because if you have any antibodies towards your own body that is an autoimmune condition and so even if it's below because oh the average person has some antibodies yeah the average person is sick you know and so it's just you know it's like you know going into like a high crime area well you know you know a lot of people have gunshot wound so gunshot wounds aren't that that's just normal it's normal to have a gunshot wound no no still not normal no that's that's abnormal just because it is common and it is the norm does not mean it's normal um just maybe normalized but no it's not normal and so same thing with with uh your your Hashimoto so you want to make sure that you have uh no detectable antibodies rashing Moto otherwise you unfortunately you do have Hashimoto it's not the end of the world a lot of people have it eat fatty red meat and do lion diet and those antibodies will come down and and you will effectively not have ashimoto so uh yeah and um that's what I would do use it as a baseline take your tests in that way keep going with what you're doing test for Hashimoto and go on from there and I'm sure you'll be fine I see people's thyroids improve all the time when they go on a carnivore diet sometimes there's bits of hiccups ups and downs depending on what's going on in their life but you know in the long term they get better and they and even people with Hashimoto they come off their medications or at least reduce a lot of their medications but it does take time so just remember your body takes time to heal and good luck with that okay lucky last question from Tahoe thank you very much for the Super Chat uh thanks for what you're doing uh thank for what you're doing doctor are there any dangers to eating spaghetti squash with a homemade tomato sauce or a hearty chili uh yes probably a lot of them especially the squash part that those things horrify me um spaghetti squash with homemade tomato sauce and hard you I mean the thing is that a lot of those things you know you're you're talking about the spaghetti there's going to be grains there's going to be carbs squash was it ripe what kind of squash was it you know is it going to be sweeter squash is it going to be more bitter squash bitter squash going to have more toxins in it how would you did you prepare it um things like that homemade tomato sauce how' you make the tomatoes were they Vine ripen tomatoes did you take the skins off did you take the seeds out and then boil the living hell out of them um things like that what's in the chili is it beans that have a lot of lectins and then um capsicums which are night shades and then meat you know those sorts of things so you know anything with meat in it it's going to be better than anything without meat in it uh but then there's all the other things that you're going to add to it as well so the are dangers you know just being you know having carbs you're going to kick you out of ketosis you're going to get out of your primary metabolic State you're going to slam up your insulin insulin affects over a hundred different mechanisms in your body not just your uh carbohydrate and and protein storage in cells um so all those things are going to be out of balance you're going to shut down autophagy you're not going to be able to turn over your cells and and get rid of these little precancerous cells and turn over your damaged mitochondria which will turn your cells pre-cancerous if they aren't already and uh and so on and so forth the lectins can be quite damaging to your gut you can get leaky gut you can get autoimmune reactions um because those lectins can attack parts of your body and your body makes antibodies towards them and you get Crossfire uh you get hit in the crossfire um things like that and uh squash is just generally disgusting anyway so that's that causes harm just to my sensibilities because I hate squash and um I squash and I don't get along let's put it that way I had to I had to run in with acorn squash when I was younger I was forced to eat it and I vomited everywhere and it was disgusting and I hate it and I never want to see another acor squash again unless it's at a ski shooting range and I can shoot it and blow it up that's really the only time I ever want to see squash um so yeah there are problems you know if there something that you enjoy and you want to do and that's you know that's your business you know I would encourage you to you know eat a lot of meat and a lot fatty meat because you're just going to be better and uh and to try to cut those things out for at least 30 days just go fatty you know meat and water for 30 days then try having the the spaghetti squash squash with the the tomato sauce um see how you feel you will feel worse you you go 30 days without eating any of that stuff and you just eat fatty meat that time and you you add back in the spaghetti squash and homemade tomato sauce you will feel dramatically worse dramatically worse and you will not only feel dramatically worse that day you'll feel dramatically worse the next day and and likely a few days following that as well even if you just don't eat it ever again um so try it you know try some self- experiment or if it's just like you just love it and you're just like I'm gonna I'm I'm just going to deal with it you know that's your business and you know this is I don't talk about you know this for like people is just like you have to do it my way or you're a bad person I'm just trying to let you know what I've found out that's worked for me worked for my patient and work for millions of people around the world already that this is this is really helping their lives and improving their health and um and and you do it that as you will and I'm I'm I'm fully on board with adults being able to make their own decisions in their life and if that's something that you find brings value to your life and you just enjoy and um and you're the one dealing with the consequences I don't get sore and miserable because you ate spaghetti squash so that's really up to you you know if you were doing something that affected then yeah I I get to have a say in it but this is this has nothing to do with me you know so if it's if it's damaging you it's just damaging you you know it's a victimless crime and so if that's what you want to do then do it but I would try that experiment i' go 30 days without any of that stuff add it back in and you'll see it's a big difference and and you get to decide if that's if that's if you want that in your life I made that decision um nearly a decade ago I have no interest in having that stuff in my life because I've seen that made the decision I'll squash you know 32 years ago and that stuff can go to hell probably is in Hell from hell is hell and um so you know no thank you to that but you know do that as you will and um you know I I I I know you'll feel a lot better and I'm sure you do feel better without that stuff give it a try and uh and you'll see yourself and then you get to make the decision on whether or not you want to ever see another squash again and good luck with that and um you'll do great I'm sure okay we have some super stickers from some very nice people like um my and dizy Mindy thank you very much for that um gataka thank you very much for the super sticker as well and stink ass cat good to see you again buddy um for a very generous super sticker as well thank you very much for that and low car blow drama thank you very much for the super sticker as well all right I have to go there because I have to I have to go to work everyone actually sort of ending a bit later than I than I meant to but um it's nice to get through all the questions and not have anybody hanging there and um which I don't don't like to do so thank you everyone uh for coming by um I will see I'll be going to San Diego next Tuesday so will I be able to do a live when I get there possibly I'll have to let you guys know um what's going on when I get to San Diego go um likely will'll be in the air during our normal time Tuesday in America Wednesday morning in yet we'll definitely will be in the air during that time and so um might be able to reschedule it for like you know Wednesday night in America or something like that but it just depends on on the everything and when I'm speaking and things like that and what day and stuff like that because it could have to be you know preparing and all that stuff so um I'll have to see about that uh but I'll be in San Diego if anybody's in San Diego and wants to come by and watch the the uh conference you know please do that's going to be in downtown San Diego and there're gonna be a couple events around there I think I'm going to try to organize a Meetup uh probably at like a barbecue place in San Diego maybe just outside of San Diego I have a friend of mine uh Mina who um was involved with our rugby team at onback down in San Diego while I was there who I've still remained friends with and she has a few restaurants and she actually has a barbecue place uh just outside of San Diego so it's sort of in you know uh it's a bit of a drive outside of outside of the city um but it's it's a really cool place and um she took us there last time I was in town and uh last year and it was great I really liked it so maybe we can do something there or maybe something a bit more more Central but you know everyone's got cars these days so you can probably make it out there and um yeah so try to organize something like that then I'll be in uh Wyoming for the beef Roundup on the 23rd and 24th and so if people are able to make it to that be great to see you then too and otherwise I will catch you guys on the next live thank you all very much for coming thank you all for the great questions and we'll see you next time"
