    "body": "member asks what is the source of the myth of cholesterol causing heart desease something this has been responsible for the death and disease of billions of people around the world over the past Century billions everyone almost everyone on Earth is affected by this by these terrible recommendations these outright frauds and lies from these drug pushing  people have gotten sick they've gotten overweight they've died early they've died in disease and suffering having dementia and Alzheimer's and being enfeebled both mentally and physically cholesterol was never the problem it was a scapegoat by the sugar companies you know that's that's their words not mine and so this was never the problem we look at total cholesterol then we're looking at LDL then we're looking at ratios and we're looking at Apple it's just shifting the goalpost it was never the damn problem in the first place you go back and you look at the origin the data that was available at the time there was no association whatsoever between cholesterol or LDL and heart disease at all none and in fact things like the Framingham study showed an inverse association between total cholesterol and cardiovascular death and mortality right so the lower your total cholesterol the more people died of heart attacks and strokes so this was just misrepresented this was the AHA the American Heart Association is a pack of lying some things and they have multiple times throughout the last century in in well documented instances been bought and paid for by the Food Industries um such as the sugar companies or people on their boards or in charge of it being on the payroll of the sugar companies the big food companies Proctor and Gamble bought Crisco from the Germans who who invented it as as machine lubricant for tank gears I believe and Proctor and Gamble bought it and said yeah it was just feed it to these idiots and and they paid the American Heart Association $20 million to lie and say that it was better for your heart than animal fats like lard and butter and say it was really good for your heart it's much better than this don't want that you want krisco this clean wonderful krisco this clean beautiful machine oil lubricant um it's disgusting you know and this isn't this isn't conjecture this isn't a conspiracy theory it's a it's an historical fact it's on the record it's a matter of record so again um I'm I'm you know I appreciate your doctor's concern but you know that is just not what the evidence shows us what the evidence shows us is that high LDL low triglyceride means you're very metabolically healthy healthy you likely don't have metabolic syndrome you're unlikely to have diabetes and those are the major risk factors uh besides smoking and drinking um for um cardiovascular disease and higher LDL is associated with longevity higher total cholesterol is associated with longevity in studies with sorry 12 million people for LDL and um we just see more and more and more data showing that L and total cholesterol have absolutely nothing to do with development of heart disease um there have been three studies that I've found that show these results but um you know one that I'll mention is a 2009 study out of UCLA where they looked at something like 134,000 people who've had a heart attack in uh I believe it was just in America and 73% had low or ideal LDL cholesterol and about that many had um low HDL as well so HDL is much more predictive of getting a heart attack than LDL was and of course the conclusion of that of these authors were oh apparently our our threshold for for LDL is uh isn't low enough we need to lower it even more you know um and see if you keep lowering and this is this is actual uh guideline recommendations if you keep lowering your LDL but your patient keeps having heart attacks you just keep lowering that LDL you know there's no there's no lower you can just get rid of LDL have zero of it it's only poisonous I mean that's why that's why you know our bodies make it um is because it's poison it wants to kill us and we just have to fight nature in order to not die I mean how stupid you have to be to believe that that we have an internal kill switch that that uh you know is just is just killing us from the inside um that's that's ridiculous that's a ridiculous statement for any doctor or biologist serious biologist to to to make um and uh and but that's the recommendations just lower it lower it lower it lower well when are you going to figure out that you keep lowering LDL and they keep having heart attacks when are you g to figure out the LDL isn't the bloody problem there you know use your damn head you know and but the problem is that people don't you know because they're brainwashed we've been we've been absolutely indoctrinated for a long time and that and that includ and I'm talking about doctors have been indoctrinated ated by the drug companies for a long time and and everyone else as a consequence of that indoctrination so you know think about it this way we've had genetically genetically the same so population genetics if you if we will study population genetics you'll understand that if you have a percentage of Le genes in a in a population regardless of how that population grows or or shrinks expands or shrinks that you will have that same percentage of Le in the population unless there's some Mass you know genocide and die off and Extinction event or a mass migration of people coming in you'll you'll keep that percentage so right now we've had we have the same percentage of of people that have familial hypercholesterolemia worldwide that we did in the 1800s the first death from heart attack uh confirmed on autopsy in America was in 1912 there wasn't a single case throughout American history or the colonies before that 1912 was the first one I've been able to find exactly eight case reports of uh people dying from a heart attack in all of Europe throughout the entire 18th century I'm sure there are more but if that were the most popular killer we were eating more meat in the 1800s than we were in the early 1900s because vegetarianism started getting pushed really hard in the 1800s because of the puritanical movement and the temperance movement because they thought that women especially shouldn't eat meat because it give them carnal desires you eat of the flesh you'll think of the Flesh and and can't have that you know can't have people reproducing and being healthy and fertile no no no we need to suppress that and so the idea was if you were a virtuous person you would go vegetarian to suppress your sexual urges in any experiment any model in any observation in nature When Animals stop being interested in mating and reproduction they are sick there is something wrong and that's what we're reproducing that's what they were intentionally reproducing and you see the meat consumption sort of going down throughout the 1800s probably as a consequence of this of this sentiment that you needed to eat a vegetarian diet in order to suppress your sexual urges that's certainly what the Seventh Day Adventist believe and then they codified that in religious Doctrine by saying God said it and then that spread out from there and now you have you know the consequences of that with you know Dr Kelloggs and all the serial companies that that came up as a consequence of Dr kellock and sanitarian Foods U you know um the Seventh Day Adventist like sanitarian Foods who are the major influencers of nutritional studies dietetics the curriculums and um and the studies that are being put out so I mean this is all this just goes crazy but again we're eating more meat in the 1800s there's exactly eight deaths from heart attacks in the in the literature there's exactly one that I can find in the 1700s with the same exact percentage of people have familial hyp cholesterolemia in the 1800s and 1700s before as we do right now when this is the number one killer in the world so that that's a there just LDL equals Death why weren't anyone why wasn't anyone dying then and if you say oh well we just didn't notice it you're right we saw eight of them so people didn't know what to look for read a textbook from the uh medical textbook from the 1800s they are insanely detailed William osler's textbook my great-grandfather was a doctor graduated from Columbia youngest ever graduate from Columbia Medical School to date he was 20 years old when he graduated Columbia Medical School top of his class he has William osler's textbook and it's that big I have it at um at at you know my my family's home in uh America it is is so detailed there are so many maladies and pathologies of the heart all these different ways that people can die and then looking what happened oh and this is what happened this is not a single damn mention of any you know coronary thrombi in in the coronary vessels um why is that it just too stupid to figure it out these guys dissecting everything else about the heart looking at all these different sorts of thing and totally missed that just totally miss this big blockage that killed off half the heart and it scarred over really you know I mean you you have to be a special kind of stupid or ignorant to uh to believe that um it's wrong it's dead wrong so why is it why is it that the first heart attack you know proven on autopsy was in 1912 in America 10 years later there were many more 10 years after that number one killer in America now it's a number one killer worldwide and there were eight in all of Europe throughout the the entire Century of the 1800s why is that is it really because of cholesterol is it really because of meat we're eating more meat in the 1800s than we were in the 1930s when this was the number one killer in America or became the number one killer in America we're eating more meat in 1912 than we were in 1930 when this became the number one killer in America it was U-shaped curve so we're eating less and less and less throughout the 1800s it dips it's at its trough in the 1920s and 30s when this becomes the number one and then it starts slowly coming back up there isn't even a correlation so sorry I Bel belabored that point but it it still really rils me up obviously but watch my video the truth about cholesterol and heart disease this has just killed billions of people I mean do we get that do people understand that like this this has been responsible for the death and disease of billions of people around the world over the past Century billions right so everyone almost everyone on Earth is affected by this by these terrible recommendations these outright frauds and lies from these drug pushing  and people have gotten sick they've gotten overweight they've died early they've died in disease and suffering and in in you know having having dementia and Alzheimer's and being in feeble both mentally and physically by the billions you have 35-year-old uh men and women having heart attacks and dropping dead in front of their children you know they're robbed of their entire life with their kids those kids are robbed from their of their parents for the rest of their life because these you know just wanted to make a a buck you know that pisses me off and everyone should be pissed off by this which oh well you know it doesn't oh F you forever putting this up F you for for trying to push this nonsense on people F you for trying to keep propagating this  when we have hard evidence it was a con in the first place so people like Dr Alo and these other who who just push this sort of probably because they're getting paid off they just want to try to make a name for themselves because they're just they're just desperate to try to be popular like I'm sorry you didn't have friends in school but Jesus Christ don't take it out on the rest of us like no one is benefiting by the nonsense that these people say people are getting hurt and they are suffering and they are dying by the billions because of this garbage that people have been spewing out there and it is just time that this just dies and we just stop doing that and just be like oh but CL like f off that was a scam not talking about it and I think that's what I'm going to start start doing is just be like look watch my video on it it's a scam don't worry about it because it's a scam it is a scam and uh and we just you know the only reason that this is still alive is because we are keeping it alive by even entertaining the discussion you know oh but you have to do this that's  you're wrong we're not talking about that read a goddamn book you know this was just you know this was they made it up they made it up to push their product and to protect their product it's crap moving on with our lives and that's what we should do um and that animals don't get diena in the wild when natural die but they will get their eating they an unnatural die and dementia Alzheimer's dementia at the very least didn't exist before 1906 and any real numbers that people notice let's get back to that I mean people weren't even full carnivore back then you know they're just eating less they're eating more meat more animal fat and less garbage"
