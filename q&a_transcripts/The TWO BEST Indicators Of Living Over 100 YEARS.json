    "transcript": "why are we screwing around with the biomechanics of our body and we think we have to we have to micromanage you know all these different things in our body that's stupid like what what animal does that in nature they're all just dropping dead and dying just all these diseases because they just didn't you know micromanage their blood markers properly those species wouldn't exist they would go extinct because they suck oh my God your LDL came dude who cares stop eating for 5 days your LDL is going to go up tell your doctor to fast for 3 Days see what his LDL cholesterol does is fasting bad for you now is that bad for your heart eating Oreo cookies that's going to lower your LDL is that good for your heart well LDL if it goes up that's a problem  Scott Welden this is from the previous Super Chat that didn't attach so uh thank you again for that Scott Dr chaffy my total cholesterol is 458 HDL was 58 uh triglycerides were um 87 was 12 I don't that's shockingly low um and LDL 400 fasting insulin was 2.5 uh would this concern you first of all your fasting insulin is excellent so that's that's amazing so I'm I'm these sort of look like American numbers I'm going to assume you're in America and if your insulin is between is 2.5 that's fantastic you know there's Dr Casey means uh who I had on on my podcast she has the company levels they track glucose have a CGM constant glucose monitor sort of keep track of these sorts of things see what how to how to improve your metabolism and your health through glucose and Insulin control and she was saying that sort of the best range they found was between two and six for your fasting insulin so that's excellent um and your your total cholesterol is is um you know 458 that's certainly above the arbitrary boundaries that that have been set for cholesterol but what does that actually mean well in a study with 44,000 people this year published out of um Sweden they looked for different biomarkers that could you know best relate to your OD you know relate to odds of living over 100 and they found that the two best biomarkers for predicting if you were going to live over 100 was low insulin and high total cholesterol so you got both so that's very good all right so at least according to that study you're in a better group for longevity um hdl's 58 that's fantastic above 40 for men and above 50 for women is is the target range and I you know I would actually agree with that target range um triglycerides 87 from 12 I don't know how they were ever 12 even if after a carnivore diet I've never seen them that low and certainly if people are eating carbs and sugar and alcohol and things like that I don't I don't know I think that might have been just a an error in in measurement but either way if it's gone from 12 up to 87 or 87 down to 12 either way you're well below the threshold for any sort of concern for triglyceride so I I wouldn't worry about that LDL again if you just fast your LDL is going to go up so eat some cookies eat some Oreo cookies and and your LDL will come right down if that's what you're worried about it's not what I'm worried about and again it was a it was a it was a surrogate no sorry it was a scapegoat for the sugar companies you know they they needed they needed something to blame for um for heart disease because it was much more likely to be that their product was causing heart disease they like we got to we got to shift the blame somewhere else it's complete um and so why are we still looking at it it was a con it was a con then it's a con now like so I I just don't I don't even look at it um you know there are the there are no highlevel studies none showing causitive relationship ship between LDL and atherosclerosis despite anything that petera says there a re recent interview he did with um Derek from more plates more dates and he says well everyone knows that this is causitive highl causes this and we know that anyone who understands math and statistics um knows that well the problem with that is is that there are no studies at all that show a causitive relationship between LDL cholesterol and and um atherosclerosis just none and that's the only thing that you can use to prove causation in fact there are randomized control trials that can show causation with thousands of people very high-powered well done well done and designed studies that actually showed the opposite they showed a protective uh relationship that higher LDL cholesterol actually had lower heart disease and strokes and um and that's what the journal American College of Cardiology said is that there should be no arbitrary upper limit on the amount of saturated fat people eat because the more saturated fat you eat the less Strokes you get and there is no relationship between higher saturated fat and and higher um cardiovascular disease none none so you know I I think that you know Dr T should relook at that and understand that uh if you understand statistics and you understand um you know how the the nature of these studies you cannot cannot not show causation unless you have you know from a from uh anything but an experimental randomized control trial that's the that's the Baseline and all the ones that have been done have shown the opposite okay so anyone who understands Math and Science and statistics does understand that unless they've been completely misled by um by the propaganda it's it's complete crap it's utter utter crap and um the only highlevel step studies show the opposite of what their Theory shows and we know that they were lying in the first place so that fits pretty well right we know they're full of and now we have studies proving it in fact we had studies then proving it they just buried them for decades because they didn't want people to know about it and so um and I and I wonder why because they were trying to hide stuff they were trying to mislead people and then so they buried that in order to hide it in order to mislead people do not trust these people cholesterol was never the problem why are we still looking at this you know I people do ask me about their cholesterol well what about this and it's generally very similar um Bloods here and of course they're going to be worried about that because we've just been drilled in our ears all the time I hope to get to a point where no one asked me about their cholesterol because it was never a problem in the first place and it's not a problem now so I if I had those numbers and I probably have something pretty close to those numbers except my HDL is a bit higher than that um I've been doing this longer um my insulin's very similar um you know I wouldn't worry about it not because you know this is this is this is a a straw man that they make so oh people say well if you're if you're metabolically healthy and your insulin's low well then this doesn't cause a problem that's what petera say oh well I don't know why they would say no no no no I don't give a about your metabolism I don't give crap about anything else LDL is not a goddamn cause of heart disease full stop okay not ever not in any condition at all it does not cause heart disease that was a scapegoat something else causes it now does sdldl a small dense damaged lipoproteins do they play a role maybe but they don't cause themselves something caused them to exist and that process is causing these other things and maybe that plays a role in that they are not the underlying cause because some cause them we make large buyant LDL molecules those do not cause atherosclerosis you damage those you disease those if those were to have a problem well something else caused that so that's not the beginning that's not the Genesis right but then again they're not the driving Factor either because increase sdl uh sdldl is only increases your risk factor for heart disease by 70% 1.7x metabolic syndrome increases by 600% 6x type two diabetes increases it by a th% 10x which is up there with smoking right so you know the the one has the least uh you know relative risk that's the one that's that's the direct cause that causes everything that's the underline I mean you know um you know that little meme that kid his car SE going I mean I wish I had that kid I just turn it on every time someone says something's asinine like like that um you know smoking uh carries something like 11,500 increased risk of developing lung cancer if you smoke like per per pack year history right so it goes up right so that's a that's a that's a very very very strong link right and it and it goes up you know with a dose dependent you know sort of uh criteria right and that's not what you see even with sdldl you don't see a very strong relationship it's a very bad marker for that so why the hell are we looking at it I don't I don't I do not look at cholesterol as a sign of of uh heart disease risk because it's not because cholesterol never had anything to do with it in the first place and apparently it's protective so if anything you want to look at your your cholesterol to see um if you're protected and you have higher LDL which seems to be protective you have lower triglycerides you have higher HDL you have lower insulin all of these seem to be protective so good for you well done hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own questions please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest of the Q&A so Eric C thank you very much for the Super Chat hi doc need advice uh triglycerides 132 cholesterol 324 LDL 261 CL 38 carnivore for one month doc wants to start statins 60-year-old male heart bypass aortic valve replacement cancer history any advice keep doing what you're doing that is my advice um it's been one month first of all what were your Bloods the month before you started what were they the day the day before you started right you need to look at that you have no idea what the changes were if you don't track the changes right you need before and after so this is a baseline check it again in 3 months months see how it goes check it in in six months in a year see how it goes you will not develop heart disease and atherosclerosis in a month or six months or a year it takes a lot longer than that so you know whether or not you need statins you certainly don't need to to you know need them now based on one month of just eating differently regardless of what you're eating um and again LDL will go up if you just stop eating so eat Oreo cookies for for a week check your blood your LDL again that will be low your doctor will be happy and you can tell him that he's fired because that's idiotic right um check your blood sugar again or or check your your cholesterol again in a few months after doing a high fat uh red meat and water diet your HDL will go up your triglycerides will keep coming down uh your LDL will do whatever the hell it wants to do because that's a a metabolic issue if you if you're eating carbs LDL will be low you stop eating carbs LDL will go up or you just stop eating totally that it'll go up as well so that's that's a metabolic thing that's not a that's not a you're going to die of you know dietary cholesterol doesn't doesn't really affect our serum cholesterol anyway we make the majority of cholesterol it's only when your body is impaired and stopped from making uh enough cholesterol is when you start absorbing more cholesterol in your from your diet and so your body is perfectly regulating this you know like why are we why are we screwing around with the biomechanics of our body and we think we have to we have to micromanage you know all these different things in our body that's stupid you know like what what animal does that in nature they're all just dropping dead and dying just all these diseases because they just didn't you know micromanage their blood markers properly those species wouldn't exist they would go extinct because they suck our species is not extinct so we don't suck and so these things can you don't have to m micromanage them so I I would love to get to the day that no one ever ask me about their cholesterol again but I do understand why they do um you know starting some I mean you're oh my God your LDL came dude who cares stop eating for five days you know your LDL is going to go up tell your doctor to fast for three days see what his LDL cholesterol does is fasting bad for you now is that bad for your heart eating Oreo cookies that's going to lower your LDL is that good for your heart well LDL if it goes that's Pro  that is not true there's a direct relationship between high LDL and their development of atherosclerosis  there is zero highlevel um uh studies showing that none it's correlation only and there are a lot of correlative studies with hundreds of thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions of people showing that higher LDL cholesterol is actually inversely related to heart disease and all cause mortality so the higher your cholesterol the higher LDL cholesterol the longer people are living in multi-million person studies right the Framingham study itself which is like probably the only study that your doctor was taught in medical school certainly the only one I was taught in medical school about cholesterol and heart disease that was a correlative study and it it said that we were taught that higher cholesterol uh corresponded with higher rates of heart disease in fact it was the opposite it the co the framing St showed the opposite of that it was misrepresented by the American Heart Association which were in the pocket of the sugar companies this is a fraud this is a con I don't I don't pay attention to this it's not a good marker for heart disease it was never the cause LDL is not the cause of heart disease and so I would just I so I don't look at it as that cause I look at other sorts of things uh as a as a as a marker for that and that is not it that is not the one I look at so I look at fasting insulin I look at blood sugar control hba1c those sorts of things those are much stronger indicators much stronger smoking drinking much stronger indicators so but when you're on a carnivore diet and you're your fat adapted keto adapted then you will you will just constantly replenish your glycogen and your ketones uh from your fat stores we know this from from studies in wolves in 1981 they said"
