    "title": "\ud83d\udd34Understanding The Carnivore Diet with Dr Anthony Chaffee | LIVE Q&A March 19th, 2024",
    "transcript": "all right hello everyone thank you very much for joining for my YouTube live for March 20th um in Australia March 19th in the US um so yeah so sorry I was just uh I was over at um my patreon group we have uh weekly live sessions where we do uh more one-on-one sort of talks in the in the group anyway so we just finished that and um so other people are interested in joining that to get more sort of personal talking time then that's that's an option too and my patreon is just Anthony cha MD just like my YouTube channel and Instagram um also wanted to announce that my um uh my friends and I are doing a conference over in Melbourne it's called the regenerate conference there on the screen that's April 21st so that's a Sunday and um we did this last year as well in Albury uh New South Wales which was awesome and um had a great turnout and great food like it was literally the best uh food that I had at a conference because it was all just like 100% carnivore stuff and it was just all just like regeneratively raised um you know pasture raised meat and eggs and things like that from WLKY farm so he he supplied all that from his farm which was great and then um after that next month I'll be at the phc conference of Public Health collaboration in London London and that'll be the weekend of May uh 18th so the 17th 18th and 19th will be that conference as well and so if anyone's over in Melbourne or on on the East Coast or down in Australia want to come to the regenerate Conference next month in April uh please do be great to see you there should still be tickets available um so uh as you can get you can get those and then if people are in England or in Europe and they want to come to the phc conference as well there be a ton of people there uh that uh will be great uh great to see people can go to the phc Instagram page and the website and see all the different speakers that are going to be there but um it'll be myself I think Dr Baker will be there Dr Barry pretty sure will be there Dr David Unwin will be there and I think Dave Philman a lot of other people anyway it's huge huge amount uh it'll be a huge uh turnout so it'll be really great so people are able to come to those uh it' be great to see you guys there and then uh and then ketocon slash um what the hell is it now hacky Health that's where they're sort of rebranded as hacky Health that'll be in Austin sort of two weeks after the phc conference so if people are there that's that might be easier for people in the states to come by and say hi okay so um we've got a number of Super chats here I I have a about uh sort of hour and a half two hours I have to sort of finish around uh noon my time so that's in about an hour and 45 minutes so um just to let you guys know and we' already got a number of questions here so thank you everyone for submitting your [Music] questions Colin wheeler thank you very much for the Super Chat How likely is it that antibiotics could stall carnivore adaptation one month in and I have periodically um stomach bloating diarrhea as well as keto rash any advice greatly appreciated well it just depends um you know it's it's not it's not necess going to going to stop your adaptation to a ketogenic ketogenic uh energy metabolism necessarily shouldn't really um but it can certainly mess up your gut and make it so that you're not you're not really feeling your best or having a bit of disbiosis you can kill off a lot of the bacteria that are healthy and are supposed to be there and doing good things for you in your body and um and if that happens you can get these sorts of issues uh like you're describing bloating and diarrhea ketor rash that well a it could be from you know if you're taking antibiotics and you're getting a rash you you need to ask is it is it a rash from the antibiotics and so you know that that you shouldn't discount that isn't necessarily keto rash if you're on medication medications can cause rashes especially antibiotics if you're having a negative reaction to that if that rash spreads or you certainly get anything on your lips you're getting IR carrier sort of like like hives and you know big sort of breakouts and that could be like an allergic reaction it could be dangerous you need to go go go see your doctor right away probably go to the emergency room if it's really going crazy certainly it gets on your lips or in your tongue you just call the ambulance right then because that can get down the throat that can close off your windpipe even if you're driving to the hospital it could close off while you're driving you know not safe so anytime you get big swelling on your lips or your tongue or in your mouth you just call you just call the ambulance and you tell them what's going on and they get down there and they give you a shot of adrenaline right then and there you don't you don't waste time with that so um but as far as bloating and diarrhea yeah that can absolutely come from uh from antibiotics and so if you're if you think you're having gut disbiosis you think you're having a a microbiome issue that's causing these problem problems because of the antibiotics you can always try to have a bit of fermented dairy so some live culture yogurt Greek yogurt that has very little carbohydrates try putting that on meat you chew it up together in the meat so you're sort of burying those bacteria into that bolish of food you swallow that together it protects it from the stomach acid that sort of gets through your stomach acid in first part of your small intestine so you can get that bacteria down to the colon and you know do that for a week or two after that you hopefully things settle down your body can just get to normal and you'll support your microbiome as it's um as it's going to be fed on the things that you eat and what if you're eating what you know is healthy for you you're going to have you're going to support the bacteria they're also healthy for you to have so um that's what I would do Colin wheeler uh thank you for the super chat again hey Dr chm 44 started carnivore one month go is prescribed um sulam metho whatever the hell that is um for prostatitis a week into carnivore uh 30-day course one week left Jesus 30-day course wow uh worried that prescription is affecting adaptation well yeah so so I think this is sort of a continuation from the the last question may or may not be doing adaptation but a 30-day course is definitely going to trash microbiome so I would recommend having like the fermented dairy and um and trying just starting that now really and mixing that in with the meat that you're eating and eating that uh it's going to get killed pretty quickly because have all these antibiotics in your body but you at least you're trying to keep that seated and um and then when you're you're done with the antibiotics you just keep going with it for a couple weeks after that to sort of keep those bacteria in there because the the one one of the major risks is that you can get different sorts of bacteria in your gut that are more resistant to these antibiotics and now they they don't have any competition because you just you just scorched the field and you've laid waste to all their competition the a jungle down there and they're they're fighting for resources and now all of a sudden they don't have to fight for resource and they just go crazy and you get you get an overblown um bacterial colony of just one specific thing like claustrum dis the seal so C diff is is a very dangerous consequence of long antibiotics uh and and so something you want to think about um is H is reeding your gut microbiome and if you're having too many problems or issues or you're getting sick and you think that there's you're getting bloody diarrhea and all that sort of stuff and you're getting and you're getting more unwell you need to think about you know is are you getting a sort of an opportunistic over bacterial overgrowth in your in your intestine and getting you know something like a C diff sort of infection as a result of those long-term antibiotics and see your doctor but that's what I would do now anyway is start with with some yogurt it doesn't have to be much just a little dollop on some meat you chew it up together little dollop little dollop little dollop on each bite of meat you know it doesn't have to be a huge amount um and um you just do that for the rest of your antibiotics and then for a couple weeks after and hopefully that settles things down so a question from an Bei who says out a comfortable weight do not want to reduce anymore how do I know that my body knows this sure others have been in a similar boat yeah well you know how that it is an assumption but is an assumption based on on the this phenomenon being the case in all aspects of life in existence so all life knows how to eat in while you know they don't have a they don't have a coach telling them well you need these macros and those micros you have to weigh your food and do all this crap they just eat they eat when they're hungry and when food is available and they eat as much as their body tells them to eat and it seems to work out and why wouldn't it right life is supposed to just work all on its own you don't need anyone to tell you what to do if you're doing something that's that uh is is part of your biology and so it doesn't make sense that we would have to would have required these sort of macros and micros and you have to calculate this and do that because we weren't you people weren't doing this for most of the human existence people just ate until they felt I don't need to eat anymore koalas do the same Lions do the same whales do the same it's just that's how it is and so if your body can't figure that out you know you're going to die that's it you know you're not going to make it in the wild and so if you have a species of animal that can't do that or you have an individual that has some sort of mutation that makes it so they can't can't do that they can't regulate the amount of nutrition they can they their body needs they're going to die they're not going to make it they're not going to make it Forward they're not going to you know they're not going to procreate and you're not going to have that as a species doing that because it's going to be so inefficient those individuals are just going to die off it's going to weed itself out and we came from other forms of life that were already established that were already there that had already won the game of Life they had already succeeded in different situations and so you know those traits just don't exist you know that you just you just can't tell it would be an individual mutation that came in and would be wiped out pretty instantly um and so you know maybe you can start getting that mutation now but it maybe one off mutations it would be an individual here and there and extraordinarily likely so you know you just just test it yourself you eat until fatty meat stops tasting good you don't eat anything else and you see what happens you know or I've haven't yet seen anybody that this doesn't apply to if somebody's on medications their appetite suppressants sure you're not you're not necessarily going to be able to trust your instincts if you're on medications that increase your your hunger sure you know you may need to look at this a different way and say okay well maybe maybe I need to toh think about this and limit it myself but when you're outside of those situations when you're not taking a medication that's disrupting your your hunger signals then you just eat until fatty meat stops tasting good and um and if you need to eat more than than once a day you just do that and you won't lose weight you won't lose more weight than is healthy for you if you're able to do that unless you're on different sort of medications or other things that are that are you know screwing with that you Cho radiation all these sorts of things that can that can disrupt your body you're being put on you know cortical steroids to reduce inflammation because of some issue or another uh yeah that can that can change your hunger that can screw with your blood sugar and do all these other sorts of things so those are all special special circumstances outside of those special circumstances you should be able to just listen to your [Music] body um where'd that go there we go uh Lena thank you for the super chat if you portion Dairy does it still cause weight gain depend on how much you portion if you portion a lot then sure the thing with dairy is that it can just it can just screw with your hunger signals right so just like we were talking about how's your body know well because it's getting the proper signals and so that only works if you're if you're eating what you're designed to eat so Dairy can cause a bit of compulsive eating can cause you to eat more than your body necessarily wants and it screws screws up those hunger signals there are natural opiates in in uh Dairy and milk so that can be a bit more of a of a compulsion to eat for a different reason than just hunger and uh carbohydrates can do this as well and so what you know I see I see commonly is that people will still eat the exact same amount of meat regardless of the amount of dairy they have and so they can just they can just eat more than their body actually wants and so that changes some of their signals so that's the thing yeah if you portion it if you butter seems to be okay but you know things like cheese and yogurt and certainly milk you know seems to just be you know people will have quite a lot of that and and not really think about it so that's what I say with dairy is you do want to limit it and so that would come into you know portion it yeah so if you if you just have a slice of cheese with meat every now and then then fine you know you melt some cheese to a hamburger patty that should be fine if you're having a bit of yogurt on a bite of meat so that you can basically take it as a supplement to Reed your your gut bacteria fine you know if you're eating bowls of yogurt not fine if you're just eating chunks of cheese not fine if you're drinking gallons of milk a day not fine so yeah you do have to portion that stuff um and it depends on how much you portion if you're if you're eating a lot of dairy you're gonna have you're gonna have uh more coming in than you may actually need and so you you won't be able to listen to your body as much as you want to so Mariana cozer says Dr chaffy any chance of a visited South Africa I would absolutely love to I love South Africa I've been there once back in I don't know when I was 22 so like 20 22 years ago like back in 2002 I went down there absolutely loved it had a good friend of mine that still keep in touch with that we played rugby together in Seattle but he's from there he played for um uh Stellenbosch he was their starting fly half and um and um and then he got injured and you know he was he was gonna play for like the Petoria Blue Bulls U but unfortunate injury sort of made that difficult and then he started traveling came to America and uh ended up in Seattle and played with my team my team there and so I absolutely loved it I had a great time there um I haven't been back since I'd love to go I think it's um more dangerous now from what I hear uh there seems to be certainly seem to be a lot more South Africans moving to Perth and saying that like it's getting a bit dodgy there so they wanted to come here but I'd still love to go I think it's I think it's a gorgeous country and um yeah would would love to check it out I don't have any plans to I don't I don't know of any conferences or anything like that that are going on that I could you know that I could justify coming over but yeah it would be great to go and then maybe I'll you know if there's a conference over there that you know Professor noes is putting on and and I get invited you know that'd be great and uh maybe I might just go go visit my buddy and uh see how that goes but yeah it would be it would be great I've been it's been way too long since I've been there um so Jan gross U Martin Dale said asks Dr sh can you speak to rabdom myisis it depends on the context you know this is something that people often get uh well can get when you're doing excessive cardio and working out like people running marathons and they're not quite hydrated enough um and that really pissed off um guy that was doing that got wrapped in my eyes there's a lot of people got wrapped in my Allis one year with the Dublin marathon when I was over there in the emergency department in Dublin and and I was just like well this is something that you know we need to drink more well I'm definitely hydr I'm like I don't give a what you're saying your Bloods are telling me different you know it's just you're not you know and the treatment for this is giving you a whole bunch of water that's the idea you know so it isn't it isn't from dehydration but the treatment is you need a lot more water to clear this stuff out of your kidneys because you're you're breaking down muscle tissue and it's just clogging up the kidneys it's getting too hard to filter this stuff out and you get a relative you're sort relatively dehydrated because you don't have enough water to sort of flush your kidneys as much as they need to to and you're still working you're still producing the stuff and it gets harder for your body um as you go and so uh Yes actually this is uh this is a problem and a consequence of not drinking as much water as your body demanded for the breakdown and excretion of these of these materials so it's you know it's it would be interesting when we see more carnivore athletes you know doing doing um competitions because you know rap my liis isn't all that common but it does happen in these big marathons but we had you know the guy that um you know carnivore guy who who ran five marathons in five days fasted he was just drinking water and he you know he drank a lot of water um didn't get rabbed in myis you know felt felt good the whole time so you know didn't eat the whole time if I didn't mention that so it was 5 days in a row didn't eat at all was fasted the whole time didn't eat ran five marathons day after day after day after day and that ended with the Sydney marathon and um you know did that and actually recovered enough that that was his second best time his first day was his best time and his last day was his second best time did not get rabbed in my eyes so you know I wonder if that's um you know if that's going to be influenced by a diet almost everything is and so I would imagine that that that does as well but that's really what it is you're breaking down your muscle tissue to such an extent that your kidneys have a difficult time time clearing it out and uh you can get an acute kidney injury and um and you just need to be on tons and tons and tons of fluids IV and otherwise just to try to flush this stuff out and help your kidneys so they don't have to work too hard and then you you get through that and generally be pretty good after that you can also get it from uh when people fall or have an accident or you know if if somebody who's elderly has a fall or breaks her hip and then Falls and they're stuck on the ground for a while and they're just their body weight is pressing on their muscles and actually breaks down the muscle tissue because they're on a hard ground and they're there for you know hours or even days sometimes unfortunately and they get there and and they'll have a rapdom myisis from the breakdown of that muscle tissue which is very sad but um yeah same same treatment though supportive care tons of fluid DP thank you for the Super Chat uh female 5 foot3 121 PBS been lifting weights on keto for 2 years now on Carnivore for two months approximately 80 to 100 grams of protein 90 to 120 grams of fat but no gym since the summer only walking every day could I lose muscle mass you're look you're gonna you're you're you're not going to run on your fat on your muscle anyway you're not going to catabolize your muscle for energy until you run out of fat or if you're not eating enough and then you run out of fat then you'll then you'll start catabolizing your your muscle at that point if you're not stimulating your muscle then your body can just say hey there's there's better use uh for these resources we can reallocate those somewhere else uh we don't need to muscles expensive you don't need to keep you know keeping these things built up if you don't actually need them and if you're not stimulating them takes a long time takes a long time but they can atrophy they can get smaller you know I mean when I when I'm working out I'm sort of back in the gym now for the last couple months and you know feel good and I've been putting on weight and I've been putting on muscle and um but you know last sort of week or so I haven't really been been able to go just with work and haven't really lost anything hasn't really changed so it does take a long time you absolutely can put on more muscle and then if you're not working out for a long time that will slowly go away but you you'll sort of hit a hit a balance point where you won't really lose more muscle than uh than that so you won't necessarily be as bulky but it takes a long time takes a long time to do that but your body just says okay look we don't need to necessarily support this these big muscles as much anymore because you're not using them and so that could go down but you're you're not going to catabolize your muscles you're not going to break them down for energy um unless you run out of fat if you're not eating enough and you run out of fat so you just keep eating until fatty meat stops tasting good um Those portions proportions look fine but it just depends on what your body's demands are you need enough protein you need enough fat and that balance that proportion tends to be about one: one two to one grams of fat to protein tends to be but it but it varies and obviously one: one to two: one is is actually quite a big variation already so just depends on what your body demands and so you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and that should support your body for where it is when you start working out again that demand will increase and you'll put on muscle so yeah you probably won't lose much but um it's you you tend to stay very stable like when I when I'm just eating normally even very clean Whole Foods whole Meats not a much of fat salads if I had to and you know some bread every now and then or whatever never a really big pasta sort of person my majority of what I ate throughout my life was meat and I ate the other stuff as a side because I was supposed to and even then e eating in that sort of clean way with a lot of meat if I wasn't working out I was I was losing muscle and I was putting on fat and losing muscle it just that was just that was just what was happening and that's what Norm most people experience now the exact opposite I never put on fat and I hardly ever lose muscle and when I when I'm working out I put on more and then I I keep that and so you know just just going for the last you know month and a half two months you know I've noticed I'm like wow I'm actually looking you know much more developed and muscular and lean I was like that's nice sort of missed that and uh but you just don't really lose it it takes so long to lose that and I was like it was probably wasn't working out consistently like on a you know 4 days a week basis for I mean over a year it was every couple weeks I get into the gym there's a several month period that I didn't I didn't get into the gym at all and um didn't change too much didn't didn't go down I mean it does it does but so slowly so incremental and slow and then it just stops at a certain point like you really don't lose it past that as long as you're eating properly and um then I start working out again and started getting good results again so yeah you probably won't lose too much but it is always better to work out and you'll feel better doing it too baby Jesse James thank you for the super chat um 36y old woman 4 foot1 118 PBS I've lost 40 PBS and I'm about 8 pounds away from my my go weight which is great that's awesome I'm doing mad but struggling to lose the last bit of weight uh cannot um cannot eating enough stall weight loss it can um you know if you're there's no animal in the wild like if you put food in front of if you put that animal's food in front of it and they were hungry there's no animal they just be like I'm just not going to eat today or I'm just I'm going to limit they're going to eat until their body tells them to stop if there's food available they're going to eat if they're not eating to the point of satiation what does that mean that means there's not enough food available they're going to eat what's available and they'll stop when they're satisfied if there's not enough they'll eat what's there and then look for more so what you're doing physiologically by undereating is that you're telling your body that you're in a famine because if you had food available you would eat it because that's the inputs your your your your physiology isn't isn't an intelligence that's sitting there watching us and saying oh well I see what you're doing you're trying to lose weight so I'll work with you here that's not what it's doing it's responding to inputs so your input by not eating enough is there isn't enough you're in a famine and your body goes right well we need to slow it down less coming in less going out you know like as you as someone who's phisically responsible should be you get you get your hours cut at work last thing you need to do is start you know blowing out your savings and spending everything in the bank and blowing out your credit cards bad idea right you need to trim sales and survive you need to just you know hunker down and just okay we need to weather this and have less going out um so you know almost almost as if you know it was it was uh you know a responsible sort of system and it is right because you have to be because if you're not if your body's not able to survive a famine it's not able to slow your metabolism down you're going to die and so you know animals that are all going to go through times periods of deprivation and so spe species animal that can't do that that can't weather and survive a famine they're dead you know we have um where's your study study is the Minnesota uh starvation trial uh that happened in World War II uh with our good friend and um uh honorary Nazi anel Keys who starved the hell out of people and studied what happens and um you know if we're going to get long-term you know engagements and people going to have food shortages and stuff like that they wanted to see what was going on so they starved the hell out of people and um and they saw yeah they lost weight but then it plateaued that's sort of stalled out sort of what we see in concentration camps as well you if you read gulg archipelago with Alexander solichin see what they were being fed every day you're like you should be dead right but the people were doing that for years for decades they were eating like that and um and they didn't because their metabolism slowed down metabolism slowed down enough to survive that and some people do die of famine but you know you can you can survive a lot more than you think and if it was just calories in calories out no change in the metabolic system some of those people in in the in the Minnesota starvation trial would have would have ceased to exist because they would have lost more weight than they had in the first place so that's what happens when you undereat you actually slow your metabolism so we don't want to do that we want to encourage your metabolism you want to eat as much as your body's asking you for if you eat as much as your body asking for you're not in a famine you're eating you and you get to a point you I don't need anymore and you leave those leftovers on the plate you finish your plate and it was good to the last bite you make more you want to get to a point where it sort of tastes like you know just uninteresting or like cardboard you just kind of go yeah I think I'm done it should be enjoyable you should not eat if it is not enjoyable but if it is enjoyable you know you should eat if you're eating meat obviously you have clever people doing you know clever things to make unhealthy things taste good but healthy things also taste good so if you're eating those healthy things which is just fatty meat should be fine and so you just do that you just eat until your body is telling you to stop as long as you're not any medications or other sorts of things that are going to disrupt your hunger signals like we talked about you know then that should be fine you know if you're having Dairy don't it's that's a that's a classic weight loss stall do you're having artificial sweeteners don't those are also classic weight loss stall and uh for carnivores and you get some some idiot somewhere who has a study that says something but it's comparing apples to oranges right they looking at at diet sodas versus normal sodas or diet sodas in a in a standard diet that's not what we're talking about we're talking about eating a proper human diet we're talking about eating something that's fit for our biology artificial sweeteners and sugars and real and other sweeteners and these other sorts of things will absolutely disrupt your body and your biochemistry so just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good do that every day exercise if you can uh anerobic exercise that's what you really want to do so weightlifting um resistance training and uh sprinting probably the best uh full body all-around exercise you can do is sprinting you can do it at any age all you're doing is you're going as hard as you can go it doesn't have to be not have to win any races you just have to go as hard as you can go if you're a Mobility risk and you you have have issues um that may lead you to Falling do it on a stationary bicycle where you just you just pedal as hard and as fast as you can at a resistance that's challenging for you and you do the same thing you go as hard as you can and you try to wear yourself out um as quickly as you can so if you can do it more than a minute you're either in really good shape or you're not working hard enough so um so do those sorts of things and that will that will improve your hormonal Health your physical health your um your lean body mass and can absolutely help uh stimulate weight loss as well but yes if you undereat you can slow your metabolism and stall your weight loss Lindsay Snyder thank you for the Super Chat what did you use what do you use for toothpaste also I don't have a gallbladder and sometimes struggle with digestion do you think chewing U mastic gum before meals will help Prime the stomach for the meal thank you I don't really know what mastic gum is unfortunately but I also don't think you do need to um because you you're still going to make bile it's just not going to be stored in your gallbladder so it's just going to drip out constantly out of your liver and so if that's the case you just may not be able to eat a huge amount of of fatty you know fat at one time uh because it'll just won't get digested won't get absorbed really it'll get digested just won't be absorbed uh because you need bile to mul mify and put these into little my cells and those get taken into your lymphatics in in the form of chylomicrons and so if you're doing that uh with a with without a gallbladder you're just sort of constantly dripping out bile from your liver and so you just sort of need to eat smaller amounts of fat throughout the day and that will sort of catch that bile as it's coming out and before it gets reabsorbed so that's what you do a lot of people actually form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is a an outpouching of the common bile duct and and it basically acts the same as a as a gallbladder and so those people can actually eat just like one meal a day or two meals a day if that's what they're you know the tickles are fancy and and they don't have any problems with diarrhea so if you eat eat like a big steak with a lot of fat on it and you just eat to your body's desire and you just have to you know run to the bathroom after that you're probably not absorbing all that all that fat and so that could be what's going on there and so you just split up you split up those meals you still have the same amount you just sort of have a you know quarter of it now quarter of it in a couple hours quarter of it in a couple hours after that you just sort of split that up throughout the day as to as to toothpaste um I I I sort of go back and forth sometimes I'll use baking soda um that's just sort of you wet the brush and dip it in some baking soda you brush your teeth with that just a bit of an abrasive you could just use a toothbrush a toothbrush is an abrasive but I don't I don't find that that's as good as baking soda I also now that I've been working with stone and spear Tallow um with my friend Asher they make it sort of a tooth powder and um it doesn't doesn't have all the weird you know micro Nano particles and weird you know sort of titanium white sort of stuff that's all and all these other sort of toothpastes as a as a coloring sort of thing uh it's just sort of like a bit of an abrasive and has some like just sort of some of it has like a peppermint sort of flavor so I've been sort of using that too I tend to like things that don't have uh any any scents or flavors or anything like that so um baking soda is actually quite a good option baking soda actually is a bit abrasive so when you're doing that you sort of feel a bit you feel a bit raw in your mouth uh but it actually works really well and um so that's what I tend to use baking soda is great and then there's the these tooth powders and things like that that stone and spear make um that I've been using as well I tend to not use toothpaste just because of all the crap that they put in it not least of which is fluoride which I have no interest in and um and yeah and these these Nano particles that he's getting more and more uh weird information on that you know whether or not they do something bad to you like like why why risk it like who cares you know it's not something you need you know you don't need it so why run the risk that it's you know that it's something that you don't need um or don't want so that's sort of my My Philosophy on that as well you know just avoid this crap you know there's all these well no there's this study and that study and this St who gives a you don't need it you know you don't need it the potential for harm so why mess around you know you know in 50 years we get more robust data and be like yeah no we got long-term data this is totally safe fine you know but like right now we don't have that so you why mess around Laurel rer thank you for the Super Chat no question this week just Penance for falling off waged oh that's sweet of you you don't have to do that thanks for all you do I know uh what I need to do to be healthy and you validated well I'm I'm glad that um that this helps anyway and uh you know one thing that you know falling off the wagon can actually be very beneficial sometimes because it uh it allows you to see what it's like when you don't do this and um it's uh it it's sometimes quite a Stark difference and then you hit this reality like oh my God I just did I did not realize I did not realize how good I felt until right now when I don't feel it anymore and it's just like yep not worth it so that's me people think I'm just so so crazy and I hardcore about no I I experimented I tried this I looked at the difference I was like yeah that sucks I don't want to do that and so you know I did try I did experiment so you know you guys should too and um you know if you don't believe me try it you know you you find out for yourself you find out real quick you know if you if you're if you're off all that stuff if you're just eating meat and drinking and only drinking water for a month or three months or six months and then you just go out and have like a normal meal again you will feel wretched absolutely wretched and um you know and that's a good good piece of information because you're like I did not realize that I did not realize that that stuff makes you feel so horrible and does so you you have that now you have that frame of reference and you know then it's easier to make make uh good decisions in the future so good luck with that uh don't worry about it people fall off the wagon people make mistake to to air as human um you know it's that's it's just it's just part of life but you can you you know we learn from our mistakes right and so you know you have that experience and you're like didn't like that don't want to do that again it really solidifies this you know I wish I had that you know in my early 20s I didn't I didn't see that contrast it was a slow progression for me because I all I did was add in was uh crumbed chicken had a bit of crumbing couple times a week and I didn't notice but over the months it built up and I just went like wow why don't I just feel like a superhero anymore I want to feel like just super super human amazing what the hell happened I didn't see it you know it wasn't it wasn't something I was looking for it wasn't anything anyone told me about and and so I didn't I just didn't notice it and it sort of was a slow creep in and um you know and so I I ended up slipping off of it without realizing it and then I was just like wow I just I don't feel good like why the hell is that and I didn't I didn't see I didn't see the cause and effect to it so now I do and I can help sort of relay that to other people and then they look at that and they go like oh God yeah that that didn't feel good so that's good good information to have and M thank you for the Super Chat uh H 100 Grand that's sweet idrs I don't know where that's from is that I don't know where that's from but anyway thank you very much for that um been carnivore for almost a year now and everything is great except that both my wife and I noticed that our gums bleed a lot when brushing our teeth and it hasn't really improved since uh any thoughts um well you know you can you can try getting you know softer bristles and all those sorts of things depends on what you're brushing your teeth with um is a bit weird if you're eating just meat and you're not eating anything else you're not going to get scurvy uh there is vitamin C and meat and you don't need it for for um collagen production when you're eating meat because you get all this collagen hydroline hydroly uh that you would normally well that you would otherwise use uh vitamin C4 to make yourself when you have to make hydroline hydroly denovo then you know um Indonesia great and um when you have to do um we have to make we have to make that denovo um then you need vitaminc to catalyze that reaction that hydrolyzes Proline and lysine and so you shouldn't need that if you're just eating meat um you know liver has more vitamin C than Apples do so you know if you're you know you add in some liver if you're really worried about it but it's it's not from vitamin C anyway I've checked my vitamin C I should have had scurby I don't you know it's just you know if that was going to happen it would have and um so you know and remember that that carbohydrates do block out the absorption of vitamin C as well so you'll get far less in you do need some but not for scurvy not for not for development of um proper collagen if you're eating properly so I don't I don't know what that is it could be all sorts of things that's not a typical response that people get so do try to see if there's anything else in your system or in your diet if are you eating anything else besides um besides U meat if that's added in if it is take it out um or using anything that's too abrasive for your teeth um and your gums are you having a very stiff bristled brush is that causing damage to your your gums as well all these sorts of things flossing this can cause bleeding gums but generally it toughens up so there there are a lot of different things I don't think it's from the diet if you're only eating meat if you're only eating meat and nothing else and you're not drinking anything else except water it shouldn't be from the diet anyway and um so you want to think about all these other things that could be playing into it um and uh you know throw in some liver if you're worried about vitamin C take some vitamin C it's not that big a deal you don't want to take too much anyway you don't you need 10 milligrams a day to Stave off uh scurvy and that's if you're eating um uh carbs right so you need like nanograms if you're if you're not eating carbs so you know just a tiny little bit you know that makes you feel better makes you feel a bit more comfortable that you're a bit more worried about it fine Inuits don't get scurvy I don't get scurvy and uh you know the Messi don't get scurvy and they drink milk which actually has a lot of carbs so they're getting even less vitamin C in from their diet they don't get scurvy so I don't think it's that anyway um but uh yeah hopefully you can figure out what's going on and and uh Make It Stop uh also I just want to say I saw little El Marie pop up there so hello little elmarie nice to see you thank you for joining Terry thank you so much for the Super Chat Dr C can you you give thoughts about sunscreen uh what do we need protection and do we need protection if going into the Sun for several hours thanks well I think that sunscreen is probably not beneficial for people on a carnivore diet namely because we make our own defenses against the sun because surprise surprise you know we grew up biologically in the sun we're not trog we're not deep sea dwelling creatures that just can't deal with the sun we're supposed to in the Sun what what damages us is we're eating a whole bunch of plants that are very pro-inflammatory it cause a lot of oxidative stress and damage so when we get some sun damage our body can't heal from it appropriately uh also we're eating plant toxins that are cause direct damage when in the sun they they're UV they make a sensitive to UV light um there's a whole class of these called Fano cumerin they're in all citrus parsnips celery these sorts of things and and a lot of other things as well and they will make you like sensitive UV light hits it and it binds irreversibly to proteins and DNA and permanently damag them so you get this on your skin you're squeezing limes and that lime juice and oils get down on your skin uh and you're in the sun you will Scorch your hands you you actually get chemical burns uh my little brother actually did that we had a lime tree when we were kids and uh growing up in California and uh you know a couple citrus trees and yeah actually we had a pretty awesome Garden actually little strawberry patch and kiwi Vines and and um and uh a lot of vegetables limes lemons oranges and uh tangerines and um yeah it was great it was really cool little little Garden in backyard so it um plums all sorts of stuff but um anyway so he went up and he was sort of picking limes and doing all the sort of stuff he came back and just covered in welt and we're like oh my God you know he's allergic to these keep him away from the from the lime tree and then in college I remember I was up visiting him when he was at doing his university and he was like drinking a Corona had a linan I'm like isn't that isn't that gonna kill you he's like yeah I don't know you know maybe that maybe the corona like you know like neutralizes it or something I'm like probably not but all right at least they not dead and um you know so that's what I think may may have happened was that he was actually responding to these frumin he just got light sens got on his skin he just got these you know the sun damage the skin damage and that's something can happen as in the literature it's called phyo photo dermatitis um and called celery dermatitis I spoke with um and I said you people eating celery in the sun and the kids that are chewing on it and they're drooling and those juices go down their face they get just scorched in the sun um celery Pickers I spoke to a celery farmer who said that was like oh yeah no that's that's well known in the industry you have to wear gloves and long sleeve shirts and you really cover yourself up because if you get if you're picking Celler you get that sap on your skin you'll you'll blister and get horribly skin damaged and get very bad uh burns from that like oh my God and you're feeding this to people you know then they're eating it um so that's that's a major thing so if you're not putting in all these these damaging things in your body Sun's fine I just put on Tallow Tallow or emu oil um you know I have a lot of Tallow um Sun sort of things that I have from um Stone and spear because I'm I'm partnered with with them and they make very good products they don't have and I I you know they have a whole bunch of things that don't have any scense or anything like that which is what I want and you know I also just get the Tallow that they have and just use that doesn't even need anything else some them have like Tallow and like a bit of beeswax to give it a bit more form and structure but um or or better consistency but you know it's um uh you can just use normal Tallow and or emu oil and um you know that's uh those are things you can do but yeah Tallow works great tall is the single best moisturizer and um you know it's just the best thing for skin Health that i' I've ever used anyway and um it works absolutely fantastic as far as sunscreen is concerned uh I don't think it's necessar required I personally haven't used sunscreen at all in Australia even oh my God there's no ozone layer there is an ozone layer that that's another myth that came around in the 80s they said there was an ozone layer hole in the ozone layer um over Antarctica and they said o if we don't stop these CFCs in America it's going to make that grow bigger and it could Co you know open up all over Australia well they knew actually at the time that this was seasonal it sort open up for three months and then close and open for three months and then close like that so it's like a liquid it's like a liquid sort of ozone layer sort of moves around it's not just static and why would cfc's in America pop open a hole in Antarctica even if it were static doesn't make any damn sense so you know they they they got their wish they banned these things maybe they are damaging I don't know but you know it's under false pretenses anyway um but that was a that was it it was a press conference oh look this this could go and it could cover open up over Australia and so then became oh there's no ozone layer over Australia that's what that came from there is an ozone layer um maybe it's thinner who knows um who cares you know it's just uh it's if if you're if if you're you know not in in you know you know exposing yourself to these sorts of things then you really don't need it the thing with sunscreen is that they have a lot of things like Benzene that are known carcinogens in the sunscreen that's supposed to be stopping you from getting skin cancer answer uh and yet as um I saw a graph years ago as hours of sun exposure went down over the 20th century skin cancers went up there it's it's inverse it's an inverse graph so the less sun exposure people have the higher when we were having less sun exposure we had higher skin cancers now that's not necessarily related that's correlation it's an inverse correlation it's not necessarily causation but it certainly doesn't show a correlation with sun exposure and skin cancer in fact it shows the opposite so okay is it just completely unrelated or is the sun actually good for you and protecting your skin who knows am I saying that you can't get sun damage and that can't be a bad thing of course not of course you can get sun damage I'm saying that if you are on a carnivore diet you're not eating in this garbage and you're having enough cholesterol you're not eating plant steroids which mimic cholesterol so we don't make enough cholesterol vitamin D is made from cholesterol our hormones are made from cholesterol vitamin D is made on the surface of your skin mostly also in the epithelium and that actually is a natural sunblock as well and so you're making Vitamin D from cholesterol if you if you have enough cholesterol if you're not eating plant stero and then you get vitamin D and it protects you if you're not if you're wearing sunglasses and with UV blocker your brain doesn't see that you're in the sun in the first place you don't make vitamin C you don't make melanin and you burn so if you don't do these stupid things and you don't eat a bunch of stupid plants you know it's a different story it's a completely different game and so um you're just not going to get as damaged like you really have to try to damage your skin uh when you're on a carnivore diet and you're doing it in that way especially if you're putting you know Tallow moisturizer on because it you know helps keep your skin protected and healthy and moist and um sunscreen as well that's something I learned in medical school from our professor of Dermatology she said that um spf15 is basically the max you want to go and that's actually what I I was told by my parents when I was a kid that's what they said that after that it doesn't really do you much good and there's more chemicals and things like that and so that was confirmed by my professor of Dermatology you said that SPF 15 blocks 98.5% of UV raise pretty damn good you go up to U you know SPF 30 it now you're getting 9 9% blockage and you're using three four times the amount of chemicals to do it SPF 50 SPF 70 you're getting 99.3 99.5 99.7 you're using five six seven times the amount of benzene and other horrible uh chemicals um on your skin that soaks into your body you know there another another phrase I heard from a doctor was never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat because within 20 minutes it's G to be in your bloodstream so you know it's interesting probably not everything but you know it's it's it's it's a good thing to keep in mind as well that we do soak in things and absorb things through our skin and so you don't want to do that and um you know so you're you're adding in a whole bunch of chemicals and stuff like that that I I just don't think you need um keep your skin moisturized keep your body protected don't e a bunch of plants that are going to harm you and uh should be fine Aaron thank you for the super uh 50 days in fasting blood sugar was uh 76 milligrams per deciliter wife is 66 neither of us previously diabetic or obese just curious uh what it would be just curious what it would be internet said too low and bad I believe my body more any thoughts no it's not too low um and and you're right you do you do believe your body also you're going to have ketones and so uh there studies very unethical studies done I believe believe in the 50s where they ramped up people's ketones and then dropped their blood sugar and they they kept dropping it lower and lower and lower and just seeing talking to people how they're doing that they're sitting up talking chatting total normal cognition and and able to you know hold the Rapport and they they got it down to the point of their their blood sugar they should have been in a coma really and they're like how you doing yeah fine everything's great why why why do you ask uh no reason no everything's fine that's because they had ketones so your body runs on ketones your brain runs on ketones your brain preferentially runs on ketones 2third of your brain runs preferentially on ketones meaning that if you have enough ketones and enough glucose your brain will those parts of your brain will only run on ketones that's a preference so that's your primary energy the energy your brain's primary energy source it's only when those ketones start going down that you start using more glucose to replace that that lack of energy so no it's not too low um you know below 60 if someone's on a normal diet you start thinking H okay that's probably too low uh on a ketogenic in a ketogenic metabolism when your body is making ketones no just do what do what your body's allowing you to do if you're taking insulin and you're doing medications that are going to artificially disrupt your body's homeostasis of glucose and and ketones and things like that uh uh you know then you know then you have to sort of be a bit more careful about these sorts of things 66 is not too low if she feels fine and is not diabetic or taking insulin and has ketones uh so yeah I agree with you listen to your body over the Internet uh seore athlete I'm assuming carnivore athlete any supplements or extreme for extreme endurance athletes I biked 730 mil last 7even days omad Stak eggs for dinner only first of all badass um no I don't think you need any supplements on top of just just proper nutrition and um and uh you know maybe maybe just you know because you're you're sort of asking a lot of your body you you want to give your body a lot so you know adding in a bit of organs you know liver and kidney and heart just making sure that you are energy that you are nutrient replete doesn't have to be a huge amount just have a little bit in there especially when you're getting ready for for these big events and especially if you're you're doing these things regularly you just want to make sure that your body is has exactly what it needs for what it's doing and you just eat yeah you just eat meat and a lot of fat if you're doing all that sort of energy you want a lot of fat and um yeah steak and eggs for dinner I think that's great you know butter maybe the only supplement I'd add to that uh Dar thank you for the Super Chat um could have just asked but that's okay uh thank you very much TSH 6.43 free T4 1.1 doctor freaked thyroid is is high no iodine then mentioned Hashimoto um I had a cold TSH is usually 1.75 no symptoms is iodine okay well you can certainly check your iodine if you don't have enough iodine then that um uh will absolutely stop you from being able to make um your thyroid hormone like your T4 and then your T3 T3 is the more important one that's the the bioactive form of of thyroid hormones so that's so T4 is sort of a reservoir has a longer half life and it sort of turns into T3 and T3 gets used up more quickly so it gets stored in T4 and turned into T3 as needed that's another thing too if you don't have enough zinc you're not going to be able to convert T4 into T3 appropriately either you don't have any T4 so that's really the issue here um so iodine could absolutely be the issue um if you have Hashimoto those are thyroid antibod and you have you need to get checked for those thyroid antibodies if you've been checked for those and you have that you should not take iodine as a supplement iodine can can exacerbate Hashimoto and so um unless you're like fully deficient but you should be able to get that you know from your food and um you know if you're eating seafood and things like that that will have a decent amount of iodine in it um but even then you know if you're having a lot more iodine than um than you need that can exacerbate Hashimoto and so that can make that flare up make those antibodies go up so you know check your antibodies see if you have them if you don't have any noticeable an antibodies you can have some well and check your iodine too if you have no uh antibodies for Hashimoto and you have um low iodine sure you know it takes some have some more Seafood have some more iodine and uh and see if that helps and um if you have you know High uh antibodies for your Hashimoto you just need to go strict lion diet you need to just do red meat and water um preferably grass-fed and finished red meat and water and um and just cut everything else out and um and unless you are low like low low on iodine um with Hashim Modo then then probably don't need to take that probably shouldn't take that but to get up to normal levels sure but don't go past that because that can make that can exacerbate Hashimoto so yeah I'm very sorry to hear that but um check your iodine check your uh thyroid hormone and um and see how you go and sort of make a make a decision from there you can always message me and ask me and uh let me know what your results are we can try and um look at it a bit more closely as well uh should I do here just see okay I've got about 45 more minutes everyone and I've got a number of Super Chat so why don't we um just sort of try to cut off the super chats now and uh and so I can get to all of these so that I'm not leaving anyone hanging okay uh the real deal says hi Anthony started my geriatric 19-year 9mon um mun cat on a raw meat yes on raw meat yesterday started with some sir steak and 8020 grass-fed beef patties from Costco he loves raw meat awesome well hopefully he does does great manun are monsters those are such Cool Cats um and uh I'm sure I'm sure he'll do really well on the on the raw meat yeah raw meat's the best cats really do need raw meat they do lose torine and other essential nutrients from cooking the meat H that they have to have we don't seem to need those as much but um uh they do they definitely do so they need raw meat so yeah just let them go go to town hopefully hopefully it uh gives him a lot more health and he has uh many many more happy healthy years left in him dark sky thank you for the Super Chat when starting pure carnivore how long should one expect to expect a temporary worsening of autoimmune symptoms to last and when to expect significant relief oh it's it it really just depends I mean most people when they're going on a a cornivore diet with autoimmune issue actually just get better just get better I mean some things with like psoriasis or something like that that seems to some people will have a bit you'll get a bit worse and then they'll get better um some people have a bit stubborn case with psoriasis especially and um and it can it can sort of last for months most of the time it clears up before that but some I've seen some people last months and then one gentleman he had psoriasis that lasted like six months it really wasn't shifting and he started using Tallow moisturizer and cleared it up and so that was that was sort of the missing link for him so if you have any sort of skin conditions or rashes I would I would recommend using Tallow as a moisturizer uh for skin health and um most other autoimmune issues actually do just get better depends on what you eat though if you're having an autoimmune condition you really need to be strict just red meat and water so the lion diet sort of approach that Michaela Peterson talks about for her autoimmune condition where she's just like look I really can't you know she has a pork chop and it just sets her off um really badly and she'll have a bad rheumatoid flare up so um you sort of need to be in that category you know maybe down the road you can sort of open it up a bit to other meats but you know at at first first it's uh best to just do red meat and water and um and reduce stress improve sleep stress and poor sleep can can also exacerbate autoimmunity so um you know get all those sorts of things you need you need to sort of get a holistic approach it's yes diet is I think a number one most important but the other things are nearly as important as well or just as important because there are things that you're doing every single day as well it affects your body and your health and so you know you need to get those things right too um so if you do that and you're just eating red meat and water and you're eating high fat and not taking in anything else you should expect to see autoimmune issues start to get better but skin conditions like chis sometimes they're a bit more stubborn you just have to sort of wait and let them go through and uh use moisturizer uh the uh Tallow moisturizer that seems to help with skin conditions so good luck with that Mary Shepard thank you for the Super Chat newbie Labs uh for reference A1C 5.8 triglycerides uh 135 HDL 62 HDL 129 High sensitiv CRP 4.2 C peptide 399 have a CAC soon uh pre-diabetic Mi um 529 or 2019 Mi so cardal infarction heart attack two stance and a pacemaker vsg n909 um weight loss 100 need 100 more uh further advice or thoughts well first of all congratulations on losing 100 pounds that's that's fantastic um just keep doing it just keep going with what you're doing keep eating fatty meat till it stops tasting good you want to encourage your metabolism you don't want to suppress your metabolism and you want to keep everything else out so don't don't have any d or any other sorts of things that can slow down your weight loss or stall your weight loss or reverse your weight loss um and that would include any artificial sweeteners so um when you're dealing with any sort of you know major health issues you need to just be as strict as possible just mostly red meat and water high fat and then again it's is is important what not is as important what not to eat as what to eat so no plants or mushrooms no sugar or any sweeteners nothing artificial that goes for sauces seasonings and as well so that's that's how to do it the best that you can possibly do it in my opinion in my humble opinion and um and you know if you want to you know make variations on that to suit your your lifestyle or or how you feel go for it but that's just a that's just a framework uh to get started anyway and um but you know otherwise things are looking good you need to look at these as as a snapshot in time all these Bloods are going to be a snapshot in time we don't know if they're going up down sideways and uh and so on so you take these you keep an eye on them that's all fine check them again in three to six months see what you're doing you know you you're going to expect to see your HDL go up your triglyceride is going down LDL is going to do what it wants to do and um if it goes up that is associated with living longer so you know don't worry too much about that um you need to be on top of things too stress sleep taking care of yourself getting outside in the sun getting getting light on your face and in your eyes and on your skin these are all important things um that that um may not be as important as uh you know eating properly but it is absolutely important and so you know you're eating right great now do the other things as well and um then you'll do great so Sarah Nolan thank you for the Super Chat I'm not seeing a anything attached but um maybe further down but I'm not really seeing anything so maybe maybe something later on uh Sam Lloyd thank you so much for the Super Chat I buy the carnivore arguments but there are so many real life counter examples for example many top athletes in the NBA and NFL eat nothing but carbs and junk food please give a rational explanation yeah it's it's pretty simple you know like you can you can do all sorts of crap that doesn't mean it's the best for you it doesn't mean that that's the optimal diet for you you know there was there were you know top marathon runners back in the 80s and 90s who said yeah it doesn't matter what you eat as long as you work out and they drop dead of a heart attack at 40 so you know it's um you know is that is that is it an example of that's exactly the same and it's just as good or is it an example of you know they're working their asses off and they're fantastic athletes and um you know they're able to compete at that level because of all the hard work and natural ability that they have that says nothing about what is optimal for them would they be better on a carnivore debt 100% I have no doubt of that in my mind and why do I say that because I'm seeing top pro athletes go from a standard diet or even a pretty good diet pretty clean diet or plant-based diet and then they go to a carnivore diet and they have massive improvements in their performance in game you have a lot of you know these Game Changer guys who uh got got fooled into that sort of thinking and you know Cam Newton injured himself out that year he was MVP of the league like two years in a row and just absolutely you know just crushing at every single game and then he was his performance was going down his performance and he was getting injured he not recovering from injuries getting worse and worse and he injures himself out on the season and then he's you know had had a difficult time recovering since then I actually don't even know if he ever made an established comeback but that was right when he went plant-based bad idea so you know you can you can eat crap and uh and still perform it doesn't mean that you're performing at your best it doesn't mean that you're per you're doing the best your body can do um it's not just diet diet is a major factor and it can give you a huge Advantage but you know working your ass off and having the right you know mentality to play these sorts of games is the most important you can have a perfect diet and not have that that instinct for the game and that that sort of killer mentality to go and smash somebody and really relish smashing somebody um and uh you know you're not you're not going to be playing the same as other people you know like your desire and drive and your will to go is uh is is much more important than that so um you can you can absolutely SU Ed at a lot of things and a lot of Endeavors eating different ways but that doesn't mean that it's that you will feel the best that you can and that you'll perform the best that you can I've seen the difference in myself eating a very clean diet but with meat carbs and veggies almost no sugar ever but sometimes and hardly ever alcohol U well actually drank usually about once a week or something like that sometimes once or twice a week college and then I decided I'm not going to drink during the rugby season because I just feel so much better there're athletes that drink too they're athletes that do drugs does that mean that that's going to be the best for them of course not if they stop drinking during the season they're gonna they're have way more uh a way better performance and they're got to feel much better too just be really the main thing you can do it you can get away with a lot but you're hurting yourself and you're not going to be able to perform to the level that that you would otherwi watch that's the thing and so it's just a matter of of uh you know people trying that and you know more and more athletes are coming to this and more and more athletes are saying this is completely revolutionized my game and my athletic ability and my and my you know and how much work I've put in you know Ryan Talbot who um who went carnivore and then you know first of all like double nearly doubled his testosterone in a year to the point that Dancy doublea started testing him for for substances and you know came back completely clean and is FSH and LH you know which are the the hormones from your brain that would get suppressed by exogenous testosterone and steroids they're all normal levels they're like oh yeah your body's just making this stuff that's amazing good job and um you know so he he I mean think about that think about that as as already being a top athlete like the guys you're mentioning going to a carnivore diet and doubling your testosterone what's that going to do for your performance right it's GNA it's going to absolutely just it's going to be unfair is what it is but um you know that's the thing and also you know everybody else they competing again is eating this crap they're they're all you know and I mean that's the difference too because people that have you know like a like a celebrity chef and a PT and all these sorts of people that are that are carefully organizing their meal plans and they're this and they're that and all that sort of stuff and there's the ones that sort of eat more laxad desically well why are why is that one able to compete when this one is using all this other stuff it's just about you know just optimizing things and so you know with with Ryan like he said that his game just went crazy and when he got the the balance right on how much he needed to eat he was able to eat enough you know he was losing weight at first and we talked about and say you need you need to find meals that you can stick in at different places and that's not going to be too close to your training that you you end up um slowing down your training and so he was able to do that and then he was saying yeah well now I have a problem I'm putting on too much muscle I'm getting too big I'm too athletic and that's a problem you know and so he want he wanted to keep his weight down a bit so he actually was working out less and getting more that's a good problem to have you know you have all these these athletes that are just desperately trying to put on muscle put on strength and uh and he's having a problem because he's putting on too much muscle right so you know that's that's what this can do for you and that and that's coming from him as a scholarship D1 athlete at Michigan State right so he went from that level of an athlete to All-American that year winning the Big 10 setting a School record in the decathlon that year then the next year you know uh getting second in the Big 10 earning allamerican honors again and earning a spot on the USA team for the PanAm games and coming in and getting bronze right that was this year and now he's been invited to try out for the Olympics amazing that's what that's what switching your diet to something optimal can do it can turn you to a fantastic athlete to an exceptional Elite top tier athlete and so if you're already in that category um you know being in the NFL being in the NBA or something like that and you ratchet up again it's just gonna it's going to turn you into a superhero you know like it does with all of us we all feel like superheroes compared to ourselves and so you know if they're already a top athlete and you Ranch it up from there my God it would just be uh be pretty awesome to watch and we're seeing this now we're seeing this in the Rugby World there's a ton of pro rugby players switching to cornor completely revitalizing their careers and just killing it so you know that's that's what you see is it can you do it sure is it the best thing you can do absolutely not would you get better if you went to carore 100% uh Rob O from X says love this way of eating at 57 that's awes awesome it's changed my life for the better neuropathy is improving no heartburn for over a year improved eyesight no aches and pains no brain fog and energy for Miles that's great Rob that's absolutely awesome that's certainly what uh I've experienced and um what a lot of other people experien as well so that's great uh really good to see that you're doing so well let me see here go uh Daniel Fitz thank you for the Super Chat had menitis three weeks ago and dealing with a persisting headache also have celiac disease started carnivore four days ago and feel great but brutal headaches still persist persist any advice 29 years old well menitis 3 weeks ago it's still very early days so you know that that's a that's a really good reason to have headaches um so that's and hopefully that's cleared but hopefully you know if those if uh you're being closely monitored by your doctor and your medical team because if those headaches are getting worse and worse it could be a recurrence of the menitis or an abscess or something something else that you need you would need help with so if you are getting I'm glad that you've started a carnival di I think that's a really good idea for your health and your immune system um it it can certainly help with headaches but it depends on what's causing the you have an infection and something that's you know irritating the brain it's it's going to be very painful Blood on the brain is extremely painful it's very irritating and um and so is an infection infections even even more irritating so that's that's where that can come from so until that clears and that inflammation subsides you will likely have pretty bad headaches unfortunately the carnivore diet can help reduce the inflammation hopefully you're getting into that now after about 4 days getting a deep ketosis your ketones go up you're getting more of this stuff out of your system but it can take days or weeks to get this crap out of your system and um you know so but it it should keep getting better so hopefully it does um but always remember that if this this headache's really not going anywhere or it's getting worse and you start getting fevers especially you need to go back into the hospital you need to get that checked out so hopefully hopefully you do well menitis is very serious of course as as you know um and hopefully you do well with that and any any issues or any concerns just just go go get it checked out it's not worth it's not worth messing around all right um so what if asking from X um if a human has to take out his pancreas is it advisable to stay on Carnivore um well very few reasons that people have to take out their pancreas so it's not going to be you know too common thankfully um but your pancreas helps with digest any food any and all food you have digestive enzymes coming from your pancreas meat is the most easily and readily digestible food that there is on this planet for humans and so yes if you have difficulty uh processing digesting and absorbing things even more important to do a cornivore diet if you have your pancreas taken out you're going to have to take digestive enzymes anyway things like Creon and other other medications that that replace those things that the pancreas misses and um or is is you're missing out on because your pancreas is not functioning or not uh not there and um so yeah it's still it's still advisable to be on Carnivore it's even more advisable because it's more easy for you to absorb meat than anything else so uh yes absolutely um hopefully uh you're okay and um but you know you have to you're going to have to take digestive enzymes like Creon regardless of what you eat because you can't break down anything um as easily as you can with a meat and you know and and a lot of the stuff you can just absorb but you do need to break some of these things down into into more Amino smaller amino acids and even smaller carbohydrates and lipases break down your fatty acids and all these sorts of things and then you absorb them so you need that anyway and if you're eating plants almost none of that's getting absorbed anyway but you still need the same digestive enzymes and more to break that crap down so uh yes still a good idea to be on Carnivore [Music] um so Stags thank you for the super chat um you say eat till full or food stops tasting good I eat lots of beef and lamb uh to where my uh kilo calorie is around 4,000 plus I've gained uh kgs but always hungry uh having some self-doubt so so it does depend on other factors so if you're on medications if you are um taking any sorts of supplements or anything like that they could offset that then that that can be an issue also it's usually just until food stops tasting good um you don't have to physically fill pack your body but if you get to a point where meat just doesn't really taste very good that's your body telling you to stop you can overeat you can eat more than your body wants but it's it's difficult because it it it becomes unpleasant to do that if you are taking medications though that can cause you to increase your your uh hunger um a lot of psychiatric medicines will do this a lot of um um pain medications also active psychiatric medications can do this as well and uh obviously cortical steroids like prazone cortisol hydrocortisone those things will absolutely raise your your hunger signals the other side of it is that depending on where you're starting from your hormones can be completely out of balance people get what's called leptin is a is a hormone that is a satii hormone released from your fat cells goes to your brain tells you how much energy you have and Insulin blocks that so we're eating a whole bunch of carbs our whole life and that sort of blocks leptin blocks leptin lectins those plant toxins all plants some of them can bind to insulin receptors five times more tightly than insulin and they also bind to leptin and all the other things that insulin uh is involved in so it shuts down a lot of processes in your body when you eat these lectins or when you eat carbohydrates and your and your insulin goes up one of those things is leptin which is your satiety hormone um and so you can block that out you can get leptin resistance and uh then you don't actually know when you're satisfied when you're satiated and so you could potentially overeat even even though you're listening to your body but the thing is is that if you don't check that you don't know um and your body's still telling you to sort of eat and um eventually that leptin will come down it doesn't actually take all that time long but it can take months uh depending on how high it is and how how strict you're being and so that can take some time there are people that do put on weight uh Kelly Hogan is a classic example of this she's done a a video with um Charles Washington who's been like a 20y year carnivore and um you know they talk about this sort of thing but she she put on weight but her health was improving she was improving she was talking to all these long-term carnivores who' done this and seen all this stuff before and they were saying look don't worry about your weight don't don't measure just you know eat what's right for your body let your body heal there's a lot of hormones and things that your body needs to deal with and if your body needs a bit more then it needs a bit more you can also try eating a bit more nutrient-dense food which is like things like the organs adding a bit of those in because your body is chasing nutrients it's not chasing calories and if it if it will bring in more calories to get those nutrients as well because it needs them so if you're eating sort of less nutrient dense foods and meats it could be that your body's telling you to eat a lot more because of that add in a bit of organs Li liver kidney and heart and more red meats especially more fat as well um that can help and so um you know beef and lamb Lamb's great but there are lean parts of lamb leg of lamb uh there's a lot of lean beef so try to get fattier cuts and and try to get some more um nutrient Den Parts like like the organs and just be patient your body's healing there's a lot of things going on if you're on any of these medications or any supplements or anything like that then yeah you may need to limit what you're eating because you you won't be able listen to your body if you're eating dairy stop immediately because that can that can also make you eat more than your body actually wants and um artificial sweeteners as well so anything anything Stevia monk fruit sugar you know xylol sorbitol any of those things just get rid of them so just whole meat lot of fat plenty of water nothing else bit of salt to taste your body will heal it'll get better if you're curious about it you can always check your leptin and if that's elevated you know you have lein resistance and it's going to it's just going to be a bit more stubborn for you and um you know but it'll happen that will come down uh with any ketogenic diet especially carnivore diet because you get rid of the lectins on a KET on a carnivore diet uh as well which you don't necessarily do on a on a just a ketogenic diet that still includes vegetables so yeah that's that's another thing um and this might be a good rant to uh to sort of take out and clip out um and eded into its own thing but you I've been thinking about this you know people say like well there's no there's no um you know people say well there's no high level evidence to show that a carnivore Diet Works well first of all there's a lot of very good evidence such as your anthropological evidence of fossil record biology physiology um and Anatomy that actually shows yeah well we actually are carnivores and that that is what we're supposed to eat however there are tons of high level studies that show that a whole food animal-based diet that is high in animal fat is one of the most efficacious and beneficial diets that has ever been studied the ketogenic diet is the most robustly studied diet on Earth in history is the only study that has the multitude of randomized control trials Interventional trials looking at specific Health outcomes and markers to show benefit or harm and it shows benefit and it's gone head-to-head with the DASH diet and you know beat that soundly and and shown again and again and again to be very very healthy now there are fraudulent studies where they look at oh well we look at low carb diets and low carb is not no carb and also we okay what do you look at as low carb they're like eating the same amount of carbs as as the other group so it's like yeah you really didn't actually control for carbs you didn't actually reduce any carbs EA like 100 gram of carbs what the hell is that about you know that's not the same thing so they're using the name and they're casting aspersions but it's inaccurate so zero carbohydrate diet those have been shown to be extremely beneficial extremely healthy and while a ketogenic diet just means that you're not eating carbohydrates sugar alcohol and you're going to be in a ketogenic metabolism you're going to be producing ketones you're going to be making your own blood sugar and glycogen well what do they do that with you could technically do that with a vegetarian diet with a plant-based diet it'd be almost next to Impossible though to getting all the energy required from uh plant fats and things like that uh you could do it uh you'd be extremely nutritionally deficient so you have to supplement copiously um and but at the end of the day that's not what those studies did those studies did not look at vegetarian plant-based ketogenic diets they looked at animal-based diets they looked at the carnivore diet with salad so the most robustly studied diet on Earth the one that has been shown to be most effective most healthy is a whole food animal-based diet with some veggies and no carbs so carnivore diet with a salad that's the most rigorously studied diet on Earth so the next time somebody tells you says oh there's no there's no highle studies on carnivore [Music]  you know all the best studies all the highest levels of evidence are on a carnivore diet with a salad that's what it that's what it shows so these are the same people that say oh meat's bad for you well no it's not because these studies look at animal-based diets with high animal fat and they all show benefit when done actually in a ketogenic fashion and and um and not you know these these these uh you know these these intentionally false studies so that's what they show so whole food animal-based diets have been shown to be the best diets on Earth they're not damaging to your health they're beneficial to your health and so the next time someone says well there's no high level evidence showing that that meat and carnivore di are good for you you call on that we need to reframe this argument we need to point this out to people that the ketogenic diet that has been studied is an animal-based ketogenic diet carnivore light it's Carnival diet is a ketogenic diet so the only difference between these things is just the amount of veggies they eat but the meat is the consistency there right so you know you're eating a carnivore diet carnivore light so carnivore with a bit of veggies and things like that we need to reframe this so we need to start you know showing that no an animal-based diet is the best diet it's the most rigorously studied diet plant-based diets they don't have any rigor to them they have no highle studies showing that they're better it's only EP epidemiology these surveys they say oh once a year they say hey what did you eat last year like the nurses study it's nonsense they do that specifically so they can manipulate the data and say whatever the hell they want they call meat pizza and fast food just any fast food so you you buy a large fries fast food y That's meat no it damn well isn't and you know the drink and all that sort of stuff I mean this is this is just nonsense these are people trying to uh manipulate people for their own gain and benefit either ideologically or financially and uh and it's not the case so they don't do highle studies you have Dr Gardner from from Stanford saying oh it wouldn't be ethical to do a carnivore versus vegan diet oh because I mean you don't even get all these essential nutrients like fiber oh my God how can you get fiber you don't break down fiber you don't get any nutrition from fiber so it's not a nutrient in the first place if it's not a nutrient then it can't be an essential nutrient this is a simple definition in terms so this is this is him trying to escape the in EV itability of of his ideology being shown to be completely backwards and wrong um where's the B12 in a and a vegan diet I mean how oh it doesn't even have oh it doesn't even have fiber your diet doesn't even have B12 or DHA or EPA or retinol or D3 or K2 or thousands of other micronutrients that haven't even been named yet that only exist in meat and don't exist in plants so that's a a copout you know they they know exactly what that would show and that's why they don't do robust studies with plant-based eyes they don't do experimental data they don't look at fasting and they say oh you get these benefits from fasting do you get the same benefits from eating a plant-based St no no you don't um and so you know they're not doing those studies because you know they they don't want to see the results they want to put out weak studies epidemiology surveys that dat they can manipulate so can push their own agenda and their own bank accounts and uh so we need to start reframing this we need to start talking about how the most the most rigorously studied diet on Earth is an animal-based diet is a meat and high a high fat meat-based diet high animal fat High saturated fat diet that's the diet that has been most rigorously study there are thousands of high level studies on ketogenic diets that show significant Improvement and benefits to health and specific medical outcomes not just looking at correlations saying oh hey we sort of see this and we can sort of extrapolate whatever no we're doing an experiment saying hey this is the health outcome we're looking for let's see what happens right that's high level data that's good experimental data and the most rigorously studied diet on Earth is the animal-based diet the meat high fat meat based ketogenic diet with a side salad carnivore light that's what it is and when we do carnivore full I think we'll find even more uh more benefits when you get rid of all of that sort of stuff as well but we'll we'll see but at least now the best diet on Earth is an animal-based diet a high fat animal-based diet so that's something that we need to reframe and when you start going into this um when you go into this uh these arguments and discussions with people you make that note we get that arguments out there and we have to shut down uh that sort of side of things where they say oh we don't have any high level yes we do there are thousands in fact it's the only diet that has these high level studies the plant-based diet does not and there's a reason for that because they damn well know that it's  tal Asmat says I'm 20 years old uh can I get a any height benefits if I do cornivore now depends potentially yeah there are people in the early 20s there's a soccer player in in um the Netherlands or something like that I always forget this kid's name um but he was like in his early 20s he's like a Premiership soccer player and uh and he went on a carnivore diet and started doing all like the biohacking things wearing the blue blocking sunglasses getting light and grounding and doing all these sorts of things dude grew like three or 4 inches or something like that in his early 20s so it was pretty cool um and now like the number eight striker in Europe which is which is great you know so uh yeah you you can it just depends on if your growth plates are close so people's growth plates close at different times and but quite often people's growth plates are still open at 20 but it just depends on if yours are if they're still open then yes you can grow taller if they're already closed then they're already closed but uh yeah fingers crossed hopefully hope you can still uh get more out of that uh Roger Ram uh J Shankar thank you so much for the very generous Super Chat it's really kind of you greetings from India greetings so one does a two-month-old calf have enough nutrition as uh beef um probably not as much you know when when a cow is eating eating grass and um you know as it it gets older it's going to be able to accumulate more and more nutrients and get get more uh nutrient density and I certainly noticed this and now now this is all opinion like I don't have I don't I don't know of anyone who sort of tested you know uh calf ve uh young steer older steer and then older cow but uh just going by taste massive difference in taste much stronger beef flavor in older cows and when you're tasting these things you're tasting nutrients that's that's what that is so uh I would expect so yes that as as the cow gets older they store more nutrients but it would be interesting to see if if someone you know were to send off um beef from from different stages in life and see what that is I would expect that to be the case though uh two we don't get grass-fed meat if it's about um okay we don't get grass-fed meat if it's about low omega-3 can we take sardines uh for adding omega-3 if it's not about omega-3 why do you insist grass-fed beef thank you well you you don't have to do grass-fed beef I don't I don't certainly don't insist on it um it's whatever you can afford that you have access to makes you feel good that's it if you don't have access to grassfed fed beef then then that's totally fine you just eat the meat that's available to you makes you feel good that you can afford and um there is a difference there is an objective difference when you do see or generally raised grass-fed finish ranchers send off their their beef to get check checked out and see what their nutrient levels are uh they're higher they're they're generally some of I've seen two different ones the send off independently compared to the USDA standard and it was like four or five times as many um micronutrients so you know that's objectively uh better right so the Omega-3s can be a difference as well and so yes that is that is something that you should keep in mind it depends on how how long and how intensively cows are put in a feed lot there are feed lots that do like 40% uh grain 60% grain and the rest of it on hay and other sorts of feed as well um that's more nutritious to the cow and that's going to be a different nutrient complement and omega-3 complement than if it's like 90% 95% grain we're really intensely trying to fatten these suckers up if it's in this this high-intensity feed lot um According to some uh some studies you can lose out most of your Omega-3s after about 3 months of high intense feed lot feeding for a cow so you know you need those Omega-3s you want those Omega-3s especially for kids growing brains everything like that omega-3 such as DHA EPA that's that's what you want and 20% of your brain is made out of DHA so if a kid's brain is growing needs DHA so yeah things like sardines to supplement in with that probably a good idea um and um and otherwise just the the grass-fed is just going to have be higher in nutrients less of the other stuff because it's you know cows are really good at filtering out crap that they're not supposed to eat either but it's not necessarily perfect so that's sort of the idea you're getting a cleaner product it's better quality it has higher nutrients they they can have less fat but they have more cutaneous subcutaneous fat it's just no marbling and so what you want to do is you want to if you're if you're getting this from your Butcher say I want all the fat I want all the fat that comes with this I don't want you to trim anything off if you're buying a whole cow you have to tell them don't trim off any fat or any fat that you do trim off throw it in the in the uh ground beef you know um you want all that fat and um and uh yeah and then then you'll get get more of that otherwise it is quite lean oh there we go Michelle C thank you for the Super Chat hey Dr C any advice on allergies and um in the in the pasted used local honeybee pollen um trying to avoid meds I sound like a frog right now plants really are trying to kill me help um that's a good question you I me you can still get allergies on these um you know on on any diet quite often people improve they're they they feel better and have less Aller allergic sort of reactions but you're still going to get allergic reactions to things um unfortunately I don't know of any any tricks apart from just eating meat that's going to help you you know there's still a role for medication and antihistamines you know if you're really having a if you're really struggling might be might be worth trying for the short term um allergy shots you know I think I still think there's a role for traditional medicine in a lot of these things and and sometimes allergy shots can certainly help uh reduce your your um your negative experience with these with these allergens so uh maybe maybe give give that a shot and maybe for now try an antihist little Ellie Melly thank you for the super chat um says grateful for you well grateful for you too sweetie it's very nice to see you and and uh thank you for joining Patrick coat thank you very much for the Super Chat been doing beef butter baking eggs since January 1st and feel great however I just got Gout is that a sign I need to stop or any suggestions um no not necessarily you know some people do get gout or still have have gout and then um I've spoken to people who who had this experience they sort of they'll get like a flare up or two afterwards and if they just get through it it goes away and it stays away gout has been treated with a red meat and water diet since the 1800s with Dr Sals he wrote about this and he was curing people with gout by putting them on a red meat and water diet you know if you're eating organs you have more purines that can be uh something that that can lift up your uric acid levels but there's there's a there not really a great correlation between uric acid serum levels and uric acid in your joints which would be gout there's also other kinds of gout there's really five kinds of gout now gouts being called uric acid crystals in your joints and the other four are being called pseudo gout one of those pseudo gouts is oxalates um and so oxalates can get in your joints cause joint problems so we don't necessarily know what kind of gal you have there's there's at least five different kinds you need to get a needle in your joint and you express that out and you see is it uric acid is it oxalates is it something else and that's how you'd know no one does that uh they just sort of say oh that's gout syc acid goodness stop it um it may not be could actually be something else could be that you're you know oxalate dumping and having these sorts of problems and you're getting flare ups that way um you you could try cutting out everything except beef you know that's what that's what Dr Salsbury was doing in the 1800s and that's what he said work the best was just beef and um and you you'd get through it and it would go away so so um I would give that a try I'd clean up everything else and I would also think about the fact that it may not be uric acid crystals that are in your joints could be one of these other four causes as well but either way whatever the cause it should go away it should clear up and there are some people that have a couple flareups and then uh and then nothing after that so that's the usual pattern uh when people suffer from gout even going into a carnivore diet is that they may get another flare or too some don't some don't get anything um some get another flare or two and then it goes away that tends to be the pattern that we see Albino Rhino uh thank you for the Super Chat my father has a condition called thrombocytosis is this something that could be helped or cured by the carnivore dieet thank you for the help well it really just depends on what's causing the thrombocytosis and it could potentially affect that underlying cause but it it um yeah it really just depends depends on what's causing it a lot of these things um get a lot of weird things get affected in very positive Ways by going on a carnivore diet because we don't even realize how many underlying mechanisms are are getting screwed with by eating these different plant toxins and other sorts of things that are just screwing with our body our insulin is going up and that's completely deranging all these things that insulin affects so it's a lot of it's a lot of um uh well there's a there a lot of things that this clears up let's say when you when you go on a carnivore die and you clear you clear out all these other sorts of things so you never know there's a lot of things that this this affects and some people affects things in a very different way so definitely worth trying it's going to help your father in a thousand other ways and it could very well help that I have no idea though because we don't know what's causing it and unless we know what's causing it then we don't know if it's going to be able to help but certainly worth trying it's not going to hurt him uh it will make him better in a lot of other ways as well so um I think it's worth a try and then see what happens and and let us know Amber thank you for the Super Chat you mentioned Tallow and emu oil as moisturizers any thought on casor and Rose hiip oils plants so I don't know how how good or bad they may be but um I just tend to avoid them anyway just because they may come with other sorts of things of plant sterols and other sorts of um inflammatory factors that you know can can get on your skin and soak into your body I don't know um if they they are particularly bad or worse than other sorts of things but you know all things being equal it's easy enough to get some Tallow or emu oil and um ghee you could even use ghee if you wanted um I'd stick with Tallow but um but you can do any of those sorts of things I don't I I just avoid plants in general um castor oil doesn't have riceing in it but it does come from from a plant the castor bean that the the the skin around the be itself does have ryen in it it's a lectin it's the single most toxic substance on Earth that we know about one milligram per kilogram will kill you or any other animal it is highly toxic and we press this stuff out of a cter caster bean what the hell else is in there that we don't want we definitely know we don't want the rice in what the hell else is in there that's protecting that seed that's what a that's what a bean is it's a seed and so could be other things on there as well that you you don't really want so I just I just tend to avoid those things on principle and since Talon em oil works so well you know don't need don't need to look for a replacement just yet anyway D thank you for the Super Chat that's very nice of you and and they just say thank you Dr chaffy well you're very welcome and thank you very much for coming on thank you for supporting and um yeah hopefully hopefully this is uh something that you guys enjoy and and uh want to see more of and you know just keep keep going on and thank you every from one from YouTube and um uh YouTube and x and Facebook so everyone's joining in from from three different areas right now so we've got quite a lot of people we got about 1,700 people I know about 600 or so on um oh nearly 700 on YouTube and then the restaurant X and Facebook so that's really awesome so thank you all for joining on all the different platforms and uh hopefully you guys guys get something out of it Steve thank you for the Super Chat hey Doc looking for some comparison info on whole milk and lactose free milk free whole milk is lactase any better than lactose so so the so yeah so the thing is is that is that people that don't make lactase then they can't they can't break down lactase into glucose and galactose so those are the two constituent uh carbohydrates that make up lactose uh and then you absorb the glucose and lactose uh you can't absorb lactose directly you have to break that break that Bond so it's a disaccharide it's two sugar molecules connected with a bond lactase sever that Bond if you don't have that if you don't make that then you can't absorb it can't break it down goes into your colon bacteria eat it they make a bunch of methane and gas and things like that and you get bloated and diarrhea and you don't feel great um and so that that's where comes from so in in lactose free it's not sugar free it's not carbohydrate free it's just they add lactase in it and so they add that enzyme in it to break down those carbohydrates so now it's just glucose and galactose that's it so it's the same amount of carbs it's the same amount of sugar you absorb exactly the same amount it's just for people that don't make lactase themselves they they have the pre-digested so they can they can drink that that's really the only difference um Roger ROM Jane Shankar thank you very much again for the another very very generous Super Chat um diagnosed with solar orticaria can I formulate my own electrolyte from potassium citrate and magnesium chloride um should I avoid citrate for solar ertic carrier FYI best brand of SPF 70 sunscreen doesn't work as I get solar ticara triggered even after its application well look you know I mean like I was saying earlier with SPF SPF 70 doesn't doesn't block much more than spf15 spf15 is 98.5 SPF 70 is probably around 99.5% of UV light blocks you're getting one extra percent so you know if 15's not doing it you know 70 is probably not going to do it 90 is probably not going to do it so um also you have to wonder is it um is it something in the the sunscreen that's actually damaging your skin as well there a lot of weird nasty chemicals in there they're not good for for you they're blocking the Sun that doesn't mean that they're super good this is great for skin Health they don't say that they say this blocks UV light and if that's your priority then then that's a good product for you SPF 15 or lower but if your if your priority is skin health and overall health probably not because there thing I mean Benzene is in this stuff you know they I think they had to take out a whole bunch of these chemicals but how long were they in there for how many decades were they in there for you know there are people now there are doctors um now that are actually thinking seriously about uh about whether or not the sunblock the sunscreen that we've been using for decades is actually the cause of the rise in uh skin cancer because it it's going up it wet up and it's going up and we're in the sun last and we're using more sun block so how the hell is it the sun's fault that we're getting skin cancer it's it's not the is the short answer and so that so solar ertic area could be you know improper diet or or not enough of a proper diet and not enough you know um lack of other things and um you know and you can put these other things on your skin that can be harmful as well so eating a carnivore diet high fat put Tallow or you know other sort of animal fats on your skin and I think you're going to do well and U I wouldn't I wouldn't use anything with SPF or or all that sort of stuff or any of those sort of things because they just have a lot of random chemicals in it you don't necessarily want you know that's that's up for it's a decision for everyone to make on their own but I certainly don't think that it's useful for me um or my kids uh or family members and things like that I mean I don't have direct kids but my you know step kids like El's kids you know I don't I don't think it's a good idea I don't think it's a good idea at all so um as as for the electrolyte formula with potassium citrate and magnesium chloride uh I don't know if the if the citrate versions affect solar car unfortunately I'm um you know I'm not a dermatologist so it's not something that I I treat all that often and I don't know the connection between um potassium citrate uh and solar R carry unfortunately I haven't heard of any problems anyway I haven't heard of any any issues with those electrolytes worsening solar tic carrier being associated with it uh but at the same time I you know I'm not in that field so the the the limited stuff I know about Dermatology comes mostly from uh different sort of plant toxins that affect and damage your skin and and then little little other sorts of things there's basic physiology sort of things to do with vitamin D and sun exposure and all that other sorts of stuff but uh unfortunately I don't I don't know that but um I don't know of anything anyway but if you if you know dermat or something like that you can always ask them if you have solar ticaria presumably you're you're seeing someone for that and probably good ask question to ask them so good luck with that uh nazad thank you for the Super Chat looks like there's another one down here thank you for the super chat again uh Nan asks what is your opinion on adding fermented vegetables some say gut diversity is beneficial you know if we were talking about our our friend earlier in the in the session where they were on antibiotics for 30 days probably need some some help re restocking your gut bacteria I think you can do that just fine with fermented dairy like yogurt and life Culture Yogurt with low carbs low to no carbs hopefully and um but you put that on meat you chew it up together in the same bite you swallow it together if you have an issue with dairy and you can't you can't really tolerate it I think fermented veget is uh is a you know you know is is an option that's available to you not because it's vegetables but because of the the bacteria that's in that and so you can use that as a supplement for the for the bacteria you could do that it's going to be an isolated incidence though I don't think you just I don't think just you just normally need to do this um you know we do see this people going from standard diets or ketogenic diets and they switch to carnivore diet and they check their microbiome before and then 3 to six months after they get massive improvements in their microbiome when they just go to carnivore so your your microbiome will change and adjust depending on what you eat and so we see in the and it does this actually quite quickly because the the replication rate of bacteria is about once every 20 minutes so they double every 20 minutes so there a generation every 20 minutes right so just in this conversation that we've been having today you know me this one-sided conversation me you know listening to me Yammer on um it's been you know it's been 120 minutes and so you know we've had you know six generations of um of uh of bacteria in our gut right then right so you know they're fighting for resources they're living they're dying they're doing all that sort of stuff so it's very quick very quick turnover and so depending on what you eat that day or the next day and the next day you're going to affect that and you're going to send down different of things down to your gut and your gut bacteria are going to are going to be promoted or or discouraged depending on those resources that are available the Inuit when they're eating just a natural diet they've had very very beneficial and very healthy microbiomes when they're when they've been studied and uh and that's what we can expect when we're eating a carnivore diet so if you are you have very bad disbiosis or you're having long-term antibiotics that really destroyed your your microbiome um sure you have some fermented um foods but I would start with the fermented animal foods and you know keep it you know keep it in house and uh and try that but then again you're only doing this for for a week or two and then you should have an established microbiome and then it's just going to be perpetuated because of the things that you're eating I don't think you need to keep doing this for the rest of your life anyway so even if you did decide that for fermented vegetables was the right thing for you you don't need to do this more than a couple weeks Max and then because of what you're eating you're going to perpetuate and support the correct bacteria that you want you're not the fermented vegetables may not have all the correct ve bacteria you want going to have some you want some you don't want but the food that you're eating the animal food the meat that you're eating that's going to support the ones that you want that's not going to support the ones that you don't want so that's what you do so if you really if you really do feel that that's the right thing to do for you and fermented dairy doesn't work and you've had long-term antibiotics all these sorts of things and you're having trouble you know sure that's a that is an option but again it's like a medicine you don't take antibiotics unless you have to you don't take you know biological agents if you don't have to you don't take chemo if you don't have to you don't take blood pressure medication if you don't have to and um and so you don't so use these as a medicine that's a medicine use it in specific circumstances to get a specific effect and then you stop there's a course to your medical treatment and then you stop and that's how I would approach that with this as well okay so uh we come to the end of of the super chats thank you everyone for that I think that was pretty good timing um and um able to finish roughly on time and um I've got to go run to work so thank you thank you all very much I really appreciate it um do come uh and check out the regenerate Conference next month
