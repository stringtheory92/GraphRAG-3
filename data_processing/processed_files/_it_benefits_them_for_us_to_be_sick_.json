        "body": "ss both mentally and physically B XO thank you for the ss both mentally and physically B XO thank you for the Super Chat our big Pharma and Medicine intentionally doing this to the population to make them easier to control Greek and Egyptian texts said give slaves GR yeah hard to say but it is it is pretty reminiscent of all these things like the Greeks and Egyptians and you know Romans had you know they gave their slaves and their Gladiators is the the argument of the game changers oh the Gladiators ate a lot of grain yeah because they were slaves and they were fat and they actually ate grains they were called The Grain eaters in fact I learned that uh in in in my Classics uh studies in college uh they were called grain eaters and that was because they wanted to get fat they wanted to get put on extra fat because that like armor right because if you're very lean and Slim Right 2in cut in 2in stab in three inches and hit a major organ major vessel you're done uh you've got five six inches of fat on you that's protection you get a two inch three inch stab yeah it'll bleed but you're not hitting any major organs or vessels right so it's protection it's body armor right um You can make an argument Maybe you're fat and sick and and not moving as fast as you would and you have a bigger Target to hit could be but you know we do know this with like cats you know like I have I have a hairless cat can't let them outside because they'll just get their asses handed to them by other cats who have a big old mat of fur that's that's protection to them they don't have that protection you know so you go after a cat you just biting fluff you know doesn't help you whereas if you're seeing the skin you know exactly where to bite to get a chunk out of someone right and you don't have any any little defenses so that was the same with with the Gladiators but you know different different um Imperial Powers have subjugated and kept people in check the surf class the peasant class the plebians kep them in check by giving them a bunch of grains and cutting off the meat Supply that that that's a tactic old as time and or as old as civilization anyway and I don't know I don't know the intentions of big farmer and big and big medicine I I do know that most doctors certainly don't prescribe to that and I would have no idea that that's even something that is is in the possibilities um but I do think that they're trying to profit and their profit model is is uh is such that it benefits them for us to be sick perpetually so that they can sell us chronic treatments okay so there's a Goldman Sachs uh Mo that went out or or you know meeting that they that they talked about and it just said you know is curing disease a viable business model you know should we be curing these or should we be looking at treatments for chronic conditions that will never go away so we spend a billion dollars developing a drug and this is something that people have to take for 40 years 50 years 60 years and and a large population so looking at it like an isolate actually curing something that goes away you you can only treat them once this you treat them for 40 years right and so that's what they're going to dedicate their money and resources too right they're not going to try to cure something they're going to try to treat something and they're going to look at things that are prevalent throughout the population that have a you know high impact and is something that is a chronic condition it's not like antibiotics I mean there hasn't been a new antibiotics I think in 30 years something like that uh more than that it's um yeah God knows I mean they they just they just don't or a new class of them anyway I mean there it's it's been a long time since people have looked into actually treating infectious disease right even though we've got super bugs uh coming up out all over the place that's not what people are looking at they're looking at diabetes and heart disease and blood pressure and and cholesterol and saying hey how can how can I give this someone pill you give them a course of antibiotics that's done in in a week or two right but this person needs a Statin forever right and that's what they say you know if you if you um uh if you if you listen to some of these people the age and the and the threshold for when you start on blood pressure medication or when you start on statins is getting lower and lower and lower and lower and this is of course to sell more products because you can sell it to more people and you know they're saying anyone over 50 just because of your age you should be on a Statin and now they're saying it over over 40 and now people were saying well basically you should just be on a Statin for your whole life you should just never let this stuff build up that is insane your body is cholesterol your brain is cholesterol and some of these things cross into the bloodb brain barrier and stop your brain from making cholesterol which is about 20% of the physical structure of matter in your brain and the axon myelination is partly cholesterol it's like I don't know 50% cholesterol something like that it's it's high levels of cholesterol and your brain makes cholesterol these drugs can stop your brain from making cholesterol and now you don't have the physical building blocks and structures to build your brain you give that to a kid whose brain is developing you are going to prevent proper development that is sick that is absolutely I mean that's that's going going to Alis huxley's Brave New World where they're they're intentionally dumbing down certain po uh members of the population in order to have them do these menial jobs that the alphas don't want to do and make it and make it easier for them to just you know have a hedonistic life and and not work too hard um that's God knows who's intentionally doing what but that's going to be the result you are going to you're going to seriously damage and affect the intellect and and mental development of of uh kids and adolescen and and adults because that's you're constantly remodeling your brain you still need cholesterol as an adult as a late adult you need cholesterol there are case reports of people getting dementia from these different statins that cross a blood brain barrier right that's not okay so I don't know if that's their intention I I I do know their intention is to make money and I and they have already figured out that you don't want to cure disease I mean Chris Rock called this in the '90s you know one of his uh one of his big tours um I used to listen to it with my buddy Jonathan going to to France with we listen to it all the time it's hilarious and and and we thought it was a joke but he was bang on said they don't want to cure diseases they want to treat diseases so you can treat them your whole life you know they're still pissed off they cured polio right you know everyone laughs but like that's exactly what they're saying they're saying we don't want to treat it that's not a viable business model we want we don't want to cure it we want to treat it for a prolonged period of time that's what's happening so that's their business model now it could be that they're nefarious and could be some like the the the pharmaceutical executive I believe it was c means but it could have been someone else who sort of said there's a there was a a conversation with a pharmaceutical executive and they said and and he asked do you know what my favorite drug is that that our company produces and they go oh you know what's that something that cures cancer and helps children or something like that no my favorite medication that we make are medications that cause side effects that we have medications that treat those are my favorite because we sell more product right you get down these prescription Cascades you have these bad side effects you get medications for that side effects that causes other side effects you get medications for that side effect right and and you hear this you're not supposed to go down that route as a doctor you're supposed to I mean that was taught to us early on in medical schools like don't go down that you know don't go down this prescribing Cascade address the first one say okay what can we change here to make it so you don't have that problem in the first place hey buddy and um and I talked to people and they're like hey I was taking this drug or whatever and it made me feel very sick and so I stopped taking it um like a Statin um in particular I was talking to someone the other day about that and their doctor said oh but we could have I could have just given you something for that I could have given you something for like damn it no so there are people there there have that's their business model they want to sell you drugs they want to sell you drugs for as long as possible they and and and you know people have always wanted to be in power they've always wanted to be oligarchs they've always wanted to be the aristocracy they've all and what does that mean that means other people have to be the Surfs they have to be the plebians that means you me we are the plebians we are the masses we are the Surfs you read uh um um friedrick kak's book The Road to surom you will see all of this he calls this he said 20 years before you get the totalitarian regime where people are now surfs again they're now uh you know they're now U beholding you know slaves bound to the land um you know you get certain things that happen and and they're predictable and so you we are seeing this stuff in full force at the moment so um you never know I mean the people with the WF they are almost certainly doing this this stuff intentionally they they've basically almost said that in a lot of in a lot of ways you know like we need to make people allergic to meet so that we can force them to do what we want I mean the these are these are Hitlers these are the next these are the ne this generation's Hitler that's exactly what they are this is what Hitler did right uh some of the things that Hitler did and it started here and it ended in genocide so you know how about let's not you know how about let's stop before we get to the genocide part that would be my vote hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want a nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys"
