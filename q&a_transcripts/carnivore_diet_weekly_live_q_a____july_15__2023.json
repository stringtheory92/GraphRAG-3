with everybody it's really good that everybody because I know everybody has busy schedules and busy lives and we're all over the world you know some of us are in different countries but it's good when we can get together and talk carnivore and try to encourage each other oh I guess I'll pass it what about you Dr chafee how you doing tonight yeah well no I'm good good thanks guys and thanks for um yeah like you say trying to coordinate everything so everyone and can meet up this is great hmm absolutely always have sorry always have fun yeah so we got our first question from Ahmed he's asking I am tired of the carb crash but I am a gym rat can I still bulk up with only a carnivore diet of course being in a caloric Surplus um so uh Dr chafee as uh as someone uh someone who um you I guess you go to the gym um can you bulk up with just carnivore yeah I've I've never I've never found any other way of putting on lean muscle mass easier now you can put on you can put on fat and you can clog up your your muscles with your water and glycogen and intramuscular fats called myostatosis uh which you know some people who haven't heard of that before I think oh that's not that's a that's a myth or something like that but that's exactly what happens when you carbohydrates you store fat and glycogen in your muscles and other tissue this is how we get marbling on cows and other animals by giving them carbohydrates grains and things like that so we see this as doctors we see this on Imaging all the time it's called myosteatosis myo muscles steatosis being a fat infiltrating right and so that's sort of where that that big bulky plump comes from bodybuilders on the on their building phase when they're putting on a whole bunch of weight and they put on fat and they put on muscle as well and then they cut down and they just lose tons and tons and tons of that and like oh well you have to lose some muscle to lose the fat as well no you don't actually you don't have to lose any muscle at all what you're losing is fat and glycogen so this is the easiest way of just putting on lean muscle mass and so all the weight that you put on is yours to keep that doesn't doesn't go away afterwards because it's not just it's not just temporary bulk and it's not just there for appearance it's actual muscle and so yes the thing is you just need to eat enough so the thing is that people say like well if you eat if you eat a lot of carbohydrates then that will force in extra calories that's not what you need you need just meat and fat right and so if you're working out you will stimulate your body to grow and you will stimulate your appetite so as long as you're giving your body what it needs and so you keep eating meat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you know your body will will use that to put on muscle so you work out you lift weights you sprint and then you eat enough and that's the main thing so you know you don't have to force your body to get in extra food your body will will want extra food when I'm working out when I'm just sedentary I'll eat x amount of day it's usually pretty consistent and then when I'm working out regularly it will literally double I'll have to be 2X and when I'm doing that if I actually get that in I put on a ridiculous amount of weight you know I've I've been a big guy I've worked out since I was a kid and so it's it's maybe just easier for me to put back on muscle and weight that I've had before but either way if I do a heavy workout I can put on a pound of muscle every time I go to the gym if I'm going if I'm doing a heavy leg workout I can put on close to two pounds and I've just tracked this I've tracked this on scale it's absolutely not Cuts how how easy it is when you're working hard and giving yourself adequate amounts of food nice um okay so uh Kel Kel is asking been seeing a lot lately about carnivore diet and vitamin C danger of getting scurvy is that really a problem with the carnivore diet so Sean how's your scurvy going man I'll tell you what you know Giver me timbers um like uh lice I don't I haven't had an issue with vitamin C I haven't had any any vitamin deficiencies since I've started eating this way that I didn't have prior to coming to eat this way if that makes any sense to you um I was deficient in vitamin D along with all the other issues that I had that I've reversed so you know it's been a fair trade-off I feel much better now that I've ever felt um so you know I know that a lot of people look at it well how are you getting your vitamin C and maybe you know one of the others can explain you know um how you're going to be able to get those essential nutrients and vitamins that you're not getting from the meat technically um but as far as I haven't had any deficiencies I haven't developed scurvy I haven't had you know any kind of weird things happening that the only thing I've experienced is feeling a lot better all of my labs have gotten better and improved um and so honestly it's not something that I've ever worried about or even given a whole lot of thought about I try my best not to get sidetracked into these Springs I you know and I understand you know maybe vitamin C is a big concern you know but at the same time when I was eating the standard American diet I didn't give a crap what divided what my vitamin C Level was I'm definitely I feel way too good now to you know to to worry about it now so I you know maybe somebody else has a better answer than that but I mean that's just me being 100 honest oh sorry I was kind of gonna say well I was kind of just going to say what you said at the very end I whenever I was eating the way that I was eating before I could care less about any of the vitamins I wasn't focused on them and I didn't even I'll be honest with y'all I didn't even know what scurvy was until about a month after I started carnivore so I didn't have time to worry about it the only thing I was worried about was losing pounds and that's been working out well so I'm just keep doing what I'm doing and listen to guys like Dr Berry and Dr chafee uh what about you Cassie I've never had any issues with vitamin C before eating carnivore and I've never I don't even know what type of symptoms scurvy has that would be more of a question for Dr chafee because I've he said I wouldn't even know where to begin to answer that yeah well you yeah you know you don't get you don't get scurvy I mean if you did the Inuit wouldn't be here a lot of populations wouldn't be here none of us would be here you know it's it was it was thought that uh without adequate vitamin C exposure or intake that you would get scurvy within within a few months right and so you know that's obviously not happening I've been I've been going on this nearly six years when I was doing this for five years in my early 20s I remember thinking to myself I was like do I need to eat a banana or something you know there's something I'm missing here and I remember thinking to myself I was like well my gums aren't bleeding and I feel good so I'm like well I'll just I'm just gonna keep going with this and ride it out and see what happens um and no you know you don't get this problem I mean think about this from first principles we have been designed to eat meat and that that's our you know like 70 of all animals or animal species on Earth you know we just eat meat right so uh we've been designed to so by definition you're going to get everything you need in the proportion that you need it if you're eating your biologically designed and and uh you know biologically appropriate diet right so there are a couple of reasons why uh you don't need as much vitamin C as they say first of all when we were looking at the rdas we were looking at people that were eating a mixed diet right if you're eating different things you need a different constellation of nutrients also our good friend uh uh doctor oh gosh what the hell is this stupid name I can't believe I forget this guy he's like my my imaginary Nemesis you know the guy that came up with the cholesterol theory of um heart disease anyway that idiot so he can rdas as well and um and uh and so you know I mean God knows if that was one of one of the few honest Endeavors that he actually you know made uh you know so but I think everything that guy's done is completely suspect I mean he had to do some good work in order to get into a position uh to be able to sell uh to sell out to the highest bidder with the whole cholesterol thing but uh but either way it was done at a time when um it was done at a time when people were eating a mixed diet so when you're eating carbohydrates carbohydrates and vitamin C compete for binding sites with the glute4 receptor and so if you're eating carbohydrates it's going to block out a lot of the of the vitamin C you're going to have taken a lot more carbohydrates in your vitamin C vitamin C is you would Trace vitamin right and so if you are eating carbohydrates then you need Vitamin C measured in milligrams right but if you're not eating vitamin carbohydrates and you need Vitamin C measured in nanograms which is one millionth of a of a milligram right so it's a massive massive difference in how much you actually need to take in also you know what do we need you know what is scurvy scurvy is um misdeveloped misformed collagen so it doesn't stick tightly together it doesn't hold tightly together and in the solution it breaks down so you have breakdown of your connective tissue and this can cause a lot of problems scurvy being the most obvious but long before that you can have you can have issues before that and the uh what's what uh vitamin c does is it hydrolyzes Proline and lysine so that they bind more tightly together and form this great strong collagen and when you're eating a lot of meat that has collagen you're already getting those hydrolyzed Proline and lysine so you don't actually need as much vitamin C to do that there are other things that vitamin c does right so you know people say look well there's an antioxidant effect sometimes just semen like little neutrophils or macrophages in some of the the innate immunity cells but um in fact we have a lot of other antioxidant affection vitamin C is in our main one we don't even make vitamin C most animals do make vitamin C we used to make vitamin C and we stopped that and it thought that we replaced that with urea and urea is actually our body's strongest and most abundant antioxidant so we have that and that actually goes up when you're eating a carnivore diet eating more protein so you don't actually need the vitamin C for that antioxidant effect you don't you don't need as much of it uh when you have a good amount of urea and other sorts of things and you're not bringing in a whole bunch of pro-oxative oxidative uh substances you know so it's not needed nearly as much on a carnivore diet you have other mechanisms and means of doing What vitamin C can do for others eating a mixed diet so no it's not something that you're going to have a problem with and it definitely does not cause scurvy uh if it if it were just cause curvy people would be dying in three months and they're not so so that's not the only thing that we're seeing that not only is our demand for the necessity of vitamin C being lessened but we're seeing the what's potentially our blood living longer so you're seeing higher a lot of the issues with you know um what is it that people's A1C or glucose going up really being an issue with your blood your urethocytes or whatever living longer and lots of other issues like that is is that fair to say yeah yeah so yeah with the with the red blood cells living longer so there we we look at hba1c as an average for three months of our blood sugar level but that only works if your blood cells are living on average three months right and there are things that can increase their lifespan which would would artificially raise that HBO and C number right because now that's an average of three and a half months four months but you're considering it on a three month scale right so that's you know that's going to be a large a higher number than it would be if you stopped the experiment at three months right or you can artificially reduce the number by you know if if the red blood cells aren't as healthy and they die off earlier then you know then you're only getting two and a half months or two months average as opposed to three months right so the things that could shorten the life of your red blood cells are things like uh the plant sterol so you're eating plant oils even even the better ones such as coconut oil or you know olive oil or avocado oil these still have plant sterols which which are similar enough to our own cholesterol that they can be taken up and use as as as cholesterol and put into the uh you know the um the cell membrane of cells and that is what will shorten the life or or lengthen the life of a red blood cell is having mobile flexible uh cell membrane or when because when it stiffens up it can't go around little tight corners and capillaries that's when your body takes it out in your spleen just pulls those out it's like no no you're taking too long you're going to clot up and you're going to get stuck can't have that so they rip those out and so they're going to get stiff a bit quicker if they if you have a lot of plant sterols and so people that are eating a lot of uh plant oils uh that they won't they will they might have an artificially low HBO and see now that HBO and C may be high but it's not actually indicating what the three-month average is and then you know if you go on a carnivore diet there are many carnivores that have you know HBO and C you know in its you know 4.8 something like that 4.9 um you know which is great but you know some of them will have to sort of creep up a bit so maybe they're they're in the you know the low fives or whatever that sort of creeping up maybe even goes to six but they're checking their blood sugar on a daily basis yeah yeah exactly so that so that normally you know if hbm1c is getting higher that would indicate an average higher blood sugar but actually they're showing a low blood sugar always just lower lower lower okay well maybe my monitor is broken to get a new one no it's the same thing it's low low low low low low right and so that is um indicating that their blood cells are living longer and just being exposed to uh to a lower amount of blood sugar for a longer period of time and that that's what that shows good stuff good stuff nice one Okay so we've got a super chat here from Alia thank you very much Alia thank you I love this carnivore family also I have a question in the chat which I'm gonna bring straight up here so Ali is asking does blood type matter my mom believes that I do well with carnivore because my blood type is oh she is a type A plant-based and thinks that the best that's the best for her is this relevant um I'm gonna guess no it's not I'm Type A and I do okay on Carnivore um any thoughts Cassie uh no absolutely not that is for um either Mr Sean or Dr chafee yeah I would I would say it definitely matters if you're getting a blood transfusion if you if you get shot and you go to the hospital and you need to be giving blood it's going to matter when it comes to what you should be eating uh not I'm not real convinced that I've heard all the things about you know your blood type and this eating a certain way I'm just convinced that we are as long as you're a human being your body essentially works the same way and while the levels of what you can tolerate and live successfully and optimally may be different from your neighbor your friend or your family um the makeup of the the nutrients that you need are all the same and and um blood type you know it is maybe you know you'll get a different explanation from uh Dr chaper or somebody yeah well I mean just think of it this way you know I mean do do lions with different blood types eat different things do elephants with different blood types needy different things do whales with different blood types one needs to eat Krill and the other needs to eat uh you know seaweed you know or or grass or something something ridiculous like that so I mean your blood type is one protein or maybe you know maybe two proteins A and B and then you have your your Reese's facts and things like that these are antigens on the surface of your red blood cells right how is one protein difference or two protein differences on your on the surface of your red blood cells alone how is that going to fundamentally change your entire digestive tract and biological nature it doesn't make any sense so I I have no idea how that I that thought of of blood type having such a great effect on diet uh got so much traction just based on that that simple premise and how could one protein difference make such a massive massive difference in our just complete really overhaul our entire digestion and changes as a species because if you have one animal that's that's an obligate herbivore and one animal that's an obligate carnivore those are two different species you will never ever ever find that in the same species anywhere in the world it's not possible like if you if you're that different you are not the same species and so you know that uh no that that's that's not going to be a thing so um humans are humans we're Homo sapiens sapiens right and we we've been genetically pretty conserved for you know the past few hundred thousand years and so again you'll never find two members of the same species that have different optimal diets you might find people that are more or less equipped to eat sub-optimal things some people have more tolerance like but if I have more of a tolerance to lead poisoning then Sean does that doesn't mean that lead is good for me it just means that lead is less bad for me right and so that can be the same thing you know with night shades or other sorts of foods that we've we've been cultivating since the Agricultural Revolution and you know one person's ancestors may have have had exposure to that for 10 000 years and others like the Australian aboriginals or the Native Americans in most areas like the Plains Indians were just eating buffalo did not have that exposure until very recently and they're actually going to be much much more susceptible to the detriments to health that the those exposures will cause but it but for neither of us did that change what our optimal diet is and that and you know and um you know like Dave I'm I'm Type A which is supposed to be according to the blood type diet a vegan diet you're supposed to be just plant-based all the way and I am most definitely not but you know the thing is it's like it's as good a guess as any when you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about might as well go on blood type you know and some people see some sort of you know correlations like that and it makes sense because people just have no damn idea how we're supposed to eat because they listen to all the all the dogmas they look they'll eat the the pyramid and jewelry sorts of things it's making him fat sick and unhealthy and then someone says hey we'll do this eat according to your your blood type and they go okay well guys I guess it's I guess it's something I'll try anything at this point and you know what that does do is it focuses your mind and you start eating more consciously and you start eating Whole Foods because I don't think any blood type is the you know it is the the deep fried trans fats and fast food you know blood type right all whole food diets right and so now you're consciously going like okay oh I need to eat this category but you're but you're going to be making that stuff yourself and you're gonna need to do it and that's always going to be better than you know the highly processed Ultra process you know junk food seed oil processed carbs and sugar diet yeah nice so uh Rebecca is asking just started Carnival last week how do you handle eating out on vacation so Kip did you want to take this one first how do you handle leading out on vacation uh well you could always fast but but uh no on a serious note I just try to do the best I can whenever I'm on vacation um and I mean sometimes I'll have like a like a bunless burger somewhere at some restaurant or I'll get a steak it might not have like you know be the best quality of something but uh I just do the best that I can and I definitely make sure I stay away from anything that's got carbs in it and or things like that you can find something if you I mean if I was in a really really pinch like then I would get some hot dogs from a gas station or some vein or something if y'all even know what that is but um there's always a way to stay carnivore you just got to get creative and find the way oh so um recently I took a vacation and I drove and I took burger patties with me and some bacon so those were my snacks on my way um but in the past Larry and I we've taken air fryer to a hotel that didn't have either a microwave there was no kitchenette to it so I I would say take something like that with you or find a hotel with a kitchenette and you can cook your own food at least you know what you're eating then take some steaks you you know um but uh yeah I would just make sure that you're prepared and have snacks on hand that way you're not tempted to dip out and hit a fast food restaurant and you know sometimes you're looking at that food and um it looks awfully tempting and it's very easy to slip so just be prepared take some food with you and cook while you're there I'm not sure where it goes next will that go you to you Sean you got any ideas yeah so I mean honestly like they've alluded to you gotta if you don't have a plan then you plan to fail obviously have a plan in mind before you go on vacation what you're going to do you know and that's what I personally try to do you know um try to have an idea like if you know how I'm gonna eat where I'm gonna eat what I'm gonna do you know no matter what the situation you know what are you gonna do whenever whatever circumstances you face you go to your family's house and they eat this way or you know you're tempted don't put yourself in don't set yourself up for failure set yourself up for success make a plan stick to it you know have have those things in mind you know obviously it may not be ideal you may have to settle for a stake at a place that you know that you normally wouldn't but I mean you can get you can almost I don't know of anywhere you can in the world you know you can't get some form of well I say in the world I haven't been out of the country maybe over there in Australia where Dr chapey is you can't get a stake anywhere all over the place but there's some form of room in the animal somewhere or um you know Animal product that you could eat and have a plan to get you through my thing is I try also to spend the least amount of time that I possibly can thinking about food and I for the last a little over a year and a half I really honestly do not think about food like if what I think about food the most when my stomach and my body is like you got to get something to eat because you're dragging your tire you're you know you just get those signals and and it's saying hey look you haven't eaten today you know it's five o'clock in the afternoon you push through doing whatever you better go get something to eat or you go run out of energy you know so I mean that's just kind of how I try to look at it how I view it and how I plan for it um what about you uh uh Kim no no you already got Kip sorry I'm losing my mind Dr chafee oh yeah I mean the same thing so I mean like there's always meat on the menu like unless you're actually going to a full-on vegan restaurant even vegetarian restaurants should have eggs right so it's always going to be something so you can you can get you know eggs and bacon you can go to a McDonald's and get just the beef patties and things like that um you know any port in a storm sort of thing but I agree that that it's good to uh to plan ahead bring food with you if you're if you're going for an extended period of time or they don't let you know if you're if you're flying to a different country they don't let you bring you know meet with you to the other side you could I mean you could try but they they might catch you you might be in trouble because of that but you know you can generally bring stuff on the plane I mean there's almost never going to be enough meat on a long plane ride but if it's just like a short plane trip it's not that big of a deal but you know I've I've gone to like cutting up stagger piece of me putting them in in the dehydrator and and just bringing those and I mean just big meat cookies just to bring with me and uh you know for like long flights when I flew to Costa Rica I had had those yeah with my girlfriend now and we and we just we just ate we were just eating dried rib eyes for 40 hours yeah so it was like fine you know we didn't we didn't need to worry about you know not having food you know access to food on these these big flights um and uh yeah so you know if you're going for an extended period of time and you can't really bring enough food for the whole trip you know just just remember that there's always meat on the menu and just look for the options that that work best for you and just ask them not to bring it with all the the other garbage on the sides you know as as weird as it sounds you know fast food places where you can just get order the burger patties plain uh it's actually a pretty good option you know I've spoken to them uh certainly at Burger King and hungry at Jackson in Australia and McDonald's and they they don't use seed oils they're not frying it up on in a pan or anything like that McDonald's uses like sort of like a sandwich press sort of thing is where it just sort of cooks it on both sides they don't use any oil and uh you know Burger King is all about the flame grilled Whopper sort of thing so you know you're not you're not going to get a bunch of seed oils it's just cooked more normally and uh you know I've seen the ingredients list and it's just just it's just cow like that's what they use for these these patties so you know there are always options and just be mindful that you know you can always just order something that contains meat in the you know off the menu and just just eat that part of it but then cook for yourself too exactly you know uh as I was saying before like if you if you can get an Airbnb or something like that where you can cook yourself that's that's always the best option so we've got a we've got a super chat here from Riley Nichols thank you very much for that and I can't pronounce it so I think this one's gonna go straight to Dr chafee so is this diet safe for someone with B fellas in my uh traits yeah close yeah beta thalassemia yeah uh yeah absolutely so you know regardless of your genetic you know idiosyncrasies You're Still Human right you know I mean there's nothing there's nothing that's going to be on your blood test or your genetic that's going to show you that you're not human if you're human right and so you know all humans are designed primarily to eat and to respond the best to and thrive on fatty meat and so yeah in fact you know I've seen people with uh you know thalassemia actually improve their symptoms and other other genetic issues as well improve because we're giving our body what is optimal for our body and our body's able to run more optimally and we're excluding things that are sub-optimal and that can actually cause harm that's why I always stress that it's as important what not to eat as what to eat right so you know no plants or fungus no sugar or sweeteners nothing artificial that goes for sausage seasonings and drinks as well if you want to be as pure as possible and not everybody does but some people with with certain issues really do need to be pretty strict on it and so you'll find that a lot of people with whatever genetic issue they actually improve dramatically I've seen people with ehlers downloads which is you know lose connective tissue we were talking about vitamin C and they're like oh yeah you can you can get problems with you know scurvy and stuff like that no actually you see the opposite you see people with collagen issues with connective tissue disorders like all those downloads that don't make collagen properly now all of a sudden because they're eating meat and they're getting all this this uh you know all the pre-made building blocks for college and all of a sudden their collagen starts tidying up their joints start tightening up they stop getting jointed locations and stop being symptomatic that's pretty amazing so even though they have a genetic predisposition for something it's not actually being manifest because they're actually eating properly so you know as they say uh you know genes load the gun and environment pulls a trigger right so you have to have an environment you have to have a genetic predisposition and an environmental trigger to get the disease right so if you don't have the genetic condition then the environmental trigger doesn't do anything it's not triggering anything but if you you know don't if you have the Gene and you don't get the environmental trigger well then the Gene's just sitting there dormant and you're not going to have a problem so a lot of these genetic issues are actually triggered by eating the wrong thing or not enough of the right thing and so not only is it safe it might actually improve your symptoms as well I can't guarantee uh in your particular case but I've seen remarkable results with people with mad genetic issues absolutely insane improvements I mean I again I I go on this I think I bring this up every time but you know there are now anecdotal accounts of a few people with Huntington's disease that are actually improving their symptoms with a carnivore diet which is absolutely insane I thought that was a 100 uh penetrant where it's just 100 you have that Gene you will get huntingtons yeah no exceptions that's what that's what I was taught in medical school and and yet there are people improving by going on a carnivore diet I think that's just that's just absolutely remarkable and so nothing's really off the table for me now it's just it's just sort of a wait and see yes it's safe and uh it might even improve your symptoms your issues in a thousand other ways anyway in itself and the thing we already talked about your red blood cells living longer potentially on Carnivore and one of the issues with that disorder is that their hemoglobin is being affected and their blood cells aren't living as long so it's going to give your actually give your body a long a longer time to build up those cells if if it's if the blood cells are staying alive longer it's gonna it's it's gonna help you out right you know your body's not going to be under such demand because those cells are living longer so you know I agree with you on that if I could just ask a question um is this diet unsafe for anybody no no no no no that's it you know it any human is going to benefit from this you know even cows you know benefit from this you know I mean this is this is the most bioavailable nutrient Source uh that exists you know they actually actually put up put in you know ground up you know cows and other Livestock in feed for other livestock to get them the nutrients that are deficient when they're in a feedlot uh you know like the grains and things like that you know because they are lacking but you know the the you know animal tissue we were trying to make building create animal tissue by eating that's that's the whole point of eating right is to build and maintain our bodies which are animal tissue and so it's actually very difficult to turn plant tissue into animal tissue or not not every animal can do this only about 30 percent of animals are any good at it and these are the the herbivores and omnivores out there seventy percent of animal species are carnivores right because they don't they are not good at turning plant tissue into animal tissue and but you know the the herbivores you'll still find herbivores eating other animals smaller animals horses eating little little baby chickens and things like that my video on my my Instagram on the the um highlighted sort of things real is called uh carnivores and like there's there's a horse in a barn just looking up and there's this little baby chick sort of falling around boom it just eats it up and they're like oh God that's startling and other other you know videos of you know deer and and elk and things like that like eating bunnies and snakes and brat you know and uh and and chicks and things like that these are these are bioavailable nutrients and they're bioavailable to herbivores and carnivores the difference between the two is that the herbivores can also get you know bioavailability unlock bioavailability from plants that are not bioavailable oh and could be toxic to other animals as well so either way you know we you know there's there's since this is our optimal diet for our species it's going to be optimal for everyone you know that that's the whole premise you can have you can have different you have different things that are better or worse that are sub-optimal right you know like like you people European descent all have a bit more protection against you know grains and you know all these other sorts of you know plants and sugars and things like that that we've we've been eating and had exposure to for thousands of years longer than you know aboriginals and Native Americans and and other populations that have not had that exposure and have not built up some genetic defenses uh during that time so you know some things can be you know better or worse that are sub-optimal but but they're still going to be an optimal you know Krill is still optimal for the whales that eat krill you know it doesn't matter that you know what slight differences there are in that species of whale you know if they eat Krill they all eat Krill you know lions eat what lions eat period across a board they eat meat right there's there's no lion that is going to benefit from you know grasses more than they're going to benefit from meat right and so the same same thing goes with us you know if you are human then you know as Ken Barry says you know you need a proper human diet that's going to be better for everybody so what is our biologically appropriate species-specific diet that is that is a high fat carnivore diet and that's going to be the most beneficial for everybody in every situation nice so truck of air trucker bear 76 thank you very much for your Super Chat uh greetings from New York thanks for connecting mentoring and sharing your time to help people thank you very much and we've got also a super chat here from Jeremiah considering that freezing meat can denature protein and oxidize fats is it a concern when consuming so much meat should I always opt for fresh Sean have you got any thoughts on that um I always get as fresh as I can get I mean honestly you know the the difference when the pressure it is to me I don't dry age I don't do any of that kind of stuff um I just I literally go to the shop you know to the to the meat market and buy a rib roast and chop it up I'm good to go you know like I said my I don't I guess I don't have a whole lot to offer as far as that's concerned because you know I I spend so little time I uh last night Dr kiltz was talking about you know dry aging one of mistakes because he's in the middle of a fast I mean I guess maybe if I were our fasting I'd probably be thinking a lot more of it but um you know I I like it fresh I don't like it you know on uh dries and stuff like that very much but um what about you Cassie you eat the dried what you think about that um well I'm not exactly sure like the chemical process that happens between fresh meat and then when it does go to Frozen but I do know that when you freeze me it's obviously the taste and texture will be different but like for example I have vacuum sealed very good salmon and when I've thought it out vacuum sealed it and froze it and when I thought it out most of the fat had disappeared now I don't know if it combines with the water like I said I'm not exactly sure of the process but there is a difference and how it affects the nutrition I really wouldn't know but I know that there is something to that I would imagine that people that live in colder climates like um I would imagine that they throughout different times of the year freeze me and try to store me in different ways like years ago before we had the the resources that we have nowadays and honestly for me if freezing me is a problem then I'm in deep trouble because I smoke meat all the time and I can't just always run go grab a fresh brisket the way the day that I'm gonna cook it because it takes like 10 hours to cook it so I keep my freezers slap full of meat and like I have a deep freezer and then I have a freezer and fridge outside and then I have my main refrigerator in the house so I always have my refrigerator full and I don't want to just keep my refrigerators empty and my freezer empty just so that I could get fresh meat every day what time we eating that's what I need to know if your freezers is full we should have got the invite everything off I want to fire up the smoker when y'all show up in Alabama we will talk later um well yeah I mean look there's going to be some some damages and changes you know when you're freezing things or drying things or preserving things and in other ways but you know we have been preserving Meats in in various ways for quite some time we haven't had freezers obviously uh for for much of our history but um you know there are periods like during the ice ages and different people in the arctics you know Circle and things like that or or you know on the other side you know towards Antarctic that that likely would have Frozen things and you know during the ice ages you know God knows you know because we have you we there's evidence of people doing Mammoth drops just like the Native Americans would do Buffalo drops you know scaring these these large herd of these animals over a cliff they'd all Crash and Burn and then they'd Harvest them up yeah at the bottom of the cliff and uh and then they would eat for years on that potentially or or at least a long time and um you know it you know were they making pemmican like the Native Americans were you know over a million years ago which is when we have some of the you know the earliest evidence of Mammoth drops or were they just just leaving them in in the cold storage that was uh the ice ages right now there were always Ice Age they're intermixed throughout that period so they probably were drying them uh I figured out how to how to dry them and preserve them in other ways but you know it it does raise a good question I mean there are you know there are differences you know that there you can find a lot of you know different things about you know this will denaturing obviously freezer burning less damaging you know the meat and um you know but there's a difference also with freezing in your freezer and then thawing it and freezing and throwing it and freezing you're gonna make those ice crystals you know form up damage damage the tissue and then they they melt and then they freeze and they melt and they freeze when you're doing it like sort of flash freezing in a very very quick process it it spares that damage it doesn't doesn't damage these things as much um and so you know if you're if you're getting you're if you're buying like a cow from a butcher you're going to get less damage when you get that flash frozen thing you get it straight into your freezer and maintain it at that cold temperature than if you're just sort of throwing something in the freezer but um I think I think in the grand scheme of things that if you were you know you're still eating meat this is still going to be better it's still going to be an improvement on on anything else and so you know if you're feeling that you know you you do better on fresh meat that you can buy then you know do that and uh but if you're if you're if your access is to uh you know frozen meats and things like that that's still better than than the Alternatives and I can't say for sure if it's all that much better or worse than just getting it fresh but it's definitely better better than the alternative so I I wouldn't um you know I wouldn't shake stick at it anyway and just be oh my God turn my nose up at it you know because that was the option then going to salad or something Reckless like that you know it's still it's still just eat the meat hmm nice so we have super chats coming through here like nobody's business so um we've got one from Penny here it says one year carnivore amazing improvements in all aspects I had a chronic adrenal fatigue incident do you approach your fasting and workout approach differently you mean different different to each other I think she means in the context of chronic adrenal fatigue right um Okay so Dr Chaffey do you want to take that one uh yeah I think well look I think that you don't need to fast on a carnivore diet you know a lot of the benefits that you get are really just from not eating the wrong thing and specifically not eating things that spike your insulin and you know this is even something that David Sinclair from Harvard talks about of just like well you need to fast because you need to get your insulin down for you know 72 hours so that you can turn on all these longevity genes I I don't know but I don't know why he's not seeing that connection between you know a ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet which is a ketogenic should be a ketogenic diet and the fact that your insulin is going to be low the whole time as well and that there are studies showing that you do turn on those same longevity genes and and you know go through autophagy and mitophagy and and stimulate you know all these cellular and subcellular processes which are very very beneficial and genetic processes as well turn on different genes and turn off others um and so you get you really get most if not all the benefits from just not eating the wrong thing and from getting your insulin down and uh and there are studies with which you'll get a so-called fasting mimicking diet because you know keto people people think that oh my God you know that's just a that's just a fad that's a ridiculous thing or it's dangerous because of ketoacidosis so they call it by different names they call it a fasting mimicking diet they say well you see all these benefits from fasting that can be difficult for people so what about a diet that mimics fasting is that going to confer the same benefit as this endpoint that we were looking at here with fasting and they find that in a lot of these things Yes actually they do give the exact same benefit by just not eating carbs by just not having high insulin and not eating the wrong things you get you get these same benefits and um you know so it's uh and so actually better you know some people get you know hair loss and have other sorts of problems with with fasting but if you if you're getting enough protein like over 100 grams of protein a day that that hair a lot even if you're not eating anything else you're just maintaining at least 100 grams of protein uh there are studies show that you don't you don't get the hair loss and you don't damage your yourself in that way with long-term fats so I don't think that fasting is a great idea I don't I don't think it's a necessary thing either if people want to do that you know sort of reset things and uh and sort of have a different relationship with food and just recognize that they don't have to eat every day and they don't have to to do that uh you know they don't have to just eat constantly and just feed the beast that could be helpful you know that could be sort of from a more mental mindset but a reset but I don't I don't think that it necessarily helps you physically on top of just eating the right thing and if you have are someone with adrenal fatigue I don't think it's a good idea at all you know because you know you're you're you could put your body under a bit more undue stress than you actually want it to and you can you can press your uh adrenals to start you know compensating uh for that fast when you really don't have any any room to compensate anymore so I think that it's important just and especially if you're if you're dealing with health issues that you really just need to eat enough fatty meat and let your body heal and get better um nice um Okay so we've got another Super Chat here from Judy and Judy it says today is day one oh nice and I'm excited for my new Journey I'm 68 years young I don't have a gallbladder is there something I need to eat drink or take to help my journey um just add something quickly anecdotal I I interviewed a guy recently who has no gallbladder and he successfully is doing carnivore and has done for the last three and a half years um and uh he said that the only thing he has to do is kind of space out the way he's eating and basically if he eats too much fat at once he knows about it so you know he just spaces that out so um actually you can find him at minimalist carnivore um does anyone else have any thoughts on that anything else they wanted to add well I've heard I've heard a lot of people that have mentioned the fact that they have to take like an ox bile or something like that and they have to ease into eating because they have to get you know get the way that their their ducks or their body produces the chemical to break down the food is is much different than than someone with a gallbladder with a bowel working correctly but um those are the two main things that I've heard people talk about doing this um so I would just ease into it you know um don't try to you know don't don't get frustrated you know if you have some issues right at first but um it'll it'll come so um other than that that's really all I have to offer on that one uh if I may add to that I don't have any gallbladder issues but I can certainly speak um of experience having um digestive issues because I've had surgery on my intestines uh my colon and then over by my uh appendix and it's never been normal so for me I've just learned to live with it I space my meals and if I'm planning to go out to a big event you know I'm just very careful with what I eat and how much fat I take in at once but um certainly oxfile I've heard it can help but I really wouldn't know anything about that but just hang in there because those few moments on the toilet really are better than the alternative being sick and diseased and that icky stuff well yeah asking about you know is there something special you need to eat and drink um yeah meat and water just eat that and um and you'll be fine so you know again you know even if you you're missing a gallbladder You're Still Human this is still you know what you're supposed to eat you'll still make bile it's you know the gallbladder doesn't make bile it just stores it and concentrates it so you can use it a later date so you know like like Dave was saying some people find that they just need to space out their fatty meals because by all uh is what is what emulsifies fat and allows you to absorb it uh into your lymphatics and then take that in into through the rest of your body so if you if you don't have adequate amount of bile then you're not going to be able to absorb fat to an appreciable extent you can you can only absorb a very small amount of it and the rest of it goes out right so you might find that you have diarrhea so if you have if you have like a big large fatty meal and a lot of this is coming out you have to have a dramatic exit to the bathroom then you know you're not really absorbing all that fat because you don't have all the bile just stored up ready to squish out on uh you know from your gallbladder so you might have to space out your meals throughout the day and just eat the same amount the same amount of fat you just do it at different times because your liver just sort of constantly makes and drips out bile over the course of 24 hours it makes around 800 mils to a liter of of bile depending on the size of the person and you know that so that's not all coming out in one go but that's a 24-hour amount of bile your body wants a 24-hour amount of fat so you can't necessarily eat it all because it's sort of dripping out into your into your intestine and you just sort of have to catch it as it's coming through because it's going to be reabsorbed further down in your intestine and so some people just need to just sort of space those meals out and that's fine for them I don't think that you necessarily well if you want to absorb like a huge amount just that time if you're at a banquet or something like that a feast and you just want to be able to absorb a lot then you know you could do that I don't think that you you want to really play with that too much because you know your body makes a specific amount of bile because it wants to absorb a specific amount of fat and if you Tinker with that and add in Ox bile then you're going to be forcing your body to absorb more fat than it thinks it wants and you know who knows what's what's going to happen after that so I would just sort of let your body do its thing also quite a lot of people form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is an out pouching of the common bile duct and it just acts exactly like your gallbladder would it sort of sort of makes this little pocket and it stores bile concentrates it and then when you have you know fat that comes in it triggers your your brain says oh there's that coming so squishes that out and pushes this stuff out so there are quite a lot of of people on Carnivore uh that they're eating you know high fat diet and still eat once a day and they have perfectly fine absorption if you're not one of those people if you and you haven't formed a suitably working pseudo gallbladder then just just space out your meals and uh and you should be fine hmm thank you um we've got a super chat here from Amber and dance kind of alive four months carnivore arthritis primino dysmenorrhea migraine so much better way more energy don't give up it's 99 mental nice work Amber and Dan congratulations awesome okay and uh uh says never diabetic and strict keto for two years less than 20 grams total a day fasting blood glucose suddenly high for a few weeks 130 to 166 versus 75 to 80 normal constant stomach noise regardless of food intake thoughts Dr chafee any thoughts on that what what is less than 12 so less than than 20 grams of of carbs I guess yeah um well you know there can be a lot of things that affect that I mean your blood sugar is hormonally driven in a lot of ways as well if you have a lot of stress in your life you're not sleeping properly and uh you're you're worried about things you're going to raise your cortisol cortisol will um uh raise your blood sugar and so you can have disruptions there so I would I would address stress in your life I would also understand that you know your own keto diet has anything changed in your keto diet because keto is just the absence of something right it's just like vegan it's it's a very non-specific term vegan just means no meat keto just means no carbs right but vegan you know does include Oreo cookies and heroin right so that's not really helpful you know because you need to know what you are supposed to eat as well as what you're not supposed to eat and you know that's why I say it's important what not to eat as what to eat right so eat meat fat water don't eat all these other things right so but in keto and vegan that you're only getting one side of that equation so keto can have still have a lot of plants that have a ton of different disruptive chemicals that can disrupt your insulin disrupt your leptin disrupt your blood sugar disrupt your hormones in other ways your your sex hormones as well and and can derange all these there are different lectins in plants that don't have carbohydrates in them that will bind mortality lead to insulin receptors then insulin does and get more of an intelligent insulinogenic effect block leptin as well cause all sorts of you know issues with your your hormonal health and your blood sugar you know so there are other things in Plants regardless of carbs that can affect your blood sugar and affect your hormones in particular um less than 20 grams a day you know I just I would just probably just get rid of those all together and just stop the carbs and just try eating just fatty meat look at what changes you've made if you've made any changes to your diet you may not have in which case it would probably indicate more that you're that there are some stresses in your life and that that sort of artificially raising your your cortisol temporarily you know like people say you know we're not you know cortisol is helpful in the morning to wake you up and then you know if you're if you're fighting a leopard or something like that but we're not supposed to be fighting a leopard all the time you know so you get if you get this stress responsor that you can go and you can do go and fight and kill or or prevent yourself from being killed and then you need to calm the hell down right but if we're always in this constant stress State then you're always in that I'm fighting a leopard phase and never calm the hell down and it and it does a lot of deranged things to your body so um that's what I would try I think that you do get better control on a more controlled diet like a carnivore diet where you're at least eliminating all those other things that are going to affect your your hormones like like insulin and leptin and then you have to address your stress you have to make sure you're sleeping properly you have to make sure that your your maybe just have some conscious meditation and just get some time to just chill the hell out and and and find yourself in a position that you're not as stressed out all the time and that can help as well just get rid of the rest of the carbs as well having low carbs I think is worse than having no carbs or even higher carbs because you're just starting to trigger your your insulin but you're knocking yourself enough carbs to actually do anything with this so it can actually make you feel pretty crappy maybe even a bit more stressed out you're spiking your cortisol to try to compensate for that to try to bring your blood sugar up because you're you're not actually you know able to maintained warmly through normal ketosis or through the abundance of carbohydrates in your diet so you put yourself actually in a stress State and your body's trying to compensate for that and you can you can get some problems there so I would just get rid of all the carbs and then try to get rid of other plants as well try you know just going on to adjust a carnivore diet see if that helps and then try and lower your stress and get some proper sleep and chill out a bit thank you okay so Texas Donna if I'm wanting to lose weight about 25 pounds on days that I have a lot of physical activity is my metabolism better off if I eat a little more on those days or is it more complicated than that Cassie do you have any thoughts on this one regarding the physical activity um geez metabolism I mean my metabolism is all wacky I have hypothyroidism so I really can't answer to that it's it's not normal but I've noticed that when um I do work out regardless whether I'm having um a little bit of dairy or whatnot that the physical activity certainly does help and it for me anyway it counteracts the effects of what Dairy I would be taking in so um I don't know how complicated it is I mean Donna you're doing amazing you're just walking and just keep walking by the end of the month you're going to notice differences and you're going to feel better your energy is going to be increased you know just stay with your hydration and eat your meat and you're gonna feel great well I mean the the whole calories in calories out thing I mean your expenditures I mean it's it it doesn't you're not gonna ever have enough physical activity to overcome a bad diet so if you put the right thing in to give your body the nutrition I found that I was getting sewed uh the nutrients and out my body was so satiated that it really didn't matter what I did that day I was cool and I had this basically the same thing every day it's not like I would on the days where I would be physically exerting myself more than normal I would change the way that that looked for me there are times where my body gives me signals that I want to eat more or I need you know hey you need more food go eat some more food and and I will go do that but it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the physical because I've worked that extremely hard and ate the same thing I ate on a day where I sat around and did nothing you know um so I mean that's just my you know my intake or my uh view on that maybe you guys can add something to that I also um I hope I didn't cut you off but I also uh I'm hungry I go ahead and eat like I don't divorce myself not to eat or forced to fast constantly and oh so like if like normally I eat about two meals a day but for example today I woke up and about two hours into work this morning I realized that I was hungry and they cook fresh bacon in the oven down there that may not have the cleanest ingredients in the world but I was like I for some reason I want some bacon this morning so I went down there and I got the bacon and I didn't worry about it so I actually ate three meals today but I just kind of listened to my body regardless if I'm working out or if I'm not working out if my body's telling me hey you're hungry then I eat but if not then don't eat until you feel like you're hungry what about uh one of y'all yeah well I mean I think that you you sometimes do need a bit more but I think you just listen to your body so there's no formula you don't you know well there are formulas but they're all individual and you're not going to figure it out no one knows the exact right formula for each individual person because it would be individual for each person and so your body knows that better nobody nobody knows your your body and your biochemistry more than your body and so you know it is extremely in tune with exactly what it needs and so if you're working out and you're doing different sorts of things your body will tell you if it wants more or less in the way of nutrients there will be times that when if you're if you have excess fat to lose that you know you might work out and do these sorts of things oh well I should eat because I'm doing more today than it was on other days you might find actually I'm not as hungry I don't even need to eat as much you know I've I've found on days you know when I was slimming down to you know more stable body fat percentage that there were there were a couple times I just I didn't want to eat it all and I was like that's really weird like why doesn't the steak sound good I cooked it anyway I tried to eat it I'm like this just does not taste good I'm just not enjoying this I was very confused by that but I was gonna say okay I'm just this is just I'm not enjoying this I'm I'm just gonna stop and I was very worried about that I was worried about not having energy the next day and not feeling my best I felt amazing I felt absolutely fantastic and then you know that that stake you know which is now cold and dry and in the fridge it tasted amazing the next day when I got home right because you know my body was telling me like you know we don't need it now we've got enough you know just just go to bed and uh you know then the next day I was like yeah okay bring that stuff in we want that so just listen to your body you know if and you the last thing you want to do is limit the amount of food that you're getting into because that will tell your body in no uncertain terms that you're in a famine and that you don't have access to the amount of resources that your body is asking you for and so you just give your body what it's asking you for you don't have to artificially increase or lower or whatever to fit what you think your body wants just listen to what your body wants eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and let let your body do the rest and if you do that you will show your body that you are in a time of a place of abundance and that you don't need to lower your metabolism and store fat and guard this uh jealously because you know you don't know when the next meal is going to be coming around the corner and and you might die if you don't conserve your your uh your energy properly so just eat what your body's asking you for and uh it is more complicated it's a lot more complicated than all of these sorts of things so it's way too complicated for us to figure it out so you just need to let your body do its thing anybody who tells you that this is that exact formula you know is going to be wrong I mean they're just too many variables there are too many things that we don't know and don't understand it cannot calculate in each individual person it's not possible to do with our current technology and I probably never going to happen so you know you just need to let your body do its thing because it it knows exactly what it wants and how much of it it wants and so it'll tell you based on your hunger so just give it what it wants and let it do the rest no it's okay so we've got a super chat here specifically for Dr trophy Mary O'Donnell Dr Chaffey last night I told you I broke out in Hive since going carnivore three weeks found out there's a Syndrome from Lone Star tick bite that causes Alpha gal syndrome acquired Metallurgy any thoughts if you've heard of that well yeah well I did I did sort of Wonder uh that was on a live I was doing last night that you're talking about getting um getting hives and I did I did sort of Wonder you know because like it's only certain Meats um and if I remember it's like you know sort of like the red meats and things like that you know it's it's it you know has this uh carbohydrate really that that um that you'll build up a an immunity towards and makes it difficult to eat certain sorts of meat so there are meats that you can eat I think fish is okay and there's a couple other like you know white meats and things like that I think I think are all right as well but but um I'm just not remembering exactly it's been a while since I looked into that uh but there are meats that you can eat you can still eat a carnivore diet you just you're just not really going to be able to eat sort of red meat so if you think that's happened if you've had it and that was one of the things too you didn't mention anything about a tick bite so I didn't didn't really sort of go into that but if you have gone to take butter you think you may have been exposed to that you know that's a possibility so you know just eat eat the different meat see what which uh meats you can just Google this on which ones you can and can't eat and and just focus on those those are those are better and and you're getting you're not getting a breakout then that's fine you can just eat those the good thing about Alpha gal which was like absolutely terrifying to me I was just like that is not okay I finally I came across you know carnivore like rediscovered all this and just feeling amazing and then all of a sudden they're like oh yeah loan start to make you allergic to me I'm like absolutely not I can't deal with that no from wherever the hell that little bug is because like I just I wouldn't be able to do that and um but the good news is is that it seems to be temporary it seems to only last a few months so there are meats that you can eat for the rest of your life you don't need to uh rely on the meats that that uh you know would trigger that but the good news is is that it seems that after a few months this uh this goes away and so your body can get back to normal and and start eating you know the red meats as well so if you think that that might be uh the case for you if you think you might have been exposed to that then you can certainly try uh just eating you know the different different meats that that don't have um you know that that's uh that antigen on it and um and see how you go and if that makes a significant Improvement great keep going for that for a while and you know in sort of three to six months you can you can try bringing some of this other stuff back in and see what that does for you you got to watch out when you come out here to the sticks where where uh Cassie and Ollie man matter of fact you know it's not just them little ticks out there that get you my son you see right under the sign there no [\u00a0__\u00a0] Jesus so my son my wife and my son are walking like that's within I could throw a rock to where that bear was crossing the road I was talking to somebody I think it was Dr kill you see under the sign it just shows that was down the road from your house it was yeah it's like what matter of fact right where I walk at and my wife and my son were walking that little rat today you never know what's Gonna Get You In The Sticks ain't that right kid you might get snatched up you might get bit by a tape that turns the one thing you eat again yeah absolutely y'all should see the size of the mosquitoes down here in Alabama they are huge and they use mosquitoes down here will tear you up buddy dude I told I told Cassie the other the week we were talking on the phone trying to get out of South Carolina for a long time I just can't leave because the mosquitoes keep bringing me back you know I'm like it's horrible here in South Carolina with the mosquitoes man I ain't kidding you they are the worst they're terrible anyway I digress I you know I just had to make mention of that there's a lot of stuff that'll get you out there if you ain't careful thanks thanks for the Super Chat Amy thanks thanks for the Super Chat Amy and also from Rebecca thank you very much and we've got a question here from Norman Norman says 66 year old male strict carnivore three years recent LDL over 400 uh CAC was 359 three years ago now 357 um body fat 10 percent blood pressure varies 100 I have a 60 to 160 over 80 but mostly low not diabetic morning BS morning blood sugar 4.7 any concerns with these uh Dr chafee any thoughts about this well I mean you know any any sort of you know measure medical issues I mean should be discussed you know with your doctor you know side that really unfortunately possible to give like a full medical consult or direct medical advice uh in this context um but you know but a lot of these things are looking you know fine you know your your blood pressure is saying it's varies but you know it is in a very good range it's also in a not so good range so you know I would wonder you know what is any sort of variations in the medications that you're taking are you sort of dropping someone you shouldn't be or you're getting stressed out or are you actually getting you know resting and sitting down and just just calming down for five minutes and just breathing before you take your blood pressure or sometimes you're taking and just just going off you need to just sit down and relax and just take it easy and then check your blood pressure because sometimes when you're anticipating taking your blood pressure oh God I hope it's not high it's going to go high that's obviously going to go high and uh you know your blood sugar you know being uh 4.7 these are these are uh sort of UK numbers that that's perfectly fine so you want that between sort of four and five you know in UK Australia uh that sort of um that sort of thing so in the U.S I mean that's that's you know that's going to be right around you know the 70 80 Mark you know so that's that's perfectly fine um your LDL I've just never thought that uh or I just do not think that that LDL is a marker for heart disease or disease in general first of all there are many different kinds of LDL we have no idea what they are just from your your normal number um and you know when you make ldm the majority of of the LDL and cholesterol that you make is uh is well you make it is from your liver and so it's it's the large buoyant LDL is very good for you and then it can be damaged and crippled by glycation oxidation things like that and that can be less good that doesn't necessarily mean it's causing harm it just means that it's damaged and it's not it's not what it's supposed to be so the things that are damaging your LDL can also be damaging everything else and so you know that can you know raise your your CAC score you know that that overall damage and process to your body that could also be damaging your LDL but I I honestly just I see there's there's a hundreds of evidence against LDL being a direct driver of heart disease CAC score you know they did come down um three years ago I don't know um you know how you know a lot of other things about your health and everything else but you know over 100 is is sort of an area of concern that that's like okay there's there's a lot going on there it's going in the right direction not very fast but at least it's going in the right direction there can be a lot of other things that influence that as well so I think that you know you should still talk to your doctor you should still you know have input and medications I don't think necessarily that statins are a great idea um because there are a lot of studies that that show that hey look maybe these aren't actually as cracked up good as they're cracked up to be they'll also stop your body from making the large buoyant LDL they do nothing for the small dense damaged LDL so that's not very good you know it's a small dense damaged LDL that that have a stronger association with heart disease but again correlation is not causation so you can have something damage your your LDL cause the small dense LDL and also be damaging other things so is it the small dense LDL that's causing that or is a small LDL a sign of of other damage being done in your body as opposed to that's now going to go cause problems but either way it doesn't reduce the sdldl it only reduces the large buoyant LDL which is good that's what your body is making on purpose in order to run your body and your and your health so there's a lot going on there I don't necessarily think that anything's too far out of whack but that's a very small snapshot of your overall health and so I can't really give you any specific advice so you know if you do have concerns you know talk to your doctor if you're feeling good and doing well that's a good sign so you know keep that in mind and if you have any specific uh questions uh you know you should talk to your doctor thank you and we've got a question here for Cassie from Bella Brad for you thank you for the Super Chat Cassie what do you feel has been the hardest part of your journey looking fabulous by the way oh thank you Bella you 'll be times and if if you're not familiar with my background I did have colon cancer it'll be seven years in September um surgery it had metastasized to one lymph node um but after my pet scan came back clear and I was still diagnosed six months of chemotherapy that didn't sit right with me so I refuse that and I decided to heal my body by way of diet well the problem with that is I like food way too much and knowing that cancer for me I mean is still very scary and I thought it could return at any moment I would slip and go back to my old ways eating that garbage food um so being My Own Worst Enemy is probably the hardest thing knowing what harm I could be causing myself however through this process the gaps I'm I don't even know the last time I had a slip or what you could even consider a slip um the gaps are longer in between slips and when I do slip it would be just something Min very small very small so you know um I beat myself up with that I I still am a little concerned about that because we did slip three times on the channel and even for a few months feeding myself sugar but uh that was the hardest thing was getting over myself getting over the fact that food is entertainment or it's Comfort I mean you can still make it Comfort a state can be very comforting in fact but um yeah so that was it but it's it's also you know a blessing and a curse because I've learned from it so my biggest downfall was you know my best thing that the biggest learning experience that I've had so thank you for that question and best wishes to you and you and you do look fabulous tonight it's like Beauty and the Beast on here tonight you know and so like honestly you you really have done phenomenally I've told you this just because you know we've traveled the journey for the last year together you know you're definitely not the same person like you can see the transformation you know in your in your life over the last year so I'm convinced that you know you get stronger you learn what works what doesn't work you learn where you're weak and where you're strong you learn to guard your strengths just like you guard your weaknesses because you know oftentimes that's a lot of the places where you're going to get attacked if you're not guarding your strengths oftentimes that you know you can get attacked in those places as well so it's it's I'm thankful that you were able to join us tonight and I love Larry but man it's so much you know Beauty and the Beast is you know a great show tonight thank you I love you guys too thank you so um Cassie another one um Beth has sent us super uh Super Chat thank you very much Beth thank you Cassie I have the same problem for the same reason colon cancer surgery but I can't get it to settle down taking a gamble leaving the house it is a gamble they and oftentimes it comes without warning um like I said you you have to time your meals I I found that when I eat pork belly just a little bit too much like oh that was a big mistake you know maybe uh one ounce and not five because it's very fatty I just we have to learn to adjust now and this is actually something I'm glad this got brought up because I was going to ask Dr chafee about this you know it will it ever be normal again I've I've roughly have 18 to 24 inches of large intestine that has been removed once in 2015 and then in 2016. so is there a chance like with the ox bile is there something that you might recommend for both Beth and myself to maybe help things out or is it the same thing with the gallbladder that is you just got to time your meals it is what it is and just keep chugging along well it's yeah it's foreign it's highly individual and some people do you know get you know their body does compensate sort of down the road but you know I mean these organs you know do have a specific job and if and if too much of it is removed then they aren't able to perform that job unfortunately and so if you have your colon taken away or a large portion of it taken away you know it's its job is to you know quite a big job is to you know dehydrate you know the Kyle that's coming out and just sort of turn that into solid form stools so if if you've got a much smaller area you know it's not going to have as much of an ability to do that and so you might find that that you're not able to dehydrate those things as much as you would otherwise does that that doesn't mean drink less water you know because you don't want to like you know get get uh dehydrated metabolically either but um it's uh it's something that unfortunately you know may continue to cause a problem there are different surgeries that can that can cause sort of Kinks and turns to to sort of slow things down to solidify a bit more and be a bit more uh you know easy on your system but that's not necessarily a perfect solution and uh and it's probably not even an option for for everybody um and it's probably you know something that a lot of people will want to avoid anyway so unfortunately it's it's sort of a time will tell if your body you know adjusts and then you're able to sort of adjust different things that you're eating in a way that that affects a change great and it might be that your body's able to sort of compensate in time but um I wouldn't I wouldn't uh Bank on it anyway you just have to sort of see and hopefully your body does does compensate and then just you know do what you're doing logistically and try to you know eat certain things that don't cause more of a problem and and unfortunately uh yeah it's not and not necessarily going to going to get better or or be perfect anyway it must just might have to sort of figure out the best way to to deal with the situation unfortunately well there's our answer Beth uh quite frankly that was the most disappointing answer I've ever had I know well but the thing is I mean it could get better but I mean there's no guarantee you know and so there's you know it's very hard to say you know if something's going to get better and um however you know uh there are different ways of sort of manipulating things in the way you're eating and what you're doing that that can at least improve things uh in that manner as well so just sort of fun just like the you know the thoughts about just spacing out your meals you can do that with bile you can see if there's there's different things that you can do that doesn't give you uh the problems that that you you would have with other other ways of eating thank you and certainly fiber is not going to help you because that's just that's just all going to come out in a disastrous sort of fashion so yeah yeah so either way what were you doing now is still going to be better and an improvement yeah thank you so lightning round the carnival Road thank you for the super stick uh the Super Chat so being in different parts of the world what are each of you going to do right after the live stream ends you all are great okay so for me um I'm gonna go and eat a steak Sean how about you and now that I was gonna go to bed but now I'm kind of thinking about another steak too man you know no I re I'll probably end up going to bed it's uh it's already about 10 30 so I'm I'm exhausted hmm can I see you um I will probably have a little conversation with Larry and um yeah get ready to hit the hit the hay it's uh it's getting close to bedtime yep what are you gonna do I'm gonna uh I was gonna say I'm just gonna uh snuggle up next to my wife and say something real nice to her and then uh goodness um well what what I was planning on doing it's it's sunny here in Perth but it's also horribly cold so I was actually gonna go jump into the the water and do like a cold plunge sort of thing because I just I hate myself and I want to obviously punish myself and so I'll do that and jump in there um hate my life for a few minutes and then like take a shower and then I might go to the gym and get a bit of exercise in because I have I have actually some free time today uh that I'm not I'm not jam-packed with a whole bunch of stuff so I'll probably do that probably work out and then I've got just a you know a ton of of uh you know work and reading and writing on the computer stuff to do so that'll be my my day and then tomorrow I'm going which is great now you got to get it on camera now since you said it you got it you gotta get get Ella to God get her to get her to film it you jumping in that water honestly that cold water no I'm just kidding yeah yeah I'm such a baby about the cold and I just hate it but like it's yeah I don't know it's um people tell me it's good for me I don't know so and I do feel better when I do it actually funny enough so you know just do it just you know man up and do it nice okay so Tina Cox uh since uh since Super Chat oh super sticker and also Araceli thank you very much guys um we're we're gonna have to um close this out soon but I was just wondering if we get a couple more questions we've got uh one from Michael here I do omad in the am one to a hundred one to one and a half pounds of steak or burgers with cheese and eggs bacon butter UPS driver and I left if I'm hungry after work would eating dissociation again lead to Fat gain via gluconeogenesis I've just got someone at my hotel room door can I pass this on to you for a second Sean yeah sure man um like I I I've mentioned this before and the best of my understanding and you guys can correct me if I'm wrong gluconeogenesis is the body's way to maintain homeostasis for the needs of your body body's demand is correct so you know when you think of that process going on it's your body signaling you know hey we need whatever it is you know glucose and the body is taking those nutrients and creating what you need with what it what you're giving it so yeah I mean if you're my number one thing is if your body signals are working properly and they're telling you you're hungry you need to eat you know I when my body tells me to eat like in a few minutes you know whatever whatever it is I'm going I'm going to listen to it and I'm gonna go eat and then I'm not gonna eat until my body is like hey you're hungry you need to eat that I don't have a scheduled time to eat usually it's about ten and two every day but I don't stick to that it's not Ashton Stone you know so it's it's it's important to learn to listen to your body and don't try to like put your body on a routine an unrealistic expectation of I've been to eat at 7 12 and 5 you know because your your chances are you're probably just not hungry at that time you know so listen listen to your body signals and and when they start signaling you it now if they're not working properly obviously you gotta you gotta just plan for that and work with it and see if you we you know you can get your hormone signals functioning correctly by putting the right nutrients in there and healing that outside of that I mean that's that's what I got um what you got Cassie um glucogenesis other than the explanation that you just gave I didn't even know what that was honestly um when you're hungry until the meat no longer tastes good and feel good that's the only advice I have for you yep I was gonna say that if I tried to uh if I tried to like overeat or like if I tried to eat a ton of food in one meal and then later on eat a ton of food especially if I'm eating the right kind of nutritious food like beef or steak or something like that like my body's gonna tell me I might be able to do it for a day or two days or something and like force a lot but my body's gonna tell me look dude you're having so much food and like you'll all naturally start backing off I don't have to tell myself how much food to eat in a day my body just kind of tells me like hey about two pounds of meat sometimes two and a half pounds of meat is like my sweet spot yeah well I think I think if you're exactly as as everyone said if your body's telling you what to eat then you know and as long as you're not eating carbs and lectins and all these other sorts of things that can derange your hunger signals uh you should just listen to that you know sometimes people when they're when you know they're doing a whole bunch of different dieting and other sorts of things they can derange their hunger signals they can derange their hormones they can derange their leptin and maybe there's going to be an imbalance of what your body's telling you what's actually actually perfect uh but that that normalizes over time and and so you just need to just give your body what it what it needs and what it wants and uh and then you'll it'll it'll sort itself out in the wash long term so um you know in general uh if you're if your body's telling you uh to eat more just just have a bit more like that's totally fine you know you're you're working out you're lifting you're you're working a physically demanding job you know that's fine give your body food so you know we're all going to need a slightly different amount of food um I I often eat around you know two pounds plus a very fatty steak if I'm working out I eat four easily right so it just depends on what your body's doing so if your body's asking you for more food and you're only eating meat if you're only eating what we're supposed to eat then I think you can listen to your body's signals some people very few people such as Kelly Hogan might find that while their health is improving a lot of and their energy and all these other things are getting better their weight's not really getting better and then about six months later all of a sudden it does get a lot better I think that's that that hormonal disruption that uh you know had to had to sort of fix and normalize almost that got down to a normal level then then the weight started coming off for her and others um but either way that's not going to happen unless you're giving your body what it's asking for as well so just just give everybody what it's asking for and and remember this is a long-term game right so this is just think about that is that's like you're doing this just for the rest of your life is the healthiest way that you can eat just keep doing this and over time in the long run you'll you'll see the improvements that you want um if you don't mind uh may I ask you a question Dr Chaffey uh this is something I was very curious about and I know a lot of our listeners would be too because um a lot of us we tend to slip so my question really is how dangerous is it for us to go from burning fat to burning carbs getting back into getting back into ketosis and back out you know when you're weaving in and out of that how dangerous is that for us metabolically or is it just that our body can compensate no our body's pretty good at compensating you know if you're not if you're not eating carbs for a very long time for several months uh your body's just not going to you know to pre-load insulin in your pancreas um and so this is why some you know some less well thought out studies and and people have said that that uh being on Inky tells us for a long time can and can increase your and resistance even though your blood sugar is normal the whole time your insulin is low the whole time so it doesn't really make too much sense on its face but then they say oh well you give you give people on ketosis uh long-term ketosis uh glucose tolerance test and and it's raised so that means it's insulin resistance no it means the glucose was raised what's the insulin you know insulin's still low so it's like okay well then there's no resistance right because insulin is low right and then the insulin starts coming up and you get that insulin response and blood sugar comes down uh what's happening there physiologically is that you're just not pre-making the insulin uh if you were if you were have a chronic exposure to carbohydrates which are damaging to your body having those be elevated uh to to such an extent then your body going to pre-make insulin because it's like hey we've got to be right on right on the on the border on this you know it's like if you're right you're ready to go and so you're going to pre-make insulin it's going to be ready to go bang it comes out you eat carb bang it comes out well if you're not doing that you're not exposing yourself to that you're not going to build up that like tolerance to alcohol right you know if you're if you're if you're drinking a bunch of alcohol all the time it takes more and more alcohol to get drunk because your body's protecting you more yeah you build up that tolerance so you build up these tolerance to carbohydrates with uh that pre-made insulin and uh and then you eat carbohydrates after being in ketosis or on a ketogenic diet for a long time and all of a sudden you know you don't have you have a bit of a weird response but in a couple days your body will say like oh okay this is idiots eating carbs again we have to start pre-making our insulin and so your body adapts pretty quickly so while you may have a bit of a of a jump in your blood sugar that comes down in in Fairly short order and then you find that people are actually more insulin sensitive they need less insulin to get a better response so their insulin levels actually stay moderately low they don't have to have these massively High insulin levels in order to bring their blood sugar down to a normal level and they'll actually get a better response with less insulin and it'll be quicker so in a couple days their glucose tolerance test will actually be better than the average you know non-insulin resistant person so I don't think that there's there's much of a problem uh I don't think there's there's more of a danger going back and forth than than just you know just eating and carbs and things like that on a normal daily basis you're going to be you're going to be better off in the periods that you're not eating all these carbs and you're in and you're just eating what we're supposed to eat and your insulin level is is being maintained at the lower level going back and forth I don't think causes too much problem except for that that initial sort of bump in your blood sugar which we'll normalize in a couple days the only main thing that's doing to you when you do slip off uh you know is it just it's just going to take a bit of time to get back into it you know you're going to have to you're gonna have a bit of a lag and you know you're gonna have to sort of get you know switch on and off you know the different genes that that uh you need to to run optimally with uh without carbs and so you just you have a bit of a slip up this chunk is going to stay in your system for a while you're going to have a bit more inflammation you're going to have a bit less ketones you're going to have a bit of this these plant you know toxins and things like that they're just going to take a few days to clear out of your system but they'll go you know so you know you're not kicked off the team you're not out of the club you know if you just sort of slip up you know it's it's this these sorts of things happen and uh you know just just be mindful of it and say okay well I'm just going to get back on right away so it's just the main thing is to get straight back on the horse you know and so you slip up you have a thing and you just use that you look at things like hey I'm not actually feeling my best my energy is not great I'm store I'm sore I'm stiff I've had a you know autoimmune flare up and I don't want that I don't want that crap anymore and so use that to gear yourself you know and steal yourself against slipping up the next time as well thank you [Music] thank you so um we're about time guys so just before we just before we uh just before we say goodbye I I just wanted to say if we didn't get to your question um please feel free to post the questions in the comments below the video anytime and we will um do our best to get back to you it just is one final thing before we head off I wonder if we could just do this uh this quick question as a bit of a lightning question so what is the strangest most unique or crazy meat that you have had and did you like it um and uh I guess I'll go with uh emu um it's uh I guess in Australia not so crazy but uh it's a bit different for people not living in Australia or South Africa and uh it's it tastes good but it's not very fatty okay so that's the only problem with that uh Sean how about you oh the craziest now like uh crowded crawdads alligator bear um short well we used to have this thing every once in a while at church this uh they call it a beast feast and everybody would get this exotic meat and they would bring something different and that's that's about as crazy as stuff as I've ever had but this was a long time before I ate carnivore too so uh Cassie what about you oh yeah I've had crawdad too I've been to my uh crawfish broil um but the best thing I've ever had and it's in way of pork it's a Berkshire pork chop and oh my gosh it is the steak of all pork chops these are heirloom pigs and just the way they're fed and the rays are absolutely phenomenal so if you can get your hands on a Berkshire pork chop I highly recommend it [Music] I would say for me uh I I definitely have ate pretty much everything that they just said especially the two of y'all that are from the south because I eat all that stuff but uh uh as well another thing that I love to eat that some people think is crazy but like don't knock it till you try is which I don't eat it anymore because I'm carnivore but I used to love to eat fried frog legs and a lot of people are scared to eat frog and they think it sounds weird but fried frog legs if you gig them they are super good what about you Dr Taffy well I've had I've had fraud frogs like frog legs when I was a teenager and they're actually delicious um that was yeah only once I've only seen it once but uh no those are great oh I've I've tried to eat sort of most animals that I can get my hands on like so when I was in South Africa you know there's just a lot of different animals that you have access to that you just can't get anywhere else so I've had ostrich ostrich was good I haven't had emu uh I'm assuming they're probably fairly similar the ostriches yeah yeah so you know the ostrich sort of tasted like just sort of beefy chicken and that was just sort of a weird little combination but you know that was just just sort of beefy or chicken and and they had like Eland springbok kudu uh those are some of the the other animals that I had there I've had crocodile that was cool I'd always wanted to eat one of those monsters and um you know it's obviously better if you've if you've haunted it and taken it down yourself and it's a bit more of an accomplishment but um I've eaten one of them they have not eaten any of me so I think that's a win in that regard and um um but yeah other other sorts of I guess rattlesnake I had at one point um gosh what would be the most bizarre things I can't think of it but I mean you know there's there's a lot of weird stuff out there and I think those are some of them nice okay so um everyone thank you so much for joining us we've had like uh the busiest times we had over 600 people in the streams that was awesome um and uh can I see any final words oh well thanks guys this was a blast I I would love to uh hook up with you guys sometime in the future and um
