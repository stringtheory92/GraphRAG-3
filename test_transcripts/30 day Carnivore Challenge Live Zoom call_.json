    "title": "30 day Carnivore Challenge Live Zoom call!",
    "transcript": "more calories and so i'm a little bit concerned because uh like i'm just like what is reasonable and you know i love going on instinct because like when when i sit down and eat it's like i'm devouring it you know almost as fast as i can or i have no interest so i love that that that part is fantastic but i'm just like i'm a little nervous about like how much i'm gonna be eating when i do start working out again and well yeah well i mean however much you eat it's going to be what your body wants right you know and so um you'll yeah you'll probably increase your appetite a bit but you're still going to preferentially use you know your excess fat tissue you know and so your body's going to use that first i mean there were days when i was um trimming down that that like i didn't even want to eat at all and you know and i did like a crazy workouts you know i was like three four hours of lifting you know two three hours of you know rugby just dead sprints the whole time and i was just like yeah i've worked out for six hours i'm going to be working out for six hours tomorrow like i have to eat i have to eat because like you know i i'll need that energy not you know obviously you know not recognizing the fact that i had weeks maybe months of energy already in my body and and no i didn't need to eat and uh and like everything says just like don't eat a steak this steak sounds awful and i was like but i have to i have to and i try like forcing myself i'm like i'm just not enjoying this and that's when i first really started figuring out that like you know taste was a very really good marker of that and things are going to taste better or worse depending on on how hungry you are and and so you may find that your appetite increases a little bit but you know if it does it's okay yeah your body wants that yeah exactly and um you know when i trimmed down until my stable you know body composition my my appetite doubled you know and because now i wasn't using my stored body fat i i needed i need to get all my daily energy from my food and and so it was actually a lot so i was like doubling what i was eating and so you know that just shows you how much energy your body's going to be using of your own um okay of your own stores and then now when i work out yeah my body wants to use you know wants to bring in energy for that so my appetite will double you know and so crazy you know but but at the same time you know when you when you're before you get to that state you know you probably you know you may or may not see a difference in it but if you do it's okay that's what that's what your body wants so that's okay yeah i just i feel like i'm getting like still going back and forth with like how much i eat like i'll lean out for and it'll drop in like a week and a half and then i feel like for a few weeks i'll start bulking up so i think i'm pretty sure the composition is changing which is great but um i think through all this just strictly carnivore thing i haven't seen i mean i did keto for such a long time and then mostly carnivore for a while and then but it wasn't until i did all like no plants did i have tremendous benefits like i used to be one of those people that was always cold i had cold hands cold feet 100 of the time summer outside you know like it is now but now i run hot like now i just like radiate heat from like my upper chest and neck and that right there that's totally worth it to me like right there i was just like oh my gosh i'm not cold anymore like it was it was amazing and so i'm just like this is exactly what my body needs and this is i i thrive on it my i can't believe i'm not on any caffeine i can't believe that i have the energy that i have so this is just thank you thank you for doing this well though look you you're doing the hard work you know and so you know you're uh you're doing great and that's that yeah i i think it just makes such a massive difference just getting rid of that last little bit of stuff and and so it's great that you you've seen that for yourself and then uh and and are getting the benefits of it so that's great yeah yeah thank you no problem all right tom you had your hand up next i'm sure let me can you hear me yeah can hear you okay yeah i guess my question is um back to last week i think you were talking about blood glucose and levels that they should be at and i've been carnivore about two and a half almost three years now um i don't test my blood glucose all the time but i do test it occasionally and i just wonder um i understand the dawn effect but my blood glucose always runs like between 110 in the mornings um the only time i ever seem to get it under 100 um maybe down in the 80s is if i fast for more than 24 hours is his blood glucose the dawn effect or the blood cousin google close in the morning a concern that it's that high or not necessarily i mean you know you weren't you weren't coming from a background of diabetes or anything like that no no um no like you know in the morning you know we're going to we're going to secrete our highest amount of cortisol cortisol will raise your blood sugar you know um and uh is what you we give people steroids that mimic cortisol in the hospital just screws with their blood sugars you know their blood sugars just slam up so that's that's a normal response you know that's just this is part of your you know just the daily fluctuations in your hormones and your blood sugar as a result of that um you know i mean have you checked your hba1c or anything like that no um i mean you could i mean you don't need to i don't really i really don't go to doctors i don't know you don't want to hear that yeah i know i like hearing that i don't think you know i would rather people didn't have to go to doctors stop gap you know they shouldn't just be you know like like somebody's just like just everyone's just reliant on them just so they just don't fall apart and die but that's like that's that's what it is now because everyone is just falling apart and dying and so no i i really like hearing when people don't go to television i don't i don't have any issues that i deal with i mean i feel healthy and fine and i just test the blood glucose every so often and that's pretty much it you know i don't know if there's a better time of day to test it it's consistent you know i mean it's the thing is if you're just testing at the same time every day at least you know what you're tracking right and so you can you can check when things are are sort of going off and if something's affecting you in a different way you know you can try it you know before you eat sort of after you eat a couple hours after you eat you'll see you'll see minor variations especially in the time of day but i think at the end of the day your body's doing what it's supposed to do you know if you're eating pure right and so you're not getting any carbs any artificial sweeteners anything like that um then your body is just going to work you know uh you know you you know most people have a bit of insulin resistance and a bit of you know pre-diabetes even if they're not diabetic um just because of all the high octane crap that we've been eating our whole lives but you know you haven't been eating that stuff in a few years now and so a lot of that damage is going to be undone if you were curious you could get an hp a1c that's really the only thing that's really going to make any uh you know sort of you know the only thing that's really going to matter you know all these tests are just a snapshot in time so you take your blood sugar that's that's a snapchat at like that moment in time but that's not necessarily indicative of what else is going on uh so an hpa1c is a three-month snapshot so it's better it gives a better piece of information and it sort of gives you an idea of what your blood sugar control has been uh for three months but you know you're not if you're you're eating just carnivore it's gonna be fine you know so even if you came from a background of diabetes you know some people you know i was keto maybe a year and a half prior to that and i just did a sean baker one month challenge and i haven't turned back so good yeah well that's the idea that's the idea of these challenges is that it just sets up a pattern of behavior that that you can then follow for the rest of your life you know because it's you know it's not a you know it's not a crash diet you know it is it is optimal living and uh and you know getting that mentality of like this is just this is just the optimal way to live and i feel really good like this i want to keep living like this that's that's the idea is to try to give people support so that they can they can achieve that and they can get that that that basis so that they can just carry this forward you know and then just keep going forever so the test is an hb a1c yeah hb so for hemoglobin a1c okay my last question is um does adidas sponsor you because that seems the only hat you ever wear yeah i wish yeah we'll have to see you know this this is literally the only hat i've ever found that i actually like the look of every every other hat just looks weird on my head like i just my head's like too big it's not like my dad my dad's head my dad can't even can't even wear hats like you know if you um you look at like little straps on the back um he'll he'll like be like the very last snap and it will like barely fit on his head it's like all like stretched out like that it's like it looks it looks funny and so you know i'm the op i'm the opposite my head's too small to wear hats yeah um yeah so i i wear hats and they just look stupid i hate them and then um my buddy um that i grew up grew up with uh one of my best friends growing up i was visiting him down in phoenix and he had a hat like this i was like oh that was a cool sort of dry fit material you know he's in phoenix so if you're hot is very breathable and and all that i was like okay you know and um and i just got it and actually actually looked decent on me so you know when i've been you know i'm just going off night shifts at the hospital so you know i was at the hospital all night and you know i'm wearing a stupid scrub cap my hair is all screwed up and i'm just like i'm just put on a hat i'm i'm not gonna bother um so yeah when i have when i have uh the opportunity to do you know uh make my hair look presentable then i'll do that and otherwise i just stick on a hat because i just don't care especially when you have like like hat hair scrub hat hair is worse than normal hat hair and so it's just like no i'm not gonna i'm not gonna do that but yeah i should talk to them about getting sponsored that would be awesome yeah i'm done okay all right yoga you had uh your hand up uh yeah i mainly wanted to provide an update because uh i actually i start from the beginning of the year i started transitioning more into increasing my meat intake but i didn't really start um going towards carnivore until i moved into the housemen now which would have been about three months ago or almost four months ago actually and so i took this challenge to kind of stamp out all the stuff that i was still um eating or drinking while supposed to be on the carnival diet like you know coffee and i was still putting spices in my food and that sort of thing so uh if anything it's been good to [Music] change my behavior that way um and i like i ran into a little i ran i ran into a few sort of minor issues i think because like there was a stage where i was going to the gym and like what i would normally lift i was suddenly struggling and that sort of thing and i think that came down to me not eating eating enough the previous night because i work out faster in the mornings um but yeah i think i think over the course of this year dropped 26 kilos right and and it's kind of in the last couple of weeks it's kind of stuck around the 80 mark because i'm five six so like it's stuck around the 80 mark but i think that's more because i'm building muscle mass because i'm so like in the last few weeks in particular i'm more able to push myself harder at the gym and i instead of doing a set amount of uh instead of doing a set amount of reps per like per exercise i'm pushing myself to failure which is actually something i picked up from one of your past videos so i just thought i'm gonna try this and uh yeah and so i think that's probably more of the reason why because you know i've been pretty strict this last 26 days or whatever it was so you know i've cut out the coffee which i didn't i thought i would react more to the cutting out of the coffee than i thought but uh compared to some of the people at my workplace um i don't actually i was drinking one or two cups a day with some people at my workplace because we're all shift workers so they'd be drinking five six that have the pot next to them i'm like okay i don't drink that much coffee now yeah but but it's been a good experience for me good you know and that's really good about the working out as well i think that makes the biggest difference is is working to failure and uh and i mean that that's even independent of that you know i i've always said that and that was something that you know dr jaques was saying as well you know when you go to failure it makes a big difference and that was why um you know he was saying like with this x3 bar thing that was something you could you really go to failing and then doing those half reps and those you know quarter reps and things like that until you you just you just exhausted everything and um and that that he you know he found that that was beneficial and the studies show that that's beneficial i just noticed that just just in my own training that that was that made the difference that you know if i did 10 you know it was it was struggling with 10 it was just like oh okay fine but if i if i just really went and i did 12 you know and failed and hit that failure point maybe had someone spot me and do 14 you know that's when i really got very very very good results whereas otherwise you're just sort of maintaining you know you have to challenge yourself there's no growth in a comfort zone so you know if you're you're always always challenging and straining or you're just remaining constant and you're not going to grow so yeah so that that that's uh that's great that you've been doing that and yeah that you know that that's why we you know i tend to you know try to have people avoid checking the scale all the time because it's you know you're going to replace fat with muscle and so you're looking like oh i'm not really losing weight but like your body's just transforming you know so it doesn't really matter what the scale says you know what matters is your health how you feel and you know and and eventually how you look which is i i still think is the secondary outcome you know the main thing is being healthy feeling good that's that's the main main thing and you know the aesthetics and uh and and weight loss is is is a nice bonus but the main thing is being healthy and feeling good yeah yeah i agree good all right so anyone else have uh updates they want to share how they're doing sandra you want to share anything um well i said the other day that my blood pressure was better but in the last two days it's been like 143 over 84 something like that so it's in the i get a red because i have one of these um blood pressure cuffs it's either green yellow or red right and i did test it and when i went to my doctor i did my can you hear me yeah you can hear you oh okay when i went to my doctor i had they tested my blood pressure and then i used my little thing to test it so we could see if it was accurate and it was so now i'm trying to figure out what did i do um i don't think i did anything other than work is a little more stressful um but would that make that big of a difference i don't know well it can and you know it can also be you know this thing called white coat syndrome where you know if you're thinking about it you know and oh uh huh yeah so so white coat my coat syndrome is where you know the doctor comes in a white coat and you're like he's gonna check my blood pressure and like oh hope it's slow and oh my god and your blood pressure just spikes and they find that like five minutes later after the dude leaves you check your blood pressure again and it's you know it's 40 points down so you know you can um you can certainly jump up your blood pressure just by being a bit worried about things and uh and thinking about them and you get down this this spiral where your blood pressure is a little off so every time you check your blood pressure you're just a little anxious and which is going to keep your blood pressure a little up and all up and all that sort of stuff so um you're just just when you're taking blood pressure sit down like take your blood pressure um but take your time with it sit down take a breath calm down do a couple deep breathing and wait five minutes and then take check your blood pressure on average you'll you know people will find that their uh blood pressures are significantly lower uh when they do things like that so you can try that um you know if you're if you're you know you know avoiding all you know plants and carbs and sugar and artificial sweeteners and coffee and things like that um you know your body's going to do a lot better than it than it would otherwise you know there's there are multiple reasons uh for high blood pressure and chronically high blood pressure and there are some that you know uh that need to be sort of ruled out generally once people have high blood pressure uh especially like very high blood pressure you know there are certain things that they just need to be checked on so i don't know if those if your doctor has checked those things with you but if it's none of those things then quite quite a lot of the time it comes from like you know insulin resistance in the uh in the arterials or arteries and and um and so that just takes time it just takes time to sort of settle down and you know you may need to be on a bit of blood pressure medication in the meantime until that that settles but you know eventually it should settle and um uh how long have you been doing carnivore now uh strictly well i started july 11th um but i was eating animal products like i did have some cheese and i did have some um well i was still drinking decaf coffee and i was putting half and half in it that was really about the only dairy i guess and i was eating other kinds of meat and so when i started this i started doing just the beef and the water and the salt but another thing that happened so i was on 40 milligrams of propanol and she bumped me down to 20 when i went to my appointment so then i was like well does it have anything to do with maybe the fact that i bumped down um [Music] maybe i don't know but you know but the thing is is that you know bumping down is a very good sign you know because it means that your body's repairing you know and that's and that is what we tend to see is definitely what we like to see and you know so that that's going in the right direction yeah maybe maybe you know maybe you would have been you know more optimized with a dose of 30 but you know they really come in you know certain doses and um so it could be it's just there's going to be a bit of an adjustment period and but i would expect you to keep going in that trend you know yeah 140 yeah you don't want to stay there your whole life but in the grand scheme of things it's not all that bad you know compared to a lot of people that are like you know in the 160s 170s 180s over 200 chronically you know these people are really straining their heart and they are you know really at risk of rupturing and hemorrhaging um you know when they just when they do this for but i mean but i'm talking years people will be on these things for years on end so i wouldn't i wouldn't be too hard on yourself for you know getting something at 140. uh yes it's not it's not optimal you know and and we want to get to optimal but your body's still healing you know you still got a ways to go uh your blood pressure will fluctuate you know when when you're working out you're doing this you're straining blood pressure is going to go up and so your body's your body's adapted and able to deal with transient rises and lowerings in blood pressure um and that's okay um you know so i would i would take that i would take time with it i would take you know five minutes deep breathing calm everything down and then check your blood pressure and you can check it a couple times a day check it consistently sort of in the same scenario same uh you know right in the morning right when you wake up or halfway through the day and you know at a specific time in a specific set of circumstances and then you know at night before you go to bed and you can just track these things and um you know and just again just calm breathing spend five minutes just sitting there next to the thing getting used to it not being scared of it it's your friend it's not your enemy you know it's it's going to be okay you know and um and then you'll be able to see it more accurately because it's very common for people to get a bit anxious when they're about to take their blood pressure especially if they're having blood pressure issues um and that will raise your blood pressure so you know yeah so i was wondering too she said that my a1c was 5.2 for the last three months um does that mean i don't have um uh insulin resistance yeah if really well no it means that your blood sugar control has been good but that doesn't mean that doesn't actually mean that you're um [Music] that you're uh you know that that's separate from insulin resistance oh how do i know if i'm insulin resistant then um there there are many different ways uh one way you know is good you know looking at your hba1c but you know it's a little different in a carnivore uh setting because you know you're not taking in exogenous carbohydrates and so you know you're not you're not going to be having these big spikes in blood blood sugars um but it's you know it's a good sign that that you're going in the right direction it's not it's not definitive proof that you're not insulin resistant though you know okay um just having blood pressure you know be a little high suggests is suggestive of that though you know and you know um you know and it's it's not to say that you're you're not hyperinsulinemic either because that's the thing your blood your blood sugar you're gonna make a certain amount of blood sugar just based on on need and um and and so that would be a certain level it's going to be a lot lower than it would be if you're eating carbohydrates it could be that your insulin is enough and that keeps it all regulated or it could be that you're a bit insulin resistant and so your body needs to jack up your insulin levels and your insulin production in order to maintain the blood sugar that your body wants okay and so that could that could be where you're at right now you know you know a way of getting more information on that is checking your insulin levels you know and so you look at your insulin levels your blood sugar control your hp 1c is good and then you check your insulin levels all actually you know have slightly high insulin levels well that would suggest that you're a bit resistant and your body's making a bit more and that's why type 2 diabetics can eventually burn out their pancreas or the insulin making portions of their pancreas the beta islet cells um because they just overworked them because you know you're you're you're you're chronically high blood sugar and you're making a lot of ins you're making insulin but it's not getting the same effect as your body makes more insulin to get that same effect and it's getting less and less effect when you're raising raising rates and you know just like any any drug you're getting resistance and you're getting tolerances and and and and uh you know you have to increase the dose to get the same effect and then eventually you won't get you will never get the same effect so you know it takes time you can check your insulin that might be a good way to but you know really it's sort of academic because you know uh whatever it is you know you're in the state that you're in and your blood pressure is going to be what it is and your and your body's going to work the way it is and it's still going to be optimal you know eating carnivore and not eating carbohydrates and so you know just just let your body do its thing it's going to stabilize at a certain place you know it might be that that place you know like for for some diabetics um insulin resistant or insulin dependent type 2 diabetics quite a lot of them stop needing insulin some of them don't though some of them need to to keep taking their insulin um but not that much they'll take a very small dose you know and so and that and that'll be just just as much as they need because they're maybe they're making insulin but they're not making as much because they really sort of harm themselves and um so maybe they just need a little bit of a boost so either way it is what it is and your body's healing and it's going to heal to a certain extent and um you know that can take that can take months that can take years you know the insulin resistance side of things probably won't take years but it'll certainly take months and so you know and and you know in the grand scheme of things you know it took you however many decades to get to this this state of health you know a few months it's not that long you know even even a few years is not that long you know and um you know especially that's that's the thing too you know obviously we like we like instant gratification but you know a lot of people like you know say this like oh you know you you know you may only be able to lose a couple pounds a month and that's how you have to look at you want to lose 10 pounds there's going to be five month process and all these sorts of things of hard work and dieting like that sounds miserable and um you know and and we're losing and we're losing 10 20 pounds in our first two weeks and people are just like oh but you know i it's been a month and i'm not you know you know competing in a bikini contest it's like all right well you know that maybe a little fast you know we're getting huge results and and and um and so sometimes we think because we're getting such big results you know we we want even bigger results but you know it's um you know it's quite it's quite amazing that we're even getting these results at all and we're able to reverse blood pressure issues and diabetes issues and autoimmune issues so you know just be patient with it you know you're doing great your body is obviously healing and your hbo1c is fantastic you know like i think that's you're right in the perfect range and you know and and you're coming off your meds which is you know all signs that that you're doing great so just yeah just just keep going with it and just let it happen it takes as long as it takes you know but it's but it's happening you know so that's good awesome well thank you yeah very much very welcome all right uh mary did you want to give us an update um sure um well i'm sticking to it i mean that's not an issue um so the 30 days has been fine i've i've just pretty much been doing the meet um mostly i started off with bison and [Music] i do quite a bit of lamb i don't do a whole lot of beef because i just seem to react to it more but i've done a little bit of pork and a little bit of turkey in there i've just been so um kind of like i guess a little frustrated and and surprised that i can't do the the as much fat as i want to right now um when i i started carnivore um april of last year and for nine months i really did a lot of high fat and that's what kept my cravings down and worked really well for me and then last january february i didn't do as much fat and i was adding in eggs and fish and [Music] dairy and a little bit of plant stuff not a lot but a little bit um [Music] and but i had to go back but the cravings came back um and that's one of the reasons i i signed up for the the challenge was because i wanted to go back to to just meat and and you know water and salt and fat and just see how i did so i've kind of been surprised that i haven't done as well with the fat as i wanted to considering that how long i've been doing this and where i started and um so but i'm hanging in there i really want to do this i really wanted to work so i'm just trying different things different combinations of fat and and meat to see but i always seem to have um minor issues and the symptoms seem to come and go i mean i might have a little headache i might have um the shortness of breath i might get hives i might get itching um um i get it that's with fats you're getting sort of itching and hives with with just increased fat is that what you're saying um well when i started the challenge i was doing the bison and a little bit of beef and probably for the first week or two i had itching in hives and i still get some itching um like my back you know i'll eat and then my back will start itching but it won't necessarily last it goes away or i might get a little hive and it goes away and so things seem to come and go i seem to do worse in the morning i'm not sure why but in terms of reactions or i might get fatigue you know i'll eat and then i'm you know i my energy drops and so um so i don't know if it's just i need to keep i mean i'm going to keep at it i'm not going to give up i'm not going back to plants um i really dislike plants as a food source they look pretty and they do but but as a food source i really have no desire um to go back to them so i only have to go forward and i think that so i'll just keep trying um keep working at it um yeah that's interesting that you know you get that that sort of reaction i mean i don't i don't i don't know why it would be fat that would be uh giving you that sort of reaction i mean there's obviously something in in the food well or in your environment in general you know but if it's if it's timing with every time you eat you get itchy and you get a bit of a rash you know i mean that that is certainly suggestive that there's something in the food that you're eating that's giving you a bit of a reaction and um you know so you can you sort of play with that and make sure that that is that is happening consistently every time because it could be something else in your environment as well that's that's kicking things off um if it is something that's just your food you know trying trying different foods and seeing what what works and what doesn't you know see if you know sort of grass fed finished animals uh you know work better you know potentially reducing your sort of your histamine reaction [Music] that way it is interesting that you're saying that you're more fat gives you these reactions normally people like gen yeah well just they more fat than their body can handle they just get you know loose stools and then you just pull back on that and um but if you're if your reaction reactions are more in the regard like some sort of allergy or something like that well then there's i mean there's probably something in there and like you know the the composition of the fat is going to be is going to be different in grain finish versus grass finished and so you might just be a bit sensitive to that you have you have you noticed that have you tried like sort of grass fed and finished uh fats and has that made any sort of difference were they both the same well i was doing the ghee um for quite a while and i'd started when just before the challenge started that's i switched over to the ghee because i thought it would be easier to digest and now that is organic valley and it's not i don't know that it's a hundred percent grass-fed grass-finished cows but the tallow um that i'm getting that should be completely grass-fed grass finished um from the butcher um and yeah i'm not sure if it's really if it's the fat or if it's the meat or a combination you know eating them together um or if i i don't know if i just have a weak digestive system um well no i mean if you're getting a rash and you're getting itchy like you're reacting to something you're getting a histamine reaction to something yeah you know so just it's just a matter of identifying you know what what that is and and eliminating it um [Music] you know ghee you know it's a it's a milk fat and you know and this was you know just clarified butter you know most dairy cows just eat grass you know they don't do that they don't do the grain feeds because they don't need to um you're not trying to fatten them up you just want them to just eat grass and make milk you know and um you know so they're quite often uh you know just grass fed and you know not always you know sometimes they're giving feed especially like in uh you know sort of drier months or you know um winter if it's like freezing cold you know they might be you know given feed but either way you know you should you certainly can find it and um you know it you know when did you start getting the the rashy sort of reactions um i've had them um the um hive stuff um i've had them for quite a while um even when i was eating some plants i was having them um now it has gotten much better it was only the first week or two when i started the challenge that it was really bad but now it's it's settled down and and it's better i was also thinking of maybe trying fish just to see how i react to that if it's an if it's any different or not um yeah so so i'll try the fish um i don't do a lot of poultry but maybe i'll try some of that just to again just to test to see um maybe with without fat yeah well i mean it's worth a shot i mean you need the fat that's good for you you know so oh yeah and i want the fat yeah i like fat i want the fat and i need it to maintain weight as well yeah and um yeah so yeah just experimenting around and see what see what you know uh helps or hurts uh is always good um you know if you're getting a direct response you know sometimes you eat and you just get a reaction well then that's you know sort of suggests that that's coming from something you ate if it's just sort of happening and it may not be perfectly aligned with when you're eating you maybe think about you know is there anything else in your environment that's contributing to this as well and anyone even you know even then you know you you can have things in your environment it could be delayed it could be a delayed reaction to food as well yeah and or or delayed reaction to something else in your environment you know and so that's true yeah sort of sort of you know time it and you can you journals are really um most people think like well i can just remember these things but if you if you sort of keep a journal of things you you actually see that you know different patterns end up showing up that you may not have noticed because you know everyone's sort of a victim of confirmation bias we sort of we sort of look at this and it's like oh it happened at this time that confirms that this this is what i thought but you actually realize that you know it's happening at other times too maybe and you're just not noticing it as much so if you have a journal and say okay you know this time of day this is what i was doing this is what happened and uh and you should and then you'll be able to sort of get patterns and it could be it's just like like clockwork you know like 15 minutes after you eat you get this rash you know it's like okay well there's something in your food and then you have like okay when i ate fish i got this reaction when i had you know turkey i did not get this reaction and you know you can go from there but you know i think i think having a journal and um and just keeping track of things uh methodically like that will help yeah i do keep a food log all the time but i've never found that it's been helpful in terms of being able to see patterns so you've been keeping track of the the rashes as well oh okay yeah and what what do you notice do you notice that it's just like clockwork after you eat every time no like i said the the symptoms come and go right okay well so that could very well be something independent of what you're eating as well you know okay yeah and so that's something you should you should think about you know because you know when you're when you're exposed to something you get a histamine response is generally quite quick you know your body hits it and just goes no not happy with this and you you blast out a bunch of histamine and um so you know if you're if you're reacting to your food you should get a reaction every time you eat food you know but if you're just getting a reaction seemingly you know independently of that then it's it's like more likely to be something else in your environment yeah so okay you know you can go back to eating fat yeah see how you go you know and it could be that it doesn't really change things you know or you know good so but you know if you're having sort of independent independent of eating it's it's likely something in your environment so you can think about you know what else is in your house and or in your surroundings that you're being exposed to you know and and you can keep track of it that way you know maybe you can you know it's just like oh okay every you know 20 minutes after i go outside this happens or something like that you know you can sort of try to see it that way and as well but yeah you know when we do a radical change in our diet like this you know quite often we think that you know we sort of pin a lot of things to to uh the change in our guides we think oh okay this is what this is this made me do this and it's just like well maybe it did maybe it didn't but you know there are other other factors that play as well so just yeah just keep that in mind thank you i will yeah no problem okay okay uh leslie did you want to have a question or a comment or anything maybe not okay and anybody else had any questions or simon do we have uh some questions that uh got sent in we do have one question sorry i'm just having a terrible day [Music] a she's concerned about a carotid artery anthony um and she is 67 now but when she was 45 her doctor heard a brew when she was when he was listening to her right carotid artery um couldn't find a blockage but found that she has a curve in one of her arteries and thinks that she's susceptible to blood clots because she's got thin arteries i believe so now takes that but is concerned about how much fat she should be eating um because of this issue with the brew and the carotid arteries yeah um should not be concerned at all uh you know you know fat cholesterol don't don't contribute to atherosclerosis i mean just the fact that you have higher um ldl cholesterol whatever it doesn't it's actually you know a lot of studies showing that there's no association between higher ldl cholesterol or higher saturated fat intake and heart disease or strokes and in fact finding reverse uh in inverse correlations so uh finding that as protective and so you know cholesterol again is never it was never the problem in the first place so i wouldn't worry about that it's uh i don't know is that highest sorry say that again ldl is 183. it depends on the units but like either way i don't i don't care i mean i it's just it's not it's it's not it's not something that you know we we built these um these reference ranges based on a false premise and um so they're meaningless they they are literally meaningless you know and so i don't attribute any meaning to them um so whatever the ldl cholesterol is doesn't really matter what matters is are you drinking alcohol are you smoking cigarettes are you eating sugar are you eating carbohydrates um those are the things that are going to contribute to heart disease you know the the cholesterol is going to be damaged by oxidative stress like from seed oils like from high blood sugar from eating carbohydrates like from sugar and fructose in particular is worse you know so it's not the cholesterol doing it the cholesterol is being is an innocent bystander that's being used in a heist it's like a hostage in a bank robbery you know and it's just like god goddamn hostage if only we didn't have hostages we would not have bank robberies you know and um you know it's like so you're blaming the wrong the wrong person here so um you know they're just getting caught up in the mix but yeah the the level of your of your cholesterol has has no indication on you know on heart disease because it comes from damaged cholesterol so just having more cholesterol doesn't mean you're going to have that that's not going to damage your cholesterol just by having more of it it's those other things that that cause harm so yeah i would i wouldn't worry about it from that standpoint you know you have a you have a bree you have you know um you can have anatomical variants and things like that that can predispose you for clots and all that sort of stuff that certainly has nothing to do with uh cholesterol though you know um so but that doesn't mean you can't get clots and things like that i don't know exactly what you know condition they have but you know they're saying something about about getting clots and then so but the cholesterol is not going to affect that though um i think it's um in that kind of that that state of in between where where you're you deep down you know that cholesterol cholesterol's not causing any heart issues and and that it's good for you but at the same time when she went and visited her doctor her doctor was like oh you should back off the liquid fat stop adding butter to things um you know go go easy on the fat consumption so i suppose it just sounds like it's one of those things where it's like just got this nag in the back of her mind like you know like could it be cholesterol no which you know these things do take a while to overcome like you um and so we all kind of you know that's a good thing about being in the community that everybody sort of supports each other and makes it normal to eat health and to just eat meat salt and water yeah um yeah i i don't know why the doctor would say that though that's that's very funny oh avoid liquids and why but why based on what you know so i don't know i don't know where that where that was coming from obviously you know people having you know misgivings and then being you know because look i mean i've looked into this thoroughly and um you know and i come from a medical background where i read a lot of these things all the time and so you know i you know i'm i'm happy to do that and i'm i'm very convinced of this but you know other people are are literally just going on faith and so that's obviously very i can be very nerve-wracking we're like oh you know are we sure and so that's that's totally fine uh you know i was i i was just more uh confused and perplexed by what the doctor said so that was a very strange statement but yeah i know it's totally normal to be you know a bit a bit concerned about um about this because you know we've been we've been told this for 50 years and and so you know now all of a sudden it's just like nope just do the exact opposite and like you know and then you want to you want to go into it but like it's yeah it can be certainly nerve-wracking um for everyone yeah no that's totally understandable but yeah no it's totally totally hasn't no you know but but that no that's not gonna that's not gonna certainly not gonna cause blood clots and it's not gonna uh cause atherosclerosis or anything like that yeah i mean i think i think that is fantastic i know a lot of the crew but you know i've had bob from the kitchen bench just grab a knob all the time yeah yeah right it kind of like it can get you between meals that little bit of extra thought yeah i i like butter you know yeah it tastes awesome you know so uh yeah i have no problem with butter yeah we had uh do we have other questions as well um maybe just tom can you give us an update on the on the x3 challenge how's it going um well simon do you have your x3 yet you wouldn't believe it mine has been at botany bay docking station for 10 days so every day i wake up in the morning and i check my fedex uh tracking link and i just add a day to my tally so i was in botany bay during the week as well so i was probably like you know 100 meters from it but i can't get it can you can you not let you pick it up bastards sorry it's like in one of those big you know holding warehouses i haven't it's just delayed way too late so i don't know maybe i'll maybe i'll get on hold with fedex for an hour this afternoon and try and speak to someone else good luck my x3 challenge is going great i mean i've i've pretty much committed to it i do um six days a week i do take a day off i mean i've had the x3 for about three years now and i've been i've gone in spurts where i'd do it for six eight months and then i lose track and but this past month i've really made a lot of gains bands are going up reps are going up i feel like i'm my my weight's going up a little bit but i'm leaning out so yeah that's good it is yeah and you you know yeah and you know what you're putting on on muscle and and yeah i can i feel like i i feel like it's a weird i don't know how to describe it but feel like my arms are tighter now yeah like around my biceps my chest feels i feel like when i walk my chest is in front of me not behind me mm-hmm you know it's like we're supposed to be yeah no it's good and um yeah and it's a nice testament that like you know that your hard work pays off and you you put in the work that's great you know and especially on a carnivore diet you're going to you're going to get way more results you're going to be able to work harder and and the hard work is going to pay more as well so you know it's good 20 minutes a day it's you know it's it yeah it's nothing you know and i'm doing these stupid videos like you know so that was like more of a pain in the ass because now i'm just like oh i just want to do my quick workout i'm like i said that stupid-ass camera so like that's like that's that's for me it's still not that big of a deal you know yeah well i have a good carnivore story for you guys yeah so i i play golf pretty much one state one day a week with a bunch of guys and typically never have dinner with them afterwards because what they serve i just won't eat so but last week instead of going and up dinner within that with the place we played they had prime rib on the on the menu it's like a perfect all piece of prime rib and these guys are all having bread and pastas and all the crap food then it comes time excuse me comes time for dessert and all these guys everyone this place is known for their sunday so they're all like i gotta have this sunday you got it that sunday you gotta they came to order for me and said well what do you want for dessert and i said the only thing interesting me for dessert i'll take another piece of prime rib they all they all laughed and thought i was kidding they said well and they said well if you'll if you could eat another piece of prime rib we'll pay for it so silly that's absolutely silly it's like that's a no-brainer yeah i got you know two for one prime room for dinner i only paid for one and eight two yeah yeah what is silly and it was easy yeah it's like don't don't threaten me with a good time like jesus exactly yeah i mean even if i was not hungry i would i would i would absolutely force feed myself no problem yeah i was hungry so i was eating steak yeah well and that's it too you know like you know i've i've i've rarely filled up at a restaurant you know like and so you know anytime i go out to dinner i will eat a steak first like every time you know because you're going out more for the experience yeah yeah you're going out yeah you're going out with experience you're not going out because you're actually hungry you know if you're hungry you just stay home and eat you know you're you go out because it's like a social experience and that's unfortunately what what it is now you know food used to be about eating and now it's just about like you know it's like you know catching up with your friends and being social you know you're going to breakfast brunch lunch dinner coffee drinks all these sorts of things like people just cannot spend time socially without putting something in their face like why like why why can't you just do things and talk you know and um you know but that's just that's just what we've grown into it didn't used to be like that you know and um but yeah so it's um it's uh i think it's just a waste of money going out to eat i don't know i was always it was like my dad um had that thought when we were kids he hated going out to eat because my mom was a great cook first of all so we had better meals at home anyway but we could get sort of different things you know because my mom would try to cook healthy low fat you know there's always always be meat there but you know china wasn't any sugary garbage and so you know we'd go out to eat and there would just be different things and it was just sort of an exciting little treat my dad hated it it was like just a waste of money you know it's just like it's not as good you don't get as much and it's just and it's crazy expensive and you got five kids too you know you're paying for like seven meals and like kids only eat half of it anyway so it's like screw that and um you know and as a kid i sort of resented that i'm like oh this is like we want to go out now i'm just like i'm totally of that mindset i'm like screw that restaurants are rip-offs you know and i cook better anyway you know i totally get that that mindset now you know so yeah so yeah well done getting the getting the second steak i'm with the tom i'm good yeah yeah that's good uh mary you had your hand up do you want to say something yeah i have i have a question about the x3 um i do resistance bands but not an x3 um i'm i'm a pretty petite person 5 2 98 pounds can i is it x3 is that too much for a small person no you're not allowed absolutely not yeah no it's fine they have resistance bands that are that are pretty light as well and um you know so you know the you know if you use resistance bands you probably do a lot of the similar things you know the x3 bar is you know it's just a bit better so it has the bands it has a lot of heavy bands too um you know if you're using lighter bands then that's um there's probably more available but um you know outside of the x3 system uh but you know having that bar and having something to link onto and we can you know push and pull and do all that stuff with that bar that's very helpful and then there's like a foot plate where you sort of tie underneath it and then you can pull up with that do shoulder presses and biceps and squats and and dead lifts and shrugs or whatever you want and and so you know those are helpful you could just step on them you'll damage the band you know eventually it'll break um and uh you could do that without the bar as well but they're just little conveniences and they make they do make things um a bit more convenient so and you could you probably even use the the x3 bar with the bands that you had as well and so you know if the the the lighter ones are too much then um you know you can use other ones tom you wanted to say something yeah i was going to say mary if you look my wife did the x3 bar 2 for a little while and she found that the bands that come with the system are a little bit heavier there's so she did the bar but then there's a company out there called sirius steel and they make bands that fit the x3 bar that are lighter that are lighter weight bands so that's probably what you would look at serious steel to get the bands for the bar that would fit your profile okay great thank you yeah so there you go so yeah so i mean and there are other band systems as well um that uh you might have different different sorts it was hard to tell you know everything's online and you're just having you just seen pictures of things and so you don't you don't really know um but uh yeah you know the the bar can just help make things a bit easier and you know effect and there there are you know if you if you're really just going after you just want like a bar and you have the other bands or you're going to get those other lighter bands from serious steel you may not even need to get like the whole x3 system you know because it's your your you know it's it you know it is it is expensive you know it's it's in the grand scheme of things if you're replacing gym memberships with that then it actually becomes you know you know profitable you know because you're not you're not spending money on gym memberships uh perpetually um but you know you're you're gonna be paying for a lot of bands that you're not you're going to use and there are other options you can look on amazon sometimes they'll have different band systems that are that are less expensive they're probably you know cheaper as material as well and not as well built like these are very well built you know i was very uh very happy with that with the quality of the craftsmanship but and i have no idea what the other ones are like um you know the xp bar sort of swivels as well so it latches on and it'll have a barbell swivel so as you're going it it stays oriented properly i don't know if the ones the the cheaper models do that you know it could be that they just hook on and that's it and it's just a bit more of a pain in the ass but you might be able to you'll find that in the description somewhere but you know there are others on amazon that that would be cheaper because they're not named brands and so if you just want the bar out of that maybe you can just get one of those cheaper ones just to get the bar and use with the different different bands because yeah you know the the other bands it comes with you know the lightest of them would probably be fine for you but maybe not for every exercise and so maybe you would need slightly different ones for them as well um you know so yeah just just uh okay see how you go thank you because i've been curious about it i mean i've seen um you know different things on it and i was just curious if it would be overkill for me no no i i think i think the bigger bands yes you know especially for certain certain exercises you know um but the lightest of the bands you know you will probably use that for different things i mean like you know like squats and things like that you're using your legs your legs are going to be stronger and um and so you you may be just fine with that one and maybe just fine for other things as well it may not even be enough who knows you know you may you may you know need a bit heavier band but um you know it does get you know for depending on what you're doing some of it you do want a bit lighter lighter weights and so yeah um because i feel like i think about for like the military so obviously the more you stretch these things out the more resistance there is right and so if you're doing something just sort of you know close to the chest or just sort of close the ground it's not going to be as much resistance but if you're going up above your head and doing shoulder press you're stretching that thing out as far as uh as any other exercise and so that's just going to have more resistance and so you know you're not going to be you're not going to be using the same the same resistance for that as you would um you know for bicep curls or something like that because bicep curls are here and shoulder press is up here you know and so you're going to increase the the the resistance a lot on that one as well so yeah you might need some thank you yeah no worries yeah i think there are there are really actually i have it right here these things as well these come with it and these are super light you know and these sort of attach onto something i'm sure and then you have even more you know lighter sort of things i've never used those so i have no idea but um you know they came in the box so presumably they're they're for those lighter sort of exercises as well but yeah cool um does anybody else have any any other questions or comments or or anything like that no simon we are we out of uh [Music] people people didn't really submit too many questions this time no i think we um thank you so much everyone yeah yeah yeah thanks everyone hopefully that was um you know obviously we had to adjust the time a bit uh this week just because i was on night so i apologize for that um probably could have ended up doing it in retrospect but you never know you never know when when like an emergency is gonna come in or something's gonna happen so um it's it's generally best to you know avoid things when i'm when i'm on call because uh yeah yeah i think things can happen at a drop of a hat and so all of a sudden you have this plan and then all of a sudden you have to just cancel it all so that wouldn't have been good uh next week should be my schedules is sort of back more to normal so i should be should be okay with that so as long as simon are you good for the normal time next week friday yeah yeah so it should be fine so yeah so um that'll be back to our normal friday time in in australia uh 6 a.m perth 8 a.m eastern states and so that'll be sort of afternoon uh early evening in the u.s tom yeah yeah um question so next week is beginning of september so that starts another month and you'll sign up tom so you'll be there i did i did sign up but i i don't know if you want to shoot a note out to everyone saying yeah if they want to continue on they should sign up yeah we definitely will this weekend i think anthony and i and he's been flat out doing nights nothing but out so we'll catch up and then we'll um we'll spend the messages out letting everybody know that it's time to start to sign up because i think thursday is the first of september right yeah so let me the second will be on okay so what um how many how many friday sessions or weekly sessions have we had was it four this time four was four maybe four again i think yeah okay all right yeah just make sure it wasn't like you know that um yeah we got at least four so otherwise we should add in another session or something like that um but yeah okay all right well great month great job everyone i you know it's been great to see everyone's uh updates and how how they've been doing and how everyone's been uh uh progressing hopefully everyone can just sort of roll this in to next month you know it's just like you guys did this for 30 days and you all did great and hopefully you felt the benefits of that and uh and now keep going you know like what we say in the clinic here we get people when we get them to commit to a carnivore diet say okay you know do 100 carnivore for 100 days you know and that and that sort of just sets that that tone and uh and then you know after the hundred day and then what about half for 100 days and do 100 more you know and so this is this is a lifestyle change okay so hopefully that's um that's set up the the base for you for everyone uh to then continue on and um and get uh you know more out of this and just continue this as a way of life because that's where you really get the benefits of it i mean this is this is this is going to give you optimal health for the rest of your life you know you can't get optimal health by just doing this for a month unfortunately you know it'll help it's better than nothing but you know if if you really want to be the healthiest that you can and live the best life that you can um and happiest life that you can like i don't i don't think there's really any other other way to do it than to to make your body and your and your mind as healthy as possible and and run on the most optimal sort of nutrition and eliminating out all the all the poisons so um keep it up everyone's doing a great job i'm really proud of all of you i'm really happy to see everyone in the chats you know doing so well supporting each other and um and updating each other with with how great they're going so just keep keep it up if everyone who uh joins in us joins us for the next um next round it'll be great to have you along and everyone else good luck with everything and uh hopefully you can continue this on and stay strong and and hold these uh those sort of principles you know in your mind all the time and just and just make it a way of life and uh and you'll just keep doing better and better i'm really excited for all of you absolutely and i might just quickly jump in um for everybody who participates next month uh we've got a new members portal that anthony and i have been working on um so it will be a slightly better experience whereby each day you unlock a new module it'll be a learning module that has um video content or written content or both and obviously there's no ads or anything you can just get straight into the learning so it's going to be a more immersive environment and you're still going to get the weekly calls with anthony and myself and we're still going to have a telegram group we're still going to have a facebook group but you're also going to get this portal um so you know it's going to be slightly better we're going to keep improving it every single time that's the idea and and any suggestions and tips that you guys have for you know better experience and you know what what might help us um you know help help you guys and help people uh always always open to uh hearing those it's definitely uh good to know yeah uh nicole i almost said leah yeah i know thank you one thing that i i guess i learned from um uh dr baker's rivero and one of his coaches raymond uh naison was about the priming and the getting to that thanksgiving full and i know like um on the telegram like i got a lot of responses that that actually helped like quit coffee quit um other things and i know for me like that made the cravings go away um so i think like uh talking about that more to help get people started to like it's kind of hard to to tell yourself okay i've got eat every meal till like i'm so full i could burst you know because they're so used to diet scoops limit what you eat um but i just i think that was a game changer for me like i i honestly i didn't believe i could do just me salt and water there was no way until i heard about that little tip and trick and then it was like seven days in i couldn't think about food because i was just so full and then it just like and then i like had to cut it down to like two meals a day and um but like for getting rid of cravings like that was a godsend like i don't know if i could have done it without that yeah well that's what that's what baker says is um how much should i eat and he says you know you just eat until the cravings go away you know you eat as much as you need until you don't get cravings funny enough to spoke to uh raymond today um yeah i was on um uh you know bella steak and butter gang uh i think i was like a guest guest q a sort of thing and and he was on there and he's one of the coaches on there and he asked uh that question you know what what do i think about priming and uh you know i think i think it's a good i think it's it's good i think it's a good idea you know as i i've said um a lot you know many times you know a lot of people will tend to under eat because your hunger signals change so dramatically you never feel hungry in the traditional sense and so it's very easy to not eat enough and that's when you're going to run into the cravings because your body is going to your brain is going to start asking for food and energy but it's asking for it in different ways and you're just not see you know hearing the signals and then all of a sudden you're going to get cravings like oh i want that you know donut or whatever and that's just your brain get some guard jam calories in here and yeah and you know so so i think priming is sort of an elegant solution for that where you're just you're just you're you're making sure that you get everything and then and they'll force you to sort of start noticing what hunger actually feels like yeah yeah and you know i always go by you know taste obviously when things taste good that means you're hungry when they don't taste good that means they're you know your your body doesn't need those nutrients anymore and so um you know i think that that uh it's not something i've done you know so i can't speak from personal experience but just just the concept of it you know uh seems like a good idea and and and can make sure that i mean at the very minimum it's making sure people are getting enough it's very easy to not get enough you know when i when i started this 22 years ago i had no idea it was going to change my hunger signal so much and so i was never hungry there were there were multiple days like four days in a row where i wouldn't eat because i just wouldn't even remember to you know and and i was you know i was up early straight into you know classes at you know university of washington and the second i finished classes i was straight down into you know uw rugby practice the second i finished there i was straight over you know to uh the seattle men's practice the seattle sarasota's practice and uh and then i was it was to the gym and then it was home i'd you know you know study for an hour or something like that and i go to sleep and then like quite often i would not eat that whole day i would never eat breakfast i would never eat during the day and uh and then i get home and i just be just all over the place my mom was just like oh i've got to do this i'm going to do that and then i've got to go to sleep and you know sometimes i'm like oh i just i just don't have time to cook i'm hungry so i'll just drink like pound down like a gallon of water or something like that so it doesn't like feel like i'm hungry and then i go to sleep and then it was just like and then sometimes i finish early i get home and it wouldn't be that late and be like oh i have time to cook today you know i should eat because i didn't eat yesterday and i didn't eat the day before did i eat the day before that it was just like okay you know i need to i need to eat something and so you know and i got to a point where my body just ran out of reserves and you know i was not able to to manage the amount of working out that i did and i was actually getting weaker and like normally i was feeling like stronger faster and better fitter every single time i worked out i could feel it happening and changing and it was amazing it was amazing i loved it and then all of a sudden it was just like every time i went it dropped me a little i was like i felt a bit worse and a bit worse and a bit worse this is because i run out of stores my body was breaking down and um and so i hit a wall there and um and i remember thinking i was just like i should i really don't think i'm eating enough i really don't think that i'm getting enough food i was like but i'm just not hungry i just i'm never hungry and so you have to relearn that you know you have to re-learn your signals and so i think that's a that's an elegant way of just at least making sure that you're getting enough and then you can you can recognize what that is you know and then oh yeah i'm just not hungry i'm not hungry but actually you know it does taste good up into this so i i do know how much my body normally wants and so yeah and then and yeah i could i could totally see that helping with cravings as well because you're just just not gonna be hungry you're just not gonna wanna yeah yeah so stuff yeah and i know roman does like a lot of he talks a lot about the priming and like feasting to get ready for fasting which i haven't attempted yet because i don't know i i get hungry and i just devour the meat right like so i'm just kind of going by you know how hungry i am and not hungry so it hasn't happened yet but maybe maybe after a while we'll see but i i thought like wow that that everybody knows what that thanksgiving fool feels like and so like the the words and like uh the technique of priming that was just that was so helpful for getting me on uh you know strict carnivore and getting rid of those cravings you know getting rid of the caffeine getting rid of like every like everything like everything so that's just one tip and trick that it's a really good suggestion yeah that's good so we'll probably include that yeah and certainly as you know as a suggestion for getting people to you know at least get enough you know especially if they're just starting out you know um having an easier time yeah yeah and just yeah you don't need to get used to that i mean i i you know i try to tell people like you'll eat until things don't taste good anymore and so you know you'll sort of get to that same thing anyway but yeah that does give the you know a bit of a bit more structure in your mind like oh okay this is what i'm going for um and uh you know so yeah it can be a good you know good good uh you know tool in the in the in the box yeah cool awesome thank you well thank you for that all right okay well again yeah thank you everyone and
