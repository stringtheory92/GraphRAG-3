    "title": "Live Q&A with Dr Ken Berry! Carnivore Masterclass, live on the set of Reversed Season 3! Jan 8, 2023",
    "transcript": "I'm here with my good friend Dr Ken Berry we're just on the set of reversed season three so uh we've been doing um filming for the last four days uh Dr you tell us a bit about the the show and what we've been what we've been doing here yeah so we're in Costa Rica it's beautiful here and uh we had four house guests uh who had some degree of metabolic illness or autoimmune condition and we basically brought them to Costa Rica to teach them all of the benefits of a carnivore diet and um I think I think it went great yeah and you think it went great and I don't know what network it'll be on I don't know when it'll be out so don't ask it'll be out when he gets out and I'll let you know but I think that the information that's going to go public with this uh series is going to be uh Paradigm shifting for many many people which is the whole point of doing it is to help people understand maybe we've got lots of stuff wrong for the last few decades when it comes to not only nutrition but medicine and medical therapy and even Physical Therapy physiology we got a lot of things wrong and so this series is a is a great first attempt to start to set the record straight yeah absolutely and I think that this is a very good sign of things to come with you know these sorts of projects you know recognizing a carnivore diet uh having these sorts of uh you know abilities to reverse very very serious illnesses like diabetes and others that once that starts hitting the mainstream and start getting more and more shows like this we'll be able to get this information out to more and more people yeah and the number of college students who are going to watch this who are kind of undecided on their major yeah and then they're like wait there's this there's this hypothesis that eating nothing but meat and eggs actually is good for humans I'd love to study that I think I'm going to change my major yeah like you never know when a med student is watching or a third year who's like I can't decide I don't really want to do mechanical engineering but and then they're like wait a carnivore diet Duke that's it that's what I'm going to study and so I think it's really going to Spur a lot of new creative research and a big problem with the State of Nutrition in medicine is that it's all based on a foundation of a false Paradigm yeah and that's the that's dangerous but it's also ubiquitous I mean it's everywhere many things as as we all know it's just been based on sorry but that's that's literally the technical term for what we're basing a lot of our current science and and other things on you can't do that with physics or mechanical engineering because if the bridge don't work the bridge falls down people die that's it but in nutrition you might be completely wrong about what you're saying but it's going to be 40 or 50 years before the evidence starts to to reveal itself and so I think that that that reversed carnivore is going to be the beginning of a great paradigm shift in human nutrition yeah I think so too and you know just like you said a lot of these things are that we think about in nutrition even in medicine are built upon false pretenses like cholesterol is bad Etc trans fats bad things like that and when you have that and you recognize and you have hard historical evidence that these were fraudulent put out um by you know very very I don't know nefarious people but you know for whatever reason they put it out for whatever their interests were they did put it out and we and we know that they put it out and on under false pretenses and anytime you have something based on a false pretense you have to throw it out so we have an entire Decades of medical research and and guidelines based on this false Paradigm absolutely and you know the in many circles uh it's considered fine to eat sugar yeah it's literally fine and then in some circles it's considered a health food to actually eat you know fruits and honey and other things that are full of much more sugar than our ancestors would have ever had access to for more than a few weeks out of the entire year uh and and when when there's false paradigms yeah as a foundation of nutritional or a medical Paradigm every research study done in that space is slanted and tilted by definition because the foundation is built on is just wrong yeah and so I really think you're right I think we're going to have to trash Decades of nutrition research and then obviously medical research is built on people eating a certain diet because when you have humans in a medical study even a randomized control study they're still eating a diet and so is are the findings that you found are they relevant to somebody who's eating a proper human diet probably not and so there's there's probably entire swaths of pharmaceutical interventions that would become completely meaningless and bankrupt in the face of a large adoption of a proper human diet by a large section of the of the population those Pharmaceuticals would literally become moot yeah and you know it could be that that there are people that don't want that and it may be that you know we have these these different industry sorts of papers and research that comes out that muddy the water and say oh actually Sugar's okay sure should be pretty good for you or or you know something else is bad and it sort of muddies the water protects their product but it doesn't protect uh URI yeah corporations have a long and well documented history of financing funding research that throws doubt into the mix you can you can read the story of big tobacco and how even as late as the 1980s they were saying in front of the U.S Congress I believe all the CEOs were saying I believe that nicotine is not an addictive substance yeah and obviously even in at that time there was copious amounts of evidence that proved conclusively that nicotine was very addictive but just these guys in in three-piece suits sitting in front of the U.S Congress saying that out loud putting it on the permanent record that muddied the water yeah and so for decades there are still people to this day that I'll meet online who say no I don't think there's anything wrong with smoking yeah I think it I think it's just you know the the the the tree huggers at Harvard they they don't want me to smoke and they're trying to take my rights from me and it's like dude no this is pretty hard science the nicotine's habit forming and that all the toxins in cigarette smoke are very very bad for you but they muddy the water so much and this same thing goes for fruit and hunting this thing same thing goes for whole wheat bread uh the same thing goes for all of the the vegetables that you need to eat five a day or in the U.S you need to eat you know seven to eleven of servings of whole grains and then five to seven servings of fruit hey beige it's always phrased that way because everybody loves fruit but not many people love that you know yeah that's very true uh great well we had uh a lot of people submit questions so thank you for everyone who did that so we'll get to to a few of these and see how much time we have we're still on set so that we may be interrupted so if we have to go apologize in advance but um so we'll start uh with one of these and I think this is actually something we discussed yesterday uh a bit as well and uh and something that you and uh and your wife have personal experience with um one question from the lady says uh that she's been carnivore for three to four years but she cannot stick uh to carnivore during the first trimester of pregnancy specifically why do women women get new diversions during the first trimester and what do you do about it yeah so uh the first trimester of pregnancy is is a very unique time in in a woman's life and it is very common to develop food aversions and and so for someone just eating a very a varied mixed diet a standard Western diet they develop aversions as well and often it's it's the something that's not meat they'll not be able to eat bread for a while they'll not be able to eat this or that or the other for a while but if you're trying to stick to a carnivore diet then if you develop a temporary media version uh that's a problem because that's a large percentage of your diet and Dr Kilts and I were actually discussing this yesterday it probably since so much development is like well they just call me okay so much Baseline development is happening with the fetus in the first trimester that's literally the make or break moment it's probably that a woman's olfactory sense and her gustatory stance become very heightened and women will say yeah I remember the first trimester right you I couldn't smell a certain perfume like I couldn't tolerate it at all and what the theory is is that's probably to protect you from meat that's a loft or from something that you really should not eat at all because it could actually affect the the genetic development of your fetus meat aversions are always temporary Amisha had a severe I couldn't even cook a steak in the house when she was pregnant with Beckett and so I would have to go outside and cook my steak on the grill even in the you know the cold months because I had to have my steak and she couldn't tolerate it this was short-lived it lasted about a month month and a half she lived on seafood and eggs during that time so she was still getting preeminent nutrition for her and and baby Beckett growing inside but she could not tolerate the smell of of mammalian meat cooking and couldn't even think about eating it for a month month and a half okay so but there were options there were other many other personal options absolutely yeah and she did great because beautiful and intelligent and uh she loves her steak again awesome so let me go get this uh this uh set call and if you want to we'll pick back up yeah yeah man all right thanks great well sorry about that everyone so we um yeah we still still on the set and we're we're still filming uh different scenes so um we'll give them a minute if things take it take a bit long maybe we will uh just cut there and maybe go through the questions and then post them in in a video but um if anyone had any questions about the show or about anything else going on you can you can certainly ask that have I been sleeping not much uh you know we have uh we have early starts and late finishes so especially last night I don't know what it is but I I well I do know what it is the Airbnb that we're staying at has uh it was in a very rural area and there's just a ton of animals and dogs and coyotes and roosters that are just up all night screaming uh their heads off so I was up pretty early today just because of all that that noise but uh yeah so uh what else where do we watch the show um it we're finishing it now and then it's going to be shopped out to different Networks so that's how generative these projects go where you'll you'll do it you'll have a package and you'll say hey this is what we have what you guys think and then other sort of like Hulu or Netflix or um you know the different platforms not necessarily Netflix but others as well will uh you know you know you know give an offer if they're interested in it and so we'll have to see the previous season because this is season three the previous seasons can be found on on Bloom Network and I think uh Pluto TV is a is a streaming app that you can watch it on as well um what am I most excited about for everyone to see on a reverse Series so you know this was this was i absolute Just Master Class on on a proper human diet and and biologically appropriate diet and why that matters and and what the benefits are and so I think that having all the different different experts to be having I mean literally we had like a dozen people that are very well versed in this and and have been living this themselves for many many years and have been helping other people with it for many years as well and you know people like you know Dr Barry obviously he's been in medical practice for over 20 years as a as a family physician he's been helping people with this in other ways for years on end uh online and in practice uh Dr Philip avadia is a cardiothoracic surgeon that is noticing that you know people don't need uh to really get you know cardiothoracic surgery if they follow these these pretty basic principles that we've basically been told uh what would cause these cardio cardiovascular issues and you know Dr Kilts Kelly Hogan um you know so many others uh that uh you know everyone has their own piece of perspective you know like Bella steak and buttered gal there's so many people here that give a unique perspective um to this coach Bronson as well tons I'm forgetting everyone and I'm sorry for that but there are just a ton of people here that are giving their own unique perspective and insights onto this and we're helping you know these four people as well get better and you know just seeing their benefits and their improvements is actually remarkable you know some of these people have made wild improvements in their health and literally reversed and got rid of major major illnesses like type 2 diabetes so I've been very excited for people to see that um do I eat butter and dairy I do eat butter I generally that's the only Dairy that I'll eat you know maybe occasionally a bit of cheese on some meat as as a condiment but that's pretty much it I'm very consistently just meat and water and butter I I do fine with butter some people don't but I do fine Costa Rica is one of the blue zones where people live longer and healthier you lost family mean and fat maybe that's why yeah it could be you know you look at the Blue Zone uh paper I won't call it a study because it's not it's it's a you know cherry picking you know five places that that fit their narrative and actually don't fit it that well they misled people a lot because you know like in Okinawa they said this is the Blue Zone this is because they eat these beets or something like that and like well no one else is eating those beets so you know how is that our proper human diet how is that something that everyone evolved on it's not obviously but what they fail to mention is that people in Okinawa actually eat more meat than everyone else in Japan who they're comparing them to and they don't look at the Blue Zone of Hong Kong where they eat more meat per capita and have the longest life expectancy in the world um so you know that's obviously um you know a bit of you know so that's obviously not a study the Blue zone is misnamed the Blue Zone study it is a piece of propaganda and it's just you know written by journalists you know it's not and they just they're just pushing their own narrative um what do I think about the line diet well I I sort of live the lion diet I like the lime diet I think that you're you're going to do uh pretty well on that and most people who do very very well on that um because red meat is just seems to be the most nutrient dense and uh beneficial meat that we have available to us especially that grass-fed um especially people with autoimmune issues uh like Crohn's ulcer colitis rheumatoid arthritis and you know psoriasis all these different sorts of things they seem to have problems with things like chicken beef or sorry chicken pork fish uh eggs and certainly Dairy I think it probably has a lot to do with how the animals were raised and what they were fed more than anything um because they're not eating what they're supposed to eat that can that can pass on to you um but 99 of what I use beef like we had some like pork chicharron which is like pork belly with the skin on sliced up and deep fried and lard and just cooked and cooked and cooked and cooked this is amazing I've never had this fresh before I've only had it sort of in packets which was fine too but this was uh like next level good it was absolutely fantastic so you know I'll have things like that occasionally but the vast majority of what I eat is beef so I have a question here I had my gallbladder removed nine years ago and on a carnivore diet but have problems of diarrhea sometimes you know poop what can I do to fix that so that's that's an issue with absorption of fat so your gallbladder is what stores bile and concentrates it so if you don't eat fat for a number of days or weeks you'll have more concentrated bile and that will go out and then emulsify fat and bring that in because fats are very very important it's an extremely important nutrient and you know we need it so we can still eat a carnivore diet we can still eat a high fat carnivore diet without a gallbladder but we do need to be mindful of the fact that you're not going to have a concentrated bolus of um a bile at one time and so you might have to just split up your meals throughout the day and just just space out your fatty meals throughout the day now some people don't need to do that some people form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is just an out pouching and a common bile duct that acts pretty much the same as as a gallbladder it stores bile concentrates it up and then squishes it out so they're actually quite a number of people that do a carnivore diet with no gallbladder and they just eat you know one meal a day so the omad style of doing things and they're able to absorb all that fat so if you're getting diarrhea on a carnivore diet um you have sort of there's generally about three things that you need to think about are you still drinking coffee that's a that's a laxative are you using artificial sweeteners like especially like the sugar alcohols like sucralose and Xylitol things like that those are definitely laxatives um and then if you're not doing that if you're just doing meat and water um then you're probably eating more fat than your body can absorb and it sounds like that's what's going on in your case and um you know because you don't have a gallbladder so you'll need to space out your meals but also think about coffee and the artificial sweeteners because those will definitely add to that problem on Kelly Hawkins just landed back home uh awesome uh that's really great it was it was lovely to meet uh Kelly Hogan she was absolutely fantastic you know she was one of my um you know the first people that had me on uh her show when I was first getting started and it was it was an absolute pleasure to meet her in person she was just such a lovely person if you watch her videos you know she's just just this bubbly effervescent you know just ball of energy and pleasant pleasantness and like and that is exactly who she is in real life that that's not an act that's not just for the camera that that's who she is and um and it was just an absolute pleasure so thank you very much um for all of uh your kindness Kelly and it was an absolute pleasure to meet you you know Dr Berry is back joining us again I just had a question here I've been on Carnivore since October A1C is still 11.2 and passing glucose is 230. um yeah so there's several things that could explain that first of all are you sure you have type 2 diabetes that's the first question the way you know for sure is you have your doctor and if your head doctor hasn't checked this you may need to find a new doctor at this point you need a fasting insulin and you need a and or a c-peptide and if either one of those are either zero or close to zero then you're a type 1 diabetic and even though you're eating a perfect carnivore diet you're still going to have very high blood sugars and you have to have some amount of exogenous insulin insulin that you inject or get in some fashion uh just regular pills for type 2 diabetes won't help you at all if you're a type 1 or if you've developed Lada later in life and so that's the number one question that you've got to get answered and if you have truly been strict carnivore and you still have an A1C of that you're you're almost assuredly a type 1 diabetic who's been misdiagnosed as a type 2 diabetic which is much more common than it should be I've met multiple people who were diagnosed as type 2 and that's a misdiagnosis and kept that diagnosis for two three four five years before some doctor finally said you know let's check your fasting insulin and then they're like oh you're a type one we've basically been uh mismanaging you for however many years so get those tests checked immediately and now other another thing it could be is some people misconstrue what a carnivore diet is they think that it means adding meat and eggs to their existing diet that's decidedly not carnivore and I think you've probably been if you're if you follow Chaffee you probably already know that so it's probably going to be a misdiagnosis in your case right what else what can you think of that's good I think so and yeah and I always do wonder what people are eating if they're you're still uh you know having because that you're exactly right A lot of people think a carnivore diet is just they increase the amount of meat they eat and eat a lot more meat and they probably eat less plants and things like that but they don't realize that it's it's just as important to not eat all the other plants and carbs and sugar and artificial sweeteners and things like that that it is to yeah as well but with the neighborhood see that high the only other uh possible reason for this is that you've been misled into thinking that fruit and honey is part of a carnivore diet which it absolutely is not and but that could land you with being on a uh I don't I don't even want to call that Carnival what is that animal based yeah diet you could still have an A1C that hot yeah absolutely I mean that's a whole the whole thing with the hba1c I mean that that's a glycation product uh from high blood sugar and you're not going to get high blood sugar from eating a high fat diet you really do need to take in exogenous carbohydrates generally you know if you're um you know if you do have diabetes especially you know type you know type 1 and type 2 diabetes these things can make it difficult for you to manage your your blood sugars but you're you're still going to be in control of making your own blood sugars you'll be making these things so you really shouldn't have a massive massive number like that if you're not taking an exogenous carbohydrates unless you know like you say that's your uh you actually misdiagnosed yeah yeah great all right um so and this is only again you have personal experience with is carnivore Diet safe for children and pregnant women uh their OB GYN is against keto yeah so your obgo GYN currently believes the false pair done that red meat is dangerous or bad that animal fat is bad in some way um your your placenta and your baby inside they are literally made of fat animal fat and animal protein that is literally what they are and so to even intimate that that's somehow eating that is would harm something that is made from that it's that's kind of silly on its face right and then secondly uh meat and eggs with the yolk are the most nutrient dense foods on planet Earth and so every pregnant woman should be maximizing the nutrient density of the food that she eats and so if she's eating empty calories like whole grain bread or she's drinking fruit smoothies those things are essentially either nutrient void or the nutrition is locked up in the like to like the lectins and the phytates and the oxalates and the other things she's not even getting access to those even though it may be listed on the label meat and eggs with the yolk are the only Foods on the planet that are not only nutrient dense but also the the nutrition is supremely bioavailable and bioabsorbable and uh both Beckett who's now three and a half and Bonnie Blue who's six months old uh Bonnie's got two little teeth yeah right and so she's already been chewing on pork ribs when I eat the eat a pork ribs I give her the bone and she gnaws on it she gets the cartilage she gets the little remnants right that's that was that was her first food that was also Beckett's first food was a beef rib in the same fashion and when Becky got done with the beef rib he had stripped it so clean that when he dropped it on the floor our little Yorkie Poo didn't even want it it was it was literally devoid of nutrition at that point unless she pulled it for bone broth uh but yeah all both of our kids are going to be 90 uh animal food based they they eat all kinds of different Meats they eat eggs every now and then they'll have a pickle or a little piece of avocado or something like that but the vast majority and that's those are basically fun foods like oh let's see what happens when we give Bonnie a slice of lemon right let's see her face just that kind of stuff that parents do but but when we think about what are we going to feed this this child today for nutrition it's always meet next that is the primary thing that's on their little baby plate yeah absolutely and uh and they and we entire civilization is still alive today that they're children pregnant women and adults are exclusively eating me absolutely and you know going back into and having beautiful intelligent babies yeah eating a meat based diet yeah you know big perfectly formed jaws and teeth and bodies and brains and yeah as I'm sure most people who follow us know uh before the Agricultural Revolution our brains were about 11 larger than they are now I think that that is entirely a developmental issue not a genetic issue I think that that's because we're not getting the proper nutrition that we need it was a direct result of the plants domesticating us that's uh to to grow them and eat them absolutely yeah absolutely so um well maybe ask uh my daughter is allergic to me can I help heal and eat allergy I tried to to find out if this was um you know what exactly they meant by allergy right so many people will do the food sensitivity tests which are almost uniformly okay just just to use a technical term if if that's what you're basing that she's allergic to me on then that's foolishness throw that stuff in the garbage she's not allergic to to egg yolks she's not allergic to meat that absolutely is such a rare occurrence that it's almost not worth talking about now if she was bitten by a tick and developed Alpha gal then she will be sensitive or allergic to mammal meat for a few months and this almost always resolves after a few months when the immune system calms down some people it'll it'll last a year and so she can keep trying um little bites of meat every few months to see if that hasn't resolved yet but I've yet to see a case that was permanent and I've yet to meet a human either online or in person who was truly had an anaphylactic reaction to eating eating red meat I've yet to see that unless they were bitten by the specific tick that gives you Alpha gal yeah yeah that's literally been my worst fear for the last several years I kept getting this take bite I was like oh my God yeah but you can still enjoy all the seafood okay all the anything that flies or swims you can still eat it without worrying about it it's only an allergy to mammalian meat okay and it seems to result yeah yeah every person that I've talked to who's been actually diagnosed with it within three to twelve months they're like no I can eat meat again it's fine thank God yeah right so take a breath it's fine all right um what are your thoughts on raw milk on Carnivore so raw milk is the least bad milk that you can drink now uh this is this is a very complex issue and so you can't there's not a sound by answer for this so if some if a human being is under the age of five six or seven raw milk is fine for them Beckett drinks uh goat milk every day he's three and a half uh but about the age of five six or seven we'll start to wean wean down and stop that because there's no precedent in anthropology or in even zoology of an adult mammal drinking milk except when we when they're basically our prisoner like dogs and cats and we give it to them okay now there is one recorded case of um I forget what what mammal it was but on a dairy farm it would lick out of the bucket after they've milked the cows but you have to understand that's still an artificial situation that would never occur in nature and and so life is very intelligent life always finds a way and milk is a great source of nutrition for young mammals so there would absolutely be some bird or some mammal some weasel right some some little marsupial that would have discovered the nutrition in milk and would sneak out and would be nursing the Bison in the middle of the night whether by that would have happened by now and I've spoken to several evolutionary biologists and and they're like yo that's very odd that that no other mammal ever takes advantage of the milk of another mammal never like it's there's no case of that ever documented except in artificial human created situations where the animal basically doesn't have a choice and so all mammals are smart enough to know that when I'm an adult I don't need milk it's going to cause problems even either from the the lactose or from the caseings in ways which for most adults are inflammatory to at least some degree but if you are insist on drinking milk please drink raw milk in preferably raw A2 milk from a sheep a goat or from an A2 cow that's probably the least bad option but more than so the the anthropological record shows that we started to to drink milk on a regular basis seven to eight thousand years ago which if you think about the entirety of human existence on planet Earth it's just a blink of the eye very short it's not enough time for us to have evolved now lactase persistence has developed three different times and three once in Asia once in Africa and once up north uh and so we we are slowly evolving to be able to tolerate milk as adults but we're not there yet and that that by no means makes Milk a health food for an adult by no means makes it any kind of optimal food for an adult it just means we can tolerate it it's a great starvation food so if you're starting to death yes drink all the milk even pasteurized homogenized but if what you're trying to do is optimize your health as an adult and from the way I've studied this and looked at this milk plays no role in that for adults yeah I think that's the same sort of um way of thinking about certain domesticated plants as well you know we we have some populations you know agriculture has developed you know for seven times independently around the world over time right and you have in some of these populations especially going back to the earliest examples the descendants of those populations that have survived um have some resistances but certainly not it's certainly not optimal it's certainly not our our biologically appropriate diet exactly it makes it a great starvation yeah that's what grains are that's what milk for adults is and the only reason we develop those things in the first place a lot of people think of the agriculture they call it the Agricultural Revolution right like it was some breakthrough like it was some leveling up and it was actually a response to the loss of megafauna we were basically starving and so we were like we got to do something because we got all these kids to feed let's start doing this and but that doesn't ever make it an optimist food and those are two very important Concepts because basically the nutrition guidelines of every country in the world they're recommending that you eat lots of starvation foods and and they're recommending that you avoid optimization foods that are going to give you your best physical health but also your best mental health and your best hormonal Health it's almost as if they want to keep men in a kind of a low testosterone inflamed overweight condition and and then the same for women they want to keep their their hormones addled and confused and and their mind muddied I'm not sure why they're so adamant that we all eat these starvation Foods I find it quite concerning I'm not sure what the motivation is at the top but I'm not going to fall for it no and then there are certainly examples throughout history of you know a dominant political force restricting and limiting the amount of meat to multiply multiple examples of this and in many cases it was illegal for you to have access to the the livestock or the the animal foods that come from the livestock that was not for you because you were a prisoner or a slave or a pauper and and it was literally illegal for you to eat those Foods yeah and that was um uh an example in in England uh when this was the case you weren't allowed to EPC these big sort of animals so people had to flesh out their their meals on rabbits you could catch rabbits there were enough of them around they do cats still technically illegal but harder to catch you doing exactly and if you dropped a big beautiful uh yeah exactly the king's deer it was all the king's animals yeah but isn't that weird but you could grow uh grains and beans that was fine you could have that but don't touch the king's animals yeah exactly quite chilling yeah and um there was a period where there was a a plate sort of wiped out most of the the rabbit population and there's Mass starvation and uh and death throughout England because now they couldn't get the only source of animal nutrition and protein and fat not much fat on a rabbit but at least there was something there uh and they and people died on that absolutely yeah yeah and and there's multiple examples of that in archeology in in history and I think we should all start to think about these things a little differently like yeah why are they recommending 11 servings of grains a day but you should limit that red meat yeah and because when you look into the science there's literally no support for that so then what's their motivation why are they so adamant in pushing it you know they they could say something like well we're not sure but we think you probably ought to eat lots of grains and avoid red meat that would at least be more more honest yeah but for them to be like no this is the way you should eat it yeah that's that's concerning I think I think so too and you know you'll get back into ancient Rome when when people started getting a bit uppity and and the the you know the air was a bit more rebellious the first thing they would do is cut off the meat supply to the people and it was bread and circuses and the reason is bread inserts there's not steaks and circuses yeah yeah so just keep people docile you know so domesticated domesticated exactly yeah and you see these the different sorts of people that are pushing the uh the plant-based fake meat sort of thing you know the the Davos crowd you know there's there's famously pictures taken this year every single plate was full of meat that was what they were serving at this place where they said we need to get rid of meat the medium was leaked and it was literally steak and lobster it's with these guys who are telling you to eat the grains and beans they were having steak and lobster yeah I don't know that surely that's a coincidence right yeah exactly and uh you know people you know and Bill Gates is one of these guys as well I don't have anything you're particularly against Bill Gates but I you know I grew up next to him I grew up in Kirkland Washington he's in in Bellevue Washington in Medina and there's a place called Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in downtown Bellevue where anytime you go there you are you have a 50 50 chance of seeing Bill Gates there he eats there all the time he gets big old steaks yeah and so you know he's not he's not going to be cutting in uh to that fake meet anytime soon he might invest in it and encourage you to eat it but he's having a roost crisp exactly yeah um so this is a bit of a of uh now a question that isn't necessarily uh nutrition based but probably more of a logistical one that's probably as important or more which is how do you filter this message down into the school systems at K-12 and get this uh you know sort of a broader reach message into the kids nowadays especially with schools now pitching a plant-based dietary vegan diet in Australia there's actually schools that are purely vegan and you are not allowed to put meat in your kids lunch lunches at all so I don't think there's an answer to that coming from a legislative or a uh administrative level I don't think you're going to have any effect on that trying to like in the U.S run for a seat on the school board I think this is coming from so high up the only the only access the only thing the only solution for you and me is to feed our family a proper human diet and to teach the people that we love our friends and family this is the right diet this is the diet that's going to give you the the best hormone configuration the best mental Clarity the best physical strength the best stamina the best resilience maybe even anti-fragility this is the diet that's going to do that and so this has to be Grassroots because the top has been completely captured in education and nutrition and medicine you're not going to have any effect at the changing at the top this is going to come from the ground up and that means you have to eat a proper human diet and you have to teach your friends and family and everybody you care about hey whatever you do in public that's fine but when you're in the privacy of your own home you eat meat and eggs yeah yeah absolutely yeah I don't I don't think that's um you know we're necessarily going to be able to you know to fight through with these these schools on a one-on-one basis you know that I know a lot of parents in Australia and Perth who are you know don't like the fact that they aren't allowed to send me in with the school in with their kids but you know they have really not much they can do about it but if you if you teach your kids to eat the right way maybe even just fast during school or something like that just don't need anything and then just avoid this but the you know once we get like sort of a critical mass of people that understand this and just absolutely not we're not going to do this then the schools are going to be less able to sort of impose their will as well what a sad commentary on the state of modern education that a child is going to have to sneak into a bathroom stall and eat a few sticks of beef jerky yeah in order to get the nutrition that they're growing body and brain needs and they're going to have to sneak real human food and eat it in private eat it in secret to help their body grow and help their brain develop because they'll get in trouble if they're discovered eating real human food it kind of sounds like uh the king's animals doesn't it it does odd yeah there was a there's an ad campaign going through in Australia at the moment uh basically saying trying to educate miseducate parents to say that it's just not safe to put lunch meat in your kids pack to school lunches that you know it's not going to be refrigerated so this can just go bad and spoil and you know instantly Mass plague and instantly covered with the play yeah exactly even even though you know we've been doing this for decades right right oh over 100 over 100 years hundreds of years I mean how many men have taken a chop of of meat with them wrapped up in burlap or just stuck in their pocket yeah before we had you know cool Captain America lunch boxes you would just wrap it up in some cloth or something and take that coat of meat to work with you so you'd have something ability it I mean that just Beggars belief that that a school system with a straight face yeah would say something like that it really is concerning about the future of humanity well I said you know they make these statements and as Thomas likes to say without any evidence either ask for or provided right is make these statements um I you know you see like one of those old black and white pictures of the guys building like skyscrapers in New York and they're sitting there with this little lunch pail there 100 what do you think is in there yeah all day outside yeah metal lunch can and somehow they didn't die exactly I've had I've got whenever I cook brisket I don't put it in the fridge because no I never we never refrigerate leftover meat because it's going to be gone in a day or two yeah yeah but for to even imply that oh that's going to spoil within seconds yeah that's foolishness and everybody with any Common Sense knows that so that that's why it like if I had Beckett in that school I'd be like are y'all are you guys effing stupid what are you even talking about do you teach real science at this school and if at all possible I would pull back it out of that school immediately because obviously they're not teaching real science yeah well that and that's the other thing too that parents can do is you know if they start imposing this sort of thing on it you just pull your kid you know people are are moving schools and and homeschooling and if that's what you need to do that's what you need to do to protect your kid yeah absolutely yeah um all right so here's an easy one can you get scurvy on a carnivore diet well you have to see anybody Do It um and I've actually after I had been very very strict carnivore for a year and a half I actually got a serum vitamin C Level checked and it was still within normal limits okay a year and a half of nothing but meat and eggs and I did include liver some kind of liver chicken liver Cod Liver maybe calves liver or sheep liver once a week and so there is Vitamin C in fresh meat and there's lots of vitamin C in liver and spleen and then you you have beautifully laid out the argument that when you're eating a essentially zero carb diet you don't need nearly as much vitamin C to not only prevent scurvy but also to to have all of the anti-inflammatory effects that that vitamin C might play a role in in a high carb highly processed diet if you're eating the standard Western diet you probably do need to take a vitamin C supplement because you've got so much sugar in your bloodstream it's competing with the for the receptor but if you're eating a very low carb diet and fresh meat and is is part of your daily diets not overcooked and liver is is one a once a week food for you or once every two week food you're never going to develop a vitamin C deficiency this has been shown in tens of thousands of carnivores some of some of which have been carnivore for 20 years yeah and uh you know and as we were talking about before you know or as you mentioned there that Contin is contingent on a carbohydrate-free diet because carbohydrates increase your basically your demand provided in C because you're not going to be absorbing it as well you're not going to be utilizing it as well as you actually need far more vitamin C so you know I always think about you know people you know if you're eating fruit and all that sort of stuff well there's going to be some vitamin C in there so you're going to be sort of offsetting that but if you're say drinking a lot of milk or something like that you know you could potentially get enough of carbohydrates in your in your meal that um you know you'll actually not get enough vitamins okay sorry the case reports of scurvy in modern society that I've read uh are predominantly people on what we would call it a tea and toast diet you know something like that that has no nutrition and also no vitamin C I've read one case report where a guy was living on a highly processed uh meat uh product it was not fresh meat it was not meat that he was cooking on the grill it was like just a preserved dried thing that that had essentially had been destroyed in the factory and so they they really made a big uh haboo about oh God this this guy eight meat and got scurvy but if you actually read the study he was eating bread in this dried highly processed meat product and he was not eating any fresh meat at all and I don't know of a single case report in the literature where someone was eating fresh meat routinely and uh Got Scurvy and there's actually a randomized not a randomized control trial but a controlled trial in humans when Steph Austin was put in the metabolic Ward for a year and he ate nothing but meat so this is this has been actually proven that human beings don't develop scurvy if they have access to Fresh Meat yeah and do you remember from that study was that was that cooked meat was it like largely raw or no it was cooked meat yeah I think I think it was cook meat I don't know how well it was cooked but he may have been eating some raw meat as well and I don't know if he was getting organs but I know that he was under direct observation for a for a solid year and ate nothing but meat yeah and did not develop scurvy so that that that kind of study design that can that can be used as proof yeah and as you say there are so many people that are living as carnivores now in in Western societies for decades and decades and decades eating you know just just normal store-bought cooked cooked meat there was a guy that I spoke to who just inadvertently became a carnivore when he was 15 because he just didn't want to eat vegetables you know man after my own art and just just started eating uh just meat and he's been here for 40 years and that's just that's just what he wanted to do and he went from being the shortest guy in his class at 15 to being the second tallest on graduation he ended up sprouting up to six foot six interest three years interesting yeah and then and he's just been eating you need ever since he's like I feel good and this is doing good by me and uh and he definitely Cooks his his meat as well and uh yeah so I think that's uh hopefully uh you know alleviate some people's misgivings and concerns this is awesome let's do one more yeah um how can carnivore heal anxiety and other mental illnesses so it seems like a large degree of mental illness is due to some sort and some degree of inflammation in the brain whether it's within the neurons themselves whether it's around the axons whether it's around the synapses I don't think we know that yet but there are more and more psychiatrists every day using either a ketogenic or a carnivore diet as a therapeutic intervention for depression for anxiety for OCD for for multiple and and I can tell you from personal experience with my ADHD it's 80 percent better when I eat an exclusively animal-based diets and when I say animal based I don't mean fruit and honey I mean meat and eggs when I do that I still have ADHD but it's controllable it's tolerable It doesn't irritate Nisha nearly as much but I would if anybody has either has a mental illness or has a friend or loved one that has mental illness I would highly encourage you to look at the work of Dr Chris Palmer and Dr Georgia Eid e d e these guys were Pioneers in this area and have had great success and are now starting to publish literature showing stunning improvements in symptomology of mental health with a either a carnivore diet or a very red meat heavy ketogenic diet so if you know anybody with mental illness you need to put the names Chris Palmer in Georgia Eid in their ear because it could literally change their life for the better yeah absolutely and Dr Palmer is a professor of Psychiatry at Harvard and he's been there for 20 some years and he just wrote a book called brain energy which I just read which is excellent and it's the it shows that this can actually be you know just down at a fundamental level of the mitochondria and the dysfunctions thereof and that this can cause a lot of different problems and that psychiatric issues actually can be caused by metabolic issues and by going on a carnivore diet or ketogenic diet caramel diet is really just an ultimate ketogenic diet that after days weeks and months you actually improve the function of your mitochondria you replace old and damaged mitochondria for a new better working mitochondria and you increase their number so there are studies showing that after several months in on a ketogenic diet that you will have four times the number of mitochondria and they're four times as effective and efficient so you're getting a big big bonus here that sounds important it does yeah yeah thanks a lot thank you very much thanks for having me all right absolutely all right see you guys thanks everyone all right guys I hope you guys all liked that that was absolute pleasure for me um and I just saw one little little question about someone who said they're they're doing BJJ do they need cars absolutely resounding no you don't need that you're much better off if you don't have carbohydrates you will make carbohydrates and ketones and glycogen and muscle glycogen liver glycogen when you're when you're training and you will have basically unlimited access to energy because you have access to your fat stores as soon as you eat carbohydrates you cut that off okay and so by a work of um of uh Professor Tim Knox shown that you actually do much much better exercising working out in a high performance International level when in ketosis okay so hope that helps everyone I really appreciate you guys taking the time I hope you like it okay guys we'll see you later"
