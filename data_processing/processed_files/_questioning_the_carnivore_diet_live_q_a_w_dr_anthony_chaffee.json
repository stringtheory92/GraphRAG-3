        "body": "hello everyone Welcome to our live stream challenging Dr chafee's carnivore diet I'm excited I'm fired up for this one so uh Dr chafee should be jumping on here with us in just a minute today we're tackling fears and arguments and reasons why you were scared to start the carnivore diet um for example I've often heard my entire life that vegetables are vital you got to have your vegetables breakfast is the most important meal of the day if you eat too much meat it's going to clog your arteries it's going to kill you lots of scary stuff we've been told our entire lives and lots of things that caused me to to pause when starting carnivore diet it's a scary it's a scary thing doing carnivore you have to be pretty brave because you're you're basically going up against everything you've ever been told and a lot of times that fear comes from misunderstanding or not having the facts or the truth so the purpose of this video and Dr chafee and I have done a couple videos like this now it's been a lot of fun purpose of these videos is to break down those myths answer the tough questions overcome the fear looking at the facts trying to get to the truth so um the other thing I would suggest as well is don't just listen to us and don't just do this do your own research there's so much great information out there uh check out Dr chafee's channel for sure if you haven't subscribed uh to that yet you certainly should he's got so many great uh videos on Carnivore diet one of uh one of his best I'd really suggest especially if you're new to carnivore and this is your first entry into it is uh his video it's titled carnivore for beginners how to start a carnivore diet with tips and tricks it's an excellent video it has nearly half a million views and this is just free information so I always encourage people so many people have been commenting on my YouTube videos lately and they're saying uh I'm going to start Carnival right now I'm gonna go buy a steak right now and I'm like no don't do that you have to know your why for starting carnivore and it has to be a powerful why and then you have to know your how how are you going to do it it's not just going out and buying some ground beef and steaks and eating it there's certain things that you have to account for and you gotta you gotta do it right and you gotta understand it and you got to make the decision for yourself before you just jump on and do it and it's free information at her fingertips I wish I had the resources [Music] um that are available now 20 years ago I wish I had Dr chafee's videos 20 years ago it would have changed my life forever so uh strongly encourage everyone to to check out Dr chafee's Channel I've got a it's it's listed in the description below and uh it's down there on the bottom of the screen as well and so uh I'm excited for this I'm fired up we did a couple other videos in this series so if you guys haven't watched those yet check it out and um Dr chafee should be joining us here any second now I just want to give a huge shout out to him he is such a generous person we need more doctors like Dr chafee we have to elevate Dr chafee's message Dr Barry's message Dr Baker's message or we're never going to have more doctors like them he's been a lot of you uh have probably heard of my my new friend bill and his story it's just amazing 700 pounds from Alaska he's been doing carnivore today is his day 11. he's thriving you can already see some of his face changing this if you guys haven't heard this story you got to check out my channel and see I did a whole video and then you got to go check out Bill's Channel he he couldn't afford meat and uh he lives in Alaska and he's 700 pounds he hasn't left his house in four years and he's he's on Carnivore for 11 days now and the goal is to get him in our carnivore diet documentary we're putting together that's on the bottom of the screen we need all the help we can get with that so this is a crowdfunded documentary and I may be flying out to see Bill shortly I'm going to decide here in the next day or two so um more to come on that very soon but I was just going to say uh there's Dr chafee now Dr chafee uh I'm just uh I was telling people a quick update about Bill and I was going to ask people how important it is that we Elevate people like Dr chafee because I wish there were doctors like you I I keep I keep showing people this I got it on my desk here but all of these doctors failed me and I've had so many things that are a hundred times better on Carnivore diet I just wish I found it earlier so it's really important that we give credit we're due and um I I just I wanted to thank you Dr Chaffin for being so generous with your time and no you're fine helping with Bill too so this thing with Bill I was just telling everyone give them a quick update Dr chafee he's on day 11 right now he's just doing awesome it's nice 700 pounds and he's going to be in the carnivore diet movie um and I'm thinking about maybe flying out there in the next day or two so um it's but you were so generous and you were like if he needs any help just I'll have a private phone call with him and help him and I I really appreciate that and Bill really appreciates it and it's it's awesome what you're doing so I was just telling everybody go to Dr chafee's Channel subscribe we have to elevate doctors like Dr chafee we need more doctors in the world like this uh so Dr chafee I kind of went through the intro and uh basically there's a lot of scary stuff out there that stops people from starting carnivore but when you get to the facts of it you can get over the fear and then start it and that's kind of the purpose of this video Dr Chaffey and I have done a couple videos like this so Dr chafee I mean maybe just to kick things off if you wouldn't mind could you introduce yourself uh yeah so so my name is Dr Anthony chafee I'm an American physician I work in Australia at the moment uh special um you know sort of been a residency for neurosurgery I also have a private practice in functional medicine and metabolic health and I've just done a lot of research into diet nutrition how that affects health and chronic disease and I've found that that is one of the best tools that I've found to to help my patients get better and not not need surgery in the future and not need a whole bunch of medications now awesome thank you um I'll just do myself here real quick so my name is Carrie I've been carnivore for 134 days today's day 46 on the lion diet carnivore has completely changed my life forever I'm two pounds shy of being down a hundred pounds since my heaviest um I overcame depression anxiety IBS I I would stop breathing about 400 times throughout the night I had a CPAP machine strapped around my face every night just to breathe because of the food I was eating and all of that's gone now for the first time in my life I just I feel like a natural human being like a human should feel and I guess the other big thing about me is I'm on a mission right now it's my new purpose and goal in life is to share examples of carnivore diet so we're putting together the carnivore diet documentary I talked about Bill earlier he's going to be in there and after he's been stuck in his house for four years and if the goal is to show Bill uh right now I'm actually probably going to be flying out there in the next couple of days is to start filming with him so it's really exciting but we need more participants too so if you're interested in sharing your carnivore example it's not just obesity it's diabetes mental health issues aging Women's Health all of those things we want to share those examples over the course of one year on the carnivore diet we're not telling people hey you should do the carnivore diet or you should eat this way it's just look at all these examples use your own two eyes and then decide what you want to do and I think it's so important to share all of these examples it's what inspired me to get started on Carnivore diet so uh yeah with that said should we jump right into some of these questions I have we've done these videos before Dr chafee and I have so uh check some of those out go to Dr chafee's Channel and check some of the past ones out they're they're so good you just you were knocking them out of the park and we have more questions we didn't get to last time that people have submitted and I keep saying questions they're more so arguments against carnivore diet I want to start carnivore diet but I am scared because it's going to clog my arteries I'm going to die of a heart attack or whatever the reason may be so we have some of those here but if you guys have any of your own please leave them in the comments if you have a question you can put a little cue in front of it and I was just saying earlier if you have a fear a carnivore fear maybe put a big F in front of it and then we'll be able to catch it quickly but we've got some right here so what do you say Dr chafee should we just jump into some of these yeah sounds good all right here's one and now all most of these are new we've covered some really good ones before this one I wanted to cover though because a lot of times there's new people on here we've touched on a little bit of this before so per Cleveland Clinic the carnivore diets High saturated fat content raises LDL cholesterol something a lot of people were worried about increasing heart disease risk it's it's uh low in essential nutrients and can cause health issues long term yeah well it's funny that they say it's low in essential nutrients I wonder which ones you know they're talking about is that is that the Arsenic of a cyanide or the you know sulforaphane it oxalates and things like that um no you're not missing anything absolutely not anything you know how do we know this because the Inuit exists right so they eat just meat and they don't have anything else you people say that well the Maasai they eat this and the other and you go there and actually they you know they don't you know there are there are some who do and the ones you know living traditionally they really don't eat it really any plant material um and then different you know than the net and other populations the Australian aboriginals and their their native uh you know sort of uh civilization they they really just ate meat and they may have ate implants when they had to and certainly when they were introduced by uh you know westerners but uh left for their own devices they really weren't eating meat unless they really weren't eating plants unless they had to so there's nothing that you're missing we know that because there are people that only eat meat throughout their entire life we have entire civilizations and cultures that only meet throughout their entire existence generation after generation and they are actually extraordinarily healthy lean strong fit individuals great microbiome they also don't get heart disease that that is the disease of the West that we used to be called a disease of the West now it's just getting older now everyone gets heart disease and we don't think about that we don't think about the fact that the first heart the first heart attack a person who died of a heart attack uh and proven on autopsy to have done so was in around 1910 in America we don't look at that we don't and we don't realize that then they they thought no you got it wrong you saw something you you didn't see uh what you said you did that's a lie uh 10 years later they started having more and more of these people dying from this weird thing that they'd never seen before and they've been doing autopsies for hundreds and hundreds of years thousands of years really and yet this is the first time they've seen that and uh 10 years after that's the number one killer in America why is that you know it came out of nowhere um so it certainly wasn't the meat we were reading because you're actually eating more meat in the 1800s than we were in the 1900s and certainly in the in the 1920s and 30s when when those levels spiked up that was actually trough reading the least amount of meat in the 20s and 30s in America that we've eaten in 200 years right and so obviously that's not the case saturated fat well Cleveland Clinic is great it's a it's a wonderful institution but you know they don't they don't get everything right every time and the journal the American College of Cardiology published in 2020 um a massive uh literature review looking at all the best studies and that analyzes and the you know rent my controlled trials and all these different sorts of things and they found absolutely no connection not even an association weak or otherwise between increased saturated fat intake and heart disease now it may or may not increase LDL it actually doesn't in many people however it does not increase your risk of heart disease it's not even associated with an increased risk of heart disease that is published in the top Cardiology journal on Earth and in fact some of these authors had been authors on other Publications saying saturated fats bad you got to watch out for this is where they're Mia Copa saying hey you know I you know we got it wrong and we're sorry this is what we this is what we think now this is what the evidence shows so in fact they found an inverse relationship between saturated fat intake and stroke so the more saturated fat people eat the less Strokes they have so the lower your stroke risk the less saturated fat you eat the higher your stroke risk the more people were having strokes and there was a study with LDL there's tons of studies with LDL in the last decade showing literally the opposite of LDL being a heart disease risk in fact they found some that found it was protective and they found one one study looked at over 11 million people one of the largest studies has ever been performed looking at LDL cholesterol not even differentiating there's over 100 different kinds of LDL cholesterol first of all it's important to know which which kind you have if you have the large buoyant healthy LDL cholesterol you really it's not even associated with heart disease risk right not really and um and they found that even the all the different particulate sizes that that aren't uh you know as as good for you as the large buoyant was didn't matter just LDL in general that higher LDL cholesterol equated to lower all-cause mortality right so you lived longer you died less often if you had higher cholesterol any higher uh LDL cholesterol right so so your ldlc was higher you live longer on average for 11 million people one of the largest studies that's ever been done and you go back to the original studies looking at uh LDL cholesterol total cholesterol and heart disease and in fact these were fraudulent so so the saturated fat was never a problem cholesterol was never a problem uh cholesterol is very important and uh it's ubiquitous every single one of our cells is made out of cholesterol or hormones are made out of cholesterol our brain is 20 cholesterol biles made out of cholesterol so many things are uh reliant on cholesterol and also LDL is not cholesterol so transport molecules so you're talking about ldlc ldlp all these different sorts of things however these associations they had with total cholesterol and LDL and c and so forth they were fraudulent these were bought and paid for by the sugar companies we know now the Journal of the American Medical Association published in 2016 actual internal memos from the sugar companies detailing how they paid off three Harvard professors to falsify data and publish fraudulent studies to make it appear as if cholesterol caused heart disease when it was really sugar and to exonerate Sugar and say that it was safe when there were studies out there saying that actually there's a strong association with increased sugar consumption and heart disease also a very strong associate very strong association between seed oils you know that cooking oil canola oil sunflower oil soybean oil things like that and heart disease and in fact it's probably probably a better relationship I think they're both both implicated but um but seed oils are very bad and so they paid off a number of professors one of those professors from Harvard was named head of the USDA and it was he who authored and published a 1977 USDA declaration saying that cholesterol caused heart disease saturated in fact increases cholesterol stop eating both of them and this change the world and since the 1970s 1977 in America we reduced bread meat consumption by over 33 percent reduced uh fat cholesterol uh intake by about the same increased fruits and vegetables by 30 40 respectively increased grains in uh increase high fructose corn syrup by over three times increased seed oils by over three times and what happened well a lot of things happen people got fatter sicker more chronic diseases all these sorts of things but heart disease rates tripled now you'll have dishonest people usually in vegan cohort that are trying to to push their narrative and agenda and they'll say no no actually you know heart disease deaths have gone down it peaked in the 1960s and 70s and then it started coming down just just perfectly coincided with a reduction in cholesterol so you know that's better what did they say what did we say we said three times as much heart disease right they said heart does it deaths from heart disease mortality rate of heart disease peaked in the 1960s and 70s then went down okay so they are trying to distract you they are trying to they are talking about something else and they're trying to pretend that they're talking about what you're talking about so yes deaths have gone down what has gone up you know cardiothoracic surgery has gotten a lot better we do quadruple bypass is a lot easier now people don't die as often we can do stents endovascular treatment go in see someone who's getting you know angina or angina depending on where you are and that goes up goes up the the artery and you just sort of open up those those vessels before you ever have a heart attack all these sorts of things if you do have a heart attack then go in take out the clot open up the the area same with Strokes in the brain things like that and so our interventions have gotten a lot better also smoking rates have come down dramatically which is a massive massive massive uh you know Boon for heart for for people who don't want to develop heart disease or die from heart disease so the prevalence and incidents have gone up so the numbers of people with heart disease has gone up is going up around the world and in America it's just the death rate hasn't you know gone up it's sort of gone down because of our interventions and because of we we've uh stopped smoking but the amount of people that are getting their first heart attacks is going up has been going up since then and so you can't say that cholesterol directly causes only thing there and smoking obviously that cholesterol causes heart disease when you reduce cholesterol and heart disease rates triple if anything you can say that it's protective and in fact that's actually what a lot of their studies at the time showed that they doctored the evidence and they misreported them the Framingham studies one of the most famous studies in cardiology I was taught this in my first year in medical school it was just the study that just proved the case right and it followed you know something like 76 000 people over you know a few decades and they made a lot of different associations with uh with their health and all the different things they were doing one thing that was taught to me was that when they had um higher levels of cholesterol higher levels of cardiovascular uh death right so like Strokes heart attacks things like that right okay pretty good correlation is not causation but you got 76 000 people with a lot of people goes up that goes up okay seems pretty good people don't tend to ask questions after that even though that's very weak evidence correlation cannot show causation right but the problem is is that that was actually a misrepresentation that was the American Heart Association which again was was compromised by the sugar industry they had they had people that they had paid off you know at the heads of of the American Heart Association at its Inception that uh were pushing their agenda and they actually misrepresented the the Framingham study so the Framingham study actually showed that as you lowered your cholesterol cardiovascular death rate went up exactly the opposite so in fact higher cholesterol protected people from heart attacks and strokes right and so you know that's that's my answer saturated fat 100 does not cause heart disease to not contribute to heart disease and uh it and LDL doesn't either it just doesn't you know I mean maybe you can look at certain patterns of your different you know LDL particulates and see if you have a greater or reduced risk of developing heart disease that does not mean that those molecules are causing the disease it just means that they're being used in the process or they're being damaged and this is again the smoke and not the fire right they're being damaged other things are being damaged the whole body is being damaged and you're getting heart disease and you're blaming it on you know this little guy over here which which is not borne out by by the data I don't think you know even if you have the bad pattern of LDL like a pattern B LDL you're having all these small dents um you know LDL C molecules running around which have a stronger association with heart disease it's a 70 increase risk of heart disease right so it's 1.7 x so 1.7 times increased risk of developing heart disease very scary 70 right well metabolic syndrome increases your risk by 600 percent so 6X and diabetes increases your risk by one thousand percent 10x right smoking is about the same so that 1.7 x on SD LEL I just really I just I'm not getting out of bed for that you know and the fact of the matter is you're not going to have that cldl if you're eating a natural appropriate carnivore diet and you're not eating carbs you're not eating seed oils you're not drinking alcohol you're not going to have that you know so saturated fat does not increase sdldl and statins don't decrease sdldl they stop your body from making the large buoyant LDL which are the good ones so you're reducing the LDL that are good for you and you're preserving all the ones that are bad for you because those don't actually change so it's not actually the change in your cholesterol that that makes statins helpful how helpful are they if you've had a heart attack and you go on statins for at least five years you'll increase your life expectancy on average by five days not years not months days right and uh and you have a lot of side effects you have a lot of costs and uh you know there's a study that actually showed that certain um uh statins like Lipitor can cross a blood-brain barrier and they can uh actually stop your brain cells from making cholesterol which they need to do 20 of your brain is made out of cholesterol thereabouts your axons are myelinated with a lot of cholesterol right and so you can get demyelination you can actually get atrophy of your brain and you have all these patients with Alzheimer's who are on these statins they said okay why don't we take you off the statins wouldn't you know in six weeks they didn't have Alzheimer's anymore funny enough and then they put them back on the statins and six weeks later they had Alzheimer's again right so this is causing harm and it's giving you five days right five days in a nursing home dribbling thank you I'll go without and if you haven't had a heart attack it increases it by three days right so not much bang for your buck and and there's definitely a lot that could be uh a problematic with it as well so um you know and I don't know when the Cleveland Clinic said that I don't know if they've changed their minds since then but saturated fat is simply not uh the the problem that that people thought it was and that was a long answer to that but I think that's probably one of the major ones that people have and it's just absolutely just just absolutely just Hammer the nail in the coffin on that one and just let that die and go away I just want to add something too I didn't mention this before Dr chafee hasn't seen these questions in advance and you're not using a teleprompter right no so this is this is another another thing I always tell people use your own two eyes and observe these things like all of the that answer Dr chafee just gave that's the carnivore brain at work right do you think Dr chafee before this you had been able to Rattle off just your your stats and figures and statistics and studies and just like that like I'm finding myself on Carnivore I'm able to just riff I did a video yesterday for like 40 minutes where I could never do that before it's something kind of sorry I'm getting off track here but something interesting with carnivore the other thing you said that's so interesting I heard Dr Philip lavadia talk about that too the metabolic Health why doesn't anybody talk about metabolic Health everyone that knows I'm doing carnivore I want to see your LDL you're going to die of a heart attack nobody talks about metabolic health and it's like you said six times more likely to have heart disease if you have poor metabolic health and you look around the world right now everybody seems to have poor metabolic health and nobody's worried about it and gee I wonder why because if you're worried about metabolic Health that's less sugar and junk food you're going to be eating and like we've said before if you want to sell an incredible amount of sugar just demonize meat and get everybody scared about LDL and if you're not eating meat the only thing left is to go back to the sugar and the junk food and the carbs well and the thing is too is that if if you are eating the junk food and you're getting sick and uh then you need the medicine right so they're all they're all tied up they're all invested in each other so the food companies are invested heavily in the Pharmaceuticals the pharmaceutical companies are invested heavily and the food companies and in some cases like Kellogg's Kellogg's actually makes diabetes medications so they they make frosted you know Corn Flakes and things like that and then they sell that to you gives you diabetes and then they sell you the medication for it you know I mean that I mean that's that's knowledge of forethought they know what's happening they're selling you a product that causes the disease which now they're selling you the treatment for I think that's honestly diabolical I think that's pure evil that you're you're doing something that causes disease and you're profiting from it you know you're profiting from people eating your product which is which is harming them and then you're like yeah well I'll just sell sell them this other thing too you know that was what um someone said that they um they heard someone at a you know Drug Company exec said you know my favorite you know drug is and they were thinking I was like oh it's going to be this thing that cures you know childhood leukemia and all these sorts of things I was like oh yeah what is it this is like my favorite drugs are the ones that cause problems that need more drugs those are my favorite drugs and um I think if I was in the room without probably you know knock the guy out and feel pretty good about it you know and and you know but um that that I think is truly sick you know and I think it was a Goldman Sachs or something like that one of the investment companies uh if it wasn't them I apologize but you know there was there was an investment company I think it was Goldman Sachs that someone someone leaked a picture from one of their their meetings that says you know is it really a good business model to cure diseases right implying that you know shouldn't shouldn't we just perpetuate a chronic state that we can sell someone the the treatment for the symptom something that you can treat the symptom for 60 years and put them on blood pressure medications diabetes medication you know statins and things like that for 60 years and just you know profit on them their whole life until they die young sick and miserable you know I think that that that's truly sick I mean people people have lost their Humanity you know and I don't think that they I honestly think these people should be jailed like you're knowingly doing something like that you got to go like you have to go like that that is not okay you know you you are causing harm and you're profiting from it like you don't get to do that right wow all right here's another question or concern I'm scared to start carnivore because I've heard many say red meat is associated with an increased risk of colon rectum cancer and evidence also suggests It's associated with some other cancers so the University of Washington uh published last year a massive review looking at at hundreds of different studies that that asked that question and looked into it and the ones that that suggested that there was a very very weak and tenuous link and again Association with red meat meat processed meat whatever and any cancer of any form rectal cancer or otherwise they found that they were extremely flaw of studies extremely weak evidence extremely bad studies that they said these were lazy studies this was lazy such as junk science and that they didn't prove anything they didn't even show Association when you get rid of the confounding factors and the biases and things like that they found no association no association between meat and any cancers and certainly not unprocessed red meat and cancer so this is something this is a problem again going back to the processed food companies and The Seventh-Day Adventist Church and and uh and other sorts of things that have a vested interest against meat not just four plants but against meat right because the seven-day Adventist Church were religiously anti-meat in the 1800s they said that you know meat causes lustful feelings so uh meat is a sin because lust is a sin meat is now a sin and plants help suppress your lustful feelings it helps suppress your hormones and your health and so your body says you can't procreate right and so that that's what's happening there um but that's what they thought this was they thought this was a good thing that you just were depressed and miserable and your body wasn't capable of having a child children um and somehow that was holy even though the Bible tells you to go forth and multiply you know and so they founded sanitarian foods and Kellogg's foods and and the processed food industry was started by them to push this plant-based agenda to stop people and suppress their hormones and make them uh you know less less active sexually for some reason that really was important to them to voice this on the rest of the world and the sugar companies and drug companies and the uh you know other food companies and things like that they're the ones putting out the majority of the research and nutrition so just Coca-Cola spends 11 times the amount of money on nutritional research than the NIH and that's not to say what Nestle and Pepsi and Kellogg's and sanitarium and the Seven Day Adventists are putting out so all of these studies you have to look at where they're coming from you have to look at who peer reviews them quite often it's Loma Linda Medical Center which is the Seventh-day Adventist uh churches Medical Center and medical school right and then you have the the Adventist studies oh the Adventist study okay again you're looking you know this is this is fruit from the poison Vine right you're looking at the Adventists they're doing their own study on their own people with their own numbers and their own interpretations right it's never going to be fair so you look at all these studies the vast majority of these studies are put out by these people that have vested interests you cannot trust them and so the University of Washington was they were actual scientists actual doctors who actually wanted to know the truth they looked at these things they're like these are crap these are crap studies they're horribly designed they don't show what you're saying they show and so that they they just said absolutely not so they concluded that so you can you can find that um you can find that study from the University of Washington last year the reason people really blame you know meet and you know processed meat in particular uh with with being a carcinogen because the who said it was in 2015 right they said they processed meat was uh was a carcinogen you know cause cancer and that that red meat probably cause cancer right would probably mean okay so name one thing in red meat that causes cancer right there isn't anything right however the who actually has a web web page dedicated to different natural food toxins you're like okay so maybe it'll be stuff about them eating there not a single thing of meat everything's about plants all the different toxins that are in plants that we eat and they're toxic in the proportions that we eat them and you have to detoxify them you have to prepare them in certain ways or you can die right so these are very toxic not a single line on meat there's um there was a mention of algae not not meat that could get into sea life right shellfish fish and things like that right and then you could get sick from eating you know that you can eating the algae through you know the fish or the the shellfish that had eaten the algae that's not the fish doing that so they said that that this that processed meat was was the problem right okay but if if you go from red meat unprocessed meat into processed meat it becomes cancerous carcinogenic okay well what happened did you add more meat to it and that that made a cancerous also no they added plants seasonings sugar artificial ingredients a bunch of preservatives watching nonsense like that so if you went from an un not cancerous thing to a cancerous thing it's the things you added to it that were the problem right so it wasn't the meat in the first place but the who um you know it's even worse than that because they they looked at these studies they looked at the flawed studies they looked at the bad studies that pushed what they wanted to because I wanted wanted to say because a large portion of these people controlling a portion of this of this group were vegans vegetarians and Seventh-Day Adventists or a combination thereof right and so there are other people on those that panel still in the who were basically railroaded and you know couldn't make decisions couldn't say like hey look you're throwing out very strong data that show that there's no relationship between meat red meat and cancer including very flawed studies that are very weak evidence that are not as good and yet they they push your narrative and they kept those in and so they said that that was one of the one gentleman said that that was one of the hardest things he's had to go through professionally seeing them constantly you know throw away very very good studies that showed that there was no connection with with meat and cancer and bringing in ones that that uh were crap and he said okay you guys need to display your biases you need to say that you're vegans are vegetarians and and Seventh-Day Adventists they refuse right so of course this is that this is narrative you know this is ideology this is not science this is not fact and so the more people that understand that the better because you know they they can only survive you can only survive a Web of Lies if people don't know that they're lies and so the more people that understand that the better meat does not cause cancer right the the cancer rates of the Inuit actually very low has successively gone up in successive generations and decades as they've been further incorporated into Western society and started eating more Western Foods right cancer doesn't exist in the wild cancer is a disease of civilization that was a book title by a professor from Harvard in in the 1920s called wilhelmer stefanson who people know wrote the book called The Fat of the land he lived with the Inuit thing called the Eskimo for 12 years learn their language learn their culture just ate me the whole time he said this I've never felt better in my entire life and you and he really started looking into it and he found that cancer only existed in you know more modern civilizations not in the privilege of populations we do not see cancer in wild animals we do not see cancer in zoo animals being fed their natural diet we do see cancers in pets that are given a bunch of grains and plant-based crap that they're not designed to eat we do see it in zoo animals if they're fed this plant-based crab that they're not designed to eat either so that's my answer that's another one of these things that that really just do need to die it's just it's just it's propaganda it's ideology it's not science love it and that's one big thing I've learned on Carnivore because my whole life when I would hear a study you hear them all the time too you're inundated with them throughout your whole life on the Nightly News meat's gonna kill you all these all these studies I always used to think study science and I never really thought about them I always in the back of my head it's like well these are here for my benefit it's they're not like you really need to question all of these studies because it's incredibly expensive to do a study someone's not going to do it unless there's some sort of bias or some sort of agenda or some sort of pharmaceutical pill that they want to sell at the end of it um it's kind of like on when you're doing carnivore you got to be a a detective looking at all the ingredients or Foods or just only eat meat but you got to really look into things and you gotta it's the same thing with those studies I don't listen to any studies anymore unless you you really look into it uh here's another one carnivore diet is way too restrictive life is too short to sacrifice ice cream and social outings for a carnivore diet that'll make me a a joyless Hermit very specific you don't seem like a joyless Hermit I'm not a joyless Hermit but no I mean you look that I mean that that's the same argument as saying you know that's too restrictive not doing meth and heroin all day I mean that's ridiculous you want to live your life like that I mean really you know you want to not do heroin and met I mean have you ever done heroin and meth you might like it you know you might want to do that every day same idea right you're doing something that is knowingly bad for you right obviously you know drugs are pretty intense but but it's illustrating a point you're doing something that's knowingly bad for you because you want the effect right so you want social experience you just want to have something nummy like ice cream um you know that that's sacrificing your health for a momentary Joy is not a good idea and so you know we look at people that that drink to excess or do drugs uh and we and we and that person would probably be like that's ridiculous that that's no way to live well but life is short well you're going to make it a lot shorter by doing that and yes you're gonna you're gonna have fun now you know but you're not gonna actually live and and you know a fulfilling life that you could with you know family career loved ones travel all sorts of interesting things that could engage you for decades and the same thing is true with food right you're trading Decades of your life we're not talking about a few years we're talking about decades we know genetically we know as geneticists that chromosomally we are designed to live 120 years I was taught that in my genetics class 20 years ago 20 plus years ago now Jesus Christ I'm old so you know it's um you know that based on the length of our telomeres right so we we look at that and you can sort of gauge how long an animal or a species is supposed to live we're 120 years yeah I mean it's crazy you go back to historical records there's you know civilizations that that have said this you know the Native Americans they would often live 120 years ah they're just saying that Herodotus documented the Ethiopians they said they lived 120 years just ate boiled meat just drank milk and water ah must have been lying but the person said they lived 80 years and they ate bread that's about that's about what we're eating where we're living they didn't have a bunch of processed foods it was just Breads and things like that so you know but it was always 120 it was always coming back to that so what what does that mean if you are genetically designed to live 120 years then that means by definition that if you just don't mess up it's just stay out of your own way and just don't mess up that you should live 120 years without doing anything special it should just happen it should just happen on its own so why are we dying in our 60s and 70s that's literally middle-aged and that's because we are are rotting our bodies we're rotting our brains we're decaying decades early we're starting to decay in our 30s and 40s oh you're middle age you're you're past 20 is just downhill from there when was that ever a thing right Benjamin Franklin was was kicking ass in his you know 60s and 70s like during the you know the the Revolutionary War and um you know and so you know you know Socrates was in his late 70s when they had to kill him you know he was so uh you know so healthy and big you know and and you know vigorous that like you know he was there you know corrupting the Youth of Athens you know in his late 70s right so you know that's just just not the case you know we are designed to live a lot longer and yet we're dying or collapsing our bodies are just decaying and degenerating uh we're getting heart disease in our 30s and 40s people don't have heart attacks in their 30s which is crazy the first heart attack was in you know 1910 or so and now people in their 30s you know people in their 20s are getting heart disease like how the hell is that possible right so you know this is this is just a major problem so yes you can do that and you know good luck to you but I would rather be vigorous and healthy for the next hundred years now people oh I don't want to live that long I'll be horrible where did this come from most people say I want to live forever I don't want to die then you say okay hey you know you just see me you can live another 100 years oh I don't I wouldn't want that I wouldn't want to live that long what the hell why are you why are we talking about this you just said you wanted to live forever but you don't actually want to live longer they think that you know you're going to age in the same pattern that we're aging now you get up to 70 80 people are just like just decrepit and dying and just not doing well health-wise they don't have a very you know uh you know envious life you know sitting at home not being able to do anything uh you know sitting in a nursing home playing shuffleboard or something like that if they can even get out of a chair and then stacking on another 40 Years of that where you're even like getting worse and worse and worse and you're just sitting there with a blanket and a towel with someone wiping your face obviously you know that's not a desirable life that's not what we're talking about we're talking about being hail and Hearty healthy older adults and your brain's still working your body's still working you being fully independent and active until you just slowly pass away at 135 thank you count me in I'm happy with that you know invest in compound interest right now you know just just it's a waiting game at that point you'll be fine you'll live in a castle in Transylvania somewhere for the next 50 years you know the last 50 years of your life you'll be fine all right so um you know it depends on what you find restrictive you know it's just eating eating our biologically designed diet that's restrictive well why not eat you know uh just random plants well why would you that's not good for it's going to be healthy for you okay so that's not food for you so I don't consider non-meat food because it's not food for our species food is species specific so I'm not restricting at all I eat everything that is designed for humans eat which is any animal basically or the parts of an animal that aren't that aren't you know poisonous right you have poison sacks and things like that and so that's what I eat I don't limit myself at all you know I'm very unrestrictive you know it is restricted as type 2 diabetes heart disease cancer is very restrictive autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis that will you know you put you in a wheelchair and then kill you that's pretty restrictive you know having to take thousands of dollars of medications a month that's pretty restrictive you know that's gonna that's gonna put you out a bit um you know going bankrupt having to pay for chemo for yourself or a loved one that's pretty restrictive um taking medications 20 times a day having massive side effects GI upsets and um you know vomiting being sick all the time that that's actually pretty damn restrictive you're not being able to play with your kids is restrictive not being able to you know uh you know be an active member in your relationship in your in your marriage not be able to work properly being sick so sick that you you can't even function you can't succeed in your job in your career and your profession being so racked with chronic pain that you can't leave the house without copious amounts of of medications that that dope you up so much that you can barely function that's restrictive you know not not having something nummy every now and then that that is the least restrictive thing I've ever heard of in my in my entire life yes wow so true and then they say joyless hermit uh I'm on Carnival day 134. I have never felt better in my entire life 100 years with no ice cream and the people that are saying like you mentioned earlier well who wants to live to a hundred they're in the mindset of the standard American diet feeling like garbage every single day if they felt like you or I feel right now oh yeah take me to 120 years old 130 years old in a second I just I feel amazing and I don't the the ice cream's yummy like you said but everyone out there really needs to think about this like if I had some ice cream right now every single time I've done it in the past before I felt like garbage afterwards I felt inflamed and my stomach's gurgling and bubbling and it was never like oh gee I'm glad I had that gigantic ice cream I feel so much better now I uh so much so much better this way and people say too it's joyless I disagree on that too I have a big rib eye waiting for me at home right now and every single day still day 134 I am smiling when I'm eating it I feel great it tastes delicious it's like the best thing in the world yeah absolutely here's another one I'm athletic and I would never adopt a carnivore diet because it includes almost zero carbs to thrive physically carbs are essential if carnivore is so great wouldn't the NFL have adopted it well the New Zealand All Blacks have you know and then they are crushing it in the in the world stage in rugby so you know they've been doing that for or at least low carb for for a number of years in fact there's a there's a guy uh Dr Peter brunkner who's uh you know one of the top you know Sports Medicine doctors in the world down here in Australia and he and he's worked with a number of different teams around Australia and turned them into uh absolute machines uh just going low carb not even full carnivore just getting rid of carbs specifically just getting rid of cars and going keto uh the the Australian uh National cricket team they went and got thumped by England and they lost you know all five five days of the of the Test match right so they just got thumped driven out of town England was you know her happy hurray and so they went back six months later or so they went and thumped India which is a which is a major major country to beat in cricket right and they thump them five to nothing right I believe that's the case and what was the difference they went from getting thumped by England and then thumping a better team than England what happened well in that time Peter Bruckner got to them and got them all on a low-carb diet got them off the carbohydrates and they became such vicious athletes that they absolutely destroyed the competition after that and you see that time and time again in professional sports there are people doing carnivore trust me on that they just don't want you to know about it they don't want their competition to know about it because they get paid to play and so they want that Advantage this is why people take steroids without telling anybody because it gives them an advantage over other people or maybe it puts levels to Playing Field against other people who are doing steroids as well they want to make their spot so they want to be they maybe they love their teammates and all that sort of stuff they still want to start that week and so they want to be better than the guy who's gunning for his spot right or her spot and so they want that Advantage they don't necessarily want other people to know about I was always happy to everybody you know my secret my team better I was I was always happy for that but you know a lot of people are just like hey this is this is my livelihood and I certainly don't want my competition knowing about it so they kept it hush hush and so there are a number of professional athletes that absolutely do do this and you know and there's more and more and more data coming out with this there's a professor Tim Knox from South South Africa who was um he was like the major guy on the world stage of sport Sports Medicine saying you need to eat carbs you need carbs to burn carbs you need these things for for high uh you know high high level Athletics and he just went oh my God I'm wrong I've lied to everybody because things when you stop eating carbohydrates your body makes carbohydrates so yeah you do need carbohydrates but you have more carbohydrates if you stop eating them because your body makes it from your fat it makes it nearly instantly so you're making blood sugar you're making glycogen you're making ketones as well and you're constantly replenishing your your liver and muscle glycogen from your fat stores so you have something like you know you know 15 000 kilojoules in your of um of energy that you can stuff if you're carbo loading in your uh you know the night before something like that you stuff your liver full of from glycogen at sort of a maximum capacity but you have a hundred and fifty thousand locked up in your fat source so even for for a slim athlete you'll have that so you are going to run out of your stored glycogen far faster then you're going to run out of your adiposity and so you're going to keep keep replenishing that and I played for you know professional sports high level competitive rugby uh for 10 you know 10 years before medical school and five years of that thereabouts was on uh carnivore five years that was not I can tell you for a cold Frozen fact that it was thousands of times better on Carnivore I couldn't get tired I couldn't run out of energy I couldn't get sore I was at a dead Sprint every second of every game every training every day no one could uh could out uh you know beat me on Fitness or anything no one there wasn't a single person that I ever came across that that could beat me uh for endurance and fitness and things like that not a soul you know I was sprinting you know equivalence of marathons and I remember thinking I was like I should enter a marathon because I could literally Sprint it I wouldn't get I wouldn't be able to I wouldn't have to stop I could just be at a dead Sprint for 26 miles I'd set a world record on my first marathon and just be in the news I was just like I should do that but it's the thought of just running you know for 26 miles just like the most boring thing that I could think of you know if I if I'm running more than 40 meters and not hitting somebody like I'm I'm you know I'm I'll probably hit somebody you know I'll just tell you that so you know so like that that was that was what was worth it to me but I thought I was like okay well if one comes up I'll I'll do that but yeah this is before the internet so um I didn't I didn't have anything to look up and I didn't really care to either but um I was uh I felt way better way better when I was doing that than any other point in my life except for right now and I'm back feeling that way and at 38 I got back to a carnivore diet realizing that that's what I was doing in my early 20s from 20 to 25 just by happenstance I just stopped eating plants because I learned how toxic they were to humans uh in college and I was just like right I'm not eating this crap I just defaulted into eating meat and eggs and then at 38 I realized okay wow that's what I was doing that's I was I was living as we're designed to live humans are carnivores as a species that's just the kind of animal that we are and that's what I was doing I was living as a carnivore I was eating as a carnivore and just like any other animal you give us what we're designed to eat we're gonna we're gonna do better and so at 38 years old I went back on just carnivore I was older a lot older you know I hadn't played a full season of rugby in three years it just become back from Bangladeshi and humanitarian work hadn't worked out months right fat out of shape it was like 270 pounds you know I wasn't like oh oh well I I was technically obese but uh you know I can still I still had like you know I could still sort of see my six-pack and things like that but I had a lot of extra weight normally like I'm sort of like well you know my plan was around 240 right so I had I definitely had like 30 extra pounds on me probably more than that because I didn't have as much muscle and within two weeks I felt so good that I was like right I'm going out to play rugby again it's 38 years old fat and out of shape and I went back and I just felt great again I was like right is can I do this like in my early 20s where I just push myself as hard as I can my body just responds I could so I was at a dead Sprint every second of that training and you know couldn't wear myself out wasn't sore the next day like this is this is going to be bad for some people and so I just started you know training again and you know I just started feeling absolutely amazing shredded down stacked on muscle and just got better and better and better more athletic and you know I'm 38 years old and you know I'm I'm out there competing with you know professional rugby players in their in their 20s right so it makes a massive difference this is and this is something I've worked with a lot of athletes um you can go to my my channel there's a playlist on on bodybuilding and Athletics there are athlete after athlete after athlete that is showing this is that they're absolutely killing a lot of professional athletes professional rugby players Collegiate rugby players you know like top level European uh you know rugby players in um uh you know University and and professionals and they're absolutely crushing it they're just stacking on muscle getting crazy fit and killing it and their athleticism is going crazy Ryan Talbot uh is a great guy he's been I've had him on the podcast twice he's an NCAA all two-time All-American decathlete in NCAA one for Michigan State both of those All-American titles were on a carnivore diet he changed mid-season went carnivore and as a mid-season adaption he said it was still he still didn't find it was a downside he felt you know there was some adoption you know periods going on but he actually felt amazing and so he ended up doing so much better he ended up setting you know winning the Big Ten Championship in his first year uh in doing the decathlon set a School record and then went to Nationals and uh earned All-American honors and you know got second the next year and again earned All-American honor so and he's just saying he's just getting better and better and better and he was saying that he actually has to work out less because if if he's working out more and lifting weights he actually puts on muscle too easily right and he doesn't want to be as jacked and muscular because you know he wants to be lighter so he's got no fat to lose so you know he needs to he needs to keep his his musculature down so that's what you get on a carnivore diet and the only reason that people in the NFL aren't doing is because they just don't know about it but as soon as they do you can bet your ass that they will be doing it could you imagine a whole team of carnivores and the coach the coach is a carnivore that'd be amazing yeah I yeah like you got to use your own two eyes too like look at Dr chafee look at Dr Baker look at all of these the carnivore people you see too and for myself I have never been athletic or exercise I couldn't do a pull-up for a million dollars before I started carnivore every single day every single morning this morning included I get up at five in the morning I jog I do pull-ups I do exercise and it's like you said I'm not even like lifting a bunch of Weights but that's what people have said Well Carrie you lost so much weight and you're like you're growing muscle like what are you in the gym every single day no I have these resistance bands they do these little pathetic resistance bands every day but it's just like it goes on so quickly and the thing you said is so true I never get tired anymore bike riding jogging whatever I used to I could go a little bit and then I would just be fatigued and trying to catch my breath and I couldn't catch up on Carnivore you like it's crazy you just you don't get tired you don't get that fatigue there's just a you know someone in the comments that you know saying that this guy Josh Bank saying extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence yeah so look up Tim Knox Professor Tim Knox he's putting out he's putting out copious amounts of study uh you know randomized controlled trials like taking athletes and taking two groups of them randomizing them giving one carbs not giving the other carbs right getting them keto adapted and putting putting him to work and and checking their results they find that there's actually no letdown uh in the keto crowd so you're saying that you have to have carbs absolutely don't and Tim Knox has proven that and in fact now you don't have to run on your glycogen you will run out of your glycogen you only have you know hour or two depending on how much glycogen you have so if you're doing really high intensity uh sport you're going to run out of that uh bit quicker as well depending on how hard you're working uh you don't run out of that when you're fat adapted right so he found that these people had had no drop in their athleticism you know in the in the in the short term and they could just keep going where the other guys dropped off without refeeding and taking a bunch of sugar packets and things like that and then he took them and switch them and fed the non-carb group carbs and the carb group no carbs put them on a keto diet keto adapted them again tested them again there was no drop in performance by switching and and coming off the carb so uh yeah you know you're right you know uh you know you make these sorts of claims you need to have evidence and it's there uh look it up Professor Tim Knox great should we take that Peter Walker and yeah Dr Peter brunkner and uh Paul Mason all these guys are putting out copious amounts of studies and research it's amazing too that there's studies out there too because I get that comment a lot and it's hard to have studies for something like carnivore because there's not a lot of money to be made if everybody just eats meat and they do it they're supposed to but the fact that there are is is great and uh yeah I was thinking maybe we got one more carnivore argument here and then maybe we could jump into some of the viewers uh questions and super chats uh here's one I get this comment all the time on my channel my doctor insists I need fiber how can I possibly do that on Carnivore diet well I mean you ask them what the evidence is you know what they'll say first of all they want to know it you know because I guarantee you they've never actually looked at a single study uh referencing fiber but the the studies that do suggest that that you do better with fiber and they do exist these are a epidemiological studies that are not Interventional trials that you actually try to where you can prove cause and effect and they say well when you increase fiber compared to the standard population eating a standard American diet which is highly processed garbage which doesn't have a lot of fiber because you can't put a lot of fiber in processed foods because you have to freeze it and ship it and all these sorts of things that when you do that you're eating more fiber so you're eating more Whole Foods you're not eating all the processed crap okay so you're you're that's not the same thing you're not saying that the fiber is doing better well no you're just you're you're not just adding fiber to you know to a Happy Meal and to you know fries and process you know cookies and cakes and things like that you know you're you're going to a whole food diet approach you're actually changing a lot of variables so there's a lot of confounding factors a lot of things that you're changing you're getting rid of a lot of things that are really bad for you you're adding things that are that respectively better for you that have fiber in them and and I would say that they are better and so if you if you're looking at that contrast of course you're going to improve so that's not the same thing right so you're not saying that fiber is better there's a lot of confounding factors maybe maybe fiber was doing that but maybe not the only Interventional trials have actually not been so favorable for for uh fiber there was one that looked at it was around sort of you know 75 people or so so you know smaller study but it's really the only one that exists and they split people like they all had they're all symptomatic for you know GI upset and distress um and so you know take that for what you will but they split them up into four groups one kept eating the same amount of fiber group two increase the amount of fiber group three reduce the amount of fiber group four eliminate fiber entirely and when you know more fiber made more GI upset same fiber same amount of GI upset less fiber less GI upset no fiber completely fixed all symptoms in all participants right so the fiber seemed to have been causing the GI upset um there was another study with over 2 000 people looking at you know doing colonoscopies on these different people and looking for risk factors for diverticulosis which is you know basically colon failure you're drinking these out pouchings with failure of that organ and you get quite sick you get diverticulitis they can be an infection of the diverticulosis you can get ruptures and you can die it's very serious um so they found in over 2000 people the only risk factors uh increased risk factors of developing diverticulosis first of all age as we get older it's just more likely that you're going to damage your body enough to develop this um but then after that it was just fiber more fiber not less fiber more fiber and more bowel motions so people they were having on average more than 15 bowel motions a week had a massively increased risk of developing diverticulosis right so you're eating a whole bunch of plant matter with fiber in it you cannot digest that you cannot absorb that you cannot use that you have to eliminate it by Design right and so you're going to be you know going the bathroom more often than other people right so constipation was not associated with diverticulosis that's what it's attributing oh you're getting constipated and fiber Health with constipation no constipation was not a risk factor meat was not a risk factor dietary fat was not a risk factor more fiber more bowel motions probably from the fiber were the only associations they were strongly correlated as well it was like a 600 700 percent increase risk right those are the studies that exist on fiber that you know actually tell you something foreign love it wow we have over a thousand people on right now 61. Jesus we've got a bunch of super chats and questions and fears from the viewers here so I thought maybe we would jump into some of those a couple of new members here Jeff thank you and Kip thank you anyone that joins and becomes a member on my channel every penny from that goes towards the carnivore diet documentary so I really appreciate it all super chats I get I'll go to that as well here's a question for Dr chafee 39 year old overweight has iih has CSF leak nasally and on dimex I read diet may help iih would carnivore diet help because I read low-fat sodium is suggested neurosurgeons suggested a shunt yeah well so I mean there's difficulties of IAH Diamox is just a medication that can reduce the amount of CSF that we produce in our brain uh CSF leak that's not great you know that that should be addressed sometimes those will heal spontaneously but if that that doesn't then you know she'll need an intervention that's a very very big risk of developing meningitis you know getting a bacteria up through uh that break wherever the break is um you know in in their nose to uh into the brain so that's that that's a big deal um so it sounds like she's being on treatment for that but however you know if you're sort of keep leaking and leaking and leaking I mean that that needs to be addressed like that's that's a that's a big deal she can uh get very very sick and and be life-threatening um iih you know I don't I don't know offhand there might be studies first of all you know going back to that other gentleman there are literally thousands of very high level studies Interventional trials control trials and so on with ketogenic diets in humans and animals thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of these things now that show specific benefits in many many many different issues and so it's becoming much more popularized in medical circles now and there there could be one for iih I'm not I'm not sure I don't know of any studies but you know what it's um it's how our body was designed anyway it was just to eat meat and not eat all these other things that can cause direct harm to our body so you know either way I think it's it's in her best interest and everyone's best interest to to go on a biologically appropriate diet all the best evidence shows that what that is for for humans is a is a high fat meat-based diet and I think that will help in a lot of other ways um you know whether it helps with that I don't know um that's something I'll make a note of and I'll try to look up and see if we have any studies on keto there won't be any for carnivore but you know there would be for keto and carnivore diet is a keto denogenic diet or it really should be I think and so I'll take a look for that but I think it's I think it's worth a try anyway but um if that keeps leaking you know need to be on top of her doctors to make sure that that gets investigated that that might need to be surgically uh stopped up you know a CSF lake is a very very big deal all right Alia Wells twenty dollars hi Kerry and Dr chafee first donation for the doc let's get those super chats going thank you Alia Ali is awesome thank you very much a whole bunch of funds earlier uh Bishops keep learning meat causes and insulin response can you elaborate on why this is not a problem and it's okay to eat meat multiple times per day yeah so you know the thing is is that when you it's first of all the protein that causes an insulin response not fat fat does not trigger an insulin response when you're eating people go about the glycemic index uh we'll get a bit Get Fooled by this because you'll see protein has it has a higher uh you know glycemic neural insulin response but that's not actually the case that's only in combination with carbohydrates so if you're not eating carbohydrates you won't have as big of a jump in your insulin response okay blood sugar or your insulin response and so if you're just eating meat and you have a large bolus of of protein that comes with you know eating until you're full yes you'll get you'll get a slight rise in your blood sugar much smaller than than you would if you were eating carbohydrates and yes you'll get you'll get a rise in your insulin as well however you will then get a correspondingly high if not higher release of glucagon which opposes insulin brings that back down brings your blood sugar back down normalizes that normalizes your insulin as well so it's actually a normal physiological process that's part of the physiological response when we're eating and that's okay you know it's uh you know people talk about you know oh we shouldn't be in ketosis all this time or whatever you're not if you eat a big steak you will come out of ketosis temporarily and then you'll get back into it afterwards and so you know that that's that's the the issue there it's not it's not a big deal for that reason you're not going to spike your insulin you're not going to spike your blood sugar for a prolonged period of time so you're not going to kick yourself out of you know therapeutic ketosis or nutritional ketosis if you're worried about that so uh you know so that's fine also you know we are designed to eat a certain way I think that way is just eating meat that's you know what our ancestors did throughout the the ice ages and and even more recently the Native Americans and the planes are eating you know Buffalo and pemmican and things like that they were extraordinarily Healthy Living 120 years by their records so I know I guess they're we can just call them Liars I guess but that's what they were saying and you know and you've got people talking about how they were in the War of 1812 and describing this and describing that and be like it's 1920 and you were fighting in the War of 1812 they're like oh okay maybe he's just making it up whatever you can think what you want I'll think what I want but either way they were extraordinarily healthy and they were found to be the tallest human beings on Earth right your average height of a population denotes the average health of a population they were just eating largely they just eating meat fatty meat and so whatever your whatever your body does whatever your physiology does whatever your biochemistry does when you're giving it its input when cows eat grass something happens when lions eat gazelle something happened maybe they go out of ketosis for a while they get an insulin response you know when whales eat you know a lot of krill or whatever something's happening but when they're eating what they're supposed to eat what happens is supposed to happen that's the same thing for us so I think that that the evidence shows that humans are designed to eat meat that's what we evolved on and that means that's what we're supposed to eat what we've been eating for the entire existence of humanity that is by definition what we're adapted to right that's how that works right so two three million years of just eating meat or predominantly eating meat that is what we're adapted to eating that's what we're going to do best on and so if you're just eating what you're designed to eat your body's going to do what it's designed to do so if your insulin goes up a bit great I'm not too worried about it I've literally never checked my ketones or blood sugar because I just don't care because I'm eating what I'm supposed to eat my body's doing what it's supposed to do and that's all that really matters I get that question a lot I'm like what would I do differently there's nothing I could do any differently to affect that number uh Troya said question in another post thank you for all you do I'll I'm looking right now to see if I c an find that other post thank you so much uh robono 20"

        "body": "an find that other post thank you so much uh robono 20 an find that other post thank you so much uh robono 20 Super Chat thank you for all you're doing question could you address the effects of cream again well the main the main thing also cream is going to have a lot of uh very positive fatty acids um in fact so so it's something I was actually reading uh Dr Robert lustig's book metabolical which is a fantastic book and it sort of blows a lot of the case open on processed foods and and fructose in particular and uh and really you know does a scathing review of the uh I actually talks about the the seventh day Adventists and the uh food companies and things like that food and drunk companies how this is this is not they're not doing things for you that they should um and he spoke about you know the fats in Dairy and they're odd chained uh saturated fatty acids right and so you know meat has even Chained and these do different things in your body this is a whole idea of you know calories and calories out is a bit insane to me anyone who's taken biochemistry should know better and anyone who hasn't taken biochemistry uh should should do that before they start talking about this um yeah these chemical these these compounds are different or very complex organic chemicals they have different complex chemical interactions in your body so you have dozens of carbohydrates they do different specific things in your body you have dozens of different amino acids they do different specific things and have different chemical and hormonal responses in your body same goes with your fatty acids so you have saturated fatty acids in milk and they are odd chained uh fatty acids they seem to be actually cardio protective right so your drinking cream that is the a you're getting a lot of positive fatty acids saturated fatty acids which are good for you cardio protective from various studies and uh they're they're taking out a lot of the proteins and things like that as well so you know a lot of good things there some people respond to Dairy some people have a problem with dairy for whatever's in in there a lot of people are responding to the casein which is you know one of the proteins that milk has and a lot of people respond to that and so they usually have to avoid that most screens will get out most of that but they'll probably still have some in there so if you're very sensitive to that you can have a problem with that I don't think there's too much of a problem having cream or other fats because we need a lot of fat you know we typically need around one gram of fat per one gram of protein about for different people it's going to be slightly different maybe up or down depending on your activity level and your protein demands and things like that from from Athletics or lifting you know you're going to need a bit different so so everyone needs to mold that to their own situation but it's shoot for a gram for gram and then adjust from there for yourself but you have a limited capacity to absorb fat it's actually very difficult for your body to absorb fat without bile you only make a limited amount of bile every day and once that runs out you can't really absorb fat you can absorb some but it's it's very low figures like 10 to 15 percent largely uh medium chain fatty acids so most of that's going to go out and that's actually what keeps your stool soft that's why you don't get uh well if you're eating enough fat you don't get constipated on a carnivore diet you'll get the hard drive Rocky stools you'll get infrequent stools but that's not constipation constipation is the consistency of stools not the frequency of the stools and so if you're not eating a whole bunch of fiber you're just not getting rid of a lot of waste because you're absorbing 98 to 99 of the meat that you're eating and so you don't have much waste to go out it's actually a lot more convenient to just not be on the toilet all day and so cream you know you add some of that stuff in some people will have some some issues with some of the things in there and so you know maybe that's not something you want to do but most people will be okay with it I do find that some people with dairy any dairy seems to stall there's something in there that can that can trigger your body not to not to lose as much fat or even put on weight um not everybody but some people find that that's a stall so if that's you then just cut out the dairy and just go to Just meat and water even just red meat and water and most people do do fine with that but but by and large creams fine you know unless there's a specific problem for you yeah I love your statement too not to be in delicate but I was at the grocery store the other day and you look in people's carts and it's 99 stuff that's going straight in and then straight out like it's funny and it's crazy but then when you think about it imagine the toll that's putting on your body processing all of that garbage for me for 42 years processing all this stuff that literally is going in one end out the other and it's just complete waste it's it's kind of crazy t hat this next one here from

        "body": "hat this next one here from Troya she left the earlier hat this next one here from Troya she left the earlier Super Chat and she said she left another comment I found it here it is question had labs done after nine months on Carnivore cholesterol 246 HDL 66 triglycerides 59 LDL 165 doctor thoughts yeah oh well look you know I mean obviously you have to take these in in a particular context of the individual but you know just looking at those numbers you know that wouldn't really bother me you'll refer back to you know my my 20-minute answer on the first question cholesterol was just never a problem it was just never a problem in the first place um we talked about pattern a and pattern B type cholesterol the large buoyant fluffy nice LDL cholesterol that your body makes and the statins destroy um that those are great for you if you have higher HDL which you do you have your age sales in a great range and you have lower triglycerides which you do your triglycerides are in a great range you are much more likely to have an abundance of the large buoyant fluffy nice good LDL um cholesterol ldlc molecules and and that's great you know so that that's that's what you want it if your triglycerides were Sky High in your HDL was quite low then you would likely have more likely have pattern B the small dense damaged glycated oxidized damaged uh you know ldls that are have a have a 70 increased association with heart disease but again metabolic syndrome is 600 percent increase rate and diabetes is one thousand percent increase rate and smoking is around the same so I just I just don't see these things as a major problems LDL is just not associated with these things if it was if it was your sdldl okay 1.7 x right but you don't have sdldl you will almost certainly have pattern a and so again it's just cholesterol just simply was not the marker that we were told it was it was a lie for more on that I do a big in-depth look at the literature and um and you know the published literature peer-reviewed studies and the major medical journals around the world on uh the you know the the truth about cholesterol and heart disease it just goes through them so so people can watch that and uh know all they need to to know about that but if your HDL is high especially if your HDL is equivocal or higher than your triglycerides you you are in very good good stead that's uh that's a sign of good metabolic health and I would be happy with that and again you know higher LDL any LDL is associated with longer life so what are we doing here you know why are we worrying about this people with higher LDL live longer so what the hell right all right from Boris question is a carnivore bodybuilder I can't seem to get enough food in but adding carbs at 10 grams makes my brain work way less help for a hard Gainer yeah so you know the thing is is that is that low carbs is worse than no carbs because now you're gonna you're gonna ratchet up your insulin you're gonna cut off your ketones your brain wants to run on ketones now you're running out of glucose you don't have ketones your brain doesn't work your body doesn't work either you're actually going to shoot yourself in the foot from a glycogen standpoint as well also when you eat carbohydrates you raise your insulin insulin uh blocks the secretion and action of growth hormone and it also disrupts your testosterone as well so this is not actually what you want I don't think you know that's a personal opinion but it's not what I want I don't want my growth hormone being blocked especially if I'm trying to build muscle and be lean and athletic and strong I want my my growth hormone to be you know up where it's supposed to be so um this is why you know you shouldn't why think you shouldn't eat um carb before you go to bed is because you raise your insulin you you maximally secrete growth hormone has um when you're asleep especially two hours after you go to sleep as long as you go to sleep all the time that's very important and so by jacking up your insulin you're you're slowing that down you're you're lowering the amount that your body is actually secreting and you're blocking its action too so you'll actually get a get a corresponding drop in your insulin like growth factor one which is sort of how we test for the the action and functionality and uh amount of HGH so I would avoid carbs um at all you know if you wanted to go the other way and go back to the old way you need more cars than that like if you're going to run on carbs you need to eat enough carbs to run on and then you put on glycogen you also put on fat you get a bulk right so if you're if you're going for a competition probably a good idea to eat some carbs the night before because you'll get that pump swell the next day because you'll get you'll pack in a bunch of glycogen in your muscles you'll also bring in water and that you'll you'll get more of a plumped look and so that's something that car that um bodybuilders have done for a while is it they just eat carbs just the night before uh competition um and from what I understand and that that gives them a big pump Ronnie Coleman talks about that as well just the day before you like eat a pizza and they just boom you just like killed it the next stages and veins popping out and everything like that not something you want to do every day you know and to maintain that physique however you know just before you're going to get that big glycogen water Pop um as far as doing this carnivore and doing it right so I have a number of interviews with professional bodybuilders who have won major tournaments International tournaments and things like that like you know uh Richard Smith uh who won the Euro British national title as a pro and that was a tested event and so obviously he was not on juice and then he won the European Championship as a pro and that that was not a tested event but he still won it naturally so he beat people on steroids even though he was natural and and he was doing that as carnivore and so yes it's it's difficult you you do you just need to eat more so you have to eat more often during the day it's hard because you know when you're working out if you eat before that you're just gonna make yourself lethargic you're going to put yourself into a rest and digest mode you're gonna you know pump a bunch of blood towards your uh intestines and that's blood that's not available for your brain and your muscles so that's not great but you you can time these things you can sort of eat a bit more a bit more this is what Arnold Schwarzenegger did you know he said this in his movie pumping iron and this was back in the day when they just ate steak and eggs it was just steak and eggs steak and eggs steak and eggs because that's what the iron Guru Vince guaranda used to say you just eat steak and eggs all week they had you know Sunday they would have they would have like a clean carb loading day the rest of the week was just steak and eggs and when they were cutting they would all carved that was just steak and eggs taken eggs taking eggs steak and eggs that was it and they were they were just getting shredded and jacked and those were those were all the best uh performers Arnold was of this school he learned from these guys he was the next next Generation down and obviously he added you know steroids to the equation and did very well but the the the eating uh Dynamic you know he got from them and so he just ate meat and so he talks about this he's like I can't I'm I'm not like one of those guys why can't he just eat just all this meat um his body uh image Idol was a guy named Serge nubrey n-u-b-r-e-t I was a french guy man was jacked absolutely Jack he would eat six pounds of horse meat a day right and so uh and Arnold was was referring to these guys who could just eat Kobe smells like the Mongols they would eat you know they would ravage the countryside for five days in a row not eating and then they'd eat you know 10 pounds of horse meat in one go you know in one day or whatever and then go do it again um so what Arnold was saying is just like you know I've got to have you know eggs here I've got to have a you know 10 ounce steak here another 12 ounce steak there another thing there another this there another this there and he was just talking about meat so you just you have to space it out you have to you know um build this out through the day you need to get enough there's no there's no real cheats to it you just have to get the food in your mouth and um you know so you have to do that multiple times throughout the day if you eat too much you're going to get lethargic so if you're going to eat during the day and you still got to work out later you want to eat sort of a half amount just sort of take the edge off have a bit late a bit now a bit now a bit now a bit later and then hit your workout go really hard eat a lot after that maybe you have two days or something like that okay give yourself several hours in between then get another one so this is a problem with um you know my friend uh Ryan Talbot the NCAA you know a track star right so now he's got it down where he he's able to eat enough and he's the problem is he's putting on too much muscle or before he was actually losing muscle he was actually losing weights like hey I'm losing too much weight you know what do I do and I was like hey you just have to eat more you have to you have to get these things in you have to work these things in so see what it will work those in if you had a morning workout morning uh you know session with the team he would go and do that first and then he'd eat after that and you know go have another session and eat after that so he just worked in extra meals throughout the day and that's what you have to do too you just have to do what Arnold did is just sort of maybe get him in piecemeal and then you'll start after your main workouts in the evening as eat as much as you can a couple hours later try to eat as much as you can if you got to eat more in the morning do that but just keep getting food in but just stick to the fatty meat and water um 10 grams of fat or 10 grams of carbs is gonna is is going to um really slow you down and uh and you're sort of be caught in the middle you won't be one or the other and you get sort of the worst of Both Worlds and um as far as energy wise and so you know um I would suggest just dropping the carbs all together but if you're gonna have any carbs you need to have enou gh carbs to actually fuel you all right Barry Simon 20"

medium site if so opinions [Music] um so I have heard of that um it's it's sort of a it's sort of an interesting concept right so I'm gonna say a funny concept I would say a funny concept so he he's an actual Medium as he says I mean who is an actual medium I don't know it was the you know the amazing Randy was the magician who actually had in the 80s he was saying I'll give you a million dollars anybody standing off for anyone in the world a million dollars to prove scientifically that you have psychic powers million dollars no one a lot of people took him up on it no one no one actually was able to do it um so is this guy an actual medium so this is this is a gentleman who says he's actually channeling spirits and they're giving him medical advice I don't know why they aren't giving him lottery numbers but you know they um they uh he said that he he's channeling the spirit of compassion is that I don't know if that's biblical probably not you know this is just like what I don't know what the spirit of compassion is I don't know what that means um if there's a spirit of compassion is there are there spirits of of other sorts of you know feelings towards people presumably um maybe the the spirit of Mischief is saying it's the spirit of compassion and actually leading him down the wrong way but anyway there's there's some sort of spirit guy that's actually giving him medical advice and people are listening to this for some reason and um I haven't looked at a lot of the things he said you know I think some of the some of the stuff he you know like plant-based or something but he's actually giving medical advice on some of these things which is which is not okay that's actually illegal and it's very dangerous you know telling people you know about different you know biochemical sort of Pathways and this is why this works and I was like no that's that's really not like I mean I can I can show you any number of textbooks that are very clear on the biochemistry of that of that process and that that's not it um so no I don't think that's someone you want you want to listen to I mean this is this is a you know this is someone who maybe he believes this but I would doubt that you know I mean this is there's been a lot of frauds and hucksters that uh you know say they have some sort of powers or whatever I mean you should look up on on YouTube there was like people in the 50s or you know in an earlier that were all about you know it's all you know uh outer space alien sort of things and it just people's just coming out of everywhere oh yeah so my experience with aliens and all these sorts of things just making up these stories and when people was like oh yes I'm in psychic communication with you know Queen Azalea of the Galaxy I know we talk on a daily like who the hell are you like wow this person if they actually were running the Galaxy like why are they talking to you you know like I mean we're not even Interstellar yet we don't even you know know about us or anything like that but you're just going on they're hilarious right but this is this is one of those things I mean you know I don't want to I don't know the guy um but I mean realistically he's either delusional or a con artist and I don't think that that's anyone you want to take medical advice from all right uh Carmen question I bought a half a lamb and it comes with sausages made with rosemary and honey is that okay or should I give it a Miss cheers yeah just throw it at passing cars you know um uh look you know it's up to you you know I I don't like eating that stuff um you know it does make me feel worse and so you know I like feeling my best all the time um you know you could try them if you if you think it's okay maybe it has honey in it um that can trigger sugar Cravings that can I mean it is addictive you know fructose is addictive and honey tends to have more fructose than high fructose corn syrup and and fructose is the part that's actually chemically addictive to our brain and so having that could trigger that um and if that's something you know that you've had issues with in the past and had to you know deal with shorter carb and sugar addicted and you know might be good to give it a miss you know how much is in the sausages probably not all that much and so you know it's sort of a one-off isn't that big of a deal just depends you know it might be a big deal to you it might be that you have some and it's uh and it's a problem but you know if you if you try them and you feel okay with them and maybe they make you feel a bit you know a bit gross or something like that but it goes away and it's not causing you to go then you know down a carb hole and and eat a whole bunch of you know sugar and things like that then uh you know I would you know you know just have them while you're there or maybe you know give them to other people who aren't too worried about it and then you know the next time you you do that just ask them not to include that stuff in there and just ask them just to use salt only the thing with sausages too they generally have um different sorts of binders that are generally plant derived so that when you when you cook that sausage and you cut it it stays together whereas normally if you don't have those plant-derived binders uh the meat just sort of falls out of the casing so that's that's another thing too so I tend to avoid things like sausages and those sorts of things occasionally if I'm traveling or whatever and there's something there and I'm you know just sort of at a restaurant I might have that but I tend not to feel my best when I do that and so if I if I see it it has a whole bunch of green stuff and things like that in i t I generally give those in this all right uh Kitty 10"

carnivore 45 days uh diagnosed with cyst infection seven days ago prescribed Levaquin 750 mg times 10 days would keto help this lipophilic a b entered the cyst um you know that's a good question I don't know I don't know if keto would help your antibiotic in its chin in your body but being on a ketogenic diet has been shown to improve your uh immune system your immune system runs better your your cellular immunity works better you're dropping inflammation your body's what is the information information is basically activating your immune system in inappropriate ways so you're gonna suppress that you're not going to have inappropriate inflammation your body's just going to be doing the things that it needs to do and your your um you know healing and uh your immune system actually works better so I would say that now you know to do with you know I'm assuming that's uh talking about polycystic uh kidney disease but um you know the thing is is that I it's not something that I've seen myself without I was literally just in a conversation today with um uh one of the doctors from low carb down under um over in Sydney and um and there was a patient who sort of asked about polycystic kidney disease and he he referred me over to another uh doctor colleague of his that has basically been doing research in this so I'm going to about to be communicating with them because they said that there's actually a lot of promising research coming out with polycystic kidney disease and and nutrition which is great most things are related to nutrition and you have a genetic predisposition and then environmental trigger so you have you know you have the genes for polycystic kidney disease um and then but that's not necessarily you won't necessarily get a 100 penetrance so not 100 of people who have the gene get the disease right and so something in the environment sort of triggering that and so you know that it could be that there's there's nutritional issues as well so I'll be looking into the that I don't know exactly what they are however I can tell you that studies of people say oh yeah polystic disease okay you need to reduce your protein I don't think that's that's um a good idea um you know these studies there are studies in in uh with people looking at more protein actually increases and boosts uh kidney function I don't think these are done with people with polycystic disease so you know take that for what it is but in most people more protein more meat improved kidney function this is actually I see this a lot all the time people with with kidney disease you know stage four kidney failure I've seen people come out of that and return normal kidney function and that that happens regularly and and we see this in the literature more protein you get improved kidney function some people will get freaked out because their urea goes up so people track urea and creatinine and they say oh these go up that means your body's not clearing these but then the urea goes up oh my gosh your kidneys are being shot but for some reason the creatinine is exactly the same so why is that the urea goes up because you're metabolizing more amino acids and so that's that's just a byproduct of amino acid um uh degradation and it's actually your body's one of your body's strongest antioxidants so it's actually a good thing because you're doing good things in your bodies you know so you don't need all those antioxidants and plants that actually come with a lot more oxidants than just antioxidants because you have you're getting a lot more urea as well and that's doing a lot of work there um so that can help kidney function and there there seems to be some ties in with ketogenic diets and polycystic disease but I don't know if that's going to help bring the antibiotics into the cyst though unfortunately but it can help in a lot of other ways that could help and support um you know you were or that person with uh with recovery from that infection and from uh dealing with that illness uh just real quick because this is right on that same topic you mentioned kidney failure so Ali is asking could someone with stage four kidney failure on dialysis do carnivore oh 100 you can absolutely do carnivore um it doesn't matter what your your medical condition is You're Still Human and so you know either way our biologically adapted and design diet is going to be is going to be right and correct for you so uh yeah it's important especially when we're sick to be eating a proper diet and so I've definitely seen people with kidney failure improve on that now people you know people on kit on dialysis you know can you improve off of that you know that that remains to be seen I have seen anecdotally three people now there are studies showing that more protein improves kidney function okay so that that's in the literature but the you know past that is anecdotal but I've seen it again and again and again people improve kidney function even after stage four not being on dialysis yet and I've seen three people so far on dialysis that um that have come off dialysis it takes a long time so one one lady it took nine months uh the other two people it took over a year but it happened so um and I'm sort of keeping track of a few other people at the moment who are on dialysis and doing carnivore and they're doing very well and in fact you know they're symptomatically much better they're getting much much healthier they're not feeling as horrible before they're uh dialysis as they they were before and things like that so you know I mean either way you know say oh my God it's going to trash your kidneys what kidneys they're already on dialysis right so I mean you can't you don't get you don't get past you know total kidney failure right so um it's not going to cause problems it's you know shouldn't it's not going to make them sick it's actually it actually should improve them right you're giving your body more of what it needs to help help itself and get better in every way and you're eliminating out things that cause harm there are a lot of plant toxins that are directly nephrotoxic so they damage your kidneys or they block them up and cause damage uh you know via blockages such as uh oxalate so oxalate binds calcium they form calcium oxalate Stones 75 of kidney stones are or thereabouts are calcium oxalate Stones right so you're eliminating all that stuff from your body you're eliminating a lot of things that can harm your kidneys and you're providing your body a lot of things that are actually beneficial for your kidneys so yes you can 100 do it we'll get them off dialysis I really hope so I can't promise anything all right DC I have two questions is it true that during the ice ages there was no fruit and honey at all and what do you think about people that say to feel more energetic doing carnivore add fruit and honey in moderation of course uh yeah I mean you could get more energetic adding cocaine too right so you know is that is that a good idea you know um I don't think so I've got tons of energy it is 11 38 at night uh where I am and I've been at work since you know early this morning seeing patients and now I'm talking a mile a minute because I have tons of energy I have not eaten yet today I feel fine I have you know I certainly haven't eaten any fruit or honey so you know no you absolutely don't need uh fruit and honey just like you don't need cocaine um you know you'll have tons of energy you'll have plenty of energy and you'll feel better than literally you ever have in your entire life if you're eating enough meat and and giving yourself and eating enough fat and giving yourself what it needs I think a lot of people that sort of go into the fruit and honey side of things there are a lot of people that eat a lot of organs they eat a lot of you know organ meats and liver and you can actually get toxicities you can get the hyper vitamin SSA which can tank your thyroid and make you feel pretty crappy take your hormones in other ways as well and so you know going on fruit and honey and things like that that can actually increase your body's demand for vitamin A and other vitamins and it could be that that sort of levels you out a bit I don't know that's sort of just something I've been sort of throwing around in my head but something's happening and I tend to see people who do that are the ones that are eating a lot of liver I bear I I've eaten liver four times in the last 10 years right and so you know well yeah you know beef and lamb liver I've had that Cod Liver tins of cod liver and cod liver oil like a few times as well um but that but otherwise no um as far as the ice ages are concerned um well I mean certainly there were fruit and honey in some areas more towards the equator and you know some vegans and Liars will say that uh you know during the ice ages that people are just moving towards the equator and just kept eating you know fruit and plants and all that sort of garbage because it sort of you know tells the lie that you know if we're up in these ice shelves living this way the Inuit do now which is the natural state of humanity is the way they knew it's our living now that uh well how they traditionally live anyway how you know a lot of them are living is not this is not how we're supposed to live but you know the ones living traditionally that that that's how we lived you know we lived in the ice there were no plants at all in a lot of these places and we're just eating we're just eating meat and so you know the people will say oh well we were moving towards the equator and things like that that is that is someone who has never looked at the fossil record they're just they're just hoping that's true because it because it shows that they're right about something um no it's actually wrong so as the ice shelves started coming down the false record is very clear we started going up we started attacking into the ice because that's where the megafauna was most likely and that's where we were hunting that's what we wanted to eat these big fuzzy animals that you know fed us and you know made us warm so that's that's what we were doing and so while there there were you know you know fruits and vet and vegetables and and honey and all that sort of stuff available in certain areas and I'm I'm sure that homo sapiens or not Homo sapiens well well in the last ice age few ice ages would have been Homo sapiens but you know not not early on um you know would have been around that you know maybe those ones you know Incorporated that first of all fruit seasonal and it's not nearly as sweet in the wild and as as it is in in the store I mean think of the difference between you know like a red delicious and a crab apple you found in a park somewhere you know I mean this is not the same creature and so you know it's sour it's hard it's just not it's not great the the crab apples right so we've bred these things to be many many more times as sweet and have many many more times the amount of sugar and have you know much less fiber and things like that I mean look at mangoes normally just all seed you know bit of fibrous you know meat and things like that and uh and barely any sugar now it's you know seeds much smaller a whole bunch of you know pulp and we were just packed with sugar and there are areas and I spoke to when the research was coming out about how bad fructose was and how it was you know really a causative factor in type 2 diabetes I mentioned that to a friend of mine who's who's from India I was a doctor and he said you know that's actually really interesting because there's an area in India you know forget the name of it at this point it was you know 12 years ago but um he said that that in that area the the mangoes grow so plentiful that they're just falling all over the place and just basically everyone there just eats mangoes for three months while they're in season just just every day there's the mangoes mangoes don't eat anything else and they have the highest rates of type 2 diabetes in all of India and in fact the government had to do an intervention and just say you're not allowed to eat this you have to eat other things you can only eat a limited amount of of mangoes a day uh because of that so you know sure there was there was fruit and honey somewhere it wasn't always available it certainly wasn't as sweet as it is now honey would have been just as sweet probably but the fruit would not have been a sweet it'd also only be available for a couple weeks and then not the rest of the year and um you know and then it would only be available in some places you know a lot of people most people were up in the icy areas where no that stuff did not exist and we did not have access to it even for part of the year you know most of the Earth was covered in ice and um year round you know so some areas that would have thought out sure but most people in most areas were not getting any of that so we definitely didn't need it you know there certainly wasn't any fruit and honey on the land bridge from Asia to North America on the last ice age when people crossed over and populated North South America right so what were they eating right what do the Inuits eat so if you have to have fruit or honey or carbs of any description that doesn't happen those people don't survive they don't survive generation after generation after generation right and and that's actually been well established and and admitted by different scientific bodies and medical bodies that there is no such thing as an essential carbohydrate you do not have to consume uh you know plant-based carbohydrates at any point during your life or honey at any point during your life there are entire uh cultures and civilizations that don't eat any and uh and have no deleterious health effects and so that's not my words that's theirs and so you don't need any of that crap and I think you don't want it honestly all right John Albert 199 thank you wow we're approaching 1200 people on here this is awesome oh wow Dr chafee I know carnivores don't need any sleep or anything are you still good to go for a while and get through some more of these yeah yeah never find that yes do it John Albert also uh what supplements should a carnivore take and what processed meats are okay oh you you really don't need supplements on a carnivore diet like if you have to take supplements and by definition your diet is deficient right you're not getting what you need from your diet right now we're not eating woolly mammoth or wild horses or all that sort of stuff you know the and the and the meat that we're eating isn't as nutritious as it could be like if you get a callus on a regeneratively raised Farm grass-fed grass finish it is going to have much more nutrients four or five times the amount of vitamins and minerals that you'll get in uh you know Safeway beef but Safeway beef is is uh absolutely has an abundance of of nutrients for the vast majority of people some people need a bit more some people will metabolize things in different ways you know so maybe they may not be able to process folate as well and so maybe they need to eat a bit of liver that's a supplement for carnivores is liver I don't think that's a Mainstay of your meal of your diet I think that that's a supplement you have some liver and some organs here and there you know sort of keep things you know topped up but otherwise you don't need it I've checked my Bloods after not eating any organs for years and only eating meat for years they were all in optimal ranges and so I didn't have any problems most people don't have any problems just on Safeway beef Costco beef things like that if you are one of these people you know check your full it check your B12 check your magnesium uh you want to do your erythrocyte magnesium erythrocyte zinc erythrocyte folate is better it looks at the levels in your cells which is where these things are active it's not as it's not as useful looking at your serum levels and you know if those are all good then great you don't need to worry about anything if they are you know lower than they should be or low normal or whatever you might need to just add in a bit of liver you know once or twice a week it doesn't have to be much processed Meats processed Meats again what do they process with it's not more meat it's just a bunch of plants and sugar and artificial ingredients so if you have processed meat and ground beef is processed meat right but there's nothing added to it so that's there's no issues um bacon you just look at the ingredients list right so if it has a long ingredients list with a bunch of words that you can't pronounce don't get it right if it's something that has sort of few maybe it has some you know bit of sugar a bit of this or whatever okay you know it's not ideal but you know generally the amount of sugar that's sort of in bacon is a bit of in the Cure and you look at you know it's less than you know one gram per serving and all that sort of stuff you know it's um you just want to get it as clean as possible so you know the Meat part of the process meat is not the problem it's whatever else is in it so just look at the ingredients list it has a big long horrible ingredients list don't get it a lot of the processed Meats that's what look if that's what you can afford um then you'll get it it's better than it's better than the alternative anyway um but if you look at the ingredients quite often in sort of like sausages there's like summer sausages or bologna or these sorts of things you look at the ingredients list and it'll say you know 75 percent you know pork or something like that and do the other thing okay what does that mean that means that 25 of it is not animal right so 25 of this is plant-based starch and fillers and garbage like that which are cheaper and that's why they put all that stuff in it and so if you have that where it's just like 67 whatever it's like okay if that means that there's a lot of other stuff in here that I don't want so I just I would just sort of just check the ingredients list and try to go for the ones that have as few ingredients as possible and hopefully ones that you recognize and can pronounce all right the gram I have Achilles tendinitis can I expect my rib eye tonight to cure this tonight I'll have it no matter what I can answer that yes next question carnivores don't get achilles tendonitis either I'm pretty sure on that one but yeah I'm pretty sure yeah there must be something else with that with that with that rib eye if you have achilles tendonitis I think that's it you're showing your your card but uh yeah of course I think you know that's a yeah tongue-in-cheek sort of thing uh yeah no of course that's not gonna not gonna cure it tonight but you know you'll reduce inflammation and uh that can significantly help reduce the pain and the symptoms that you have Ketone is just having higher ketones directly suppresses inflammation not eating a lot of other things that cause inflammation also reduce the the body of inflammation that you have and so people do find that they have much less pain as a result of that which is great so you know take it easy you know rehab it properly but yeah you can expect to heal faster on a carnivore diet than than you would have otherwise absolutely speaking of inflammation just real quick I had this guy come into the theater the other day Shane he was like you're not going to believe this I've only been doing carnivore for like three weeks and I've had back pain for decades and it's completely gone it's like inflammation it I yeah so many people are walking around with inflammation I I say it a lot on my channel but you need to know what it's like to live without inflammation I had back pain for years too and I always thought it was oh this is just the way it is I must have injured myself at some point and it's just always going to be that way three weeks on Carnivore no more back pain ever again it's amazing yeah that's great Jessica day 32 on Carnivore diet is it possible to eat too much protein in a meal already eating four eggs two seven ounce burgers for breakfast 12 ounce steak for dinner plus butter still not feeling satiated thank you Dr chafee for all you do um you know you know what's what's too much that's sort of the thing is you know how long is a piece of string you know it varies right so it's different for different people um you know the the thing about eating too much on a carnivore diet is it's very difficult your body stops enjoying it very quickly if you're eating a lot of lean meat and you're getting a lot more protein than fat in your body wants the fat that is going to stop tasting good you know and you're still gonna go I still want to eat I don't want to eat that and all of a sudden you add some butter to add some fat to it you go okay I like that again that's good now because your body's saying okay yes we want those nutrients we don't need those as much we have enough of those and so if you're eating those sorts of things and that's not enough then you need to eat more pretty simple and so you know some people will say that you can only absorb a certain amount of protein like 40 grams of protein a day um to me that doesn't even pass a small test you know because like you you get a lion that's taking down a gazelle once a week right so they're only getting 40 grams of of protein or however much you know a lion gets but then all that you know that's just six pounds of gazelle is just just pooping out probably not right so they're absorbing that and you and you can you can see this too very clearly you know in your in your own uh in your own ways is that you're not going to be you know eliminating this out you know if you eat a kilo of steak right you know two pounds two and a half pounds of meat right or sometimes when I'm working out I'll eat like four to five pounds of meat in a day and it's very easy to put all muscle then when I'm working out I'm eating that much and my body's asking me to eat that much because that's how much it's wanting and you know that's not just coming out the next day I absorb that I absorb all of that and so you know that doesn't really work if I'm if I'm eating once a day and I'm eating hundreds of grams you know how do we put on muscle if you're only going to absorb 40 grams I'm 240 pounds and so I'm eating once a day and I'm putting on muscle regularly and I'm certainly not wasting away you know and I'm only getting 40 grams a day well clearly not I'm clearly absorbing a lot more of that and animals in the wild due to Predators carnivores they they eat infrequently generally they don't necessarily eat every day smaller animals may be getting a whole bunch of little lizards and insects and bugs and things like that big prey animals tend to like take down a big piece of game you know like a poker player they take that one big pot an hour or something like that that's sort of what they have to average um that's like that's like us that's like lions that's like you know cheetahs and things like that they have to take down you know one big thing every few days or once a week or something like that and that's how they work and they need to get everything out of that you know in in that session from eating that thing in that time to last them another week so you know no I think I think you uh are fine you're not going to hurt yourself Anyway by by eating more protein it's just it's just going to taste bad you know so keep eating until meat stops tasting good fatty Meats you're eating fatty meat and you're getting the fat with the meat aim for about gram for gram and and then adjust from there based on your own your own uh you know your own body but um it's uh yeah you just need to keep eating until meat stops tasting good fatty meat stops tasting good your body knows what it's doing your body is much more in tune and in touch than than any so-called expert you know you anybody has a formula or a calculator or whatever it should not be trusted because like the formula to figure out our biochemistry is about 38 miles long in small print right so you're not going to figure that out no one's going to figure that out to to exacting degrees no one's going to figure it out as much as your body already knows it so if you stab your body's way you don't disrupt your your biochemistry by eating things that you shouldn't you're only eating fatty meat your body will tell you what to do and your body will figure everything out yes listen to your body Brett Atwood twenty dollars just a little money for the documentary I want to thank Dr chafee for how committity has been to shout from the rooftops everyone deserves to feel this good down 90 pounds reverse type 2 diabetes and so many other wins amazing yeah anyone who who's watching this from my Channel please go make sure you're subscribed to Dr chafee we need to elevate more voices like his for sure and thank you Brett so much for the donation for the documentary we need it we're going to reach more builds because of it so I really appreciate that candy and Sean uh five dollars thank you so much stacy says no colon J pouch patient a few months on Carnivore no more pain labs are great nice globe and highest it's ever been will I still need iron B12 supplements forever because of no colon oh no not not because of no colon you you absorb B12 in your in your small intestine so before you get to colon so if you if you still have a majority of your small intestine you should be fine now that doesn't mean that you don't have other problems you know Upstream that are going to interrupt that if you had damage to your to your stomach and get pernicious anemia it's an autoimmune issue or if you had surgery damage and took out the part of your stomach that made an intrinsic factor intrinsic factor needs to be released from your stomach and bind to B12 and then you absorb it in your in your distal um ilium I believe and it's been a long since sometimes I looked at that but anyway you're small intestine and so you know it goes down there and absorbs there but it needs to be bound to Intrinsic factors so if you're not making that anymore you're not releasing that or that part of your your stomach was taken out or damaged then you may not be able to do that um Iron you should be you should be able to absorb pretty well heme iron is obviously much more bioavailable than any other source of iron that's what you're getting with with meat especially red meat you know getting the myoglobin and things like that um you know so drink those juices and um yeah and that should be fine you know other thing I mean it's sort of gross but I mean like you know the Messiah drink blood and that's going to be your your best available source of iron um there because it's just tons and tons and tons of hemoglobin and that's um that's everybody needs it for anyway so uh yeah that's awesome I'm really glad that you're doing so well I'm glad your labs are great you just need to keep checking you know your your nutrients and things like that most of your nutrients will be absorbed in your small intestine so if you still have most of that you should be you should be fine and meat is the most bioavailable nutrient source that there is and so but you know there's OB there's obviously more to your story there so um just keep checking and if you you check your your Bloods and your um your minerals and vitamins every three months or so and it's consistently in good areas um you know and you you want to try coming off supplements or whatever and you maintain those levels um without that then that's great then you can come off of that but you need to test it you know you need to test your levels and you need to test what your body does when you come off supplements you try that and if it's coming down and too low then then unfortunately you'll need to to stay on but hopefully hopefully you don't need to carnivorous dude one dollar thank you so much Molly Malone five dollars carnivorous dude my mom has an ulcer in her colon and is worried about red meat hmm um yeah I wonder what the what the ulcers from is that like an autoimmune condition or some sort of an infection or or what you know people have ulcerative colitis you know that would need a biopsy to sort of diagnose that if that's the case that will respond extraordinarily well to a a red meat and water diet most autoimmune issues respond extraordinarily well to elimination diets there's actually a study with crohn's disease patients who um you know were having you know very were very symptomatic and having flare-ups you know 20 30 bouts of bloody diarrhea a day and that's typical for for Crohn's sufferers and a bad flare-up and they found putting people on an elemental diet which is just a very highly processed sort of shake with all the different nutrients and things like that that you need and and I've spoken to people they actually prefer the ones that are for keto uh the keto ones for epilepsy um and they do better on those that um the ones I've spoken to do better on those so it's just the nutrients you need nothing you don't need right that's what a steak is right and so they found that putting people on Elemental diet was a better treatment for an acute attack of Crohn's Disease than prednisone right or prednisolone if you're you know outside of the U.S that is crazy that's the gold standard that's a major major immune blocker that just absolutely suppresses the immune function and should just stop your body from being able to attack anything let alone your intestines right and it was a better treatment to just not eat garbage right so you just cut that crap out of your system and that was better treatment than steroids right so if your mom has like a you know some well immune issues will improve in a lot of ways autoimmune issues improve we do see studies with with ulcers with crohn's which is uh you know akin to ulcerative colitis and people do very very well on all sorts of colitis as well with these sorts of treatments and interventions as well um yeah I mean people people get worried about red meat we're told by our doctors we should be worried about red meat especially with bowel issues but you know going back to you know earlier with the whole idea about colon cancer and colon disease and also it is absolutely not borne out by the evidence is simply not borne out by the data in the literature the data and literature shows that meat is healthy red meat in particular is very healthy there's absolutely no association in any well-designed high-level study between red meat or meat in general and and any sort of disease at all whatsoever full stop Blanco uh 2500 I think that's Argentinian thank you and then there's a question Linda two dollars thank you Brett's a new member awesome and then Blanco's question forgot the question can I be on top health drinking whole milk I'm very tolerant to it and my thinking is there's an extensive historical evidence that it is good like you said the Ethiopians described by Herodotus are most known the Indo-European conquerors yeah uh well it depends you're tolerant of it that's good uh you know the Messiah drink a whole bunch of this stuff raw milk is a very different creature to you know pasteurize marginalized milk very different things and so you know if you're getting grass-fed raw milk whole raw whole milk on Pat on pasteurized on on you know not homogenized milk then um then that's different um I do think that that milk because of its lactose content is is a you know a bit problematic you know it's going to increase your insulin and your blood sugar and you're going to kick yourself out of of uh metabolic state that you want to be in so as a treat every now and then you know great the mess I do great with it so I mean you can you can certainly be very healthy drinking raw whole milk um if you're just drinking normal whole milk you know you'll see a lot of people who drink a lot of milk you're just you're just jacking up your insulin and um and you can have sort of inflammation people can put on on weight as well and so that's just something to think about um but you know if you like that I would just sort of you know maybe you know maybe just have it occasionally and and try to reduce the amount of the total carbs you're coming in the Messiah as well there was a study uh which is actually a great study looking between um the Messiah and akikuyu that were like the bordering uh you know tribes and people and they're actually largely plant-based so they're they're eating just sort of you know just Whole Food plant-based diet you know all these different things that they grow and they find largely you know not as much meat Masai eating mostly meat mostly Dairy mostly blood from their cattle if not exclusively and and they found that the Messiah were much much healthier so on average five inches taller larger brains better teeth uh 23 pounds heavier on average and they're just lean these guys are just you know jet skinny you know and um and uh 50 stronger right and they weren't getting diabetes and all these different chronic diseases and you know lung infections and tropical ulcers and all these sorts of other things and and uh they weren't anemic you know the akikuyu were anemic and had a lot of vitamin deficiencies and they tried to correct the vitamin deficiencies and they found that their health actually didn't improve it wasn't until they actually you know reduce the amount of plants they were eating and started giving them meat that their health actually improved obviously they didn't just grow five inches after that but you know they they did improve their health now one thing that they did find in the in the um the Maasai was that you know they didn't have arthritis but they had more like um like a rheumatoid Factor so there's some sort of inflammatory sort of process that you have this sort of factor that starts coming up and and is strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis now it's not it's not a one-to-one um if you have that you just have more of a chance you know of getting it but it doesn't seem that they like fully develop arthritis but it does seem to to raise a bit of that inflammation um that we can see in autoimmunity such as rheumatoid arthritis um so that's just something to think about the casein can be pro-inflammatory the A1 protein is uh you know most people find that it's quite inflammatory A2 is less inflammatory but upwards where there's less not not inflammatory so it is still inflammatory it's just less inflammatory you you're gonna have to make a you know judgment call for for yourself if that's something you like you're staying lean slim and strong you know fine you know kids who drink more dairy or have more Dairy on average grow taller and have uh you know better bone density um would they be as good just eating meat probably maybe even better but um for me I I don't drink a lot of milk every now and then when I get my hands on some raw milk if I can drink the hell out of that it's illegal in Australia so that's just not really happening every now and then it's hard to get in America uh but it's delicious and uh and but I also think that as a bit of a problem because I don't I don't want to be like craving something I don't want to be like oh my God I want that you know I want to have my you know my my life to myself and just eat meat when I'm hungry and then just get on with my life and if something's causing me to have cravings I think it's probably not a great thing so for me I tend to avoid that um what I recommend to people is is probably best to avoid milk even you know raw uh whole milk just because of the the carbs you know you're going to start bringing up your insulin you're going to you know raise your blood sugar you're going to raise your insulin and you're going to disrupt your normal hormonal and metabolic functioning so for me it's a it's a treat every now and then but certainly not something I would do on a regular basis all right well I think you kind of just covered this question I don't know if you want to add anything uh yeah Dr Pepper yeah well also just um yeah well just dairy in general if it's if it's you know um uh you know raw is much better than than the rest right um and uh Dairy that's been fermented and has that carbohydrates taken away uh much better you know and you're and you're gonna get some of those those live culture bacteria and things like that which can be good you know if you're just eating meat you're going to have a very healthy gut bacteria as we see in studies with the Inuit you know that just eat meat they have really really good biota and um you know but I was just saying just another thought that I had about the you know the last one is sort of you know thinking about you know our ancestors and things like that that ate milk we we haven't really been been using Dairy for all that long so not going back past the last ice age um we don't think you know so it is more of a new adaptation probably because the megafauna died off and we we don't have these big large fatty animals the larger the animals have more fat and then we really do need the fat and so we we probably started cultivating you know dairy animals in order to get more fat and uh and have a more of an access to to fatty fatty acids but um either way I think it's it's probably not ideal if you have access to big fatty steaks which you should do in Argentina that's like that's just steak Graceland really gen s 1.99 thank you uh name redacted five dollars what are your thoughts on lean mass hyper responders should they be concerned about high LDL no I I don't think so um I again I just don't I just don't think that um that LDL and all these sorts of things were were the issue that we've uh been told that it was so you know there's there's a guy uh you know Dave Feldman who's doing a ton of research in this and um you know so it's um you know it's it's it's worthwhile you know looking at his research on the subject but you know when you look at just LDL in general it was it was a con you know and a lot of these things have now been shown to be a con and they're more and more large very well designed high-level studies that are showing that higher LDL is not an issue and they're randomized controlled trials with thousands of people sometimes tens of thousands of people showing that you you intervene you give somebody unsaturated fat and you lower their LDL cholesterol and then what happens they start dying of heart attacks and strokes right not a great great outcome right so am I worried about high LDL no it means you're going to live longer on average right um also your LDL fluctuates quite wildly early on and so I never check um or whatever I never pay attention to I don't want to check uh cholesterol within the first six months a lot of things a lot of weird things are going to happen there after about six months things just start to settle down a bit the LDL is going to be a bit higher or it could be low or it could be normal you know you want it to be at least in the normal range probably in a bit of a higher range according to various studies that show that people live longer and get less get less heart disease and strokes and cancer and things like that and infectious disease a lot of a lot of associations with higher LDL that are actually very positive in a number of different studies so and then you look at the familial hypercholesterolemia patients they're like oh my God these people die more not really in the earlier Decades of Life they have a higher risk of uh you know cardiovascular disease death from cardiovascular disease sure and then after about you know age 50 it's even right so they have to have the same um you know uh die off rate after that after 70 it's actually lower they have lower rates of of uh cardiovascular disease and death uh so what's going on there well they seem to also have other genetic issues right so they found that people with with familial high cholesterol that you know has a genetic issue that they also are more likely to have a gene that makes them clot more easily so what is a heart attack what is a stroke it's a clot where it's not supposed to be right you block off blood supply and that part of the of the body dies right it's an important part that's a big deal and so that's what a heart attack and a stroke is and so when they differentiated out that people with this just have massively elevated um genetic reasons for having high cholesterol and the people that had the high cholesterol but also had the clotting Factor it was only those with the clotting factor that had increased risk of heart disease so just having massively elevated cholesterol did not increase your risk for heart disease compared to the rest of the population so yeah I it's literally LDL is is probably my least concern as a doctor I've I can't think of much else that I just care less about yeah all right Cricket Miss 1.99 thank you thank you card of work today this is my good friend Adam five dollars thank you love this comment too everyone should check out carnivore today he's been volunteering his time to help me with the documentary movie he's been awesome wow nice who would pay good I would I would who would pay good money to see Dr chafee play a rugby match against a team of Kellogg's and Pfizer execs yeah I feel a little that would be amazing oh my God that'd be fun just tee off on those those guys oh Grace Miguel Ortiz 10 when will the bile poop stop eight weeks in on meat and dairy only no bile if I start my meal with dairy question mark also any tip for food that I can take on a 30 plus mile bike ride thank you both for all you do um yeah well that's it I don't know exactly what you mean by bile poop maybe it's sort of greenish or I don't know if you you mean um maybe you're having diarrhea or something like that if it's diarrhea it's more fat than your body can absorb or you're still drinking coffee or your tea or using artificial sweeteners all of those are are laxatives right so if you're only eating meat only drinking water you know you should have normal stools Dairy can actually make you constipated that can actually Harden things up even if you're already eating a lot of fat so it's a it's a bit of a weird one there but um no bile if I start my meal with dairy that's interesting I don't know if you're talking about you know it sounds like you're talking about having like sort of green bile in your in your stools which is not typical I haven't really haven't really seen that before but whatever whatever you do if you if you sort of eat something in a certain way and you're not having the problems that you're that you're worried about just do it that way you know there's so many things in medicine that we don't really know exactly what's going on and um and it doesn't really matter because it's sort of the solution is still you know right there in front of your front of you you know people say it's like oh well you know it hurts when I do this okay well stop doing that you know problem solved um and so that's the thing here so if you're not having that problem if you if you start a meal with dairy or something like that you know great you know just just do it like that um tips for bike ride you know the thing is is that you know a lot of uh you know long distance endurance you know athletes and cyclists and things like that aren't eating at all you know they're they're they're going fasted they're just drinking water and you feel fine you'll be fine you know if you're just eating meat and just drinking water you have plenty of fat stores that is your food that's that's what you're you're carrying with you that is your Larder right and so you know you'll be you'll be fine on a 30 mile ride as long as you're eating enough prior to that as long as you're eating enough in the days leading up to that and just in general you're healthy and you have a lot of healthy weight on you you'll be fine the things that you may want to eat if you're if you feel like doing that you don't first of all you don't generally don't need refeeds there's a lot of cyclists like uh you know Sean Seiko um zaponowski who's um in South Africa and he works with the Knox foundation and he's you know high level Elite cyclist and he just does carnivores he's been doing keto for years and he's doing just a little carnivore now and he does 200 uh you know K cycles and things like that you know a competitive sort of races you know finished top five in one it was like in Jordan so it's like just crazy heat and 200 kilometers and he's you know he's uh his 50s and so and he finished in I think fifth you know so that was actually quite a big result he ate nothing the entire time everyone else oh my God I'll die you know pace cars around them you know giving them a bunch of like sugary snacks and refeed things they're just sucking it down they're like dying and he's just like okay yeah I'm fine and you just kept going and um but if you wanted something you just want animal stuff so pemmican is amazing it's just that's what the Native Americans used to eat they used to be the iron rations and a lot of armies throughout history and that's just you know ground up dried powdered meat mixed with liquid Tallow and um and you just sort of mix that up you let it dry and Harden you just sort of eat that or if you just want you know sort of the energy or whatever again you'll have more than enough energy um you can just bring the Tallow you can just bring a sort of a Slurpee Pack full of uh you know sort of Tallow you have a sort of warm up you just sort of slurp that down you'll just get you know a few hundred calories you know right there you know if not you know over a thousand so you know that is um that's the sort of thing that that I would do um but yeah I don't think I don't I really don't think you you would actually need it it's sort of weird to think about but once you get you know adapted you know your system gets adapted to running on fat you'll find that you probably don't need that at all Tanya thank you for the Priceless information life changing from Northern Ireland thank you oh awesome well thank you Tom I appreciate that Michelle says hi I'm 45 years old and been on Carnivore diet since the 7th of July and have bursitis in the hip would that go away on carnivore well you know it's it's one of those things that it uh can help significantly and you know like we were talking about earlier people with it that significantly reduce their Pain by reducing inflammation can definitely help that you know it may not it may not completely fix your bursitis but it it should reduce your your pain and your symptoms and uh and a lot of people that can get rid of it if it gets rid of all of it for you then that's that's amazing I can't say for sure there's a lot of other things that are going on that contribute to these things but it will reduce your inflammation significantly and that can reduce the amount of pain that you're feeling and and you know bursitis is just the inflammation and you know swelling and irritation of one of your Bursa sacks right so you know if that is reducing that inflammation and your your body's sort of working a bit better it can hopefully heal that but you know some of these sort of you know chronic issues that you've had for a long time some of those things you know tend to linger but uh there's a good chance that it will help significantly and and could get rid of it but sort of only time will tell with that one all right one hope for all I don't eat organ meat but I do have grass-fed beef liver 4500 mg supplement is that good to have if you're not eating the actual organ Meats you may not even need to eat that honestly so you know it's um the the supplement is going to be more expensive than just getting some beef liver you know just having some liver every now and then um if you cook it right you sort I sort of just sort of sear the outside and leave the inside pretty much raw tastes so much better like that and um and so it's actually not that bad but um you know I rarely use liver and if I do it's just sort of uh okay why not um but you know if you're if you're one of those that you know you're checking your Bloods and you need a bit more folate or you need a bit more of this or that um it's a good idea just to just to eat liver you know just have a bit of that and just learn how to cook it in a way that you like it um but most people don't need to eat liver or take supplements um and you know if you just really don't want to eat liver and and you are one of those people who need a bit more you know folate or whatever and you just you really can't can't handle that then sure you know having that supplement you know should be fine um but I think it's best to do it just getting with the liver it's cheaper for you too you know and so that's that's what I would suggest anyway all right I'm gonna mess this name of Korea I just received a reaction on Instagram well this is a good one pesticides concentrate and accumulate in the meat of animals anywhere from 20 times to 100 times the amount that's on produce can you please debunk this for me yeah I mean do they what's the evidence for that you know I mean did they provide a study or anything like that are they just just making that claim you know it's like those people that that claim that you know when the ice ages when the ice sheets came down that people moved towards the equator they've literally just made that up so it's like it was like okay what's your evidence for that uh so ask them you know any anytime someone puts someone forward like that is just like okay can you can you produce a scientific article that that shows that you know um and uh and and fine okay so so how much you know in in one steak and three ounces and what are we talking about 100 times in the whole cow okay well then it's nothing you don't care about that right so you know and also ruminant animals are actually really good at uh destroying pesticides and other sorts things it was actually a recent um uh study that came out that talking about glyphosate so Roundup and room and animals apparently can just you know burn through that stuff never absorb it in the first place so you know this is this is this could also be an argument for why um you know monogastrics like chickens pig fish if they're farmed being fed you know garbage that that simple people have problems with that right and they don't have as much problems with red meat ruminant animals right because they you know the monogasters aren't going to be able to eliminate this stuff out and so it's not just the pesticides first of all they're 10 000 times more naturally occurring pesticides and insecticides in the plants itself by weight right so the plants are worse than the pesticides so pesticides aren't really an issue if you're eating the plants or the animals eating the plants it's not able to detoxify the plants uh well enough that's the problem it's not the pesticides and um and those same pesticides when compared to this uh equivalent amount of pesticides will be sprayed on um you know like a serving of like you know mushrooms or compared to mushrooms the mushrooms were 500 times more likely to cause cancer than the pesticides that we used on them okay so you know ask them for their sources make sure they're not just completely full of um you know saying what we're talking here is that per three ounces 20 times the amount that's on the produce is it is it though you know and and for how much so you have a like a three ounce piece of meat and that's going to have 20 times the amount of pesticide that's going to be on three ounces of spinach I doubt it you know but you know if it is tell them to back it up and also ruminance um likely won't have that issue anyway but I I I suspect this guy's completely full of honestly Molly Malone two dollars Stacy Shearer following up I was simply a UC patient uh colitis patient who ended up with a J pouch now I have Crohn's carnivore to the rescue thank you Dr Anthony chafee I feel you've given me my life man oh good yeah that will go away I'm sorry that that you had to get your colon taken away uh before you found this um with your ulcer colitis because that would have gone away too it's it's from the food that we're eating that is causing these diseases especially for things like ulcer colitis and Crohn's and other autoimmune issues um but you know good news is you have your J pouch and now you know how to protect it you know get rid of all plants you need to be very very strict you know when people have these sort of roaring autoimmune issues you need to be more strict than other people so you need to be really really just really just red meat and water like that's it and grass-finished red meat and water if you can get it um you might just be just fine with uh you know grain finished but if it's if it's still causing you a bit of problem then you know you know grass grass-fed and finished is your is your Holy Grail that's amazing too like how does it feel Dr chafee getting a comment from Stacy I feel you've given me my life back I'm sure you're getting too many comments like that fire you up or what geez no it's amazing and it's um you know I mean it's it's why you know this is you know it's a lot of work it's a lot of stuff that goes into this it's a lot of dealing with um you know you know and idiots and uh you know that's not always fun but um you know but that that's why you do it you know because you reach people like that and you can you can just just impart this knowledge this is like this is this is available for people but they just they just don't know it because they're not being told that their doctors don't know it often and they're not and they're not telling it if they do because they're just so used to just you know pushing out pills and like oh that's not enough so let's just chop out you know whatever the hell it is and I just I just don't agree with that I don't think that's the right way to do it I think that's a bastardization um and Corruption of medicine you know medicine is is a beautiful profession it's a it's a it's an amazing um application of Science and it's been completely corrupted and taken over and I want it back you know these are not the reasons that I got into medicine these are not the reasons that I as a kid was interested in being a doctor it's absolutely not it you know I was interested in being a doctor to actually help people and to get them better and to you know help them you know if they're they had an accident or something happened or whatever you were there to help them and you could help fix them and say hey this is what's going on let's fix this now it's just here's a problem here's a pill and that's how people are trained you know pills aren't working okay let's chop it out no that is wrong that's not what we've been doing for thousands of years and that's not that it's really not what we've been doing for um you know even you know more than you know really 50 years before that we had much better medicine and people understood diet and nutrition better than they do now before it was utterly corrupted and you know there were much less chronic diseases so we were treating accidents and emergencies and childbirth and all these other sorts of things that we could actually help with and now it's just 90 of what we do is just chronic diseases that do not need to exist none of them need to exist you just stop eating things that are inappropriate for your biology they will go away right you can have other exposures as well and that can be a problem the vast majority of things are coming from what we're eating if you just eat what your body is designed to eat it will work the way it's designed to work and most of these problems will go away the vast majority of these problems will go away and you know I just don't think it's okay for people to profit off you know people suffering I just I just think it's sick and so you know I want people to be healthy I want them to be able to to know what they need to know so they can just be healthy on their own you can have these you know little trolls and things like that in the comments who gives a you know they're just not gonna get it you know like more meat for us like if they don't want to help their health if they don't want to have an open mind and go like okay well maybe I'll try and go holy I'm coming off medications and I'm helping myself and I'm feeling better maybe I'll look into this more or maybe a look into it more first of all before you talk trash and then you know see what you think but either way it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what they do that's the whole point is that you know when we're at the whim of the of the system when we're at the whim of medical establishment we just say oh gosh there's just this thing happening to me and I'm talking to my doctor and we just don't know and it's just getting worse and you're you're completely out of control you know your life is not your own you know direction of your ship is not in your control you're just in a storm and you're just being whipped around you have no idea and no control that's that's really not a nice place to be so you know that's a problem because you're relying on everybody else and everybody else is failing you and so you know being able to just you know get that back and have control is so empowering and so it doesn't matter what these people say it doesn't matter what other doctors say it doesn't matter because your illnesses are going away you are coming off of medications you are getting objectively better by every physical and medical objective marker except LDL but who gives a and so you know and then it is better it's just not a better according to people who don't don't know better you know so you're getting better in all these things it doesn't matter what they think because now this is in your control you're controlling this you're doing this you're getting better right you don't need them to get better that's why they you know a lot of people don't like this you know because a lot of people have made their fortunes off of you needing them you don't need them right and you don't need this guy to agree with you or any of the trolls or group you or any you know you say oh you're 100 times the amount of no you don't and even if you did so what it's still better than the alternative right and just just you know get you know cows that haven't been given a bunch of pesticide covered crap you know grass is fine right it's preferred and so you know you don't need them to agree with you you don't need them to be convinced you don't need any of these people all you need to do is eat properly and that'll take care of the rest you know and we'll have a whole bunch of people around the world independent healthy and strong knowing that they can live their own life knowing that they can keep themselves healthy and that is a powerful force to reckon with absolutely and like for Stacy here too with colitis and Crohn's I've known so many people over my life that have had those two things it's horrible and just imagine how many people are out there right now suffering from colitis or Crohn's disease that don't even know this is an option yet that's uh yeah that's why we got to get the word out that's kind of the whole thought behind the the carnivore diet movie too is Reach people that are hopeless they think all they can do is take medication and they're suffering with these things for years and years and it's needless uh Vic five dollars Dr chafee I'm starting my day one of 31 day carnivore challenge today your opinion on fish and seafood like shrimp and lobster ice Spearfish thanks oh yeah get as much as you can man I guess you know any meat's fine so any any animal flesh is fine you know obviously excluding any poison sacks and you know uh you know Fugu liver and things like that um you know so but but any any sort of normally you know um eaten meat are fine so whatever whatever you enjoy makes you feel good and uh that you can afford and have access to right so if you do fine with with Fish seafood and shellfish then then go for it you know that's great and you know if you're a spearfisher obviously you've been doing this for a while and you presumably enjoy it and you just find if that if that's helping you and you're feeling good great you need fat a lot of that stuff that you described there are um not all all that fatty depending on the kind of fish that you're getting uh add butter basically most people do fine with butter if you have autoimmune issues you know maybe you have to be careful maybe some grass-fed towel or something like that but you need you need fat just remember you do need fat and um yeah so so go to town on that and just add butter grass-fed butter be great all right Canada is a Corp five dollars good day thank you for sharing your knowledge my grandson has cerebral palsy is there any indications regarding carnivore and recovery on any basis so only anecdotal you know uh Force cerebral palsy now there are uh there are studies showing that ketogenic diets improve outcomes and healing and recovery from my traumatic brain injuries and other sort of damage you get from like strokes and things like that okay so that that is shown in the in the peer-reviewed literature um and so you can sort of extrapolate that to other sort of damaged areas of the nervous system right cerebral palsy is generally a stable lesion you know that's the present at birth that doesn't get better or worse over time that's that's how it's described sort of as a loose definition from the textbooks um however I have seen people had a guy on my podcast uh David Mack who had a stroke 30 years ago even did keto even did Atkins did all these different sources sorts of different sorts of things and he had weakness down his right side pretty stable for 30 Years everybody was quite weak and had difficulty walking had difficulty going up and down stairs very bad balance issues two months on a carnivore diet his wife so I was saying you're walking different you're walking like normal he's like wait what really videotaped he was like oh my God you're right this is crazy all of a sudden he's running up and down stairs he doesn't have any balance issues doesn't have any problems going up and down stairs 30 years after he's had a stroke and damage to his brain that should be permanent that should be 100 permanent apparently he was able to recover um there are a lot of things there's a bdnf is a brain derived neurotropic factor that improve that increases with ketones more ketones more bdnf and exercise can help that as well so that can cause you know healing and structure and regrowth and uh and new connections um from your branches you have exactly the same amount of nerve cells if they have more connections your brain works better that's how that works so um there's potential there I have spoken to one person who has cerebral palsy and they seem to think that their neurological issues were improving so that's just one person that's just told me their story and you know I don't know anything else but it's it's promising and either way it's going to help in a thousand different ways it's going to definitely be be beneficial in a lot of other ways they can help maximize is neurological development and maximize you know everything outside of that lesion can it fix that lesion it's probably not going to fix it all the way could it help mitigate some of the problems absolutely could it help reverse some of it I have no idea one person said seems to think as an adult that their symptoms of um you know their neurological issues are improving if they're still young and still developing you know they'll probably get more out of it um as far as you know recovery is concerned or at least the other parts of the brain compensating for for um the damage there but either way it's going to help them a lot it's going to make them feel a lot better it's going to make them a lot healthier in a lot of ways and I think it's definitely definitely worth a go I you know it's probably there's there is such a thing as damage done and you know cerebral Pals you have this sort of damaged area that's not going to come back completely I would I would not think that that would happen but can something come back and a little bit happen uh yeah potentially and it's worth a shot anyway all right John Albert uh dollar 99 any tips for finding a carnivore friendly doctor yeah difficult they're they're usually lists of uh keto doctors and most keto doctors or at least in the realm of of carnivore right so you what do you you stop eating carbs what do you what do you eat right you have to eat protein and fat you know most that's going to be derived from from animal sources right now they may have different funny ideas about you know why you really need spinach in your diet but you know you can you can sort of you know take take the good uh with the bad and um you know and just sort of uh you know do your own thing but um that's what I would do is I would I would do a web search for you know keto doctors ketogenic doctors or whatever that in your area of functional medicine doctors usually more Savvy with this sort of thing but not always you know so I would I would look for ketogenic doctors in your area low carb down under in Australia if you're in Australia they have a website with different low carb carnivore doctors the you know keto doctors that's what they call low carb doctors um many of them are very are either carnivore themselves or at least carnivore adjacents and carnivore friendly and so you can look up there there's a low carb USA and there's other like Rivero health and different sorts of things in the U.S yes you can also find um you know different lists of doctors in different areas and so yeah so depending on where you are just sort of Google around and look for keto doctors in your area there's usually a list that someone's put together all right Trey Coleman uh"

serious crime late middle-aged guy had a beautiful home and Business stolen from me police can't help trying to stay off the street for 15 years as a result carbs calm me down carnivore lion rib eye give me Clarity uncontrollable rage probably useful in Paleolithic Era but now I had to stop after a month to avoid being arrested it was really bad uncontrollable against all who hurt me including police tried the diet twice took electrolytes I think there's one more here uh full blood test all normal normal never had been violent my life before I wonder if successful carnivores haven't been Crime Victims with long-term effects that's a big one um well no normally normally actually people get more chilled out on a carnivore diet things carnivore Zen that's actually one of the Facebook groups um and uh and um you know I'm you know much more sort of level as well um but yeah it can make it can make your your your brain work better and you can think about these things you can get very pissed about these things you know it's it's you know it's very understandable that you're Furious in that situation and when your brain's working you're not being suppressed and and uh you know sort of I guess mollified but but uh really you it's sort of depressing you down you know I mean this is why they used to give out you know bread and circuses in Roman times because you're specifically bread they cut off the meat Supply and they gave out bread so no one could get meat they only ate bread it'd just make you docile so you know having those sorts of things making you docile you know that could be what's going on you know when you're when you're healthy and your body's working and your brain's working you can think about things those and you have some things to think about that are going to upset you they're gonna they're gonna upset you um it can also increase your testosterone and um you know and that could that can inspire you up as well most people get get more chill you have a good reason for being upset and so I I don't think that's a consequence of carnivore I think carnivores is making you healthy and making you um you know and making your body work better [Music] and you have a lot of real issues and real understandable reasons to be extremely angry put that into a direction that might be helpful I don't know the situation I don't know if it's possible to pursue legal means at this point or do anything from you know from a from a legal standpoint or or you know uh do do something else that's not going to get you in trouble but you know if you if you try to direct that you know doing carnivore or getting healthy getting your brain workout being like I'm really pissed and then focusing that and directing that in something even just focusing that and directing it in a new business and do this be like you know screw them you know the best revenge is a good life as you go back and you you build back even bigger and stronger and better and be like look what you lost that on you know you could have been we could have been partners with this we could have been you know you could have been a part of this but no you're not you're screwed and now you buy them out and stomp them out and you know destroy them in some sort of business venture I don't know it's uh maybe maybe pipe dream maybe you know sort of just wishful thinking but people have done it you know people have done things like that and but either way you know doing something productive for you to get your life back and to you know live a good life is is always going to be better again you know even if you never encounter these people again you know if you are doing well and you're back being successful you know that's going to piss them off more than than anything else will all right from Martin uh thanks for what you're doing would appreciate answering my previous question about folic acid and vitamin C insufficiency I just look back I couldn't find that question but I think it's just generally about folic acid vitamin C insufficiency um okay um so look some people um aren't able to to get enough folic acid just from from muscle meat you know in in grain finished beef right regeneratively raised beef probably just fine especially eggs uh regeneratively raised eggs there's one guy uh talking about his eggs had like 25 times the amount of folate as normal eggs that you get out eggs you know egg yolks things like that have more folate liver has more folate so if you need a bit more folate folic acid then you know just eat more egg yolks hopefully you know again regeneratively raise pasture Rays sort of things they're eating just bugs and lizards and things like that um they're going to be healthier they're going to have better better folate and um and you're just having a bit of liver so sometimes people do that so vitamin C insufficiency I mean you don't need as much vitamin C you know on a carnivore diet you simply don't you know because you're you're making uh collagen from you know pre-built building blocks right and so you know you need Vitamin C to Stave off scurvy because it hydrolyzes Proline and lysine which makes tightly bound um collagen right you're getting those things already hydrolyzed when you're eating meat that has collagen that has these uh hydrolyzed amino acids and so you don't need as much vitamin C so I don't know if you had vitamin C tested on a lab but if you don't have any symptoms you don't have any problems you know it's not really an issue there's there's more vitamin C in liver as well especially sort of less cooked liver that's going to sort of preserve a bit more of that so if you're worried about that you know just have have a bit more liver that'll cover your folate and your vitamin C but you really don't need Vitamin C for scurvy anyway on this there are other things that we use vitamin C for um it's not the antioxidant that you need that's the that's um urea you know we actually stop making vitamin C a long time ago you don't stop doing something you don't actually lose a trait a genetic trait unless there's unless there's a survival advantage to loses so us and you know I think guinea pigs have lost the ability to make vitamin C so there's obviously something to that so you know it's thought theorized that when we started eating a lot more meat became more carnivorous we started eating we started getting much more urea that took care of the um the demands that we needed for um you know oxidative stress and things like that and then you know now we're having too much uh vitamin C and uh more than we needed and that actually can metabolize into oxalates and so maybe we're getting oxalate problems with people who are making less and less vitamin C didn't get all the kidney damage and oxalate poisoning and things like that so potentially that's one of them but whatever reason we stopped making vitamin C because we got everything we needed from meat so if you think you need a bit more have a bit of liver that'll take care of the folate as well all right uh question does carnivore cure come gum disease it can yeah so it depends on the cause of all these things but yeah I know a number of people have have cured that there's uh Dr Kevin stock who's a dentist and he talks about this a lot he does carnivore and he promotes carnivore diet for uh people on the internet and his patients as well Jordan Peterson cured his gum disease on a carnivore diet I it's uh the secretary at my um Medical Practice actually just cured her gum disease and she always had this is something that you're not supposed to be able to cure and her dentist was like how the hell did you do this you've had this for years and years and years you know this is this doesn't just go away like how what the hell happened uh so yeah it absolutely can yeah it depends on what's causing it but for a lot of people they've been they've been fixing their gut gum disease and um and uh significantly improving their oral health will carnivore diet help an extreme case of limes inflammation even in the voice box any studies or data to research this thank you God bless you are a godsend um no I don't know of any any studies there's a lot of well there are there are you know there is research and and um Publications like going back into the 1800s with with um uh Dr uh JH Salisbury who made the salisbury steak and you know really pushed a red meat and water dye for a lot of these people and then subsequently people came after that and and some of that was with lime uh disease but um I well certainly don't have any specifically with the voice box but I've I've seen a number of people a lot of people do come to carnivore with you know having issues with Lyme disease it's one of those nasty ones that take a long time and it's like autoimmune issues that can uh that can really be stubborn if you're not very very on top of it and very strict and so what Salisbury found is that you really need just red meat and water red meat and water and and that beef was much better than lamb so that's sort of what they found so and I've certainly found that certainly red meat is much much better for for these cases um so that's what I would do and I would just eat like literally only eat red meat and water not even using spices or seasoning sauces or not drinking coffee anything like that they're just eat you know beef I would only eat water I don't even really salt anymore so just just meat and water and that's what I would do for that it's going to take time it's going to take months gonna take many months potentially you know hopefully it gets better but uh yeah it's just it's just people's um you know description of their of their Improvement but a lot of people are improving so hopefully yours does too all right Christy says I've been on Carnivore for eight weeks now and starting to experience severe stomach problems drink a gallon of water a day with lemon juice twice daily help well it depends on what's what's causing your stomach problems so um you know I wouldn't really expect lemon juice to to help necessarily um you know you're going to get things that you don't necessarily want like all citrus has friada coumarins which are make you light sensitive and so UV light reacts with that and can make you uh have problems otherwise and you can also your liver has to detox these things and so on those can cause problems but you know a bit of lemon juice probably not the end of the world but it's um I would I don't know why it would help your your stomach problems I don't know what your stomach problems are unfortunately um so that that really does does sort of matter what I would do is I would you know do like a food diet or food and symptom diary where you just write down exactly what you're eating exactly when you're eating how much you're eating it and then when these sort of symptoms come on if you're getting this just directly after you know your stomach you could have other sorts of things and that might be something you need to speak to your doctor about you know maybe you have developed with ulcer or something like that you had had pain you you're not going to develop an ulcer from a carnivore diet it would be something else added on to that but there are other things that can cause ulcers and so you know it really just depends on what what are causing your your diet your stomach problems so severe stomach problem that sounds like probably severe stomach pain um if a bit of lemon juice helps great you know but I would I would try the diary check your symptoms check when they're happening and in relation to food and things like that so mark down when you're eating mark down when you're having the symptoms and and be as as precise and give as much details as possible and um you could try having a bit of lemon juice I don't you know I don't know what's causing your I don't know what your stomach issues are I don't know what's causing them so I don't know if that would help I doubt it will I don't think it's going to help anything um in particular but you at least have some information you can see okay maybe this isn't actually even associated with the food I'm eating or maybe it's only associated with the certain things that I'm eating and you just sort of eliminate those things or it gives you just a piece of information and and some documented objective uh symptoms that you can then go take to your doctor and say hey something weird is happening seems to be a bit of a weird pattern here you know can we can we check this out and they might order you know some investigations like a scope and see if you have gastritis or or something else that might need some help with so that's that's what I would do all right caller said mainly carnivore but I do eat grapes and honey for my sweet tooth once per day is it something natural if my main goal is weight loss and muscle gain um yeah look I mean it's a lot better than than a lot of other things but you know the honey and the grapes these are sugar you know that's going to raise your blood sugar it's going to raise your insulin that's going to stall weight loss or certainly not going to help your weight loss depends on how much you're eating of course but you know anything addictive a little bit of something addictive easily and quickly turns into a lot of something addictive and so that's just something that you don't want to I just I just don't think it's it's uh worth playing with honestly and I don't think it's doing anything for you um and yeah and that's why you we're doing this thing you know this is a sweet tooth right and so it's an addiction but like any addiction you know it can it can go away and like any addiction you should probably get rid of it right so it's not really helping you being addicted to something like that and and sort of eating things compulsively because you just you really really want to right so you know you should try uh to to get rid of that if you can yeah and at least reduce that as well but you know after about two weeks generally these Cravings go away you know and you don't really miss it if you are having cravings just eat a lot more meat you know if you struggling like oh I really want that honey I really want it eat a steak eat some meat fill yourself up with fatty meat people tend to have very little um you know cravings and sugar cravings and things like that after that so um yeah just give that a shot and hopefully you can come off it because yeah I do think that you would be better off without fruit honey yeah all right Steve uh 61 year old male strict carnivore no Dairy for eight weeks down 30 pounds 5 11 148 pounds now I have yet to have a solid stool when will that change um yeah look so so so I did a video called you know you don't need fiber and in parenthesis of fiber constipation and diet I'm still playing around with these names to see what what helps the algorithm more or less but um that's that's what it's called right now it might be called something else later but you know it goes into sort of the main reasons or the most common reasons why you might experience either constipation or diarrhea um most commonly it's that people are still drinking coffee and when you get rid of fiber you know you're you're this laxative is now going to be much more powerful because you don't have a whole big blockages to just sort of move through like you know a bunch of semi trucks and traffic right now it's just there's open highways things are going to just be flooding through there so if you're drinking coffee you're drinking tea or you're using artificial sweeteners usually in the coffee or tea get rid of them they're all laxatives you don't need them you don't want them and they they will give you loose stools um if you're not doing any of that if you're exclusively eating meat and you're exclusively drinking water it's it's most often because you're eating a lot more fat than your body can absorb so there's that overflow valve your body can only absorb a certain amount of fat at a time we run out of bile we can only absorb very little after that and so the rest of that goes out and so if you're eating a lot more fat than your body can absorb well then that means it's going to come out you know in the in in liquid fashion so if that's the case you can sort of just pull back a bit and see how you do the other side is you could be so constipated because you're not eating nearly enough fat and that's usually what happens when people aren't eating enough fat they can get quite constipated and sort of blocked up and actually liquid stools sort of squirt around that so you actually get liquid stools and then every now and then you get a big hard chunky very difficult to pass stool and that's called overflow diarrhea or spurious diarrhea and that's um that means you need to eat a lot more fat and sort of clear that stuff out and um yeah and then there's a few people that have done all those sorts of things and they still are just having loose stools and and for them they just need to get for some reason people have problems like rendered fat like you know like butter and Tallow and things like that it just goes through your body too quick their body doesn't have a chance to absorb it so they need more of the whole fat like the the tissue fat so the fat in the cellular structure of the fat on the the meat itself is supposed to like rendered out liquid fat that's come out from cooking um they do better with that and then about three people now even that wasn't enough and then they started cutting off the fat when that when it was raw before they cooked it and they they would eat the fat on cooks and then they would cook up the rest of the meat and that did it so you know there's a lot of different options in there 95 of the time it's either coffee tea artificial sweeteners or you're eating too much fat all right uh holistic love hey Dr chafee is if you suffer from candida is carnivore a good way to go thank you oh yeah it can be you know because the thing is is you're going to optimize your your body's biome as well so your oral biome your microbiome in your in your gut and and there are various sorts of you know Flora around your around your body can it can certainly improve that um sometimes you need a bit of help sometimes you need a like an anti-fungal or something like that depending on where it is and how bad it is so you know I I you know I'm still you know a doctor I still think that that medicines are useful in certain select circumstances um you know if your body is having trouble clearing something or needs a bit of help so you know yes going Carnival can help your immune system it can help clear infections it can help optimize your your body's Flora um you know in your in your mouth in your digestion track and you and elsewhere and so uh that can definitely help that but if you still need medicine on top of that there is medicine available all right thank you Zeta and then we have the carnivore boss question best response to friends who either have fibromyalgia or have children on the autism spectrum when they insist that these are neurological disorders unaffected by dietary changes oh well you know you can just you just point them in the way of of um uh Dr Chris Palm Professor Chris Palmer from Harvard um who has actually shown uh nope that's not the case so yes these are neurological disorders that have a strong dietary component at least for for autism and he's he's reversing uh people with schizophrenia he's curing people with schizophrenia through diet right and so you know that's not supposed to happen he has a better success rate than the standard of care medicine and and uh counseling and things like that right so what's happening here well you know he writes a whole book about why uh that is it has to do with mitochondria mitochondria aren't working properly in autism you have mitochondria that aren't working properly you don't get neurons developing properly and you get autism uh that's actually been shown by Texas A M to be absolutely uh diet related there's a number of studies that show a strong relationship between uh diet and uh autism um there's a study showing that you know women who ate more red meat uh preconception had and red meat products had a lower rates of kids with autism than women who ate more saturated fat during pregnancy and had higher LDL cholesterol that dreaded LDL cholesterol um had lower rates of kids with autism that women who breastfed their kids lower rates of autism versus uh bottle fed right you know bottle fed formula they didn't differentiate between people who um you know you know expressed and collected their breast milk or used formula but the vast majority of people who use bottles use formula and juices and all that sort of garbage and so strong relationship between nutrition and autism certainly Texas A M actually showed causation between or causative relationship between um diet and autism in that they showed that vegans and vegetarians have a much higher rates of kids with autism okay okay so why the hell is that well they found that they say well carnitine is a is supposedly a non-essential amino acid that you know we make this we don't need it from our diet well first of all we actually benefit from having more of it first of all second of all only 70 of people make it 30 of people don't make it at all or don't make enough of it right so they need it from their diet it is essential to them and so if you're one of these kids that that needs more carnitine from your diet and your and your parents are really depriving you and starving you of essential nutrients uh you're not going to get the essential nutrients you're not going to be able to develop your brain probably because carnitine is integral for mitochondrial health and for neuronal development and so if you don't have enough carnitine or you don't have any carnitine your brain will not function properly it will not develop properly it will not function properly and uh and the fact of the matter is that I mean there's there's studies actually called you know ketogenic diet as a treatment modality for autism so that's in the published literature you know people are already treating uh people with autism with a ketogenic diet carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet so yes of course this is related to uh dietary changes fibromyalgia what the hell is Fibromyalgia ask them to explain what that is is a neurological disorder is it no one knows what fibromyalgia is it's a it's a diagnosis of exclusion you know you have all these other sorts of things and you just say okay we have no idea what it is Fibromyalgia most people most doctors think this is people making it up most people think it it's it's drug-seeking Behavior or it's just in their head right and I don't because I've seen people recover very well they've gone on a carnivore diet and I've had people tell me I have I have a um an episode on YouTube called chronic pain fibromyalgia all that sort of stuff right look it up with fibromyalgia and pain and all that sort of stuff you'll see it and look at the comments and you'll see hundreds and hundreds of comments from different people who had had fibromyalgia or radiculopathy and nerve pain sciatica and all these sorts of things they went on a carnivore diet and many of these people are saying they've had been long-term sufferers one guy said that he had he that one month on Carnivore it was the first time in 12 years that he didn't take opiates first fibromyalgia and sciatica right and he's like thank God I can come off these things because he hated it for all that time you know talking about restricting and limiting yourself you know like that's you know that's restricting and limiting being so caught up with pain and being doped up and drugged up that you can't function properly for 12 years of his life you know that's horrible uh it's all of it every your life is is related to diet everything's related to diet getting your arm chopped off probably not related to dot everything else diet fibromyalgia that sounds like IBS that's what I think of when I hear IBS because I was diagnosed with that it's like well we don't know what's wrong with you you've got IBS it's just now it's just eating the standard American diet yeah I'm seeing crap yeah please help me understand the relation between the ph and the stomach the pH in the blood and the relation to been able to become full carnivore um well I mean PhD in your stomach a pH in your in your blood are just two completely separate systems so the pH in your blood needs to sort of be at a very specific level between 7.35 and 7.45 it goes outside of that very narrow range and you get very very sick and so you know that's the the optimal pH for your body to run properly so there's a lot of reasons why that is but the pH in your stomach is a little different because you need it to be very acidic to kill off the bacteria because normally we would be eating things that have a high bacterial lobe because refrigerators are very recent and you know commercialized you know beef is very recent as well and so you know normally we were hunting and we had to sort of eat things over several days and they'd have a high bacterial load or maybe we're Scavenging and do all that sort of stuff so our stomach the HIV very very low very acidic it's it's you know it's in that range of carnivores and even like scavenger carnivores that are just eating like carrion and things like that like you know vultures and and other other sorts of scavengers as well so that just needs to be very low way to optimize that eat what you're supposed to eat don't take medications that would disrupt that and um and don't drink a lot of water uh before you eat then you'll keep your your stomach acid nice and concentrated the way it's supposed to be and you'll just you know you'll you'll do very well in your digestion as well um and so you know being carnivore just you know just don't don't don't drink water for like an hour before you're gonna eat and try not to drink water as you're eating so an hour before hour after you're going to you know keep your your stomach acid you know pretty concentrated you know some people say actually two hours like Salisbury would say two hours before after you don't want to eat you don't want to drink water you keep it very very concentrated and that that help with digestion so uh that's it but yeah you're you know if you're if you're taking a whole bunch of medications that's going to uh mess with your stomach pH like a whole bunch of like antacids and things like that your body can sort of keep pushing out you know acids okay hey no we need more of this we need more of this we need more of this that can actually give you like a metabolic alkalosis so your your blood pH goes too high you can do different things that screw with your body uh don't you know just just eat where you're supposed to eat and let your body get on with it don't take a bunch of medications and try to you know you don't try to micromanage your your millions of years of evolution or God's design or whatever you want want to want to think about either way we're designed to do a certain thing you're not going to figure that out better than your body already has so just just let your body do its thing you'll be fine Tony J thank you two dollars uh Zeta two months on Carnivore diet beef butter bacon eggs but I'm gaining weight close to gotten tighter I also have more cellulite [Music] okay well um okay so if you're eating anything else so sometimes people will still be eating uh artificial sweeteners that's a major one that people gain on and they say no no I'm just eating corn with this and the other okay what exactly are you eating anything else and it'll come out that they're having like monk fruit sugar or Stevia or they're having you know different sorts of you know electrolytes or whatever with stevia in it or other sorts of things or dairy dairy is a major one that people can stall on or gain we'll wait on um it's very rare uh that someone is just eating meat and only drinking water and actually putting on fat it does happen uh Kelly Hogan uh was one of those people she she put on weight you can also put on weight that's healthy like um like uh you know you can put on muscle and bone density and then not really lose much fat and you can you know put on weight on the scale um some people have difficulty losing fat early on or even you know middle distance um just due to hormonal disruption like rampant leptin resistance so you're you're having chronically High insulin that's blocking your leptin you're drinking you're eating a bunch of lectins that can block leptin as well and you become leptin resistance because your leptin is massively elevated and and your body's just screaming out stop eating stop eating stop eating and you can't actually see it because you're leptin resistant so that can be an issue I've seen some people have massively elevated leptins like well over 100. that um some of them will lose some weight but most of it it's more slow some of them don't really lose anyway but they gain health they feel better they're coming off medications they're putting their their um uh autoimmune issues into remission and that's what's important so you need to focus on health you need to get rid of anything that's not meat and water anything right um and then focus on your health focus on how you're feeling and then give your body time right if you're doing beef butter bacon and eggs you know maybe just cut that down a beef you know most people will do great on beef butter bacon and eggs some people need to be just on beef and water nothing else nothing else at all not even seasonings or spices certainly no sweeteners and no Dairy just just try that and and if you're you know one of the people that are just in that situation like Kelly Hogan was first of all watch Kelly Hogan and see that I have an interview with her we talk about that and you know that that can be quite helpful because like okay I'm not the only one that's experienced this it is rare and I hope it's not the case that you know that's not the case but if it is it's okay there you know it happens it just takes time it just takes time for your body to heal you're gonna have a lot of hormonal issues you're gonna have leptin which is very important for a lot of other other hormones and getting your insulin down getting your insulin resistance and sensitivity back to normal and a lot of other things you have a lot of other hormones that are going to be in play thyroid estrogen so on these will take time to normalize when they get into better levels you'll start seeing more fat loss which is not the same as weight loss because you can put on muscle and you can lose fat and you stay the same way and so focus on your health give it time just beef and water see how you go in time it should get better those people those high leptins that leptin does come down and eventually that will come down to a more normal level and that's when you start seeing the fat loss really take off it will happen just be patient and just really focus on your health speed health and how you feel because that's the main thing yeah I did that same thing 46 days ago switched to just beef and water from bbbe I feel so much better the weight started coming off I was just steady for a while but I'm I'm on Lion diet just beef salt and water for life now I feel way better it's a lot easier to and yeah the weight just keeps coming off Trey Coleman five dollars 21 year old male here been carnivore for about a month I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I was nine years old anyway carnivore can reverse hypothyroidism uh well it depends on on the cause of hypothyroidism but yeah I see I see people improve their thyroid issues all the time and you know there's people like Hashimoto's can be a cause of hypothyroidism and that uh that can improve that takes longer um any autoimmune issue you have to be very strict just just beef and water really uh nothing else very you have to be very very on it and uh and you'll you'll improve mostly from that anyway you'll get most improvement from that as well and uh yeah I can get better you know if you have something that's damaged your thyroid and it's permanently damaged you know it may not come back you know there is such thing as damage done it could be permanent but yes there are a lot of people improve their their thyroid dramatically just give your body as much as it needs and and see what happens and you know you you will improve in many many many other ways anyway and uh yeah you could absolutely improve your thyroid all right carnivore in Christ could carnivore diet shrink euterian fibroids uterus yeah uterine fibroids yeah 100 yeah so a lot of you're doing fibroids are actually caused by insulin resistance you're having a chronically High uh blood sugar or blood glucose and high insulin can actually trigger a growth of uterine fibroids and so that's something that ketogenic diets have already been shown to do you can actually uh you know shrink those down yeah so in a carnivore diet is a type of ketogenic diet uh or it should be right so if you're doing fruit and honey all that sort of stuff that's not ketogenic you need to be ketogenic especially for this one so doing a carnivore diet no carbs and sugar what I consider a carnivore diet is just meat and water right so people say oh I do carnivore and I have you know lamb you know I have lamb and honey and and fruit and sugar and you know daffodils and whatever the hell they eat like I just okay that's not exactly what we're talking here so you know if you're talking if you're saying carnivore you should you should just mean just meat just water you could say I do meat based and I do the X Y and Z that's not me it's just it makes it much more clear for everybody but like you know carnivore just means meat just means water you know and that that makes it easier so if you're just eating meat only drinking water uh yes that should help all right we're almost to the bottom this is turned into like a Telethon this is awesome they keep adding more on here you're still good for a couple more sure okay the complaining channel five dollars a quick follow-up thanks legal not possible maybe I'll try lion diet and write a book what happened to me to try to keep distracted and then one more from there you go uh oh this is going to be tough can it reduce and cure angio keratoma of fortiti uh I don't know I I don't actually know what that is so um you know there's a lot of things that were just sort of just seeing it and just saying hey I've seen that I've seen enough Crohn's you know patients uh get go put into Mission remission that I can confidently say now this this will help people with crohn's and there's there's um you know sort of adjacent studies like the one with elemental diet and you know just removing carbs and fiber that put people in remission and without without medications right so um those I can speak more confidently on other other things we're just sort of seeing you know anecdotally and uh that one I haven't even heard of before so unfortunately I don't know but um but again like like anything else it's going to allow your body to work properly and so many things are related to eating the wrong thing and so it's just more and more and more things I'm just seeing people are coming up and like wow it's helping this it's helping Vitiligo you know I you know that was a surprise to me people had you know uh you know bleach skin you know the Michael Jackson supposedly Michael Jackson disease were sort of was just gonna you know losing all the melanin things like that not only did it stop progressing the melanin came back and they had the pigmentation came back so I was like that well that's amazing so you're just you're just seeing these things and um you know and and it's it's impressive and you try to sort of relay that to other people that may be experiencing the same thing and then it's just worth a shot you know there's no guarantees on things like that that we don't have like good studies for or anything like that or even know what the hell they are but you know it's always worth a shot and just to see uh what happens and and again you're going to improve on a lot in a lot of other ways um and that so you know even if it doesn't doesn't help that it's going to make your life a lot better in any case yeah Joe Rogan's back on Carnivore and he has uh fighter Lago and it's helped him tremendously uh nice Edison Twain how many liters of oral electrolytes do you need to consume per day I take this one called electrolyte that they sell here in Mexico oh if you're just doing carnivores just doing doing meat and watery I don't think you need to take that you know some people do especially early on when their insulin is normalized and once your insulin gets to a normal stable low level you know and your body's sort of adjusted to that you usually don't need to do that you know if you're sort of feeling symptomatic and weird and whatever and you feel that those electrolytes are helpful you know go for it but uh most people don't need them I mean most people don't even need salt like I don't I don't even salt anymore right I'm perfectly fine you know you know I still sweat you know I still work out I still have tons of energy I don't get cramps you know all these sorts of things so um I don't think you need to do that um but you know if you're going to take any electrolyte then you need to make sure that it's not anything that has any sweeteners or flavorings that's really important that stuff is really not good for you so tastes like crap whatever you know if you if you want to take it then then you know uh take the unsweetened unflavored version you know that Stevia oh it's natural okay arsenic's natural sugar is natural Stevia comes from a plant it's natural it's natural from a plant yes sugar is natural from a plant that's where we're specifically trying to avoid here by using Stevia so that's not to not um uh you know justification so uh yeah just just use if you're going to use electrolytes I don't think most people need to use them some people may um but if you're going to use them just get them without sweeteners or flavorings I thought doing lion I was at the most extreme I could be now I have to start considering the salt thing some more because I'm still doing salt Josh uh 24 thank you so much Michelle Dr chafee what do you think about sugar-free no Cal carb G fuel it has caffeine thank you um yeah so I mean that's going to be I don't know what G fuel is but it sounds you know like something you get in a can if it is it's going to have you look at the ingredients list it's going to have you know 30 different things that you don't recognize and artificial sweeteners artificial sweeteners are awful they are awful you don't want to do that there's a study I mean there's a lot of things that are coming out like aspartame who has just classified as carcinogen they've also classified processed music carcinogen so God of hell you know who the hell knows but this is something I've heard since I was a kid in the 80s that aspartame was likely carcinogenic and there were sort of studies that suggested that but you know there's a lot of you know industry money going into resources oh no no it definitely didn't well there were Decades of of industry-funded research saying that cigarettes didn't cause cancer either and they they damn well knew that it did and that came out um so any anything like that I wouldn't do so I think it's as important what not to eat or drink as it is what to eat you eat meat fatty meat because that's what gives you you know your life right but all the other things can cause harm so they're just as important to not eat those things right so my hard rule is no plants or fungus no sugar or any sweeteners nothing artificial so that is probably all three you know and so I I would I would avoid it for sure if you want some caffeine even though it's a neurotoxin even though it was developed as an insecticide to fry the brains of insects trying to eat that plant um I would just take it as a pill right because you want the caffeine to wake you up do you want all the thousands of other chemicals that are in uh you know tea and coffee or The God knows what the hell else is in the G fuel stuff uh no you don't so you just want the coffee the caffeine you know you can take some caffeines eight bucks for a bottle on Amazon it'll last you a year and it costs you know what a Starbucks or one of those um you know you know goat fuels will cost you so you know I don't um I don't I wouldn't eat I wouldn't drink that crap and you know any sort of um artificial sweetener you really want to get rid of those things are highly addictive and they're very very bad for you I would I would stay far away from those all right Tony asked hi why did Dr chafee stop carnivore when younger oh you know just because I I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't doing carnivore per se I was just I was just avoiding plants and so I learned how toxic plants were I was learning how you know in in botany biology and cancer biology just how toxic plants were and I had a cancer a professor of cancer biology at University of Washington in Seattle who I wish I could track down um but I don't I don't remember his name it's uh you know 23 years ago at this point and I tried actually looking through the you know the um the records that and you dub online but I couldn't I couldn't find it unfortunately but you know he just showed us how toxic these things were how many you know dozens or even over 100 you know carcinogens that were in uh just you know vegetables that you'd eat on a daily basis and he uh you know we were all just blown away in shocked and he just and we were just like oh but how can that be and he just looked at us and just said look you know I don't eat salad I don't eat vegetables I don't let my kids eat vegetables plants are trying to kill you right so you say get it through your heads this is how plants defend themselves it's killer be killed in the wild for plants as well as animals and so they will defend themselves with lethal Force if necessary right and so they do and so at that point I just said right screw it I'm not eating any plants I just defaulted into eating eggs and meat because there wasn't anything left I went to the store I'm like what the hell do I eat because everything has plants in it and you go go to the store now and you look around you you know you you look as a percentage like what the hell here does not have plants in it it's just the meat and and dairy egg the aisle that's it you know and so you know Dairy Island I have a bunch of you know soy crap and things like that in there now infiltrated it like a cancer but you know that was it and so I just I just started eating I just started eating uh just meat and eggs and that was it I never felt better never performed better athletically until you know now but I don't have the time to train eight hours a day now and um you know and I just felt absolutely amazing but then I was in England and I was playing rugby over there and I just uh they just didn't have the same access to meat some of it was breaded and I was just like okay well maybe it's not that big of a deal dose makes the poison you know maybe maybe just having some some crumbing on the chicken is not that big it wasn't even that off it wasn't like every day you know it was like every every couple days or something like that it was enough you know it was it was enough to to knock me off my game I remember thinking I was like why am I not as feeling as just superhuman amazing as I normally do like what's going on man I push myself I'm not working as hard like um am I just 25 now am I just hold what's over the hill and just dying now and I just didn't know what it was I figured I was just getting old and but that's when I started slipping off of that without realizing it because you know I made that concession of like oh well maybe it's not that big of a deal and then a little bit something else wasn't that big of a deal a little bit more a little bit more and all of a sudden I started seeing things materialize I never I just didn't look at bread or ketchup or anything like that as food ever yeah because it wasn't food to me you know so I just didn't see it I just didn't register now all of a sudden you know you open the fridge up there's like 90 bottles of ketchup because these are English rugby players they just they put casual on everything and so they just call it sauce past the sauce there's only one sauce this is what kind of sauce no it's just it's just the one it's just it's just ketchup right and so you know there's just all of a sudden it was just like Jesus Christ it's a lot of ketchup I'm like oh I haven't used ketchup and wow well I guess I guess I'll use that up just completely blanking on the fact that like I of course I haven't eaten this stuff in five years because I was specifically not eating anything with plants in it and then that sort of that mindset of just like I'm not going to eat anything that has plants in it just all of a sudden just disappeared it was crazy how quickly it went away because I wasn't doing carnivore it wasn't until you know later I realized holy no humans are carnivores that's the kind of animal we are we were taught that in elementary school there were apex predators apex predators are by definition carnivores because they eat animals down the food chain that's what an apex predator is and that's what we are and so I was like holy okay that's it and that's what I was doing I was living as a carnival I was doing that and I came back to it but that was it it's so easy to slip off if you don't if you don't consciously know what you're doing and so even though I made it five years and those were literally the five best years of my life you know as far as athleticism and how I felt physically um you know it's um you know you just sort of you don't realize just one little in the armor and it all sort of slips away but now I'm I'm consciously doing this I know exactly what I'm doing so not really in danger of that but I really wish I was doing this the whole time I'm actually really pissed that I slipped off of it oh I should have been doing this my whole life um parents should have known about this they should have taught me this um instead of me teaching them but you know I'm glad I I got to anyway and I can teach my kids but I really wish I'd been doing this the whole time for 20 years I would have been just a different person just a different human being right feeling a lot better for more time it's it's so sad thinking about the current generation of children are never going to know what it's like to just be a natural human being what it's like to feel healthy hopefully unless we could unless we can get the word out and change it Josh says I've got a metal aorta valve an aortic root put in 10 years ago I've been carnivore eight months scared the cholesterol will hang around the scar tissue from the surgery should I be worried I know this is not personal advice I don't think so I mean I'm not cardiothoracic surgeon but you know I don't I don't uh I don't think that cholesterol has anything to do with any sort of deposition or deposits around the valves um you know the main thing with it with a metal aortic valve is you need to be on blood thinners and uh that's not going to change on a carnivore diet like you just you're you're you have a piece of metal in your body that this gonna cause clots uh if you if you don't take um you know your your blood thinners for that uh but no I don't I don't think it should cause anything else you know the the cholesterol that you'll get is healthy cholesterol your body is choosing to make because it needs it it deems it necessary to make right you're not just going to get extra excess cholesterol um that your body doesn't know about and doesn't doesn't want to use so no I think you'll be fine from that from that standpoint I don't I don't know of anything um to do with uh you know aortic valve Replacements that would be an issue anyway all right we got a little two-parter here uh carnivore for five months coming from keto I was on mostly optimal weight just looking to drop a bit of percentage body fat but gained instead also thyroid issues and then speaking with a functional doctor he noted my insulin is stuck on very low body can go on reserve mode and gain fat my insulin two thoughts um well that your insulin of two is great you know that that's that's fantastic body can go on reserve mode and gain fat uh yeah you know the thing is too if you under you can also gain fat right that's something people people think oh you you want to eat less and then you'll you'll lose fat or eat less fat and you'll lose fat uh in fact they can they can actually go the other way so I mean um uh bariatric surgeons you you can tell this or have their nutritionist say to people once they they get this surgery hey you need to eat enough because if you eat sort of less than a certain amount like you know 1200 kilocalories for women that uh you'll actually put on weight you know you won't lose weight so you know what is that what does that mean well you're changing yourself hormonally but you're also you're suppressing your immune system so you suppress your or sorry not on your immune system but you suppress your metabolism you also has a special immune system if you're eating crap but you suppress your metabolism if you're under eating right and so if you're under eating you you're by you're telling your body that you have a lack of of resources because you're not able to get enough food to maintain life at a certain level at a metabolism up here so he's like okay can't do it we'll bring it down here this is like you know if you get your hours cut at work and you don't go on a shopping spree you know you start you start you know cutting costs you know trimming sales and you you get through it right you start spending yourself into debt and you're screwed right so your body's smarter than that it's not going to do that and so it's going to it's going to actually start lowering your expenditures right so that's lowering your metabolism it's lowering your your energy output okay and you know and your body can say okay we need to store the stuff we need to store this stuff right so it's um it's it's going to do that so you need to eat enough but you need to eat enough meat right and so eat enough meat eat enough fat uh your insulin being low um it's supposed to be low that you want it to be low um you know that that's that's low for someone who's on a standard dialogue my God what is that that's where it's supposed to be you know having having it around there is is perfectly fine so I wouldn't be too worried about that you know as I said there are some people that can that can gain weight um generally you know it is a hormonal issue so thyroid leptin estrogen all these other sorts of things can play a role when you have uh excess body tissue body fat it's actually metabolically active it can actually produce estrogen and so that can that can play a role in weight loss as well so you know you need to just let your body heal you give your body time and chance you need to give it enough you need to give your body enough fatty meat and eat until fatty meat stops tasting good only eat meat only drink water give yourself enough of it and give yourself time your body takes it's going to take a long time to heal your hormones you know like it's you know I've said before or you know there's no shortcut there are no shortcuts right you walk 10 miles into the woods you're gonna have to walk 10 miles out right so you're going to have to give your body time it's not going to take 40 years or however long it took you to get to where you are now but it is going to take time so your your hormones are going to need to heal they're going to need to normalize and once those get into a normal range then you'll start seeing uh fat loss all right Peter Peter Kovacs uh thank you awesome uh looks like we just got a couple more here Jeremy m is it normal to struggle eating bacon uh yeah if you're not hungry right so if bacon doesn't taste good a steak doesn't taste good it means you're not hungry right and so you know if other meats are tasting good you just really don't like bacon okay maybe there's just something about it that you don't like but in general if fatty meat doesn't taste good then that's just your body telling you that you don't need to eat that you're not hungry anymore so just listen to it you know if you don't if you don't aren't enjoying fatty meat you don't have to eat for the sake of eating in fact your body is telling you to stop eating and just go and enjoy the rest of your day all right uh the next one was from Mockingbird acid reflux due to Mechanical issue of the valve not closing properly any advice or do's and don'ts on Carnivore diet um acid reflux due to a mechanical issue Okay so um well is not not necessarily going to affect that um but what carnivore can do is uh it has been known to reduce reflux symptoms and and can improve the acidity of your stomach so you're not getting um overly acidic uh stomach acid and and um and causing problems that way um it just depends it just depends on on the the anatomical issue that you have um and and whether or not that's that's going to help the carnivore die quite often uh what we're eating has a big role to play in the carnivore diet but um I I don't know because I don't know exactly what your your anatomical uh disruption is sometimes people have uh neurological issues um you know we don't go through normal peristalsis or these other things those things um could potentially heal but it just depends on the individual again so uh yeah it's no no necessary not necessarily induced and don'ts apart from just void spices and carbs and just anything just eat meat just drink water and um you know if and then you can also do a a diary so you can see how much you're eating so if you're eating a lot does that cause a problem if you're not eating all that much does that cause a problem or is that is that better so track out what you're eating track what your symptoms are see how they line up see if there's anything that you can can adjust and manage to improve it and that's actually a lot more helpful than than uh than uh people give credit for so you know people are having little problems like that you know keeping track of it and and monitoring it with like sort of a calendar at this time I did this then I had these symptoms all sorts of things you can start seeing patterns or you can just look like it's completely unrelated just you know get on with it all right Mama Bear 17 year old son partial a Genesis corpus callosum epilepsy severe cognitive delay been high fat 98 carnivore for three years any chance the corpus callosum will develop more um no I don't think so unfortunately um you know his his um you know he he might he might improve symptomatically in some ways but you know no I don't I don't I don't I don't think that those major structures are necessarily going to uh to to regrow you know at 17 you know your brain your brain is still growing your brain is always Remodeling and can improve at any age but you know at 17 it's really done you know the majority of its of its development unfortunately most of my really most of that's done in Euro for those sorts of things were like corpus callosum as well however epilepsy uh yes that can that can certainly help um and at least you know raise the threshold and sometimes make it so he's not having you know breakthrough seizures on medications or maybe not doesn't require as many medications and you know the longer he goes without seizures the the less likely he is to have more seizures which is very good so I'm very sorry about that that's that's a very difficult situation I do think it would still help in a lot of ways just just making him healthier overall um I don't think it's going to regrow his Corpus close them though unfortunately but it could help him in other ways and I think it could help the epilepsy and um you know could help you know him and be a bit uh you know develop a bit better from here forward unfortunately it's it can't undo um everything though unfortunately but but I do think it will still make them better you know better than you know better than he would be otherwise you know the thing is eating a lot of carbohydrates and things like that and not letting his brain run on ketones it's going to curtail um you know his brain function you know so wherever his brain function is at it's going to make it less run worse and so being on a carnivore diet being on a ketogenic diet having high ketones allowing your brain to run on its optimal fuel source it's going to give his brain it's it's maximal potential for um you know for you you know utility right so you know whatever his brain can do you know it's going to be able to do that and you know that's all we can really hope for sometimes all right uh you guys are just awesome can't wait for the film the rest of the world needs to hear this yeah if anyone wants to participate the links below carnivore dietmovie.com and then we have I was gonna say we have one more there's one more that just popped in there nitrates bad in bacon I found nitrate free breaking but it's uh it's in every processed meat here in Germany um well the thing is too with nitrate-free uh bacon or anything um and uh you know they they you'll look in there it'll say like you know you know celery powder or something like that the reason there's celery powder in there is because there are more nitrates in celery than there is in bacon right so they put like this celery powder in there just tons and tons and tons of nitrates in there another thing is true that you know something Dr Barry uh pointed out that you make you you produce more nitrates in your saliva than you'll get in bacon right and a lot of these studies looking at nitrates and nitrites and things like that they were using doses that were way way way above anything you're going to find in um you know processed meats and things like that like hundreds of times more thousands of times more right and we have hundreds of times more just in our saliva so you know some something that someone said today they thought that it might be something to do with you know the nitrates and then how they process them and then I don't know I've never heard that before but if you're just talking about if it's the same you know stuff that's coming in our saliva we have more of that in our saliva than in there and you're you know if you find a nitrate free bacon um you know it's you you look out for the celery powder because that has more nitrates in it now you can you can sometimes get naturally cured stuff and it doesn't have that sort of stuff but yeah it is difficult to find the solution to that is just get pork belly and just and just cook that yourself you know it doesn't have that Smoky nice salty flavor of bacon but it's still pretty damn good and it's not going to have any of that that other added stuff that you don't want if you don't want it if you're worried about it yeah Adam and I did that about a month ago we smoked up a pork belly it was delicious put a little salt on it though uh yeah doc C is my guy he's got muscles in his feet because he eats nothing but meat awesome okay here's the last one unless another one Pops in real quick my dad is 75 has pains in his legs for the past 10 years 10 years or so pains in his back for most of his life should he cut all grains bread and cereals yeah hard yes yeah definitely um you know you can it can significantly help with pain um and you know and also just with cognition and Longevity right so 75 years old that's middle-aged right does he feel middle-aged I'm middle-aged I don't feel middle-aged I feel like I'm 20. I feel like at 43 I feel like I'm 23. I feel better at 43 than I did at 27. right because I feel like I did when I was 23 because my body's working the same way it did when I was 23. and sex up I know a lot more stuff now and I have more money so that's good and um but uh you know the the thing is is that this is really really significant especially for people in extremes of age so kids when they're developing their brains and their bodies are developing this is really important for them to be on proper nutrition also in extremes of age when you're getting you know later on in life this is very very important you need proper nutrition you need to avoid all those other things because it's um harmful and you don't have the same threshold and um you know resilience that you did in your your sort of your 20s but that doesn't matter because if you eat properly if you eat what your body's designed to eat then your body works properly you don't you don't need to you don't need to like push through and just you know struggle along just don't eat crap just eat fatty meat only drink water and you'll be fine his pain will improve dramatically he'll put on muscle his brain will start working better until his cognition will improve his brain fog will go away his sleep will improve his energy will improve he'll start being able to exercise more which will then stimulate his brain even further and feel even better after that so you know this is something that that I think is vitally important for all of us to get our you know friends and relatives at all on this but you know especially ones that are that are getting older uh have health issues or people that have you know kids you know because this is this is going to help them more than anybody and just more and more people that we can get on this and showing them showing everybody around them wow look how great this is maybe I'll try it they do really well someone else sees that wow that's really great maybe I'll try this is how this spreads and that's how this has been spreading for the last 20 years right and it's been very so you haven't heard about it until right now because it's only just starting to catch um that exponential growth when people are just more and more people and more and more people are hearing about it or talking about it making channels like this and then that's inspiring other people to to make other channels and other channels and other channels and that's where we're at now so yes 100 I think you should definitely cut out all Breads and cereals and all that sort of carbs and sugar and all that stuff and then get rid of the rest of the plants after that and certainly alcohol as well and just go just meat and water and if you can't do that just a lot of fatty meat no carbs no sugar nothing artificial um you know get rid of sea you know beans seeds legumes all that sort of stuff and just have you know some salads with a lot of fatty meat don't do spinach every night spinach has butt loads of oxalates you can deal with about 150 milligrams of oxalates a day half a cup of spinach has over 600 milligrams of oxalates right so you say oh well are these things in the you know in proportions and in the foods iridium yes damn it they are and more so you know so um you know I mean I used to make spinach salads that were like half a pound of spinach leaves you know and then like like a whole chicken and things like that I mean Jesus like what the hell was that doing to me you know so you know no you don't you don't want to eat any of that crap but you know um you know see what you can do with them definitely getting me a lot more and get them off all carbs get them into a state of ketosis so his brain works better and his body works better get him carnivore if he can and life will be good yeah I just interviewed a man 78 went carnivore just thriving all these issues Pat mentioned he's reversed and he's just he's killing it he feels so good charm mom uh New South Wales Australia hello thank
