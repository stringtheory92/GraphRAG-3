    "transcript": "[Music] hello doctor uh 4 months on a strict keto uh first of all thank you for the Super Chat uh he goes on to say hello doctor four months on a strict keto uh diet since last October um from 10th of February on Carnivore after two weeks of carnivore horrible gout attacks in the elbow two weeks later another attack in both elbows uric acid above 430 well well um speaking with people that have had G now first of all preface this by saying that that Dr Salsbury and others have been treating gout since the 1800s by putting people on a pure red meat and water diet so you know that's already in that's already in the established literature and this is something that a lot of people around the world are finding that this helps their gout but one thing that they do report is that they can get a couple gout attacks after going carnivore and that that uh you know they'll still get they may still get a couple gout attacks but then it goes away you sort of weather the storm you get through it and then it goes away and generally doesn't come back um the other thing to remember is that there is more than one cause of gout so when we think of gout as just uric acid crystals in the joint but there's actually five different uh causes for uh gout one of them is oxalates so oxalate crystals getting in the joints um are are part of gout and um now they're sort of called pseudo gout but that that you know up until you know the 2000s it was called gout and so um you know that's something just to uh just to remember that um that it could be uric acid crystals but however there are people that have high uric acid serum levels that actually don't get gout and there are people with low uric acid levels that do get gout so it's not actually just a direct one to one you have high uric acid levels and you get uric acid in your joints it's a sort of a you know the uric acid is not supposed to get there it's not just because it's in your serum it's it shouldn't get there no matter what uric acid is one of your body's strongest antioxidants it's actually not a bad thing to have that a bit higher um the way you you diagnose gout you know the uric acid version of gout as you stick a needle in this inflamed painful joint and you aspirate some and you say okay what are the crystals in there uh if they're uric acid crystals fine uric acid crystals but they may not be there's there's four other causes so either way it it may not it may not be an issue it could just pass on its own and it may not be uric acid crystals um you know you went from keto to carnivore so you're eating vegetables and meat and now you're eating just meat sometimes you can get oxalate dumping where your body's stored up a lot of oxalate from these plants like spinach and sweet potatoes and other sorts of things and they store up in your tissues and then your body starts releasing these things to get this stuff out of there and sometimes it can do that in an overwhelming fashion and you can get gout you can get joint pain you can get rashes you can get all sorts of different different symptoms kidney stones things like that so you know one thing you could try doing is having you know putting some lemon juice in water having you know just some you know weak tea or something like that uh just on its own those are going have a bit of oxalates on you may like 50 75 milligrams of oxalates and and you know in a day and uh and see what happens sometimes that can suppress the the release of oxalates and you know if you find that that helps you then that could be what's going on not necessarily uric acid gout but it could be oxalate gout and that can sort of slow down the release of uh the oxalate Crystal and and maybe relieve your symptoms so something to think about either way when people have true gout um sometimes they they have a couple other flareups but what people have been reporting is that it then goes away and stays away so uh good luck with that hopefully that settles down very soon hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies the subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys if you're really just eating just meat salt and water uh gout should go away sometimes you you know maybe need a little help with some medications but from now I've never suffered with gout but I've I've spoken to a lot of people who who do and have gone on a carnivore diet some just sorted out right away and it never comes back um uh some people said they basically get like one or two flare ups and then and then it goes away and if they know they sort of power through it um it goes away and then it stays away there are other forms of gout than just uric acid crystals um there's some there like five I believe now they're being called pseudogout and then gout gout is referring to uric acid crystals but things like oxalates can cause um can cause gout or Pudo gout now um same symptoms and so you know if you're oxalate dumping and getting rid of all this sort of stuff you know that can cause you know uh weird pain and gout pain and joint pain and that sort of thing so something think about there and you can look at Sally Norton's work to sort of see if you think that that might be something that's applicable to you um I don't I don't necessarily think that's a kidney issue you definitely do drink enough water to make sure that you're not um you're you're filtering things out easily enough weight loss um weight loss can be can be slow like I I said before and if you're lifting weights and working out which I encourage you to do um you'll encourage your metabol you encourage your body to use more fat but you'll also put on muscle at the same time which will offset the weight that you're losing so I wouldn't worry too much about the weight um just keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good um don't eat anything else you know if you need some medications to help with with the pain or the gout um then that's fine um for the short term hopefully you won't need that long term generally don't um and then think of the other other things that can cause joint pain and gout such as oxalates as well um and yeah those are some of the things to think about anyway but most people will get through this this will just you know take a bit of time it's it's a lot more difficult for some people to transition um based on their past and what they were eating before so good luck with that Jeff says wondering if this helps gout or lymphodema yeah it does so uh Dr salsbery was using a red meat and water diet exclusively red meat and water diet since the 1800s to cure gout and so it's not red meat that causes gout it's all the other crap that comes with it and so some people find that they get like a flare up or two of gout since then but uh you know after going carnivore but then it settles down and goes away and doesn't come back there are other causes of gout besides uric acid crystals as well there's actually like five causes now some of those things are being called pseudogout now uh and one of them is oxalates oxalates are a known cause of gout used to be called gout now pseudo gout um and um and so you know you can get like you know oxalate dumping and things like that potentially so down the road potentially you can get like a bit of a flare up uh and joint pain and things like that um but uh it would be likely that if you did an actual aspirate of the joint you would not find uric acid crystals you'd find oxalate crystals and um that's a difference but most people do this stuff uh you know just clinically they just oh that looks like gout that's gout that must be yasd crystals well you don't know unless you actually stick a needle in there and find out uh most people don't do that and most doctors don't do that because it hurts and uh people don't want to do that they don't want to stick it's like it hurts enough and you're gonna stab me you know like thanks Doc um but so they just oh yeah must be that here's some culture scene off you go uh but uh but no people people do uh do fix their gout by going carnivore and like I said maybe a flare or two maybe it's uric acid maybe it's something else and then then tends to go away and lymphadema yeah there've been more and more and more reports of people uh sorting that out very very easily with a ketogenic carnivore diet yep hey everyone really happy to announce a new sponsor for the show and for

for the Super Chat do you know anyone who is Christian that could give a Biblical view on your ways I don't know well Dr kiltz is uh is quite religious and uh could potentially do that um I don't know who else in the I don't know who else sort of who has like a channel and things like that might be able to do that um well if people know if people know of anybody who might be able to give a sort of a Biblical interpretation of this uh you know please do uh put it in the chats and and and let us know and U can pop it up if we um if someone has a good idea um you know uh homesick Buckeye is a is a guy become friend with he's actually a Seventh Day Adventist Church member and he sort of found that like yep nope this is wrong he not supposed to eat plants and that's not making us healthy and um so I don't know how much of a Biblical scholar he is and and how much of an interpretation he has done but I I do know that he um is Christian and um and he has a a YouTube channel as well I think it is just homesick Buckeye um anyway he's a funny guy and uh he does he does some funny things on there and um he might be able to Dr kils might be able to um you know I've seen a lot of people commenting here if someone has is a Christian has a sort of biblical view on this you know maybe you can have a discussion here um you know one thing that I point out to people is that um you know the the Seven Day Adventist say that we should be in the Garden of Eden diet we should be doing a Garden of Eden diet but they say that yeah well we actually can't get B12 we l that ability that was punishment for the original sin and now we we need Vitamin B12 so okay so what what were people supposed to do for the thousands and thousands and thousands of years up until we were able to supplement with B12 you know if we were all supposed to be on a on a vegan diet on a Garden of Eden diet and we can't be that doesn't really make sense it's not really consistent and um and that's what the school of Lifestyle medicine teaches you have to be on a Garden of Eden diet because school of Lifestyle medicine is um founded by the 7th Day Adventist Church who say this as well oh we need to eat what Adam and Eve ate in the in the Garden of Eden actually in the in the Ethiopian uh canonical texts they're very clear that Adam and Eve ate meat in the Garden of Eden and meat is eaten in heaven and then they come out of of the garden for eating a plant they get punished for eating an apple um I'd probably throw someone out of my house if they were audacious enough to eat an apple in front of me Jo king um and um and then you know Adam and Eve had Cain and Abel uh Cain gave uh uh you know his his crops as a sacrifice to God God didn't care for it Adam gave uh the meat from his herds he was a herder he gave a sacrifice of meat God was pleased and they don't say why it doesn't say why it doesn't say well you know your the sacrifice wasn't in your heart I mean a lot of people can interpret what they want but what it says in the Bible is that Abel gave to God sacrifice of meat God was pleased Cain gave a sacrifice of plant God was displeased that's all it says it doesn't say that Cain had hate in his heart or anything like that it just said pleased and displeased that's all it says and then Cain gets pissed off and kills Abel and um you know which is sort of the first first recorded incidents of U you know vegan rage right they're just freaking out and trying to trying to smash somebody and uh and then what happened you know his disciples became horrible and plagued the Earth and they were just awful just a whole bunch of just angry vegans spread across across the world and U these these horrible angry you know uh you know farmers and crop eaters and things like that and then what happened God sent the flood wiped out Humanity uh except for Noah said you're a good guy save all these animals and now eat them that's that's literally what it said said you need to eat meat now this is stupid this is what going plant-based does to you this is bad you know didn't say that but if you want to interpret you know things if people are interpreting what was in C's heart and all that sort of then I get to interpret what God meant by that is that he was that that people eating plants were bad for the bad for the planet and uh and you need to start eating meat and that was that was what God said so and there's like how many thousands of examples uh in the Bible are there of of eating meat and you need to eat the you know the fatted sacrifice the fatted calf and you know give this and do this and do that you know in the New Testament and the Old Testament it's all you know there a lot of these directives about eating meat and things like that so I wouldn't worry about it oh carnivore kit um might be a good a good one for that as well um and he's on he's has a YouTube channel also and yeah anybody anybody thinks of thinks of another one you know just stick it in stick it in the chat when you know we're playing rugby tournaments either for 15s or for sevens it's uh you it's a long day and uh you're playing these games you're really wearing yourself out you're putting everything out there every minute of the game where you should be anyway and um certainly at the higher levels you are or else you're not not getting invited to play"
