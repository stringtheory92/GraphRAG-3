        "body": "all right hello everyone uh Merry Christmas happy holidays Happy New Year to everyone it is December 28th today and I'm trying something new I'm going Live on YouTube hold on and um so I am yeah trying to go live on YouTube as well as Instagram and um Twitter so that's going there but now for some reason it's making noise on the other side so I'm gon have to mute my own computer that's kind of annoy hope everyone's doing well and um and uh yeah so just already getting getting some chats in I'll try to go as long as as as I can um within reason and I hope everyone's doing well and I see there's little El Marie who was coming to visit me here and or coming to join me here in Seattle I'm back in Seattle seeing my family for Christmas I wasn't able to come at the same time so now she's coming uh today actually which is fun and so hello little elmarie nice to see you okay let me see here [Music] so um first question is from Curtis rat has anyone ever stopped taking medication for Crohn's after going cornivore also thanks for turning my health around yeah absolutely I mean a lot of people I mean tens of thousands of people around the world at the moment are using a carnivore diet to alleviate the symptoms not only the symptoms but the underlying process of their autoimmune disease so including Crohns including run to arthritis including including Ms or or lupus these are things that are eminent treatable with just diet and lifestyle so reducing stress improving sleep very important improving your ccan Rhythm get outside get actual sunlight in your eyes not this fake garbage that we live in um those are all good things but I think the most important part of that and other people may the those are the most important parts I think the diet is the most important part there are certain things in the food that you eat that will trigger and cause autoimmunity and so you just cut all those things out of your diet and the autoimmunity goes away so yes no I I see this regularly I see people with chronis disease come off their medications regularly either patients I have personally in the clinic and I track them personally or people that I've spoken to online or just people that you know just just accounts of success stories that you read generally in about three weeks with crohn's and ulcer of colitis people will resolve most of their symptoms if not sooner some take a little longer it depends on how how far along you are it also depends on how strict you are how closely you're sticking to just red meat and water the closer you are to just red meat and water the better you're going to be for any autoimmune disease including Crohns especially Crohns Crohns is very cron and Ultra ptis are very responsive and so you because it's going through your digestive tract and so you're putting the wrong food through your digestive tract and it's it's reacting pretty much in real time in a way that's that's good because it helps you be really on point because if you you know a pork chop that's been fed a bunch of corn and soy and that's not and that's bringing in something that you don't want let alone fruit or vegetables or God forbid you know process crap you can notice it and you'll notice it pretty quickly and you'll have a lot of pain and discomfort you get bloody diarrhea and so that's a very that's a very uh noticeable effect that you'll have and so you you stray just a little bit you go oh no I don't want that that's that's obviously causing problems to my body it's easy to sort of stay on track so the the better you do with that The Closer you stick to just red meat and water the better you'll be there's some things a bit more subtle like Hashimoto I mean you get a flare up you get antibodies up and sort of trash your thyroid and then over the days and weeks you'll feel sort of worse and worse but with chonin you're getting bloody diarrhea today and so you know that's much more noticeable and it's actually easier for people that have a more extreme and immediate response to stay a bit more on top of things because of that but yes people come off medications all the time usually I mean it can easily be within the month or a couple months you they might be symptom free and think maybe I'll try coming off the medication they come off the medication and they don't have a flare up as long as they stick to the diet and improve other things as well stress poor sleep those things can contribute as well but uh yes you definitely see people come off medications all the time hopefully you do too Courtney McQueen thank you so much for the"

        "body": "you do too Courtney McQueen thank you so much for the you do too Courtney McQueen thank you so much for the Super Chat she says my granny developed an aneurysm behind her eye pre- carnivore diet have any of your patients healed from this and what are your thoughts about laser procedures to stop any bleeding from the anism so no I haven't I haven't come across anybody resolving aneurysms on a carnivore diet not to say you can't but I haven't seen it um but I also wouldn't really expect it either you know once once you have an aneurysm it's like it's like if you if you have a hernia yeah you have you have this sort of weak area sort of things are pushing through and protruding through and that's just sort of a structural defect at the time now maybe if they had been on a carnivore diet they wouldn't have developed that in the first place but maybe not and at this point you know this the structural damage is done right you you break a leg well will car that heal a broken leg well it'll help heal a broken leg it'll heal faster but it's not necessarily going to like just make that just go away in vanish your body still needs to heal so same thing with a with an aneurysm as a hernia you know you have this defect the physical structural defect that's probably gonna stay unfortunately and that's something that you know does need to be addressed uh depending on the anism depending on the size of it depending on where it is depending on if it's pushing on anything depending on if it's growing it's growing at a a certain rate or meets a certain size criteria you know that's when you have to start thinking about fixing it you can do internal coiling you go up you know through the vessel into the brain some coils put a scent something like that and um It's very effective there are others that are more amable to surgery like an MCA aneurysm and um you know depending everything's operator dependent so you know depending on your surgeon depending on the person doing the vascular treatment you know one may be better than the other in in a certain person's hands the most important thing is is to you know to discuss with your doctor with her neurosurgeon or Interventional radiologist whoever's you know thinking about doing the procedure there are neurosurgeons that do endovascular treatments and some K it over to the Interventional radiologist which just depends and So speaking with her doctor and finding out the best solution for her and her health and her condition and her medical status all these things come into play so I can't really you know give any specific medical advice onto that because it is very individual it depends on the anism it depends on the location it depends on what's going on with it and it depends on what's available to her based on her medical medical condition however um a corn diet is going to help her in a thousand other ways it's going to help her recover from any procedure much more quickly it's going to make her much more healthy in general General correct any uncorrected metabolic issues and Insulin issues blood sugar issues it's going to make her life a lot easier getting a procedure so um yeah so I would just I would just go to whoever's the most authoritative person in your area and get their opinion and and I would go with that you can always try I mean if this thing isn't growing and it's a small enough size say hey just we'll just watch and wait at the moment fine great we've got time and you know who knows maybe this thing gets better I would expect that it would I would I would be surprised if it did I've been surprised about a lot of things that the carnivore diet can heal uh like um you know Dave Mack who I had interviews with on my channel and his channel you he had he had um a a stroke 30 years ago and he had done keto and Atkins and you know he got the healing and resolution that that he was going to get 30 years later he goes carnivore and few mons in all of a sudden his weakness is gone and and he's not unbalanced and he's not limping amazing absolutely amazing so you know you never know happen but I would I would expect structural abnormality of an aneurysm did not improve that's just sort of my my guess on that but it is a guess and so here you can see as long as they're not saying like well this is this has to be treated now you know they might say well we'll just keep an eye on it we'll do a SC in six months or a year and just track it if it starts growing you know then we'll do something about it that's that's often what happens and if that's the case then then you have B of time but I would I would go with what her doctors are suggesti ng and recommending Joseph thank you very much for the"

        "body": "ng and recommending Joseph thank you very much for the ng and recommending Joseph thank you very much for the Super Chat it's very kind of you carnivore for 6 months I'm now able to enter the Flow State seamlessly good that's good um a good place to be such a boost in productivity have you experienced this it's way better than any and all know tropics I have tried in the past thanks for all you do I I certainly have noticed that I certainly have noticed you know brain fog being gone when I was doing my mcats I had constant brain fog and I didn't know what was going on I'd wake up you fresh as a daisy I I would get a lot of sleep you know I was I was um playing rugby and and and really dedicating a lot of my time to you know studying studying for my MCAT because it been you know few years since I finished you know college and and had to go back over all these things and so I you know I needed time to study and and there's a lot of new material too that you just don't necessarily come across or in a new context and so I was doing that I was studying a lot and I'd wake up fine I get a lot of sleep and then like halfway through the day all of a sudden I just get this crazy brain fog wouldn't be able to think properly just be all Muzzy have to take a nap or something like that didn't know what the hell was going on looking back I know exactly what was going on it was easy for me to just I was not carnivore at the time I was still you know very interested in meat I was eat a lot of meat but for some damn reason it was just in my head that it was just a you know quicker easier way when I was you know spending a lot of time on study that I could just get whole wheat pasta supposed to be the best and and I just make that and put some pasta sauce on and that's it and I just I would just eat that it was just you know quick energy quick carbs and I would have energy and be able to study and and it only take me a minutes to make which is true and I had brain fog all the damn time and I just didn't think that's gone that's completely gone I have no brain fog I haven't had brain fog in years years years and that's great and so I've certainly noticed that I I I'm I'm thankful that I seem to have adapted much more quickly than than others may have I was always very heavily meat-based anyway and I've done this before so my body just was okay just slapping back into it but as soon as I dropped carbs I felt a lot better and and I really noticed my back had a lot less pain and so that was the main thing um that I the reason I stopped eating carbohydrates was because it just killed my back and so I just noticed that like if I don't eat carbs for a few days my back doesn't hurt as much great don't like my back hurting and so I I just sort of cut those out and then I was just eating vegetables and even then I had you know brain fog I didn't feel good I didn't have much energy and so I uh you know but once I cut those out and I started eating a lot more fatty meat overnight it was it was just a massive difference I felt so much better and I had a lot more energy felt good and my body just started pumping off inflammation then you get into the steady state that you're talking about your body's recovered a lot of mitochondria G through mitophagy gone through autophagy and you just sort of replaced out a lot of cells and a lot of the internal workings of your cells made them work better and then you're just Zen M Zen place just you're just living and you're just feeling great and living living uh living your best life and so I'm glad that you experienced that as well most people do um some people take a little longer than others now was like you know six months for you um and now you're getting into Flow State there are some people that take a bit of time it's hard it's hard to get through some people have one guy I've been talking to very nice guy very interesting man too has a very interesting career in life and he unfortunately had real problems with energy and and um and was just very tired all the time on Carnival a lot of all these other things improved tons of other things improved he's like I really want this I want to keep this but man I have no energy and it's been like three months and so you know trying to figure out that but you know could just be that like you we just sort of needs to give it a bit more time which I would I would expect and um that's the funny thing too know it's you maybe other people have experienced this may can put put their thoughts in in the comments but his blood sugar is perfectly normal his ketones are in a good range and yet you know he doesn't have much energy which is strange then you eat carbohydrates you eat other things and you start having energy again your blood sugar is still in the same level you a little higher at least for a spike but he has CS he has details and he's feeling a bit a bit off which is funny you know it's it's strange that that would happen because that doesn't happen for most people and you have energy available you have carbohydrates available so anyone else has experienced that and please let me know now there are other things that are involved you know vitamin being a little bit low like vitamin E Vitamin B and it could be that you're in a different sort of metabolic State those things are more or less important at the time and I certainly have people that are very tired and sick and all these things you check your p12 and it's very low uh right in the center the range for a normal B12 test for for a normal reference range that's very low and a lot of people have have serious side effects as a result that low and then they start supplementing that maybe get a B12 shot and they say just 20 minutes my look like my brain turned on again which is great you see that sometimes and so you could be things like that and that's what he experienced as well you know B12 shot he felt lot better but you know um you know just sort of goes to show you that not everybody you know hop you know is able to to sort of make that transition in the same amount of time but it should happen for everybody it should happen um eventually regardless you know because your body's just trying to trying to repair and rebuild and heal basically you just need to give it time sometimes it's harder than others but uh hopefully everyone can ge t through it always learning thank you so much for the"

        "body": "t through it always learning thank you so much for the t through it always learning thank you so much for the Super Chat just want to share this when I fall off the wagon a couple of days and E carbs that first bite of steak when I get back is like my body needs yeah that's good to hear you and and that's exactly what you are experiencing is is your body saying yes this is this is what I need and a lot of vegans and vegetarians after months or years of of not eating meat they have some fish or they have some meat and it's just like this is what I've been missing this is what my body needs your brain turns on I believe it was was it Hannah Montana um I can't remember her name at the moment but she was on Joe Rogan she said that she was like on vegan vegan gu for a long time you know obviously she's very wealthy and famous so she has dietitians and nutritionists and cooks and chefs and just making perfect diet and she was and taking all the supplements and all that sort of stuff she was miserable she had a lot of brain fog she had no energy her brain didn't work and she just felt like hell and she like Le she had fish or something like that she said your brain just turned off and so you know makes a massive difference there are a lot of nutrients that we don't even know about that are essential that only come in meat you can't get in plant and there's no pill for them there's no injection for them and so when you actually eat that your bra just go well yep that's it that's what we needed and again there are toxins there are toxins it was actually funny my mom found this book um that I'll show you guys here it's called most delicious poison the story of Nature's toxins from spices to Vices just goes into that how the spices that we say like oh well that that's that's a nice spicy taste it's a strong taste isn't it very small th goes a long way well that's because that's a toxin your body is warning you about that's why there's this big strong reaction body going don't eat this if you got a mouthful of that stuff you would spit it out all you have to do is go on YouTube and look up the cinnamon challenge and you will see you will see that cinnamon is not trying to be eaten it's not being like Oh yeah I would love to just flavor your your mocha and your cappuccino no no that stuff ises not that is a poison that is a toxin there's a lot of a body of toxins in there and so L will bit adds a bit of flavor oh okay we we grow accustomed to that we acquire taste okay that's nice I like that usually with sugar that's usually when you like these things um take a mouthful of of um of cinnamon and um try to swallow it your body will Rebel and then there are some more dramatic examples of this on YouTube they all end badly they all end badly spole this out and your body just oh no you just volcano this stuff out it's just not it's not happening and um so it's interesting so again this is not this is not new I'm not it's not my oh wow look I just discovered toxins and plants we've always known about this for thousands of years there are books written on it that have nothing to do with cornivore diet it's just talking about these things and yeah one of the one of the reviews on the back um sort of the end of it let's see here and um yeah that's it this is just how these compounds in plants are evolved to defend themselves against uh predators and um he said this exuberant poignant and mindblowing guide will transform how you think about plants and how humans use and abuse their toxins to flavor F food treat disease alter mood and more I mean obviously drugs right that's those are plant toxins those are not there to you know help you if you break your leg like oh goodness I want I 100 million years ago when you know the opiate was you know the poppy plant was uh was evolving you didn't just say gosh you know eventually there are going to be people that know how to use me you know to to heal the sick and and to dampen the pain with surgery even though that you that's not a word that exists and I don't speak English you know so um these things developed these things as as defense mechanisms and some can be used medically and some have different effects than the pl was intending um on us because we're slightly different forms of life but a lot of these a lot of these toxins are just specific to life in general or eukaryotic cells and uh in particular so these things will have reactions in US sometimes we have like caffeine oh we like that reaction fine that's we're supposed to do it's supposed to fry the brains of insects we're trying to eat that plant um same with opium you know same with cocaine same with you know oxalates all these things are are designed to protect the and that's what we we should remember and we use these things as spices and medicines and sure but we shouldn't forget that they are toxins and that's what the plant is making them for so I'll do another one here and then I'll I'll dip over to um Instagram and I'm even on Twitter today which is crazy and and see if we have some questions there vce says 31y old male 70-day carnivore cold intolerance TSH 3.8 um t48 T3 upake 31% thyroxin testosterone and a bunch of other numbers% there's 20 pre test for 93 26 um tgtp o and EST okay so I'm not I'm not really seeing the question there Vince um I guess maybe just a comment on your Bloods um you know that has to be taken into context of a clinical context but I I would just say that uh generally a TSH that high I would consider that you know that your your your brain isn't happy with the level of of thyroid hormone that's being produced and so the normal range is most countries it's like 0 you know 0.4 to to 4.5 thereabouts um that's because most people have problems and so these are the averages for the community these aren't the perfect range which is stupid it should never have been like that you should have figured out what the reference ranges are of actual good health of people in good health you know the average adult in good health be anything spectacular but just average person with no medical conditions what does that look like it's very different so the average reference RS for TSH for men and women in their mid-20s with no medical conditions is between 0.3 and 1.5 so big difference not 4.5 1.5 and in fact a TSH above two actually doubles your risk of developing thyroid cancer Okay so obviously that's not that's not a perfect range being above that and so saying that is just misunderstanding the difference between average for the community and the actual reference range of good health and we treat those um we don't distinguish between the two as doctors and I remember learning that in medical school I'm like that doesn't make any goddamn sense why the hell would we do that sure sort of forget that you know and and because that's just what you use well it's in range that's fine you need as a doctor you need as a patient to understand what the real reference ranges are and so you have to learn those pick there's no there's no database that I know of hopefully one becomes available maybe I'll have to make one where you get more of these reference ranges but a lot of these things come from studies just someone who studies you know in their life's career vitamin D and and they find that this is the optimal great so you note that down and you can treat your patients that way or with TS s prt4 and all that sort of stuff um so I would say that's a bit High um 70 days carnivore I would also say this is a snapshot in time we don't know if that's going up or going down for all your Bloods and so it's good to take uh a test at the beginning before you start then three months on or a few months on and see how you're going see if things are getting better bet they are I bet those numbers are actually better than they were previously and I bet in three months they'll be better again especially if you're sticking to red meat and water and specifically for you because your your TPL which is your Hashimoto one of your Hashimoto's antibodies is elevated if you have any antibodies uh for TG TPO then you have as motives so again the reference range say oh below a certain number is okay no if you have antibodies towards yourself and you have an autoimmune disease that's just definition in terms and so you you do have hasimoto that's what I would say from that that's what your your blood test shows that you have antibodies towards that and that's actually above the reference range um I believe and depending on your area depending on the lab certainly in our Labs that's that's above the reference range so I would say that you would improve sticking with a cornivore diet and being as close to red meat and water as possible and really just cutting everything certainly no sweeteners or any any other garbage like that cooking oils to get sugar or anything like that and just Tes again in three months you know you have to take you have to take multiple data points and see where you're going but I I would be willing to bet that if you eat that way and especially if you reduce stress and prioritize sleep get out and Sprint 31 you know hopefully you're you're in a a position that you can do that Sprint and uh you know lift weights or or do resistance training those will all improve those will all improve and just check it out sometimes you need a bit of help pharmacologically with your thyroid because thyroid hormone is important and until your body heals enough to develop or to produce this stuff um at a more at a more normal level you might need a bit of help but that that should be temporary most people with hashimotos come come off their medication as opposed to going on more when they go on a carnivore diet so that's what I would do for yourself um all right let's see um I'm just going to see there's a there's another sort of related question here on Instagram from um Brenda leer um she says good evening thank you for sharing your knowledge and for the opportunity to ask questions I've been diagnosed with haimoto and wonder if it is possible to reverse it while on a carniv so yeah that sort of ties into what we're we're talking about just now which is yes it it is it goes more slowly than other AOE diseases but um from what I've seen if you are very very pure red meat in water high fat red meat and water get your ketones up that yes your or your Hashim Motors antibodies will go down thyroid function will go up and improve and you will get better and it can take a Time Crohn's can improve in a matter of weeks and months asoto takes months and years sometimes I've seen most people resolve significantly um in in months but you know over a year certainly they get to a very very good point A lot of people are coming off medications the the problem with Hashim Modas is that it damages the thyroid and and it can permanently damage thyroid and so if you've had permanent damage and you can't um and if you can't recover fully in your thyroid function your thyroid function may never get back to a normal function you may need to be on a uh you know low dose of thyroid or if it's completely fried then you'll have to be on you know full you know full supplementation of that and that happens you know eventually if you have ashimoto long enough you know control that eventually your thyroid is just going to completely burn out and you have to be on thyroid medication forever that happens good thing is have thyroid medication so it depends on where you are you can definitely shut down the autoimmune process and it can take a while and it can take a while for your thyroid to heal but I do see I I see people with their their hashimotos antibodies in the thousands and I see that over over months just coming down remarkably and then then going down to undetectable that doesn't happen in other in other circumstances really so I think that um that you would be uh yeah you'd be very well off and hopefully you can recover enough that it uh doesn't cause too much of a problem and then you can come off Mo medication if not all some people do but it depends on how damaged your your thyroid is all right so here's a question from deboss who says hello Dr chaffy I have cancer in my duum or dadum depending on the area of the world you are in um along with an ulceration being caused by said cancer can I do Carn I have malan issues yes yes you definitely can't every everyone can uh the criteria for doing carnivore is are you human and are you included in 70% of all life on Earth all carnivores actually all life on Earth can meat you know we see deer and horses and cows and Elk eat small animals that that are unlucky enough to come around them even rabbits I saw a video with a with a deer eating a rabbit and it was not a pretty sight they don't have the right teeth for it they just sort of crushing it up and and and um taking it down as they could and like the Stag of the herd was looking over and tell you just shock like what what the hell are you doing is one of the Dos that was that was eating the bunny um animal animal protein and fat and tissue is perfectly bioavailable and you have malabsorption issues so what you need is you need bioavailable food you need very bioavailable so the more bioavailable the more you're going to absorb and the more abundant those nutrients are and the less anti-nutrients the less things that are going to impede your body ability to absorb nutrients right so you have like fic acid oxalates tannins other sorts of compounds in plants that are specifically designed to bind to nutrients and minerals and stop you from being able to absorb or utilize them once you have absorbed them then there are things like protas Inhibitors that actually block your enzymes like proteases from your pancreas to to break down protein and absorb it properly so you know carnivore is exactly what you want to do um for cancer specifically I would I would definitely recommend uh looking at um the work of Professor Thomas seed who's a who's a a very prominent cancer biologist and cancer researcher he's over at Boston College and you he believe it sure he's a 10 year professor over there he's a full Professor I believe and um and he's he's published over 150 uh peer-reviewed papers on um on cancer ketogenic metabolic therapy with cancer and doing animal models preclinical trials and and even in humans as well so uh very good resource I have a video interviewing him um Professor Thomas C S YF r i e d there's a lot to be said there it's a long video but it it's important and especially with anyone with cancer you want to throw the kitchen sink at it um any ketogenic diet is being ketosis while you're doing chemo and radiation has been shown in in two studies one in uh 2019 one in 2020 to actually sensitize your cancer cells to chemo and radiation and then protect your native cells so it actually protects you from from the chemo and radiation more should get less harm and it's more it's more effective so even if it had nothing to do with the energy Dynamics which it does because cancer cells require 400 times the amount of glucose as normal cells and so you cut off the glucose Supply you're going to limit the amount of energy available your body can run on ketones cancer cells can out mitochondria damaged and that is something that was shown by Oto warberg who was a Nobel Prize winner in medicine and he did decades of research this and um he just showed chemically because logically that these things must have damaged mitochondria and that must be a Hallmark of cancer is just this energy Dynamic and you know they sort of people tried to and something called the warberg effect where they actually require 400 times the amount of glucose and um people tried to discredit him probably funded by the pharmaceutical companies at the time pushing chemo and all that sort of junk um not that it's junk but I mean it is damaging to your body but it does save people I mean there are people that do put their cancer into remission with these with these um with these uh with the with these treatments so it's uh it is important it is helpful to people for sure um but it's also very very toxic stuff some of that stuff so and also it's product you know so it could be that you know that they're been vested interests that have sort of impeded his work I don't know but in any case he had a lot of detractors who said no no no mitochondria it's a nice Theory but the mitochondria aren't damaged you know we can see that now totally untrue we have electron microscopes we can look at the mitochondria they gutted they're completely destroyed and damaged they don't work they don't function form is function they don't have the membranes to carry off carry on these uh these chemical reactions and how are they carrying on the chemical reactions they can't obviously so yes you can definitely eat carnivore everyone can eat Carn caror and thrive on Carnivore and and be optimized by carnivore and specifically for malabsorption issues that's exactly what you want to do because it's the most bioavailable food you may still need to take supplements because if you just can't absorb enough through your food even if you have the perfect perfectly bioavailable food then you need some supplements liver generally covers it liver and other organs are even more nutrient-dense and so pasture raised eggs have something 20 times amount of folate that than factory farm B it matters what they have as well for the nutrition content so I would just get absolutely the best stuff that you possibly can and um and and add in organs as well and if you need to supplement on top of that then then please do and take take a look at the interview I did with Professor Thomas C freed and you can look at other people on my channel that have had cancer bowel cancer anastatic bowel cancer and who have have tried this and it at least for them it has worked and you can look at the the studies and the evidence yourself because there's actually quite a lot out there go od luck with that question from Andy thank you for the"

to eating fat daughter has this uh I don't know of any DNA markers but there's a lot but this is very common it's very common that people have an aversion to eating fat and I think this is this is mainly just because we've been told for the last 50 years and certainly your daughter and certainly me and people of my generation I've been told their entire life that fat is bad for them don't eat fat it makes you sick it'll make it'll give you heart disease and cancer and diabetes started with heart disease that's what I was told people may know you Dr prian the pricin diet which is B just don't eat any fat at all especially saturated fat and and said don't eat sugar don't eat process junk but so don't eat fat and then don't eat meat all that sort of stuff or if you do eat meat get very as lean ground beef as you can uh cook it up drain out all the fat boil the hell out of that strain off all the fat press it with a paper towel put it back in boil the hell out of it again skim off any remaining fat and then you can eat it yummy that sounds great and so basically if that's if you're following this diet and you're going to eat meat if that's how you're going to eat meat you're not eating that for long tastes like garbage and you're just not you're not going to deal with it use a Seventh Day Adventist people know about that I do if they don't know about that I did a video on YouTube in Rumble um about the about how our nutrition and medical guidelines are corrupt and um you know and they you know they are religiously anti-meat and they've been pushing this agenda for 140 years maybe more and and uh they own a lot of things you they own sanitarian Foods in Australia it's the largest stereo producer in Australia Dr Kelloggs who even his brother found in Kellogg cereals they were s Adventist members you know they still push this ideology that me is that why Kellog cereals wasn't to replace meat and get meat Alternatives and make nut meat and all sorts stuff sounds horrible but it uh that's that's what that's how that started and and now it's perpetu you know because now they have a vested interest they they're making just buckets of money and um and so you know that's you there are other reasons now that that they're pushing on this agenda not just a religious ideology because they say that need is evil uh Dr pran was a professor at L Melinda Medical Center which was the seven day which is the Seven Day Adventist Medical School and do a lot of peer reviewing uh as it were which is very convenient something that comes out saying C based is good they're G just g go right through and they work with very closely with people like Professor Walter Willet Harvard who's the main plant-based Guru over there and just just pushing this agenda of plant-based nonsense um even though it's completely contrary to the available evidence they they trying to um drown out the available evidence with counter evidence and counter narrative and um you know they're doing a good job but it's crap crap studies crap science and they are doctoring and fudging around with the numbers and um it's not good and so um and sort of tangent there um but back to your question about the DNA marker I don't know of any DNA markers that's going to give you an aversion to e that I do know of of a condition response because just told old fat is bad fat is bad fat is bad fat is bad and you know sort of the tie in there with all this was that you know PR was a household name when I grew up I knew who Dr pricin was and I knew the pricin died like that was one my first I don't think I've ever not known about that you know my my waking memory I've just yeah Dr P yeah don't eat fat that's bad fat will kill you that'll give you heart disease fat will give you heart attack so that was something that I've always always had and you know anytime I would eat fat I you'd always trim off the you have a little bit oh my God I can't believe I did that it would taste amazing but just she was like you know sort of fried up with a bit of salt on it when I was a kid that was incredible like I was better than candy and you smell this around the house oh my God that smells amazing what is that and you go you look at fat you're I shouldn't have that oh that's bad oh I shouldn't do that take a panful of cake and be like oh yeah whatever it's just cake and you look at that oh God oh God do so we're we're really conditioned to be very fearful of fat and I had know so many people you know my my best friend I grew up playing rugby with he he could not eat visible fat could not like he enjoyed the taste in marbled meat he could not eat visible fat he had to cut it off and then he when I started doing more of this he started coming around started introducing a little bit more a little bit more and he's like after like few months or a year he's like actually love the fat now I just can eat chunks of fat and so you can do that I I I would bet that your daughter's able to do that as well conditioned response it's not a it's not a genetic thing Animal Kingdom runs on fat 70 to 80% of of calories um in pretty much the entire animal kingdom comes from saturated fats carnivores because they eat animals or fat and go for the fat first but also herbivores that eat fiber because they break down the fiber actually the bacteria eat the fiber and they produce as a byproduct saturated fat and then the bacteria die off and they get absorbed as protein so even cow and horses and orangutans and gorillas they eat a bunch of fibrous plants but what they absorb is fat and protein so no one's gon to have an actual genetic DNA aversion that because we run on that the animal kingdom runs on F and so it's just a conditioned response you can decondition that have like just a little bit sliver of meat fat put it in with a lean piece of meat eat it together it tastes good melt butter into it so you can't see it it tastes amazing and you get more marbled sort of cuts and you just you just just slowly but surely just have a little bit more have it a little bit more and keep reminding her and keep having her remind herself that that's good for you it's not going to cause heart disease it's going to improve your health improve your life eat the damn fat and so you know that that's what you do you just uh recondition yourself okay um there's a question from Debbie King over on Instagram says can carnivore help heal someone's Vision it depends on the visual is issue like every medical issue it depends on on what's going on what's causing it however there are a lot of people reporting that they you know don't need glasses anymore which is amazing to me and so I I did ask on one of my lives If people could sort of put in the comments if they had improved their Vision what what visual issues did they have Vision issues did they have um I you know speaking to different theologists who who use this in ketogenic diets to help their patients they certainly say that macular degeneration is basically a metabolic disease and you improve the metabolism and you go on a carnivore diet or ketogenic diet and you just start eating Whole Foods real foods things that didn't come from a factory and and they improve and the vision improves and the degeneration improved so you know that's that's coming from people who treat that that illness and uh and then just a lot of people have have reported that their Vision improves which I think is pretty amazing um you know I didn't have visual impairment so I can't I can't speak for myself but still going well thankfully and a lot of people have reported that so it depends on what your visual issues are certainly not everybody who has glasses stops using their glasses but um certainly it it has helped other people and so I would I would certainly give it a try it's G to help you so many other ways as well so you know just uh ke ep going with that so Matt thank you very much for the"

        "body": "okay question from J go fast thank you so much for the okay question from J go fast thank you so much for the Super Chat uh Appo is supposed to be the new the new it's always something new they just they just run up against the wall and one after the other and they just find something else oh no no no they just can't give they just can't admit to themselves that the whole idea about cholesterol causing heart disease was stupid it was a con it was a farce and it was a fraud and it's a known fraud this is well documented it's a matter of History this is not up for debate that happened and no no but but oh but what about this all over just shut up like just stop it's just such a waste of time it was a constant beginning it's a c now but back to the question so app is supposed to be the new more accurate way to measure the risk of cardiovascular disease if you're on Carnivore and lipid particles are transporting the fats when your Appo go up maybe maybe maybe not but you know you're not you're not measuring Apple that they're talking about apple b when you damage it and you're releasing apple b because you damaged all these sort of molecules that's a problem but you have a lot of healthy molecules that have apple be on them and show up on this on this Tighter and are not causing any sort of problem or not indicative of any sort of harm right and so um it's it's just useless is absolutely useless cholesterol is not the cause of heart disease never was it never will be and so I just I just completely don't care about cholesterol for that as a biomarker it is not a good biomarker of heart disease it's not really a biomarker at all of heart disease it does not cause heart disease it can be damaged and you can have different biomarkers and different signals pretty weak signals that something else is going on in your body and damaging your cholesterol and also damaging the rest of your body which can then precipitate into cardiovascular disease but measuring cholesterol is not the best way of measure right so you have inflammation you have hyper glycemia that's causing glycation glycation fuses to LDL molecules that knocks off apple b00 and now it doesn't and that's the receptor that your liver uses to pull that in because you're transport your LDL is supposed to be transporting that from your adapost tissue to your liver that's his job and now all of a sudden you can't get there right and so now it's just your macras is sucking these things up and now you have these free Apple b100s floating around oh well look at that there's a problem there well you know there's apple b on all of these things that's just a marker on all of these all these molecules so are they on or are they off you don't know and so it's not really good good function there's a very good video discussing this by Dr Paul Mason on YouTube if you just look up Dr Paul Mason and be it um it's under five minutes and it's just sort of a clip taken from another another video it's great and so you know um whether you're on Carnivore whether you're not on Carnivore cholesterol does not cause heart disease that is what I think evidence shows and the fact is is that that the evidence against that the evidence to say that that increas cholesterol is associated there's no causitive there's no causitive studies there's no rcts there's no Interventional trials that have ever shown that cholesterol causes heart disease or increases your risk of developing heart disease but there are rcts that showed absolutely no difference and more heart attacks and strokes when you do lower LDL cholesterol so that's dumb right to say that lower LDL cholesterol or or higher ldal cholesterol absolutely is the cause of heart disease and will cause atherosclerosis and heart disease okay the only high level evidence the only high level studies show the exact opposite so it's just complete crap and the study showing an association we know we're fraudulent that's study that those have been published in pew studies all over the place jamama um and and and many other you British medical journal I believe in um New England Journal of Medicine as well but anyway you know the this is well documented well documented fact and um and we have the receipts we know these [\u00a0__\u00a0] were paid you know it was about $6,500 in their valuation about $50,000 now absolutely insane so I just I just don't care um you know Apple you know they this is this is not a good marker for heart disease again this is just this is just them desperately trying to cling to um a stupid theory that has been thoroughly deunk so I just wouldn't pay attention to it and again APPA be may go up and may go down may not change at all many peoples don't um however that's not what you're measuring you know you don't you're not just measuring applebe could be in molecules that are perfectly healthy and they're supposed to be there you don't know so watch that video by by Dr Paul Mason it's it's very good but again does not cause heart disease end of story just I just don't worry about it for that at all you know you you get glycation you get damage um you get these sdldl these small dense lipo proteins those are those are more those those have slightly stronger association with heart disease but it's still very minimal uh it's about 70% increased risk but then metabolic syndrome is 600% increased risk and type two diabetes is a th% increased risk right so this is I mean like what the hell are we worrying about right and the things that will reverse and reduce your metabolic syndrome and your type two diabetes will also reduce the amount of SD sdldl you have so yeah what are we doing it's the smoke and not the fire something else is happening and it's precipitating sdldl sdldl is not the cause of heart disease or else it would be a much stronger signal um smoking has an 11, 500% increased risk not 70% 1,500% increased risk I think per pack year right um you know smoking one pack a day for a year that's that's one pack year so if you smoke one pack a day for 20 years that's a 20 pack year history so and you do the math I believe that's the metric but anyway 11,500 per increased relative risk massive increase relative risk of developing um lung cancer if you smoke and the more you smoke you know there's a dose dependent relationship the more you smoke the more problems you get right um 70% increased relative risk compared to 11,500 per per pack year history just ridiculous that you'd say that's a causitive relationship there's barely any noise there and so I just I just think it's a bloody waste of time to look at this and I think that the less talk about this the more we just go that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] not going to waste my time on it the quicker this goes away because we're still entertaining these clowns and um you know this is this is this is a known fraud and so we should just stop talk it's like nope that's a known fraud shut up move on and um and just don't entertain it anymore and I I don't I never check clust that someone specifically asked me for it and it's like okay but then I explained to them what this is going to show um in my reading of the literature but U yeah it's just not it's just not a thing so I don't I don't consider one so we have a question from I am darit question is I have struggled with my whole life with eating like I don't like to eat now when I do I'm eating nutrient dents meat and eggs still eat like a toddler though is it okay uh to not have a huge appetite yeah look that's okay that's normal you um I would just try to eat until fatty meat stops tasting good obviously if you're just eating meat and eggs that's great it's obviously much more nutrient dents so if you're going to eat less volume that's the would do it but um you know do try to get to a point that your body just says yeah I I've had enough you don't have to be stuffed you don't have to feel like oh my God I just feel horrible you the meat sweats or anything like that you just have to get to a point where you're where the taste of it isn't that appealing and generally that's long before you feel physically full if you're eating more lean meat you can get full before you you um you get uh to the point that it doesn't taste good anymore well lean meat stops tasting good pretty quick anyway without the fat because your body wants the fat but I would just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you just try try doing that at least once a day you don't want to eat all that much or that often you don't have to the great thing about a carnivore diet is when you're eating high density nutrition you don't have to eat as much or as often and so just try at least your evening meal once a day to just keep eating until you get to a point where that meat say just says that didn't taste very good it didn't taste delicious it's just kind of like I don't really want to take another bite then stop that's perfectly fine but I would try to give your body enough enough and that's how you that's how you know that you're getting enough that for your body your body's telling you that yeah that's how mu ch come want paen Vanderpool thank you so much for the"

check so check your iodine levels if it's if it's slower than you would it want it to be supplement I don't think it's dangerous to supplement with iodine um Dr kenberry uh is um great resource he has has a ton of you know excellent videos on there one's on I he talks about basically the safety of this and you know people in Japan have taking massive amounts of iodine because because of the amount of seafood that they it has a lot of iodine in it and they I mean they have they take in higher average daily amounts of iodine than than most people taking supplements right and so it seems to be very safe so I wouldn't worry too much about taking iodine want to do it it probably is safe but I don't think it's necessary or or advisable to take any supplement unless you actually have a deficiency if you can't get every you because most of the time you'll get it from your food if you're eating a proper diet you know lack a carnivore so that's what I would do and mck thank you very much for Theo CH very generous of Dr chaffy what do you know about the root cause of Len sclerosis Lin sclerosis and do you think a strict corn diet will resolve this condition um well unfortunately that's not not my specialty so I I I couldn't tell you too much about it apart from the anecdotal reports of people that have had that and have resolved it with a cornner diet so obviously that's anecdotal those are just people's experiences but at least it's something it's not like that no one has ever like no that no one's ever heard of that I have heard of people improving that maybe someone in the comments here can say if they've if they've had that and and their experiences with that and if you've had it and it didn't respond well at the carnival I want to know that too I mean I don't want to lead people down the wrong way I want if I have a 100 people say like yeah did nothing for me um I want to know that you know I don't just want to know the the positive results I want to know all the results because I want to know what this is going to help and what it's not going to help and and and everybody else needs to know that as well so if anyone's had that and has suffer from that and has gone cornivore please tell us in the comments what your experience with that was see okay um so there's a question on Instagram from Christina Cruz why do my hands fall asleep at night um this is new since carnivore well it shouldn't it shouldn't be something on Carnivore that does that generally it's it's a positional thing you know something's being pushed on a bit sensitive um you know one thing that you can check if you're getting sort of any sort of as long as it's not a positional thing or just pressing on something and then it's just they're getting numb um that you can try just checking your B vitamins B12 ol8 iine these sorts of things a general bees and um because you can get you can get sort of peripheral neuropathies from that some people need a bit more folate um when on a carnivore diet depends on how long You' been on Carnivore as well because sometimes you have Nutri deficiencies and they just take time to come up not everybody's going to get enough folate just from muscle meat they'll need to add in liver and uh and might add in other organs as well and certainly liver to get folate so I would I would look into that but I you know I've never heard of anybody sort of having neuropathy of that nature just just by doing cornivore could be an underlying vitamin issue um but generally it's it's numbness from you your elbows on something that hits the older nerve and it's numbing up that part of your hand that's usually what it is so maybe keep an eye out for that maybe keep a symptom Journal say you know what you've been doing what you've been eating what your symptoms were what you were doing at the time and try to notice if you're maybe pressing on something um in a way that could could cause that and also you know if you're shaking your arm out does it come back or is it just no matter what you do is it stay numb for hours at a time those are different things if it if it comes back a couple minutes of standing up and shaking your arms out it's much more likely to be positional than than anything else it's vitamin deficiency or some sort of neurological issue it should be constant generally would be constant and it wouldn't wouldn't just uh happen at certain times so you know I think it's less likely but if you sort of go through the go through the motions trying to trying to troubleshoot that and you can't really find find any good answers for it you know the next thing you can do is is uh you know get get your B checked um muscle base on Instagram ask 6ot tall 165 pounds how much should I eat to gain muscle uh you just need to eat intuitively you need to eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you need to need to work out you challenge yourself physically then you are going to stimulate your body's growth if possible and Bone tissue and then you need the building blocks you need to eat enough meat you need to get enough protein and enough fat so you need to eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and that's going to be different for everyone there going to be different for everyone at every age at every height and weight description there isn't like oh one gram of this that's nonsense you'll never going to find um that's way too simplistic you're never gonna find an equation complex enough to describe the entire working of our bi biochemistry is not gonna happen and so you just need to let your body get on with it because your body does know how to run your biochemistry and your physiology so just let it so eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good do that at least twice a day work out heavily and at least ex to a high exertion level maximum exert for short burst short or anerobic activity right uh you know resistance training weightlifting sprinting excellent exercises to put on a ton of muscle as long as you're doing those exercises and working maximally and eating enough meat so just keep eating till it stop tastin g good um that one um lose thank you very much for the"

        "body": "g good um that one um lose thank you very much for the g good um that one um lose thank you very much for the Super Chat please comment on igf1 in red meat uh Walter Longo in his book for cancer says that igf-1 in red meat and animals is the main culer for cancer growth I I love long um he does a lot of good good research but um I totally disagree with that um your igf1 is a marker of your um your growth hormone and it goes to your growth hormone goes to your liver and makes igf-1 and then it does a lot of other good things so you know you have you know these growth signals and things like that and that's that's the main thing driving cancer well of course not because otherwise everyone every single human being on Earth would get cancer and they'd like to get cancer in the early Decades of their life because that's when your igf1 is highest that's when your growth hormone is highest and then you know when we're 60 70 80 and our igf1 is next to zero that's when we get cancer and so probably not a direct link to igf-1 certainly not red meat um because it's generally the people who don't eat meat that are less healthy and getting more Cancers and um at least at least from what I can see you mean you have so many people that that are vegan for eight 12 years you know like uh my friend Brett everard he had bowel cancer he had stage three bowel cancer and he was a vegan for 12 years up until that he ended up going lion diet just readed meat and water because he couldn't handle anything else it all hurt him so bad to eat anything with fiber and even pork and chicken that actually some reason flared up his stomach his intestin it hurt and so he found Professor C Creed's work and he just decided to treat this with ketogenic metabolic therapy you know declined surgery declined chemo he did you know after a month or two did three days of radiation normally it's 30 days of radiation just did those three days just to sort of get him going and reduce the pain a bit and then that's it he stopped and um and uh he only ate red meat and he put his his hell cancer into remission so no that doesn't really meet with the observable evidence um now Fred's canc did come back is very impressive form of cancer sort of genetic link his whole family gets it unfortunately a lot of people in his family get it so it's very aggressive but you know doing the same thing fasting and and red meat only he was able to and and surgery got surgery this time as well he was able to put in transission again which is amazing you know and and he's doing this by just eating red meat and fasting so no I I don't believe that um you know your body works a lot better when your igf-1 is is at a more normal level and so obviously too high is too high right you get acromegaly you get gigantism so not good you get problems with that but you you want everything in balance and so if your hormones are imbalance your igf-1 is imbalance if you're eating a bunch of red meat and your igf1 you know jumps up you know to 90 or something like that like okay you know maybe but that doesn't happen it does not happen you know people are not getting acrl and and gigantism by eating by eating red meat they're growing more they're healthier they develop better you look at the kasac Warriors dudes are monst absolute Giants and they eat a ton of meat they eat like 80 kg of meat a year I eat more than that now but I wasn't doing that when I was when I was uh growing up and developing so I'm 63 240 uh these guys are like pushing seven feet tall I mean just just absolute brutes and that's how humans are supposed to be you know so that that's that's how big you're supposed to be I'm a large man I would be average I would actually be probably short I would definitely be short in those communities but I would probably be short in in a lot of communities like the you know the Mongolians at gask Khan and and the certainly the um the big Mammoth Hunters you know back when we were just apex predators and just for thousands of generations were're only eating meat these guys were monsters so a lot of these things were like on average 6'2 some as much as six fo4 populations massive people average average right so I would have been average right so just middle of the pack a lot of other people much much taller than me and um yeah yeah so that's not what you see you see people growing normally you see people getting IG you know the amount of igf one that you get from meat I mean how much of that are you absorbing how much of that are you actually using you know I mean I put people on on a carnivore diet on a red meat only diet and uh and their igf1 will improve people that are elderly or even in the in the so-called Prime of Life they don't feel like they're in their Prime of life and they're one isn't great their other hormones aren't great their other nut aren't great so there's clear reasons why you know they have metabolic disease and and high insulin and you know you PR a cornard diet put them on a red meat water diet and they improve and all these things improve and the igf1 improve it does not go to astronomical levels it stays in physiological levels and that's what you want you want to be in physiological levels B Le thank you very much for the"

        "body": "ell done there David Barnett thank you so much for the ell done there David Barnett thank you so much for the Super Chat been zero carbs for 11.5 months weight loss stalled for three months now no Dairy but eggs and bacon thoughts lost 85 pounds 100 pounds go well first of all congratulations that's amazing you know mean what what other diet have you done that you've lost 85 in 11 months healthfully eating food that you enjoy probably you haven't most people have not experienced that have 100 pound of scho great always remember that is not the only thing that has weight muscle has weight bone has weight and when you're on a corn board that you will put on muscle you put on bone density it's about body composition how your clothes how you're feeling istion weight is really not on the on the chart there you know you've lost enough weight that you can start working out now if you are working out you will muscle the weight that you gain from muscle will offset the weight that you lose from fat so that's something you need to remember this is why a lot of carnivore Facebook groups going back 15 20 years like zero carb health and zeroing it on health they they just say don't look at the scale it's not it's not helping you and um it it can really throw you off and give you wrong information oh my God I'm not losing weight this isn't working it's working it's doing a lot of good things now zero carb do you mean carnivore zero carb zero any zero plant or or just keto and are you including you know vegetables and things like that that don't have carbohydrates if you are those can cause weight loss Cs and there are lectins in a lot of these plants that will bind to your insulin receptor five times more tightly than insulin and will also bind to leptin which is your satiety hormone and if your satiety hormone is being blocked and you're and you're getting leptin resistance is actually more difficult to lose fat not just weight and so that's what I would do if you're eating anything else except fatty meat and water get rid of it and definitely stay away from from uh you know milk and dairy and cheeses and things like that those all that eggs and bacon are fine as long as you're not you're not have a whole bunch of sugar and things like that I just I'll just get the kinds that have as little sugar as possible and no sugar there are no sugar V cures which is way to go okay so there's a question on Instagram from boj 71 strength training on Carnivore how often uh same as prior to carnivore um well look you know I mean keep doing what you were doing before see how you're feeling if you feel that you can you can continue on and get um or you can you can add to that great add to that you do still need rest days you do your body heals on rest days and when you're resting and sleeping so you need to give your body a chance to rest you will recover much quicker you will have much less inflamation much less soreness and stiffness after you work out uh especially if you just really just down the line fatty meat and water and that's it no coffee no no anything anything and and so you'll feel like well I can just do this again you can do a lot you know I mean you could you could do Sprints five days a week easily six days a week I did it you know you just don't want to push yourself so hard that you end up hurting yourself and so you're giving yourself at least sort of one day off or you know some days off in between you shouldn't be doing the same muscle group every single day I I tried that I was just like oh my god look I'm not getting sore I could just do this all the time and I did obscene amounts I was doing like 20 sets of 20 sets of dip 20 sets of squats 20 sets of deadlift 20 sets of shoulder press all these sorts of things because I could you know because my body was just recovering so immediately and as long as I get myself rest in between sets and you know you recovered my oxygen debt of lactic acid I just keep going and so it was not that was not a problem and um so yeah it's um it's pretty easy to to work out more but eventually you'll get to a point where you hurt yourself you cause an injury you cause totis things like that that's what I did eventually after several weeks of working at that stupid degree I ended up getting tendonitis in my my P and um you know but almost no one's ever gonna push themselves to that degree because it's stupid it's just a stupid amount to work out um so just work out the way you've been working out now and if you feel up to it you know start adding in extra days but just remember to work maximally when you're in there work the muscle fatigue add in sprinting hit training and then uh remember that St you need to give your body a chance to recover or else you're not going to get as much uh you know gains as you as you would have otherwise okay Matt thank you so much for the super chats very generous of you what's your opinion on electrolyte consumption supplementation aside from salt I think you you know salt to taste that's fine I don't think that most people need to take electrolytes some do when you're initially transitioning to dropping carbohydrates in general your your body can you know pee out a bit more of the electrolytes than then you may want but that that will normalize eventually you know really I see this um very very commonly people don't need to to give Electro or anything like that some oh my God you have elro you're gonna die all that sort no you don't you know I think that's a false flag people are posting in there saying oh well you go cornivore you have to take all these supplements or you die no of course you don't um that's the whole point you get off supplements and um and electroly are no difference so I I just see how you go most people don't need it most people get everything they need from the meat that they're eating if you're feeling off or you're feeling funny or you know just something's wrong you can certainly entertain take electrolytes or many different brands I'm not affiliated with any of them um but I would I would only take the ones that don't have any sweeteners and artificial um flavorings just not just avoid those at all cost it just taste a bit salty it's not a big deal and so and see how that makes you feel you know if you go on that and go like wow that actually made a huge difference great there are people to absolutely find that um I don't think you need to Salt past what tastes good I don't you need to put a bunch of salt in your water I don't think you need to force feed yourself to eat salt just taste that crap I think that's your body telling you know on certain terms cut it out don't eat this uh so don't just don't eat it but um you know eventually your body will get used to this we're designed to live on just meat 70% of all animals on Earth are designed to just meat and so you know no one's taking supplements in the wild and you shouldn't have to either so some people need it early on um you should need it long term but just just self-experiment and see if that's something that benefits you stay away from any sweetener o r artificial flavor

        "body": "yeah and Sam Matthew saying thanks much very generous yeah and Sam Matthew saying thanks much very generous Super Chat it's very kind of you do you know how the gut microbiome changes when on Carnivore versus other diets I can't find any studies because of huge huge emphasis on fiber to feed bacteria well certain bacteria everything feeds certain bacteria which bacteria you want and there's a lot of um bacteria that that are actually strongly associated with poor uh medical conditions outcomes like Ms you know so certain bacteria that are fed on carbs and and fiber and has a as an association with things like that's another ra lumor arthritis sclerosis other autoimmune diseases as well so there is that so bacteria eats everything including meat Dairy petroleum Plastics yeah they do so the thing is is that whatever you eat it's going to it's going to affect your microbiome your microbiome can actually change and 24 hours and can be very different continue to change and to change to change depending on what you eat and you know because you just have all these different sorts of factions and they all eat different things just like in any sort of natural environment and habitat this is a micro environment a microhabitat but it's absolutely still these are living organisms and they are they are still doing the same things that we would see out in the jungle so you know a lot of different herbivores and Carn and things like that they eat different things and if those resources are abundant for those things then they will Thrive and they will flourish and if they become more scarce they'll die out and something else is won't F those that environment will will flourish same with your your microbiome and so you just start cutting out carbs and sugar and and fiber and things like that and um you the bacteria will change and but they're saying oh that's going to be a negative well that's funny because the the microbiome studies that they do on Inuit when they're just eating meat some of the healthiest most diverse microbiomes that that that you can have so a lot of these things a lot of these studies you know have have a specific agenda and they associate certain things you know these are associations so you have you know like well people that are healthy they eat more fiber and and this that and the other okay well that what is their microbiome like well that must be a healthy microbiome because these people are healthy well that's healthy user bi you know people eating more fruits and vegetables because they're told that's what's healthy and so okay I want to be healthy so fruit and vegetables I'm gonna exercise I'm gonna get enough sleep I'm gonna get enough water get sunlight I'm gonna do all these things or not avoid sunlight use sun block and all that sort of stuff so something like healthy user bias can affect that and then you look at an association well these guys have this microbiome and they're healthy therefore that microbiome makes them healthy not necessarily it's just that's the microbiome they have because that's you know what they're eating is going to dictate that um and then you go to a corn diet and you get very diverse very healthy microbiomes and and ones that are associated with actually very good health outcome so you know people oh wow we wouldn't have expected that I do because you know this is how we're we're designed to live and this is how we're designed to eat and so obviously our microbiome is part of our existence have symbiotic relationship with our microbiome oral biome and when you're eating way you're supposed to you're going to support microbiome you're supposed to have it's as simple as that and sort of a proof of concept that you know if you are eating if you are eating a certain way and that actually says like wow that's an optimal microbiome maybe that's an optimal way to eat too um but that yeah and then the idea that that a you know fiber is necessary it's absolutely not necessary they say that Al it feed so bacteria and they short chain fatty acids like they do in cows and gorillas but there's very very few of them it moves too quickly for it to actually do anything real but they say oh these short fatty acids are really good for your terasz oh how how are you gonna get that otherwise heard of butter it's named that that because of the amount of berate it has so buic acid butyrate these things this is what're talking about it's like feeding the gut lining eat some butter there plenty in there your Ketone bodies most of them um do the exact same job and featur parasites and also you know there are a lot of people that don't eat fiber there are a lot of people that aren't in ketosis and don't eat fiber the majority of people are in that category they don't die of intestinal failure right the test to still work they still get nutrients now it may be that that's an optimal and preferred energy source just like ketones are our optimal preferred energy source for our brain and our heart that doesn't mean that our brain and our heart can't run on other like glucose and so so your inter terasite but it's a bit convoluted but really what you have to just look at is just like okay what do some people know people like the Inuit that are mostly eating meat or um you know hopefully they do a study right only eating meat what do that do and do that they find this very healthy and I know a lot of people anecdotally who own diet who have had exceptionally good microbiome results will be tested so I I definitely don't worry about that you know see how you go test your microbiome see what it does you always always get that objective measure and then it doesn't matter what A study says oh oh my God the study shows that you have to have fiber you'll have a horrible microbiome okay T microbiome I don't have a horrible microbiome I have good microbiome guess that stud's crap or at least doesn't apply to me because the thing is it study is just there to guide you and just give you information so you can make a decision in your life and if you know study says you if you do X you'll get y result and you do X you get Z result who cares what the study say it doesn't give you the result that it's saying and so that's not useful and it can be safely ignor absolutely Paul Graham thank you

        "body": "rcumstance Robert Troutman thank you very much for the rcumstance Robert Troutman thank you very much for the Super Chat just completed a three-day fast uh numbers remain 80 points high on average um I'm assuming it's glucose no keton throughout feeling discouraged any well that's interesting you know especially well your glucose is going to stay around 80 anyway as it should you know even when you have high ketones your your blood sugar will generally stay around that so that's good um you know over 100 is been a problem so you know no keton throughout that is interesting see I don't know how you're checking your ketones quite often people check their urine ketones those are inaccurate and so you can absolutely be in a state of ketosis and high high blood serum levels of ketones and your your urinary Ketone shows no ketones okay so you get the urinary ketones when you have such an overabundance of Ketone in your body just like we don't need this you know and you sort of lose it this is why people have been in long-term ketosis long-term ketogenic diets don't have marketly elevated uh Ketone levels the Inuit don't have markedly elevated Ketone levels when eating a meat only diet um some people say well that means they're not in kosis I mean Define ketosis I Define it as a metabolic state where you're able to make your own blood sugar glycogen ketones and and run your body with low insulin and they are certainly in that state and so it's just become more efficient at using your ketones and you don't make too much ketones your body can't use properly and and so and you and you just make what you're going to use just like your blood sugar now you're not have big strings spikes and trough you're just making the amount of blood sugar your body actually needs and uses right same thing with our keton so if that was urinary ketones uh don't don't listen to that get something that can monitor your blood Ketone levels and but also you know if you have if you have markedly elevated fast insulin and which a lot of people do it will take time for that to come down to a point in your body can start producing ketones properly so don't worry about it I've literally never checked my ketones I've checked my fasting glucose on blood test only I don't care because you're designed to eat meat and if you're eating meat and you're not eating anything else your body going to do what it's designed to do eventually your body will heal your eventually body body will get to a point where it's be able to use these things utilize them more effectively but that's what's happening I don't look at any of my numbers because I just don't care I don't look at my Ketone levels or my blood I don't care to because I'm putting in my body what I'm supposed to have and you know what my body does with that afterwards is what it's supposed to do so I'm not going to change the way I eat well my ketones aren't quite this and that and I don't care I'm eating what I'm supposed to eat my body's doing what it's supposed to do and I'm certainly not going to go back to eating another way just because like well I didn't get the result that I expected therefore I'm just going to go back and eat a bunch of things that make me feel horrible and or I I know or from my body so um that's what I would say I I would be I would be um willing to bet that probably were checking um urinary ketones maybe you can pop that in the chat what you were doing but that's generally what people see you know people get through their urinary ketones like wow they're very low or they're nonexistent I must not be in ketosis you need to check blood ketos those the only only accurate way of testing that and and otherwise I still would about it you know blood trigger is exactly where it's supposed to be and you know just go by how you feel don't don't track numbers you know it's it's not as helpful if you're diabetic then you need to keep track of these things you're taking medication taking that's important everybody else just focus on how you feel focus on do you feel good is your health improving yes okay great don't worry about the rest Damen Williams

eat safely in a day um it's you know toxic after a certain point but no it's it's an essential nutrient that you have to have and you know but yeah too much is is a problem too much of anything is a problem um and so it's it's just a matter of of understanding that I think that you dietarily you probably won't get into a position that you will get vitamin A overload unless you're taking uh supplements or you're eating just a butt load of liver there is vitamin A in liver there's a lot of it in vitamin A so you know good healthy amount if you are eating an abundance of liver if that's you know like the majority of the meat that eating you're going to get too much Li you have to think of this in the context of the animal right so you take down a water buffalo or a bison and you you know I mean the amount of thousand 2,000 pounds of meat that's on that sucker it's gonna feed you the individual for two years right that big animal right which again is a vegan AR my God some had to die one animal died in two years to give you perfect nutrition you know and yet you have to kill billions of animals to just grow crops okay so not great quadrillions of of insects which are the base of the of the food chain and now how many billions of animals are not going to ever be born or die of starvation because they weren't able to to eat those insects um you know then there's all water pollution ground pollution and St in the rainwater now people are testing I mean Jesus I mean this is just crazy you know amount of harm and destruction that Agriculture and Industrial crop farming has caused and is continuing to cause this is getting worse um so you know that aside sorry um you take down that bison you have meat for two years it's got one liver it's a big liver but it's still only one liver you've got thousands of pounds of meat got 30 pounds of liver right 20 pounds of liver whatever however big that that sucker is that animal you know that's not that's not all that much so having a small bit of liver even every day is fine I I can't tell you exact amounts because I don't know them but um but as long as you're eating intuitively keeping these things in proportion right I mostly muscle meat almost exclusively some people will need a bit more folate than B12 they just will and so those people would benefit from having a bit of liver two three times a week doesn't have to be much you know just little little amount right chicken liver pig liver cow liver sheep liver whatever lizard liver if you can get it um doesn't have to be all that much but you know it can it can help basically you know it's a a multivitamin you for for carnivores it's just the most perfect bioavailable source of of these nutrients but again it does have vitamin A it does have copper most people are shorten copper but you can get too much copper it can become a problem and so I would just keep eating things in proportion if you're eating things in proportion I I wouldn't expect you to get a vitamin A toxicity at that level it's only when you're supplementing heavily F soluble vitamins they build up in your system and so if you're taking supplements for a long time or you're eating a lot more liver than would be proportionate to that animal um I think that that's when you run into trouble with vitamin A but I do think that that's something that that people will get and you know vitamin A hypervitaminosis A having too much vitamin A suppresses your thyroid stimulating hormone for instance and so people get thyroid dysfunction they get hormonal dysfunction they get other sort of problems and they think wow this work it's not for me and and so then they start adding in sugar and carbs and all these sorts of things and um you know what happens well you know when you eat carbohydrates it increases your body's demands for certain vitamins like vitamin A and so then all of a sudden you're not in a sort of a a too high level it's now in a more normal level because you've changed your threshold on how much you need and then things are actually working better look at that that's interesting well you know there are gosh I don't even know how many people around the world now that have been doing corn War for years and years and years never get those problems but most of the time they're not the ones eating tons of liver a lot of the influencers who have gone away from that and started adding in sugar and you know things like that they're the ones that were really pushing liver and they really pushing organs and eating a ton of it themselves presumably and they're the ones who had problems you know and then I think you know one one gentleman was eating tons of liver had liver supplements and was taking roacutan which is like you know a mimic of vitamin A and it's just toxic toxic stuff that medication is just awful had problems blame the diet blame not having cars blame being in ketosis there were other things going on there that you need to eliminate before you can blame that especially because you have entire civilizations have never eaten carbohydrates generation after generation with absolutely no deleterious effects as long as you're getting protein and that and you have entire you know human existence and prehuman existence as apex predators throughout ice ages when there weren't these carbohydrates available or any carbohydrates available just meat available and populations around very recently like the Inu thetive American and the um Australian aboriginals just eating meat just eating meat up until very recently they got off their land they got their Bon herds wiped out and they forced to eat a bunch of crap and they've gotten much sicker as a result of that so um those are my two cent s on vitamin A Ramon bados thank you very much for the"

        "body": "s on vitamin A Ramon bados thank you very much for the s on vitamin A Ramon bados thank you very much for the super chat um please answer Michael's question on your social media okay where's what was Michael's question that's maybe Instagram I don't know I don't know Michael who um which sort of question unfortunately because I'm on I'm on streamyard I don't um I don't see all the comments that pop up just ones uh certain ones that s get starred or whatever I do try to look through them but unfortunately I don't know which which Michael you're you're referring to or um or which platform or what their question was if something if something like that happens um just please do you know if you like question maybe maybe put the question in there you know copy and paste it in there if you can or try to paraphrase it um I'm not really seeing there's other Michaels but um Michaels I'm seeing at the moment is doesn't have a question up or I'm not seeing a question goodness Sor I'm just trying to scroll through and see if I can find any Michael that has um asked a question here there's Michael asking how to start the diet gradually and he is chronically ill okay so that's what someone was saying Michael LED um well Michael if you can if you can post your question again in um Instagram that would be great Michael L says chronically ill internal shingles that's not fun um I don't treat that myself but you know just shingles in general you know are are amable to antivirals which I think probably a really good idea in in that case to try to get rid of those they're not fun they can give chronic pain afterwards even after the shingles are gone I have seen people improve their their chronic pain from know it's called postoptic um neuropathy on a carnivore diet and this sort of improves a lot of um neurological issues and pain issues especially and um and so you know that that's something that can possibly help chronically ill obviously if you have a lot of you chronic issues it's G to take a long time to heal and not everything can heal just by by eating better but there's precedents for this there's a book written by a lady in the late 1800s who was bedridden for years and every doctor came into town she's like please help me what can you do and they all have their tinctures and thises and thats and whatever and then they' leave and she wouldn't be any better she came across Dr salsbury's book about we should all only be eating red meat and this is really helpful from a medical perspective and she said right that's what I'm doing she was too weak to get out of bed to go to the go to the Butcher and buy meat and grind it herself which is what was done at the time make a you know Salsbury steak which ground hamburger patty without the gristle and um and so she had her her you know neighbor do it and uh after nine months she was she had enough energy to get out of bed and go down and walk into town and get her own meat other day she would do it fresh every single day and um and I recommend it and um and then after sort of a year and a bit year and a quarter she was just back to normal and that was after you a decade or so of just of literally being B down so there are a lot of problems that people can have not all of them be addressed with a corn dier Anti Diet and so it's just it's just something that uh can help and can help remove a lot of the roadblocks to health and can give your body a lot of the materials and building blocks to to rebuild can fix your hormones can fix your nutrition can fix your deficiencies um can get rid of all these other sorts of nasty things that are that are bouncing around so it's it's definitely something that I think can help you I don't know what your medical issues are so I can't say well you know yes I've seen people improve XY with that because I don't know all of your your issues but I can tell you that this is the optimal way for every sing Single human being on our feet if you are fed down and sick this is going to be the best thing that you can possibly do because it's the best nutrition around it's most bioavailable the least amount of of excess toxins and things like that if any at all if you're getting grass-fed and finished beef and lamb then you're going to have basically no toxins and your body's going to be extremely uh capable of recovering I mean there was um a young man who was in some of my carnivore groups that you know we do sort of a monthly challenge um you know so when people are interested they just need a bit extra help you know we have a it's called howu carnivore is how carnivore decom and you know we have just you know for a month we just follow people we have chats we have resources we have weekly calls like this where people can ask their questions and help get a bit more one-on-one help and uh one gentleman man was vegan for several years and his health was getting worse we said okay well I'll up it up a notch I'll go just raw food only and then okay my health is getting worse okay I'll just just raw fruitarian that's all I'm gonna do because they get he just sold this lie that this is the healthiest way to eat it's just insane and so he was getting more and more sick and eventually he was bedridden he had such neurological dysfunction that he couldn't get out of bed and um and he was still thinking that he was doing the healthiest diet ever and then he got to the point thing that his sort of wakeup moment was when he was trying to use his phone and his hand was so neurologically impaired that he couldn't actually use his phone couldn't text anymore couldn't swipe couldn't do anything and he just it just snapped he just went my dad's killing me and so that he just cut it out um and went like carnivore pretty much overnight and he has recovered you know he's not bedbound anymore he's a destroyed his kidneys so he's on dialysis but he's actually starting to make more urine which is amazing he's gonna be able to recover all the way and get his kidneys working to the point that he doesn't need dialysis or kidney transplant but they are getting better he's getting better his neurological function is getting better he's going to the gym he's working out he's he's his brain works again you know so he improved dramatically and so you know you can undo a lot of harm and and so I would I would hope that this improves you as well um so I would I would definitely still try that and I would definitely still do that and I would just give it time and just eat a lot of fatty meat keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good um so um and it it's just sort of Fallout thing he just said um says thanks I've eaten eggs to just starting um but very dehydrated so how do I do this diet well you need to drink enough water certainly need to drink enough water and you just need to eat enough food you need to eat enough fat fat is very important everyone just tries to trim it off oh my God we just got to get rid of it that is the best part that's the most important part I caught my mom cutting off a chunk of fat from a roast and just throwing in the trash like what are you doing you know she should know this right now but you just get in these habits that you've had of a lifetime you're just supposed to cut off fat and throw it away no don't throw it away to get every strap of fat that you can it's very important and drink enough water you lost 20 kg um I don't know the context of that but you can lose unhealthy weight water weight inflammation weight and fat you know early on especially slides off and there gets to a more stable rate of fat loss and weight loss if you're eating enough you should not lose any lean body mass so if you're losing more weight than you think you have to lose you're not eating enough and you need to you need to eat a lot more meat and fatty meat especially so high fat meat keep eating meat until it stops tasting good so if you just ate a whole steak like well that surely is enough and it was good to the last bite you're not you're not full you need to make another steak or have someone make it for you and or whatever meat eggs that you're eating and you should have leftovers after every meal you should have you should make more than you think you're going to want should try to get there try to get to the point you take a bite and go like I'm really not enjoying this I don't want to take another bite that's good you stop there never Force to eat yourself never have to eat if it's if it's if it's uncomfortable or doesn't taste good but you need to get to the point that it that it does okay and um and do that at least twice a day right you need to make sure you're getting enough nutrients and um so again so that's that's what I would do for that and then just give it time and just be patient you know there are other things that can cause problems so you need to address those too but this will at least address the nutritional side of things and that can do a lot do a lot a lot lot for people um so there's another question here in Instagram curiosity Ms says hello Dr chaffy please really important for me to find out if I can mix different types of proteins together in one meal I mean if I can eat the other eggs and dairy or dairy me the other yeah absolutely there's no issues with that and you people do react to eggs or dairy um so just avoid those if that's that's you especially with autoimmune issues but no there's no problem mixing mixing meat and dairy and eggs and things like not from a health pers pective anyway um I am Dar thank you very much for the"

        "body": "any [Music] reason uh yeah thank you very much for the any [Music] reason uh yeah thank you very much for the Super Chat thank you for your time very welcome I recently learned that men and women's fasting should be practiced differently or should women fast at all um I don't think you need to fast at all I think the main benefits you get from fasting are just not things that are bad for you and so you're just eliminating those from your diet and also you're going into a metabolic state of ketosis that is um beneficial so that's soal fasting metabolism that's metabolism you go into when you fast it's also metabolism you go into when you just F from carbs you just carbohydrates which really our primary metabolic state in in nature in the wild and for millions of years we never ate carbohydrates and so we were always in that state where we were not eating carbohydrates soal fasting State you know most animals on Earth are in that soal state carnivores because they just eating animals and just getting you know fat and and protein and then herbivores because that's again what they're breaking down fiber into protein when they're eating fibrous plants nectar and algae who knows biochemists I don't know that but the majority of herbivores eat fibrous plants and the majority of carnivores eat you know animals for the definition and so all of do not most and so fasting is is a normal thing you find in nature especially for Predators because it may be difficult to to catch prey and um and get a kill and so maybe several days or more before get a kill but that doesn't mean that that's good for you that's what you're supposed to do it just means that's a thing that your body is capable of doing and um I don't think that it's necessary because you you have the Native Americans who had would do a bu Buffalo drop and they they'd have meat for the year we have evidence of of Mammoth drops going as far back as a million years ago so we've been killing large herds of animals or portions of a herd of animals and having resources and food for a year or more because of that so um I you know so presumably they had pkin and dried meat available and at any time they wanted so they just you know didn't eat if they weren't hungry people say that that I fast because I only eat once a day usually but I'm not fasting because I'm not depriving myself purposely of nutrition I'm just not hungry if you're eating high density nutrition you don't need to eat as much as often and so I don't right but I eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and then I'm good for like 24 hours unless I'm withy weights and working out a lot then I need to eat more but as far as fasting is concerned I don't think you need to practice it differently I don't think you need to eat anything differently I don't think you need to do anything differently men and women are exactly the same species right so we're going to have the exact same dietary requirements sometimes more sometimes less sometimes you need a bit more you know certain you know higher quality nutrition especially leading up to pregnancy and during pregnancy and and breastfeeding you know there are a lot of tribes that when are getting ready to have a baby when they're pregnant they're just being fed just all the fattiest bits of me all the choice bits because that those were the nutrition is right and so your nutritional demands may change based on you know you different sort of life cycle that you're in pregnancy and so forth but that doesn't change what you need you need meat you need fat you need those nutrients and I don't think you need to change that I don't think that you know I I don't think that you know practice fasting is necessarily necessary and and I wouldn't think that you even do it differently honestly um I think you just eat meat and drink water and then just just go about your business I don't think you necessarily need to fast if your body's telling you to fast you know if like you're pregnant and you're just getting meat aversions like if you're not hungry for meat you're just not hungry just don't eat you don't have to eat anything if you're getting meat AV versions your body saying don't eat that it's telling you not to eat at all it's not telling you go eat chocolate and candy bars um you may want to eat chocolate and candy bars because they're addictive and it's a drug but that's not doesn't mean your body wants you to and um from a health perspective and so you know your body telling you don't eat don't eat fine don't eat you know eventually that will taste good that's fine so I I still think you just listen to your body if you have food available you just do that you know the Mongols they would go five days without eating then they'd eat 10 pounds of Hors meat and do it again so this is this is something that we're designed for I don't think you have to do it um in order to maintain Optimal Health I you're just EA proper diet you're going to be in the proper metabolic State and you're going to eliminate out things that are negative for your body so um that's what I would do I just not worry about fasting and I know I don't think that you need to fast differently for for men or women I'm not an expert on fasting because I don't think you need to do it if you're eating a cornivore diet if you're not eating a cornivore diet sure fasting probably a good idea basically just not eating things that are bad for you is a great idea and being in primary metabolic state that we're supposed to be in is a great idea but if you're just doing corn don't you you need to fast Nicole H thank you very much for the"

        "body": "you know go for it songs a thank you very much for the you know go for it songs a thank you very much for the Super Chat what is the best diet for severe autism help I well I think it's this one I think it's a carnivore diet there are there are um papers in the literature you know spelling out the benefits of a of any ketogenic diet with autism and so that's you know there's there a paper it's called it's basically arguing that you know ketogenic diet as a as a treatment protocol for autism and there are people using it as a treatment protocol and it helps and in a lot of people that actually alleviates it there's a professor at Harvard Professor Chris Palmer he's a professor of Psychiatry and he has been doing this with his patients and he shows that this is something that improves U mental was the ability of your brain to work basically and from a mental health standpoint um like major depression schizophrenia OCD all these major major issues that people suffer with uh they all they all seem to improve or at least can improve more so than medications and at least is a very strong tool in the Arsenal to attack these ketogenic diets this improves things and he saying the same thing with autism that ketogenic diets improve things improve the mitochondrial function of the brain and allows the brain to work uh better and especially autism is is a developmental issue and so get your mitochondria working properly while you're developing your neurons develop properly and you know you you don't have um as severe of autism and so this is caught young enough when people are their brains are still developing which keeps going um a very long time but obviously the younger you catch this the better outcomes they'll have uh their brain starts developing more normally mitochondria get better the neurons get better but even as adults people with Autism are keto carore diets and they're finding huge improvements there's a gentleman Jonathan Griffith who I on my podcast in my sky he a professional bodybuilder in England and we were talking and just sort of mentioning these sorts of things and he he you know said that he had autism and he said that a year ago before he started cornivore that he would not be able to have the conversation that we were having at that moment and I've seen that a lot I've um I've had a a friend of mine Ally Who Um Ali carnivore she's has a son with autism and she said to me that her son is a non-verbal autistic only when eating carbohydrates and when he's not eating carbohydrates he's eating carnivore just a normal kid and so he'll go over to the grandparents house they'll try to buy his love with you know candies and cookies and he'll come back and he won't speak for four days and so like my goodness you know like why would you want to do that to a child you know and so obviously Grand might want to do that and I'm sure they come around but you know people just don't understand how much of a difference in an impact can make also there's misev of the brain that can lead to autism or forms of autism that come from malnutrition not getting enough carnitine that's a major issue you don't get enough carnitine your brain doesn't develop properly the mitochondria don't work properly and you get this this problem we call autism um that was shown the University of Texas A&M that you have a cartine deficiency you can develop autism and this is why you're seeing a much higher prevalence of autism in and vegetarians because they don't get cartine in their diet right it only comes from meat and the majority of it comes in red meat which is the first thing the vegetarians will give up and so if your kids aren't able to make really any carnitine then even some meat products it's just not going to be enough they going to suffer for and then vegans obviously cut out all animal products because been told that this is the right thing to do and they they believe it and um and we can't blame them for being misled you know we blame them for their actions on others but you just you know buying into something because someone was very convincing is uh you that that can happen to anybody you know and so they can they can really damage their kids because they're not getting any carnitine and so even if they have a mild deficiency of carnitine or the ability to make carnitine which 30% of people do have only 70% of people make enough carnitine and actually more carnitine is beneficial so you know a third of the population needs carnitine from their diet has to have it right and some need more than others so that's what I would do best diet for severe autism is the best diet for human beings in general which is a high fat carnivore diet and excluding everything else it's not just enough eat more meat that's a good first step you have to get rid of all these other things that cause harm and cause disruption to our normal metabolism our normal energy Dynamics so you need ketones in your brain to grow your brain you need your insulin low so that your mitochondria can turn over and be healthy you can go and your cells can turn over be healthy and go through autophagy that is necessary and so you're not doing that and you're EA carbohydrates sugar you're goin g to get Alex Wentworth wood thank you so much for the"

        "body": "g to get Alex Wentworth wood thank you so much for the g to get Alex Wentworth wood thank you so much for the Super Chat it's very generous of you I've been carnivore for three years changed my life lost seven Stone and endless benefits my sister is pregnant how can I convince her to stop eating crap um well you know just being that example just pointing out just say hey look you know I've been doing this for three years I'm very healthy you have entire population is like the Inuit Messi Native American million Native Americans in North America before some sort of plague wiped them out in the early 1600s and um native Australians I mean these people are extraordinarily healthy when eating their their meat only diet or meat nearly meat only diet and uh they had babies right and they very healthy babies they had babies that grew up to be on average 6'4 they had CAC Warriors that are eating tons of meat they have babies and they have babies that grow up to be 6'8 6' n 7 foot tall big old beefy Warriors that go and do battle with mus oxes you know bring back meat for the tribe so you know just point these things out and and um you can p out the benefits you cut out things your body is finds harmful for your body finds harmful for the baby then you don't have to projectile vomit every single day because you know you vomiting being sick all day is largely because your body saying that's poison what you just ate was poison this is bad baby get all this crap out it's like alcohol poison you're like no this has to go your body gonna be much more sensitive to that when you're pregnant so if you want less of that if you don't want as much morning sickness or as heavy vomiting then then don't eat things that are that are going to your body G to find harmful it's gonna be better for your baby it's gonna be better for you if no one if nothing else is better for the baby and so you know there are you know just on the autism note there are studies that show that women with higher saturated fat intake and higher LDL cholesterol levels during pregnancy have lower rates of children with autism and that women who eat a lot more red meat preconception and during pregnancy you ostensively people are extending that into pregnancy but the study only specifically looked at preconception diet that they're eating a lot more red meat that this also lowered their risk of developing autism of their kids developing autism women who breastfed versus bottle fed lower rate of children with autism so this is this is eminently um uh affected by our di or health our development of course it is you know vegans and vegetarians kids have lower bone density shorter stature they don't grow as tall they have worse teeth they have worse bone structure and density right you look at you go to my YouTube or sorry my Instagram page at the top it's Pinn there it's amazing it's a it's a page taken out of of a textbook from Cambridge University that um that is like from a textbook on like pale anthropology and it shows I if you guys can see this like that so it just shows these two um these two skeletons it's pre- Agriculture and post- Agriculture and there's all these massive differences in their structure form and health that that you see directly after Agriculture and and it says here I'll read it out to you guys it says when populations around the globe started turning to agriculture around 10,000 years ago regardless of their location and regardless of the type of crop a similar Trend occurred the height and health of the people declined skeletal analysis suggests that these Neolithic peoples experien greater physiological physiological stress due to undernutrition and infectious dis disease right so they were shorter they're on average 5 inches shorter they had smaller Jaws narrower jaws with crooked crushed in teeth um couldn't grow properly weren't getting their wisdom teeth in getting more cavities you don't want you don't want to pay for braces pay for me now that's the trip and they were taller they had they had um less signs of of poor wound healing and infectious disease and all these other sorts of things and this is something that happened every single time every single location all around the world happened 100 years ago when we wiped out the Bison the Native Americans uh couldn't get their their primary uh food sores during that time there's a study in 2001 that showed that the pl Americans were just e bison were the tallest human beings on earth now they are not okay so there you saw that clear decline in the height and the health of the Native Americans that that has has plummeted their health is much much worse than the average American that's because they're not as adapted to Pro to plant Foods as uh people of European descent and so you know it's all adds together to show that this is not the optimal way for us to live this is certainly not the optimal way for a child to develop if you want the biggest strongest brain and body that you can have for your child then you need to give it the best nutrition you can get and that's what would that's what I would say Dr uh Geo KERO thank you very much for the for the"
