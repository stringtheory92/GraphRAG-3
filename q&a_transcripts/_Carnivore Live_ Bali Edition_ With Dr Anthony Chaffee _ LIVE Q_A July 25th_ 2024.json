    "transcript": "all right hello everyone and uh welcome to my YouTube live for July 26th in Bali 25th in America uh so I just having a bit of technical difficulties with the internet here so apologies if there's if it's a bit choppy uh hopefully it uh goes pretty smoothly but it just difficult to connect so um thanks everybody for coming on it's great to be back doing these regular ly hopefully people enjoyed the one from two days ago um want to also thank uh my friend Chris brandlin who goes by the cornivore lawyer who uh helps uh people in the carnivore Community with different sort of legal issues and has been helping me uh to uh copyright protect my podcast so that people um are you know use them for what they're intended and and don't uh steal them for profit and uh so thank you very much for Chris and if you want to go get in touch with him just go to um Brandon law.com there should be a description or um a link for that in the description as well all right so I have about an hour today everyone and I'll try to get through as many questions as possible obviously I have to prioritize the super chats first but um try to answer other questions as well um and we'll see how many we can get to so first question is from uh Beth broker good to see you again Beth hi Dr C lying for four months only beef and water would love to try eggs and butter but worry about the carbs and effect on insulin what I have to fast do to higher insulin I want to do uh the ideal well no I don't I don't think you need to uh fast or anything like that just see how they affect you there's not all that all that many carbs in in eggs or butter butter has most of those carbohydrates taken out and so that should be fine and if you feel I I would add in one thing at a time so you add in butter if that's fine and you're doing well you know for a few weeks then add in eggs if eggs are doing fine and uh there's no issue there then you you you can you can keep using the butter and eggs so add things in one at a time give it a couple weeks at least to see how it affects you uh during that time and then you know if it's if it's bothering you you take it out and then you add back the other one after a bit of a wash out period and so that's pretty much it so I know I wouldn't I don't think you need to fast or do anything special with butter and eggs it's just if um if you do well with butter and eggs then then use them and that's great um distinguished gentlemen thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr C big fan by the way well thank you very much I appreciate that uh my wife has recently been diagnosed with Graves disease hyperthyroidism from an enlarged thyroid can the carnivore way of eating help cure or repair this autoimmune disease well first of all I'm very sorry to hear that um it's a you know it's obviously a very difficult situation to be in but yes absolutely there are so many people with Graves disease specifically that have improved on a carnivore diet I've never seen an autoimmune issue not respond very well to a carnivore diet they may exist but I haven't seen one yet uh from what I can tell autoimmune diseases are just your body reacting to these negative plant toxins and your and and you make antibodies towards them and then you get cross reaction with your own tissue and and that can manifest in many different ways just such as Graves disease or the opposite sort of uh issue is is Hashimoto which instead of exciting your thyroid IT depresses and damages and destroys your thyroid so either way same same treatment works you get rid of all those plants and all that garbage processed foods obviously but plants period and you stop making antibodies and we can actually track these antibodies especially with things like Graves and Hashimoto and you get a number you say hey here's your antibodies and then you go on a lion diet you really need to be strict red meat and water even pork chicken farmed fish uh especially uh eggs dairy for sure you should avoid or she should avoid and um because they're being fed things that that they're not supposed to eat so some of those plant toxins can get into the meat and that can get into her whereas the ruminant animals even with they're eating grain they ferment that first before they absorb it so there's there's much less of that that's you know my guess anyway and so that is what we observe we observe that people that are eating more red meat you know uh beef and water beef lamb and water goat venison Yak those sorts of things the ruminant animals that th that that people do best on those and so you know give those a try um and when you do that those antibodies go down down down down down uh it it can take a long time Graves and and room and Hashimoto especially they can take a while so just be very very strict very high fat meat and water improve sleep improve stress levels as well because those can all negatively affect autoimmune issues also so you have to optimize your whole life starting with the diet but yes many many people have improved Graves disease specifically so it's well worth a try and and it's going to help help her in a thousand other ways anyway so you know even if it didn't help with her Graves disease it would help with those other things but it it almost certainly will help with the graves disease I haven't really come across anyone who uh hasn't helped with anyway Ellie thank you very much for the Super Chat uh hi I get tight and Bloated feeling an hour or two after eating and it lasts for a long time I don't drink water within a couple hours of meals I eat only beef until it stops tasting good thank you very much H well you know it it could be that you just need to that your body wants these nutrients and so it's saying yes eat more but you're just not used to eating as much and so you could try eating splitting up your meal you know two a couple times a day try eating a smaller meal during the day and then later on later that night you might eat uh another meal and that might be enough for your body but not so much that you feel that there's a lot you know a lot in your in your stomach that you're you're having to contend with um that you know if that if that tight bloated feeling isn't all that much of a concern then probably don't worry about it if it's if it is causing a lot of problem then probably try splitting those those meals up um it sounds like your body wants these nutrients but it may just be that you're you're sort of at physical capacity so you eating more you know twice a day or or more often than you are if you're already eating twice a day might be a good way of doing that increase the fat as well because that's much more satiating and if you're eating very high fat uh you tend to eat less because you don't need as much because your body tracks nutrients it doesn't track calories but that also has good calories in it but it's it's the nutrients and the fat that your body wants you have receptors in your stomach that track up to your brain via your Vegas nerve that actually look at different nutrients and macro micronutrients and it says okay well we have have enough we can stop now and that's when your body tells you to stop eating however if you're getting a lot of lean meat but you're not getting as much fat your body is still going to say hey actually we there still some stuff we need so it's going to keep telling you to keep eating that to try to get more of that those fat nutrients and so on or or vice versa but uh it's typically typically more satiating uh when you eat more fattier meat most people aren't necessarily eating as much f um as they need because they just are so used to not eating as much fat when they they do start eating fat it's it's like they're eating twice as much three times as much fat as they normally are used to and they're like well surely this has to be enough fat because I'm eating so much fat compared to what I was doing but it may not be enough for you so keep that in mind try to aim from one to two grams of fat for every one gram of protein and see how you go and and split it up into more meals during the day if you have to so you don't get so quite so stuffed another question from Ellie probably the same Ellie we don't know let's let's assume it is thank you very much Ellie again for the Super Chat is 70% fat bare minimum or can it vary by person it does vary by person so that one to two grams of fat that I mentioned is about that range so one gram of fat to one gram of protein is 70% calories from fat if you're only eating fat and and protein and then two to one fat to protein is 80% Calum fat so that's the range you just aim for it maybe maybe that you need more maybe that you need that you need less but you just listen to your body and you see also you check with with your stools you know so if your if your stools are dry and hard and constipated then by definition you're not eating enough fat and and I you know I see people you know even even yesterday I got a a message from someone saying well I'm eating a lot of fat but I'm still having dry hard constipated stools and so um you're not eating enough though it's it's more than you've ever eaten before and it feels like a lot for you and and it is compared to what you were doing but it's it's not enough for your body your body has a limited capacity to absorb fat and after that it goes out and that excess that goes out is going to keep your stool soft and uh before that it's going to get all absorbed and your stools are going to be dry and hard so if there drying hard that means that maybe you're getting exactly the right amount of fat and and no spill over but it's unlikely so if you're if you're getting soft stools that means you're you know you're you're absorbing fat to your body's capacity and then there's a little spill over so you at least know that you've satisfied your body's desire to to absorb fat so that's what you try to do you eat enough fat that you don't get constipated and if you're only eating meat and water because the thing is is if you're if you are if you are drinking coffee still a lot of people do still drink coffee even when they go carnivore uh coffee tea artificial sweeteners usually in the coffee or the tea uh magnesium supplements and medications such as metformin these sorts of things can all cause loose stools and people say well I'm drinking the same amount of coffee that I was before right but you're not eating fiber anymore and fiber slows things down causes physical obstructions and just slow moving and so actually that coffee is probably great idea to try to keep that stuff moving and um but you don't need it now and so there's no fiber there now there's no fiber all this stuff is just liquefied and you're just just shooting through liquid instead of all this big bulky physical blockages that uh fiber causes so it causes much more loose stools and so you know something to think about anyway but if you're not having any of those things and you're only eating fatty meat then um you can you can adjust that with the fat you're eating but especially when you're drinking coffee or anything else if you're getting dry hard stools You Are by definition not eating enough fat and if you're getting dry hard stools and you're drinking coffee and that's a bit of a laxative you are really not eating enough fat so just keep that in mind tulip ohare thank you very much for the Super Chat how do you feel about coffee enimas I don't feel anything about coffee animal I've never done a coffee animal and I I don't plan on it um I haven't gone into any any research for that I do know that um you know some people like my friend Dr Andrew Kaufman uh thinks they're a good idea for certain circumstances but I haven't really gone into them uh myself you know I I think that the vast majority of issues get fixed just by fixing your diet fixing your lifestyle exercising getting out in the sun fixing your chadian Rhythm um and uh you know optimizing your sleep optimizing your stress working on your family relationships or social relationships and connections and all those sorts of things that's going to take care of the vast majority of things now there may be certain circumstances where coffee animos could be beneficial on top of that U but I don't um I don't know I haven't really looked into it myself but um it's not something that I've I've you know felt that I had a a problem that needed resolving and so I haven't sort of looked for Solutions but it's probably something that um I I will I would be interested in going to look at the arguments because this is something that has been used and argued for for quite some time and people have done experiments on these sorts of things so under certain circumstances you know it might be helpful just like any other medical intervention but like every other medical intervention if you don't have the medical issue for which that intervention treats then you obviously don't need the intervention you know it's like saying how do I feel about gallbladder surgery it's like well if you need gallbladder surgery then you know probably a good idea but uh if you don't then then you don't want it so that's the same sort of thing like I I don't certainly don't think from an evolutionary point of view or even a creationist point of view that you know we we were designed to be optimized by coffee animos because they didn't exist in nature and so that's fine but if it and medical interventions didn't exist in nature either so it's it's something some these medical interventions are things that we've discovered that can help under certain circumstance ances but just for just normal Optimal Health probably don't need it if there's a specific medical issue that that it can help with sure um I don't know what those are though so it just depends on if you have those problems for which it can help but it's not something I've really looked all that much into or at all into actually uh swall NZ thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr C uh since starting carnivore I get restless legs most nights uh when I get into bed used to used to get restless legs very infrequently before please help oh that's very interesting you know there there are quite a lot of people you know my my girlfriend L included that have actually resolved their restless legs and they had it for years and just AB bugged the hell out of them um uh and then they went carnivore and and it just went away one things I I've noticed um is that the the the rare times I have gotten restless legs it's usually when I have just been out of the gym or not playing rugby or not being Physically Active for a very long time this there's no data behind this this is just my own personal experiences but I've noticed that just my legs are just they just want to do something they're like hell you know you're lazy ass let's go you know and so my my legs are just basically chomping at the bit to go and do something active you know when I start running and sprinting and working out goes away um that's just me you know I'm sure there are other I'm sure there are many causes of of restless leg syndrome if you're doing carnivore and you're just you know eating meat and drinking water and getting enough fat things like that I I don't know how long you've been doing it so sort of since starting so I don't know if you just started sometimes when people start early on it can be you can get a bit of an electrolyte imbalance you need to add more salt things like that uh most people don't have to do that long term you know some people do I know my friend Dave Felman has to use quite a lot of salt every day it's like seven grams like five to seven grams something like that he adds like every day so or else he just doesn't feel as good and uh and so yeah that's unfortunate I don't use any salt now you know so that's like you know the other side of it so it's um it it's just try to you know try to sort of optimize all these other sorts of things you know if you're especially if you're sort of you know standing up out of a chair and getting a bit lightheaded or dizzy that could mean that your blood pressure dropping a little low because you're not retaining as much water because you're peeing out electrolytes and water's going with it and so you maybe add a bit more electrolytes add more water try exercising doing body weight squats try to Sprint if you can that's a fantastic exercise probably the best full body exercise uh that you can do we were doing some yesterday actually we I probably should have filmed that that's missed opportunity we did um like a big leg workout circuit here at the B Time Chamber with uh group of the other guys that are here and um did like this big leg circuit and then it's like this big we're up with the mountains big up hill up to the leading up to um you know the place we're staying and so I said all right well let's just you know let's end this off and just try to kill ourselves by sprinting up the hill until we die and we're like racing so like one person would go like you know I would start and then someone would go two seconds behind me and then two seconds behind them and two seconds behind them you try to catch the person in front of you and then mix it around chase after people and so uh we really absolutely crushed it and killed ourselves so great workout uh you know you know really really good strong leg workout um and sprinting Hill sprinting things like that I I I I'm I'm yeah I don't I'm sorry I don't have better advice for you most people actually find that youus legs get better so you know maybe there's something you know just that you could you could tweak and fine tune to get things a little better for you on your your diet um and you can try exercising for me that that really helped every time I got I would get little weird restless legs it was when I hadn't been exercis exercising as much and I I always took it as my body just telling me uh to get more active that so see see how you with that see if that helps all right okay okay what do you say to people that claim red meat is carcinogenic and the science says plant-based diet low risk of CPT uh I say that there is absolutely no science that says that either of those things um you there are no studies extent in the literature to uh to quote my friend b k that show that red meat is carcinogenic and there's no literature extent in the L there's no there's no studies extent in the literature that show that plants uh are have a cause and effect relationship with lowering cardiovascular disease this is all associative epidemiological garbage and the red meat causes cancer thing is Extreme garbage like the worst of the worst with massive confounding Factor they call Pizza and fast food meat and that's obviously not the case um and uh so it's um it's uh well so it's it's a bit of a fraud and so you know you get these studies that are just you know weak epidemiological studies they they ask somebody you know take this survey tell me what you ate in the last two years that's that's an actual thing that they ask people remember meal you've had for two years and um and then look at other sorts of things oh look at this there's an 18% increase rate in the people that said they ate more pizza and fast food and and lasagna and things like that and uh so obviously meat it's meat then it's like screw off um the University of Washington in Seattle did publish a massive paper a systematic review looking at hundreds literally over 800 studies on the subject and they found the ones that had that weak bear association between uh not really meat and cancer were in their words junk studies and lazy science and that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of much higher quality studies and much better design studies without these confounding factors and nonsensical conclusions and associations with pizza and fast food and not not correcting for smoking and drinking and things like that that they found no association between even processed meat and cancer but certainly not unprocessed red meat and cancer and um the science does not say that plant-based diets lower uh cardiovascular disease risk they show that a healthy user bias of people that are following a more healthy diet in their mind can have a lower association with uh cardiovascular disease but that's not the same thing um so you know when they say that just say okay okay show me show me the show me the study that shows a cause and effect relationship between either of those things they don't exist and so you don't have to prove the negative you know they made the assertion they have to back it up so oh but red meat causes cancer does it where's the evidence for that oh everyone knows that that's not evidence oh well look at this study and is it that's not a cause and effect that's not a randomized control trial you can't you can't make a cause and effect you can't make a cause and effect statement from an epidemiological study you know so no try again and and just don't accept uh inferior data just don't you know they made they've made an assertion they've got to back it up and um oh but plants lower this how why where's the study that show that no that's an association there are a lot of other things in there you know there was um some of these these people have uh you know sent me these things oh but look at all these studies and meta analysis but you look in the meta analysis and because the meta analysis is only as good as the studies that are used in The Meta analysis and you look through and it's just these survey studies uh they're not part randomized control trials right oh but it's a metaanalysis oh wow it's a you know junk in junk out you have garbage studies in your meta analysis it's garbage meta analysis that's all there is to it so you know they you know do this like Lane Norton tried to do this a whole thing on him he tried to he tried to make this claim that um that uh you know that that that exact thing that these plant toxins actually you know lowered you know cancer risk and CBD risk and there was a study out of uh and one of the studies in that meta analysis um that he used they were all they were all epidemiological by the way none of them were randomized control trials except the one the one that was randomized control trial of using ice packs versus Frozen uh cabbage for um for mastis p and like cooling ice pack sort of thing I was like what in God's name does that have to do with cancer or cardiovascular disease I mean good Lord and um oh but it's randomized control trial of nothing you know so um but yeah so I went through these and I was just like I was like all right I went through the the U the studies used in the metaanalysis and one of them was from Costa Rica and they looked at you know a few thousand patients that have survived a heart attack and they looked at a a lot of different things but one of the more one of the things they looked at was how many you know fruits and vegetables and things like that they ate now if you're eating more fruits and vegetables and you're told that that's healthy it's called healthy user bias you're more likely to do other other things that that could be healthy like exercise like not smoke not drink not eat sugar not eat processed food you're eating whole plants you're not eating junk uh processed garbage processed plants really and uh you know so all these things um have an effect and so uh it was saying that and and and it concluded that oh look at this yeah eating more plants is is is better for uh protecting you from cardiovascular disease okay so you look at it and they found that yes there were different groups some had less uh plants in their diet some had more and uh whole plants and they people can find this you know my my thing on lane nort on my channel I go into more detail with it and show the studies and things and um but uh in those different groups the one that ate the most plants um had had lower you know they were they were out of all the people that had survived the heart attack they were sort of the lowest amounts okay so they had less heart attacks so first of all less they had less people survive the heart attacks because they don't tell you how many died because you can't give a survey to a dead person so they don't they don't know uh so that's a problem as well but of the people survived there were less people in that um plant group now there were people eating plants that were getting heart attacks though and the most important part of this though was that you look at the other factors the people that were in that group that were eating more plants they also had lower rates of diabetes ate far less sugar didn't smoke as much didn't drink as much ate on average 800 less calories a day than uh the than the lower U cortile that were that were're eating plants and um you know so all of these things add up and so just saying oh eating plants makes it better yeah you can't say that actually and in fact their own study showed that it wasn't that because there were certain plant toxins you know which we know are toxins because our bodies treat them as toxins by trying to detoxify them and people say oh no no but these toxins are really good like your body just doesn't know what it's had doesn't know what it's missing it's just it really should just have all this poison in its body all the time and you know you're just trying to get rid of it and it's obviously nature just you know screwed up and just has no clue this you know with a degree in in nutrition which is about as good as a degree in gender studies uh is uh is it knows more than you know God in nature and so um so they looked at that and they said that they looked at people that had a genetic difference in how to uh detoxify these things and so if they had an INE efficient enzyme to detoxify these specific plant toxins that um that they would have higher levels in their body and it would take longer to clear these out so they'd have a higher like if you're taking medication you just have a higher dose all the time and so they said oh okay so what did that do well it turns out that the people that had the inefficient enzym so they had higher levels of these plant toxins it was harder for the body to clear it they had more heart attacks right so so no uh plants don't protect you from heart disease um and uh or cancer or any of these other sorts of things and they've never proven any of that stuff one way or the other there are no cause and effect studies or relationships at all so when they make a statement like that uh tell them to back it up and then don't take garbage studies uh uh as an answer and don't just take a headline because that's what these headlines in the in the study said oh look plants lower CBD RIS no it doesn't your own data says it doesn't from Joshua um mininger good to see you Joshua hi Dr shy just started carnivore two and a half months ago and loving it uh question lots of body issues since I was young I'm 45 now but have 65y old body uh beef butter bacon and eggs or lion well you know whatever works for you eat the eat the meat that you like like that you enjoy it makes you feel the best I think that that line diet just fatty red meat is going to be objectively better for a lot of reasons and so if you want to just go absolutely optimal and feel your best I think that's the best way to go make sure you're getting enough fat uh add in a bit of liver every now then if you can't get grass finished beef and uh and see how you go check your nutrients check your vitamins check all those sorts of things make sure you don't have malabsorption issues all that sort of stuff just to make sure that you're optimal almost everybody will be just by eating you know skeletal muscle meat some people have malabsorption issues or the meat that they're eating isn't as good quality as others and so maybe they just need a bit more maybe have MTHFR G mutation you just need a little more B12 and folate and if that's the case liver sorts it out um so yeah so check that out and see how you go and hopefully your body can recover from quite a lot of that stuff and and you'll just feel better and better as you go so good luck with that [Music] okay um there question from Gunther SB thank you very much for the Super Chat for people new to carnivore who are only salting to taste how would they know if they need more sodium also if you do add more sodium how would they know when to go back to salting only to taste good question so typically is if is you sort of feel that that keto flu sort of thing people talk about you just don't feel good you get get up out of your chair you sort of get dizzy and laded that could be because you don't have enough electrolytes and your blood sugar is a bit lower than it should be um and so so that's what you do and you just go by feel like you know if I if I if I go to a restaurant and I went to a barbecue place in in Austin uh Terry blacks which is incredible by the way it's fantastic but my God dud they use a lot of salt and I had used salt in like two years at that point it was way too much for me and I felt rough the rest of the day and and just intensely thirsty and so I was just just just sucking down as much water as I could for the rest of the day trying to flood that out of me it sort of felt like spit like Spacey and laded it was not it was not nice and so you know if you're getting that feeling and you're you're not using much salt you know add more salt if that feels better great now you're using salt and you're not feeling your best okay start reducing it it's usually early on that people need uh more electrolytes you know it could be a few weeks could be a few months some people like uh like I mentioned Dave Feldman U he's been doing keto for years not full carnivore um but pretty pretty damn close and you know many of his meals would just be carnivore but he adds a lot of salt and uh that's how he feels his best so just go by how you feel and and and just play and experiment with it you know if you're if you're not feeling your best and you're feeling bit lightheaded and weird and you add more salt and you feel better great do that for a while and um and then if you you're few months into it and you start reducing a bit of the salt and just salt to taste and you start getting those weird symptoms again you know go back on the salt try it again in a few months but if you reduce it down you feel fine fine you know people a lot of people that come to uh a carnivore diet you know years ago uh the the convention was you don't salt at all you know that's what zero carb health and zeroing it on health those people have been doing this stuff for know 15 20 years and some of these people have doing it for 50 years plus they're like don't salt it's not it's not what you want it's um it's not ideal it can make you overeat and all these other sorts of things and I don't know all the arguments for that but uh I do know that they they they don't use it and they haven't used it for decades and um and so a lot of people starting on that just cut out salt as well and um and they do great so it's um it's uh it's individual so if you if you feel that you're just a bit off and you're feeling dizzy and lightheaded and not feeling good then I would I would add salt and see how you go see if that [Music] improves there we go big boss thank you for the Super Chat excuse me Doc I need help I've been a vegan my whole life and I think I'm now starting to turn into a tree well you are what you eat right so you know you eat asparagus you might turn into an asparagus um but um uh well I'm I'm glad that you um that you are are here and at least open-minded enough to you know to give a new way of eating uh a try and hopefully that's something that has helped you and um you know a lot of people I mean the majority the vast majority of people who follow me here on YouTube um and Instagram things like that were former vegans vegetarians and plant-based who uh their health was was suffering as a result of this and uh way of eating of the the plant-based way of eating and um they they made massive improvements in their health massive improvements in their health by by going cornivore so hopefully that that's the case with you as well and um yeah so so good luck with that and um you know thanks for thanks for joining the the the group and and saying [Music] hello okay question from savine I'm guessing that's how that's pronounced uh thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy insulin uh is it a growth hormone or a fat hormone how does it affect different organs it is grow it is it is a um an anabolic hormone so it causes growth it forces energy into cells it forces energy into fat cells as well so things can be uh cause growth of many different organs and tissue um it's not just one or the other insulin is an extremely busy hormone it affects over 100 different processes in your body and one of of those is by you know driving energy into cells but that is probably the least of what insulin does is massively important um massively important hormone so it is the fat storage hormone it also stores uh protein energy in muscles as well but again over a hundred different things it does over a 100 different things and it does store fat so without insulin you cannot store fat your fat cells cannot grow cannot period right so type 1 diabetics they could eat 50,000 calories in a day 50 million calories a day for that matter they will not put on fat they will not be able to store uh weight and fat they just waste away and waste away until they die unless they get insulin or the original treatment was ketogenic carnivore diets 100 years ago50 years ago that was the only treatment that was the only way to keep these people alive type one and type two diabetics that was the that was the only treatment until um was it Banting that figured out um um figured out uh um you know insulin and things like that and uh and was able to was able to help uh people actually replaced insulin when they when they weren't able to make it and that that changed the whole dynamic and they started go oh well now you need carbs because now you have insulin so um then you have people with insulinomas so again if you don't have insulin you can't can't store fat so lower insulin lower fat storage period it's a scale just it's just a slope and um and then um and then uh then people have like an insulinoma which is a tumor that secretes insulin and that produces massive amounts of insulin they just they just can't stop storing that energy right so they get enormously obese it doesn't matter what they eat and and they feel horrible because their metabolism is low as hell they don't have energy to actually burn and use for their brain and their body so they just feel oh miserable all the time and they're just getting fatter and fatter and fatter it doesn't matter what they do and that's because insulin is so hot so you need insulin at a correct level you have no insulin you die you have too much insulin you die so you need to have that Goldilocks level right and long before you die in either direction you're you're causing harm and your body's not working properly again over 100 different processes in your body you need insulin at the right level if it gets spiked up because of your blood sugar it's going to it's going to all of a sudden be out of balance for all of these other sorts of things right and then you start getting in some resistance and it's going up and you're always at this heighten level and you're always out of balance for all these different mechanisms in your body and then you eat and it bang it goes up even more so uh very very important to uh get that at the right level it's a I do look up uh the the actions of insulin it's it's actually remarkable how many different things uh that insulin effects it's it's absolutely wild so once you look at that and you just go like keeping that in in check don't want that uh to to go crazy um looks like uh little Ellie Melly is saying hi from the airplane she's flying over uh for a conference over in um in Brisbane so uh and she did a very generous super I don't know why she does those things it's very sweet of you but you don't have to do that we live in the same house and buy things for each buy things for the household so uh was very nice to see you Miss Ellie Melly yay Super Chat from the airplane hi is it true that some people can't tolerate butter because it causes issues for them is it really the butter or something else I used to think that Dairy caused my bad skin but I was wrong your thoughts thank you um most people do fine with butter some people um don't tolerate butter but it's it's it's so rare it it's so rare and um you know so it's just a just an individual sort of thing you know some people find that if they they add butter they might get loose stools their body doesn't doesn't absorb it as quickly and that's not really a bad reaction that's just you know it's just going through their body too quickly um but the vast majority of people can can tolerate butter Dairy is um is something that that uh other more people will have um more of an issue with can be more pro-inflammatory but butter removes out a lot of the components of of milk um that people have a lot of problems with and so it's mostly the fat left there a bit of the milk solids that Earth still there but most of it's out and so most of the problems that people have are with with uh the things have already been removed um to make butter and then I I really haven't haven't ever seen someone who had a problem with clarified butter which is ghee which gets rid of those last bits of milk solids when you sort of melt the butter and there's just sort of this sedent at the bottom and you just filter that out you take the fat off the top and you leave that sort of solid stuff at the bottom that's ghee or clarified butter and that's what you know if you're having like lobster or something like that you go to a fancy restaurant and it comes out with a dish of clarified butter that's what that is so it's just the fat it's nothing else and uh I haven't I haven't really come across anybody has a problem with that I'm sure they exist but um I haven't seen anybody that did that but yeah most people most people do great with butter and it can be a really really good addition to your diet especially especially grass-fed butter because it has a very good omega-3 to Omega 6 profile but the the specific Omega-3s and Omega sixes that you need because you don't need the plant versions so you don't just need Omega-3s you don't need Omega sixes you need DHA you need EPA um those are the Omega-3s that you need and you need uh arachadonic acid things like that you don't need ala you don't need linic acid or Alpha Lin like acid those are the the Omega-3s and sixes that exist in Plants the plant versions of things are typically things that that are no good for us like like D2 instead of D3 K1 instead of K2 um beta carotene instead of retinol which is vitamin A and ala instead of DHA or EPA it doesn't convert into DHA or EPA some studies actually show that when you when you increase ala consumption DHA goes down um and then the best of the best studies are are like a 5% conversion rate in to DHA or EPA maximum so not good enough and then linolic acid is is harmful for a lot of different reasons does convert into arachadonic acid but you can get a arachadonic acid from meat so you don't need it from linolic acid and linolic acid causes other problems as well especially if you get it in um more abundant levels than your body can deal with so uh butter is fantastic so butter has uh grass-fed butter in particular has U very good compliment of DHA and EPA and arachadonic acid and buic acid and you know ketones all these sorts of things these very very good fats that are very good for your body and brain especially for uh growing and developing uh brains and babies pregnant mothers uh breastfeeding mothers and and people as as we age we still need these fats to build and maintain our brain our brain is made out of you know 20% of our brain is made out of DHA right and uh much of the rest is made out of cholesterol so you know you need these fats and and and grass-fed butter is is an excellent source uh for all of those things okay so why don't we since we we have quite a few super chats why don't we um maybe halt halt them here and um and try to get through the rest of these and and if we have more time we can we can answer other questions as well but for for right now um we'll just sort of cap the the super chats at that um okay Holly Ruth thank you very much for the Super Chat uh Dr C I've been carnivore a year lying more than four months very strict I have trouble sleeping thirsty and dry mouth and have to drink a lot of water hence wake up to p and uh 1.5 cups of ice cream P or had 1.5 cups of ice cream the other day and I slept through um well it shouldn't shouldn't really be anything to do with with you know with the carbs um you just trying to see you have like you know like ADH like anti-diuretic hormone you know can't think of any any any mechanisms to do with you know like exogenous carbohydrates you know you know um increasing ADH production you're supposed to increase ADH as you go to sleep so that you don't uh make as much urine but um you know I I think the the the trick for these sorts of things is is drinking you know front loading the amount of water that you drink throughout the day um and just having like a lot of water early in the morning like a lot of water I tend I don't I don't just drink little bits and sips here and there like I'll I'll you know crush a whole bottle and just chug the whole thing and maybe two and uh then then go on by day so I sort of like the camel approach you know I'll just drink a ton of water and then get on with my life just like I'll eat a ton of meat and get on with my life and I won't be like just eating and snacking throughout the day I won't be sipping and drinking water throughout the day I'll eat it eat a lot in one go I'll drink a lot in one go and just camel up and and get on with things um that is uh you know typically the you know the way to approach this is that you know you don't want to drink as much water before bedtime and so do try to just you know if you're still thirsty at the end of the day that means that you're not drinking enough water earlier in the day and so you you know you should be able to uh get enough water early in the day that you're you're not horribly thirsty later in the evening and not having to to wake up and drink tons of water before you go to bed um you know and and if there's some sort of effect with you you spike your insulin spike your blood sugar and that you know one of the many things that insulin does you know could be something to do with ADH uh I don't I don't know if it is one way or the other but you if there's some sort of mechanism there for me it still wouldn't really be worth it because of all the other deleterious effects that it would have that that that that brings along with it um so I would try to you know adjust things so that you didn't have to use that stuff uh to to make it through the night because it's uh you know it's going to be uh more harmful in the long run as well so good luck with that just try to frontload the water earlier in the day and do the best you can all right thank you Shane for the Super Chat it's very kind of you uh Shane says each day I blend 12 eggs right from the refrigerator and drink them raw call me crazy but it tastes like a milkshake uh used to before I went carnivore can you speak to the risk and benefits of doing this so you know you it the the the argument is that that you know if there's salm Manilla contamination or something like that that you know the raw eggs can uh can be a problem um salmonella shouldn't be in the egg you know if you if you pop an egg out it's all cloudy and weird and has an off smell toss it do not drink that thing um but um you know you can look for these little spider vein crap or something like that even if it's not like a big crack through it but it's definitely if it's crack don't eat it because you know bacteria can get in and things like that um but if there's sort of these little spidery cracks on it like I wouldn't I wouldn't drink those so I I've drank raw eggs you know Rocky did it there's a lot of people that do it um back in the day the old school bodybuilders would have raw eggs and things like that or cooked eggs but some would do raw and uh but that's the risk you know if you know there's a potential for you know cell Manila things like that but typically if it's not cracked even those like the little tiny crack that's hard to see then uh it's a lower risk but it is a risk so I you know I can't tell you yes there's absolutely no problem you never have an issue because you could but it's very unlikely and if you're careful about it and you make sure you don't have cracked eggs or things that are like visibly soiled and dirty and things like that that like you know some it's it's funny you know people think that if like if there's like chicken  and feather stuck to it that it's like it's even more fresh know it's just disgusting and dirty um my dad knew uh a farmer and uh his basically his his um uh when he was a kid basically they had some like extra eggs and things like that so they just sort of on the side of the road um selling eggs just farm fresh eggs you know laid that day and people were coming by and they're oh this is great really like him really like them and they're like wow this is actually doing well okay great and so they started doing more and more and then they started saying okay well there's there's some money in this so they started doing a little little more care and washing the eggs and getting more prepared and better presented and things like that and sales tanked you know they started talking to people and they were like oh yeah and the thing was is they thought that like because it had little scraps of you know dung and and Feathers stuck to it they thought oh that's that's really fresh no that's just a normal story that's not that's not not as fresh and um and it was just like okay you know if you want us to do less work and just leave these things disgusting filthy fine and the sales went back up again so um you know don't get those eggs you don't want those eggs um if it's if it's just clean that doesn't mean that it's not fresh it just means that someone took the time to wash it which is not a bad thing so I've drank raw eggs I've drank you know a dozen at a time typically um I think it just tastes like uh cold scrambled eggs you know it's fine there's no problem with it and uh for me if I'm you know back you know from work or I'm back from the gym but I have to run out again if I'm going call and all that sort of stuff just like all well I'm not going to I'm going back in to see these patients I'm going to be in surgery okay I'm probably not going to get home tonight um great I'll just crack 12 eggs in a cup mix them all up you don't want the big clobs um you just you blend them up or whisk them up with a fork and and I just drank it you know and I've done that you know multiple times um you know if you're not drinking tons of water and your stomach acid is nice and concentrated you know you you likely will kill what whatever bacteria is in there we're designed for that but that is the risk and if you get cell Manila and you start getting bloody diarrhea that's a very serious infection so that's that's the risk um if you're careful about it I think it's is definitely going to reduce your risk but that is the risk and so that's just something to know about okay so question from rub rub HF thank you very or oh sorry that think that's the currency uh Rubik thank you very much for the Super Chat how long do I have to eat uh just fresh meat and eliminate everything else to completely stop being intolerant to histamines eggs and dairy uh can I cure F food sensitivities and cook creatively again potentially uh some people just can't some people just are going to be full on intolerant to these sorts of things but if you're if you're having intolerance because of leaky gut things like that and so things are slipping in through your gut uh more than they should uh that leaky gut uh can take anywhere from you know 6 months to a year to heal if you're doing like a full online diet just just fatty red meat and water um but and there's there's certain ways to track that but um usually best to just go by symptoms and so you know you go and and you're feeling really good and it's like sort of six months down the road or eight months down the road and you're feeling great you just sort of add in sort of eggs again all of a sudden you just get you know you don't feel as well okay you just cut it out the thing is too is it may not be histamines it may not be from leaky gut it may just be there's something in eggs and dairy that you don't respond well to and that are going to cause a bit more inflammation and that you can't tolerate there there are plenty of people out there that really cannot tolerate dairy or eggs and and it's not about histamines it's just like there there's something in there their body's reacting to so casine is pro-inflammatory different proteins in egg whites um Can can cause a reaction so it's just important to remember that be aware of that and um you know plan accordingly you know if you get six months down the road and you try some eggs and it's fine great you know eggs are back on the menu um and if you know you know same same thing with dairy great but it you you may be in that camp that you just don't do as well with dairy I don't have a specific negative reaction to Dairy but I certainly don't feel my best if I'm including Dairy and and and I don't just eat dairy like I it would just be like having some cream in a in some sort of you know uh recipe or something like that or putting cheese on meat or something like that um it's fine but I it's not I don't feel as good as if I'm just eating straight up meat and uh butter seems to be fine I don't have an issue with butter and milk you know love milk but you know I get tired as hell like an hour afterwards I'm like passing out on the couch because you get this blood sugar Spike and Insulin Spike and you and then blood sugar crashing G me pass out so it it just depends you know see how you feel most people do best on just red meat and water um if you have a autoimmune issues that's just going to be the best thing for you going forward but um see how you go give it about six months and then uh and then just introduce them back one at a time and just try for a couple weeks and if you get a bad reaction you just stop and uh and if you're good after a couple weeks of incl including the eggs great then you can add in some of the dairy see how you go for another couple weeks and um yeah hopefully hopefully you can you cook more creatively and try some of these different recipes but you'll you'll always feel best on just meat and water especially red meat and water and um and you know it's nice sort of doing these sort of creative fun recipes but at the same time you know it uh it takes about hours of prep work and doing all these things you have a messy kitchen at the end of it you have to clean up and you know we do these things you know Ella and I do these things and it's a lot of fun we're sort of doing these things it's fun to do it together and this and the other we have this fun thing and it's just like at the end of it it's just like wow look at all this mess and I'm just thinking in my head I'm like that would have been a lot easier to just cook a steak and I probably would have enjoyed it just as much so uh just have a thought about that and um see how you go but if uh I you know give it a good six months and then give it a try after that uh Keith cuser or kusak thank you very much for the very generous super chats very kind of you um Keith says you're helping so many people you don't even realize it Anthony I hope uh you make it to 130 140 years old me to and I hope there uh there's a heavy because your crown is going to be super heavy um and it for all the people that you've helped and are helping thank you well that's very kind of you Keith I really appreciate that it's very kind of you to to say that in in a Super Chat of of such generous proportions as well um I I don't know about about all that but I I I I do hope that it's helping people and I um and it really makes me happy when I see people really improve their life you because have so many people out there these naysayers this oh this is this this is that who cares what they say this is really working this really works for people and um and it's changing it's just changing their lives and um I don't I don't think that you know this is what I do I just telling people what I do and why I do it and you can try that if you like and I you know this is the reason that I use this in my patients is because it works it reverses diabetes it significantly improves autoimmune I we have clinical proof that it reverses type two diabetes and U certainly you know animal-based ketogenic diets which is a carnival diet and and many other things and autoimmune issues massive improvements I have so many patients that have gone into remission with their autoimmune issues that that that would never go into autoimmune is go into remission otherwise um because you know without medications anyway you know this it is just an amazing thing to see and and it's just I don't know it's a pretty exciting time that we've actually started to figure out what the hell these diseases are and why they're coming and how to fix them and so you know I just I I'm just so happy every time I see someone reverse some major illness because that's you know they have their life back you know instead of instead of suffering for the next 50 years and dying early you know they get to enjoy the rest of their life they get to enjoy their family enjoy their children their grandchildren their grandparents you know and you know grandkids get to see more of their grandparents you know my parents are going to be alive a lot longer and get to you know meet my kids and my kids are going to be able to know them love them and learn from them that's amazing I mean that there there's nothing more there's nothing more on this Earth than just quality time with your family and Health Quality Health and um and so it's just always wonderful to see everybody improving and uh so you know keep it up keep keep letting people know you know how you're doing and um you know more and more people are listening and more and more people are are getting better as a result and you know and they can't they can't keep denying reality forever so you know thank you all for being here for talking about this for sharing this with your communities and your circles and having those circles grow and um you thank you Keith for all your kind words it's very very nice of you and good to see you here I'm glad you're um I'm glad you're around low carb low drama uh thank you as well for the very generous Super Chat it's very kind of you uh do fasting insulin and glucose tests reliably help diagnose types diabetes and insulin resistance mine are vastly different uh when measured at 7 a.m. and versus 5 p.m. yeah that happens my glucose is always 6ish at 7 a.m. and high fours around 500m despite being keto carnivore omad at uh 100 PM uh morning fasting insulin is high as well thank you um so first of all insulin resistance takes time to come down but it does come down you know if you're if you're ketogenic especially and and not having seed oils and all these sorts of things so you know Carnival being sort of the best way to do do that um but it takes time you know it's not it's not going to happen right away um it's it they are fairly good tests and um you know there are other there are other markers that uh that I look at when I'm just looking at overall health but specifically for insulin resistance yeah you would be looking at your fasting insulin but the thing is that like you said you have you have different measurements at different times of the day you know you have something called the dawn effect where you're going to have a higher um blood sugar in the morning just because you have higher cortisol in the morning you have your biggest dose of cortisol first thing in the morning cortisol will raise your blood sugar and so that's that's um very typical to see a higher blood sugar reading first thing in the morning then later on the afternoon especially if you're you know fasting throughout the day uh or eating a ketogenic uh meal throughout the day uh especially with high fat so it it's just a matter of just sort of being consistent and so if you test your blood sugar in the morning okay well you're not you're not getting like a false you know sense of security that um you know you're doing it later in the day when your cortisol is low and this is the lowest your your blood Chu is ever going to be it's like okay well that that's great but you know at other points is higher so you know you you will find that eventually your blood sugar in the morning will be uh you know between four and five you know that's a that's a you know really ideal range for fasting blood sugar first thing in the morning and then fasting insulin will also come down as well uh remember that poor sleep and high stress will raise cortisol will raise insulin resistance raise blood sugar and do all these sorts of things but you know your blood sugar is coming down to you know uh you know into the fours during the day so you know it it looks like your body is um is uh you know is responding to this and I think it will just keep getting getting better um you're saying their fasting insulin is high I don't I don't know how high that is but the point is is is to look at the trend so you look at what it is now and then check it again in three months and see where that fasting insulin is check it at the same time every day so first thing in the morning between 8 and 9 am fasting from the night before 900 p.m. no stress no exercise no sexual activity for 48 hours before the test and you don't eat or drink anything besides water first thing in that morning before you take your test but you do take at least two glasses of water you want the same hydration status as well because that can change these um these tests as well don't take any medications until after the test as well don't drink any coffee Etc all these things can can screw with your your test results it's very important to keep this consistent and then you can get more you you can trust your your uh your test better than more reliable so always look for the trend uh don't get too concerned about you know what your what each individual data point is you want a lot of data points so you can see the trend in the graph and all that sort of stuff and remember that if you average four to five hours of sleep at night after seven days you will give yourself pre-diabetes because of the cortisol uh cortisol Spike and if you're stressed out all the time and worried all the time you're going to spike your cortisol as well you're going to spike your blood pressure you're going to do all these other sorts of things you're going to spike your blood sugar and so you know you it's food is a major part of this but it's not the only part and so you have to you have to have take a holistic approach and look at all of these these uh factors together and try to optimize your health completely and then just get data points you know every couple months you te you test those again they will improve you look for the trend and the trend is that they're going down things are going well if they're not going down okay figure out why they're not going down well is there anything you can change in your diet or using dairy or this that and the other are you just lion diet yes you are just Lion Okay well it's not that how's your sleep going how's your stress levels going things like that there outside influences what about medications that could affect this as well so um you know that's how you troubleshoot that but um but until you sort of see the trend you may not even know you may not even have anything to troubleshoot could all just be going perfectly fine so you know do take a look at that and I'm sure you'll do fine I all my patients that I track and say hey get proper sleep reduce stress Eat This Way their blood sugar and Insulin just come right down and so you'll do you'll do fine always learning thank you very much for the Super Chat uh thank you for all you do uh what are your thoughts on the Chipotle diet uh beef Monterey Jack cheese sour cream and guacamole um better than a lot of diets um you know the guacamole depends on all the different things they put in the guacamole be a bunch of different spices seasonings onions tomatoes those sorts of things which I I wouldn't rate very highly uh the guacamole with avocado and tastes delicious but if that they they aren't tree rip in avocado I'd probably avoid them because well I would avoid them I do avoid them I I don't even eat tree riping avocados but I would suggest you avoid them because when the fruit is not ripe they have many more times of the toxins in them they do have toxins you know and we oh we we eat avocado all the time yeah but avocados and grapes will kill cats and dogs right so if it can kill a cat and a dog because of the toxins in there well that means that there are toxins in there isn't it so it's just that we have we we can contend with them better than dogs and cats however you have something like four times the amount of toxins in avocados when they're picked green and they don't detoxify if they're just ripening in the basket because they don't have anywhere to go the plant has to pull it out it's a closed system now those toxins are just in there they can't go anywhere right and so they've done studies in tomatoes showing that that you pick a tomato green it doesn't detoxify and so the likelihood of them using uh you if you making guacamole with your own avocados from your own tree and they're and you pick them ripe or they fall off the tree even better then uh um you know that's going to be less bad right but it is less bad and so there are going to be some things in there and there going to be good things in there too but there's going to be some bad things also so um maybe the beef and Monterey Jack cheese and sour cream and just leave out the guacamole might be might be a better way to do it and if you do fine with dairy then that's fine make the vast majority of that beef though and um and you have vine ripens tree ripen avocado you know it's it's it's well it's at least less bad anyway and so but you know if you feel good on it and you're doing that and um and you like it and you enjoy it and you're happy uh then then that's great you're still doing better than nearly everybody else on Earth so you're still going to get a lot of good results um but maybe try just a month without the the guacamole just fullon carnivore even just cutting out the dairy and just going full fatty meat and water and see how you feel I would I would bet that you feel a lot better uh doing it that way and then you just make a decision which one you want to do all right good luck with that uh Julie halabi thank you very much for the Super Chat uh hello again so grateful for you uh well thank you I appreciate that uh what is the scene uh behind not being depressed anymore Since switching to carnivore it's amazing well that's great I'm really glad to hear that um it's uh it's something we're finding out more and more in the mental health space you know there are professors from Harvard such as Chris Palmer Dr Chris Palmer and Dr Georg eat who have and and then many others Dr Rachel Brown over in the UK uh and many many more that're now sort of terming themselves metabolic psychiatrists and and they're treating these very serious mental health issues with diet and lifestyle and fixing the metabolism fixing the mitochondria and this is actually fixing the brain and how it works and so this is something that that so many people are finding that you know they go to a carnivore diet and their mental health issues uh improve dramatically even even on top of ketogenic diets because I've I've seen many patients that have um been keto high fat keto and that's improved a lot but they still had um uh serious anxiety and depression issues and it wasn't until they dropped the plants entirely that that they got better U as well so these plant toxins can cause you know neuroinflammation and and disruption of your of your uh you know normal Communications in your brain and and you can manifest that as mental health issues uh Dr Palmer talks about the importance of mitochondrial function and how being in a ketogenic State you get uh massively uh massive increase in both the number and quality of the m Andria specifically in the brain all over your body but also including the brain and this makes your brain run better and and you don't have these issues and so they are reversing things like schizophrenia o CD bipolar major depression major anxiety ADHD even autism you know there are studies showing that in entire treatment groups that are using uh ketogenic carnivore diets to treat autism and it's helping even in adults but it's better the younger you get them because then when the brain still developing and forming you can actually undo um a lot of it and and make the brain work much much better and um which is great it's fantastic my friend Jonathan Griffith he's a bodybuilder in the UK and um you know has a in Instagram YouTube channel we've been on each other's podcasts and things like that and great guy and in the middle of one of our conversations he just said uh know autism came up and he just said uh well you know actually that he had autism and I would not have guessed that I I would not have guessed that at all and he said that a year ago you know before he started a carnivore diet he would not have been able to have the conversation that we were having right then which is just amazing and so he's he's a he's know he's a full-grown adult and yet that improved the functionality of his brain to the extent that he was perfectly normal functioning uh which is amazing it's so good to see and if you get that in children it's going to be an even more profound effect uh which is fantastic so yeah so that it is it is wonderful to see that and again it's just these disease they just they just get better you know when you fix people's diet it's amazing and so we have clinical trials in humans showing that high fat meat-based ketogenic diets improve uh treatment resistant psychiatric disorders like all the ones I named even schizophrenia which is crazy that that helps but it's amazing um and uh and after a few weeks you know um the study with that Georgia Eid was part of uh happened in France they had 31 patients with treatment resistance uh major serious issues been treated for a decade 15 years 20 years sometime no no help from standard of care medications and counseling didn't get go anywhere and they they agreed to go on a ketogenic diet 28 28 of them stuck with it for at least three weeks and every single one improved and um and I think it was two-thirds of them actually went into complete remission after Decades of suffering I mean it's just incredible so I'm really glad to see that that's helped you as well and uh do check out the interviews I've done with Dr Chris Palmer and Dr George Eid they both written books on the subject uh Dr Palmer's is uh called brain energy and Dr eids is called uh change your diet change your mind amazing books and amazing people and amazing interviews I really really really enjoy talking to both of them so do check that out and if anybody is suffering from you know mental health issues or knows someone who is those are really really important uh interviews to get to them or books to get to them sometimes it's harder to read a whole book unless you're motivated you but you might be able to to sit down and watch something for an hour anyway and both the the Georg Eid and um Chris PA ones are roughly an hour so not one of my massive three-hour ones uh so hope that helps but I'm really glad to hear that you're doing better and and I hope that continues and do check out those those interviews I think you'll find them very interesting so big gelato thank you very much for the Super Chat how should we prepare for the upcoming famine uh plan Demi 2.0 uh bird flu already in the works apparently uh they'll put down uh billions of livestock and cause global famine and force plants and Grains on us well you know they they've definitely been uh threatening to kill a lot of livestock and say this is you know this has this has to go because of you know whatever reason and um so I think it's know not a bad idea to a have your own livestock if you can do that out in the country and just get the hell away from all that craziness um and then not be reliant on the food system you're just relying on yourself um hunting good option as well and um just getting a couple um you know big freezer chests and U you know buying a couple you know a cow or two and just stocking your whole freezers uh with a with a whole cow and or two cows depending on the size of your family and how much you guys eat and uh and see if you can just weather the storm and get through it I I was thinking that last year actually actually a year ago two years ago I was thinking maybe I should buy like a whole cow or two and I wish I did because but prices have doubled since then you know so um I'm I'm actually absolutely thinking of going down that route and um you know just I have one ice chest freezer I thinking about doing a couple more and uh and just you know getting a couple cows and uh just spilling it up and just having that and and maybe just have that as the as the emergency fund and um you know keep getting meat as it as it's available and then as soon as that stops like right well you know I've got I've got my backup you know so it's not quite doomsday prepping but it's just you know being a little more uh having a bit more uh you know foresight and the thing is too is that even if that never comes to fruition you've got just a ton of meat of high quality meat that's you know going to last and you can you can have for years and um that's not a bad thing I either so uh yeah it's it's a bit we're we're in we're in strange times and you know as soon as we figured out how to heal ourselves we're we're getting told that we're not allowed to heal ourselves which is you know it's a it's a bit telling really you know it sort of tells you everything you need to know and uh so for me uh I'm not going to stop eating me and so I'm going to I'm I'm planning ahead and going to probably stock things up not everybody can do that but you know buying a cow if you're able to get one in one time it's always the cheapest option it is so much cheaper than then buying it any any other way and just buying you know individual Stakes are the most expensive way to do it you buy a whole riy loin and you cut that up yourself easily half the price if not less and um and then you buy the whole cow and it's half that price Al on top of that so it uh it makes a big difference uh even just to you know just to supporting this way of eating in the first place that's a good idea to buy a whole cow and um and and then you just eat that for the next year or two you know depending I mean a family of four can live on one cow for an entire year right and so if you are an individual that'll probably last you two years you know so and and it's much cheaper to do it that way especially when you're going directly to a farmer um and it helps them because they make more money from it as well so those are my thoughts on that and um but hopefully hopefully it doesn't doesn't show up but you know it's better to be prepared and not need to have your intervention than to be caught with that one so yeah good good to good to think ahead hopefully it doesn't doesn't come up but don't just assume it won't because then you're going to be stuck and that's the other thing too don't let it happen everybody needs everybody has a voice and everybody can push back on this you know you just say hey you know you don't get to kill all these animals there's no reason to kill these animals we're not going to we're going to protest we're going to push back we're going to fight this you call your Senators call your Congressman call your MPS and say hey this is you know I'm not I'm not we're not we're not dealing with this anymore we're going to vote your ass out you know we're going to protest and we're not going to deal with it we're not going to listen to you you know straighten up and so if enough people do that you know we in the western societies we still you know we still can affect our own destiny to a certain degree it's not as much as it used to be because they've been ratcheting down the you know the the thumb screws of of authoritarianism for decades now just slowly but surely just turning it up year after year over the last century and um you know so we're in a we're in a much tighter spot than we were previously but you know we still do have some say and so if you you don't have to just sit back and take it if we get this spread out there me and enough people are like absolutely not you're not taking our meat Supply away that's you know we're not we don't believe you um you know they they can't really do it without our permission for a lot of these things unless they go full authoritarianism and then that's time that you uh kick them out and start again so all right good luck with that hopefully hopefully uh we were able to uh prevent that from happening okay uh Dave thank you for the very very generous Super Chat I appreciate it uh shout out to you DOC for all you do two years carnivore is still going after the first six months of carnivore brain fog asthma migraines and hives have disappeared energy is great and stronger when lifting weights body uh had to adjust like you said that's awesome really glad to hear that Dave it's it is a bit concerning when it's taking like six months you know when you're watching other people and it's like two weeks and they're just feeling like a superhero like I did um and uh that you know but not everybody does and so it's really good good for you for sticking to it and being patient and and working your way through it and after six months you're feeling feeling awesome and now you're two years on and feeling better and stronger than ever so that's really great I'm really glad to hear that and thank you very much for sharing that it's great to see you um oh I think there's two of them here from Dave so there's another one from Dave here too well you did it twice Dave thank you so much there very very kind and generous of you I don't know if that was a that was a mistake but um you know thank you again and uh that's it's absolutely outstanding that you are doing so well I'm really glad to hear that you're doing so um so well hopefully your family is is looking at your example and seeing that as something that they want to Aspire to as well and has encouraged them to uh to get to get um on the carnivore train as well and and hopefully help them as well that's really great you know it's it's you guys that make this grow I don't make this grow I'm just I'm just telling people what what I what I've done and what you know you know studies show what the science says and that the science does not say what they say it says and very clearly it does not say that and uh you know that we've been misled and um purposefully misled and we have the receipts it's it's not this is not up for debate it's not up for discussion you know people that deny that are either in denial or lying and so that's there is to it this is a matter of record we have been lied to and you the idea that there aren't people out there that that uh you know life for money is just is just absolutely juvenile I mean it's just you just it's um it's it's absurd on its face because of course corruption exists of course uh you know greed and and self-interests uh rule some people's lives and so you know um it's it's very important to call these things out but but you know I'm just I'm just putting the material out there and um and then I say here's the here are the studies here's the papers here are the references you look at them and you see what you think and you make the decision because this is your life you know I I pay no penalty for being wrong and know so if you take my advice and it and something goes wrong you know it's you that suffers right but it's also you that gains and so I'm doing this because from what I can see this is the best way uh that we can live and we can eat and the healthiest that I can possibly be and I certainly feel that way and I certainly see that in my patients I certainly see that in other people but you know it it I don't want people to just listen to me just because I'm saying it I want them to you know get interested in what I'm saying and then check the references check the receipts and just say okay I agree with that or I don't fine you need to make that decision and when you guys do make the decision and it does improve your life which it invariably does people look at that and they take notice and and you know your family and friends that say well wow they're crazy what the hell are they doing all of a sudden they're like well maybe they're not not all that crazy after all and they start getting interested and they start asking questions and that's how this grows it's your own little spheres of influence that are growing and then then those people that you influence have their own spheres of influence and that's how it grows there's a Grassroots movement this is not coming from top down it's it's just not going to we have to make this a global movement of serious proportions before we will ever get this um into like actual recommendation levels because it just won't happen there's just too many uh multi-trillion dollar vested interests in uh not having this uh come up so it's h it's important for us to just be an effective example in our own spheres of influence and that's how it grows and and it is because it works and so thank you for being a part of that and uh and for sh sharing your example with others I appreciate it and our good friend stink ass cat thank you very much for exceptionally uh generous Super Chat thank you so much buddy appreciate it uh Dr C rocking the carnivore uh kasbon and Bali yeah so you know I'm at the I'm at the the Bali Time Chamber it's up in Northern Bali absolutely gorgeous here up in the mountains I show you guys a bit of it here yeah so I'm just out you can hear a lot of noise people still doing construction and people weed whacking in the middle of the Jungle which is interesting didn't know you needed to weed whack in jungles but um yeah just tons of tons of greens and forests and everything uh which is just lovely and um so it's been really enjoyable so I'll be putting out a few reels and things like that and shorts on YouTube as well uh just to show you guys what it's like it's absolutely gorgeous and um you know the you know the guy who does this he's he's a carnivore and uh they say specifically vegans are not welcome we're not going to cater to you so just don't bother so they do have non-c carnivore things but it's very easy to be it's very meat Centric and so uh the food is included in in the C up to a certain point and U but you get like a kilo of meat a day and uh roughly you know depending on how you how you do it but um and if you want more you can order or more and it's it's not all that much but um but it's absolutely great so you know highly recommend it I'm not being sponsored to say that I just actually really enjoy it here and um and the best part is is it's uh the people here the people here are fantastic you know the the locals obviously they're just loveliest people that you have to meet there everyone's just so nice always has a smile on their face they're just such they're genuinely lovely people uh but the other guests you know everybody here has been fantastic just meeting everybody and uh and just you know talking everyone's from you know very different backgrounds and different parts of the world I mean from all over the world you know basically every continent and area uh people are here and um everybody you know it's it's this one's for you know uh men only you know so there's no it's not like you know singles resort or anything like that it's just for people are serious about improving their life improving their health and you know um and uh they coming here and doing that and they're making one for uh for women as well so there it's not you're not being left out you know there are going to be option there are options for for just women as well but um just been great you know just meeting all these people here that are you know very driven and um you know successful in their own um fields and and you're just talking to them and and learning from them and and um and they're talking to you and then asking you questions and things like that it's been it's been fantastic so you know um can't recommend it enough really and uh you know a lot of people here for like a few weeks or even even a month and like instantly jealous I'm like I can't I be here for a month that'd be great just work remotely or something like that there's one guy he does he just works eight hours just out outside just like this he's just on his computer doing his thing and he's like right done for the day you know hitting the gym is outdoor gym and covered roof but you know outdoor to the air and just you know crushing a workout eat some good food in hot tub and the cold Plunge in the sauna so enjoying you know people's company and conversation and yeah it's been great but uh so yeah definitely definitely been great and I'm leaving tomorrow uh which is which is you know bitter because it' be nice to get home and see um you know L and everybody there and just get back to normal life but uh it's been really nice here too so definitely looking forward to coming back um it's a question from Alex sa thank you very much Alex really appreciate it uh hey my sister has thoracic aneurysm 4.4 I'm assuming centimeters and lupus should she do a carnivore diet in her mid-50s so uh I there's nothing there that would um be damaged by a carnivore diet and I think probably really help it's not going to reverse an aneurism uh that not not that I know of um and not that I would expect but I it's it's not going to make it worse either from from what I know of either in lupus it will help right is that's an autoimmune issue and I just I've never seen autoim autoimmune issue not get better so you know she has some specific issue and she's worried obviously he'll consult with her doctor but uh lupus and autoimmune issues in general when you're going on a strict line diet just red meat and water autoimmune issues I've never seen one not improve you uh make sure you focus on sleep make sure you focus on stress levels and um and just red meat and water high fat red meat and water water and she should improve I have a number of patients with lupus who have dramatic improvements by going on a lion diet carnivore and hopefully it helps her other issues as well and maybe slows the progression of the thoracic aneurysm or or maybe even you know improves it somehow or makes it more stable it's hard to say you know because there are different things that can cause a thoracic aneurysm um be underlying uh collagen disorders and things like that so uh um it just depends but hopefully that helps and I I'm very confident that it would help her lupus at the very least and it's not going to cause harm in uh in any respect because it's just normal human nutrition there's nothing there's nothing harmful in it so uh good luck to her good luck to you and I hope she does well uh Lena thank you for the Super Chat uh refeed recommendations after prolong fasting go slow so um I'm not an expert in this but from what I have read typically after five days of prolong of fasting which is prolonged fasting um you can get into to uh difficulties with refeeding refeeding syndrome and so you need to start very slowly so you just reintroduce food a bit slower more slowly and you just eat a little bit see how your body feels wait a few hours eat a little bit more wait a few hours eat a bit more it is kind of funny though because when you see animals in the wild that they don't eat for a week or whatever and they get po they just Gorge right they're not just oh I'll eat some they just go go to town so it is interesting um I don't know if it's if a if there's a difference in in you know how they've studied this and and and if there's certain foods that they go back to eating and those can cause a problem whereas eating just meat wouldn't cause a problem you know the Mongols you know G is K a Mongol horde they you know they would go you know five days easily without eating then they'd eat 10 pounds of H meat in one go so I would just listen to your body I would you know if you're doing like a really long fast and better safe and sorry just just start off slow typically when people are ending along fast they they're not even all that hungry they just they just don't want to eat all that much and so you know if if that's the case and don't don't don't force yourself and um you know and if it's you know longer than five days I just air on the side of caution and just uh go slow and just have a little bit at a time see how you feel a couple hours later go again C5 dation thank you very much for the Super Chat hi doctor I'm worried about my cholesterol while doing carnivore I'm doing it uh and feeling great just worry about long-term Health issu heart issues a lot of people are saying long-term it could be bad for you thoughts uh yeah it's wrong so like going back you know there there is there is absolutely zero zero studies in the literature showing a cause and effect relationship between cholesterol saturated fat and um cardiovasular disease there are five randomized control trials three of which showed absolutely no improvement in cardiovascular disease or mortality by replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat from vegetable oils and margarine um and lowering cholesterol no no improvement and the two larger studies that were better designed they actually found that replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat and reducing cholesterol killed more people of heart attacks and strokes so uh there is absolutely zero basis for them to make the claim that cholesterol causes heart disease or is a risk for heart disease because you cannot you cannot show risk without without um studies that show cause and effect unless you have an experimental trial showing this oh this increases risk epidemiology doesn't count you cannot make those you cannot qualify those statements uh by uh that that level of evidence it's just it's not it's not substantive so there is no evidence to say that cholesterol causes heart disease none there's no study that shows a cause and effect relationship between cholesterol and heart disease oh but we just know it does not good enough not good enough at all especially because there are studies large studies that actually show that there isn't even an association with heart disease it's not like there's this massive 20,000 fold increase in heart disease associated with there's not you know it is a weak at Best in some studies and many other studies actually show no increased Association or even an inverse Association so uh no absolutely not um when they say that you say okay what is the evidence for that can you show me can you show me any study that shows a cause and effect relationship between cholesterol and heart disease thing is we don't have to prove the negative right they made a statement they have to back it up right they said the cholesterol causes heart disease okay what's your evidence uh well uh because everyone knows no that's not good enough what is the evidence they have to back it up and until they do if they come up with something say oh well this study shows that well no that's not a cause and effect study that's not a randomized control trial that's not experimental data you can't make a cause and effect statement from uh an epidemiological cohort study right or or prospective cohort study you have to have an experimental trial you have to have experimental um U you know trial preferably randomizing you randomized right so unless they have that they have no basis to say there's a cause and effect relationship so you know there you go now if you want you want to go deeper into it and and see just how how crazy this whole thing is uh watch my video uh called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease uh this was a lie you know the sugar companies lied and paid off professors from Harvard and elsewhere to uh make claims that that cholesterol caused heart disease when it it absolutely did not and their evidence showed that it did not and they lied about it um and that was probably because well that's because there were scientists and studies say you know saying that there was a strong association with with sugar and heart disease and they're like no we got to cover that up you know just like the tobacco companies you know paid off a bunch of people to say that U uh that the tobacco was safe and wasn't addictive and didn't cause empyema and heart disease and cancer and things like that so you know it's uh it's just just another piece of you know duplicity and um you know so uh watch that that video the cholesterol the truth about cholesterol and heart disease on my YouTube channel okay NM 8685 thank you very much for the Super Chat uh doctor I'm Serbian we eat lots of pork Pudo lamb beef are these things like Pudo and lamb suitable for the cornivore diet uh also a lot of smoke meat uh yeah Pudo and lamb all that stuff is fine I mean there's a lot of salt in those things but typically not anything else and if you're okay with that then that's fine some people are salt sensitive and will get spikes in their blood pressure so just be mindful of that if you're having a problem with that or someone's having a problem with that maybe try to cut those very salty Meats out um but as long as it's not adding a whole bunch of you know garbage nonsense and sugar to it should be fine and so yeah those those are those are very good you know the whole meats are the best lot of fat Smoked Meats fine again um just try to be very fatty and uh try to do the whole Meats just cooked normally uh for the majority of what you eat just to reduce and minimize all the different sort of additives that that go onto it Sean 55 thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy I've been carnivore for 15 months now uh when I started my A1C was 5.6 I've recently had my labs done it's still 5.6 uh will this go down over time yeah it it it can it should um you need to spot check this with your uh actual blood sugar just with fingerprint tests because um you know if you're eating you know vegetable oils and things like that or or just plant fats they have plant sterols which uh make it so we don't make as much uh cholesterol and that affects our body in certain ways but it also gets used as cholesterol in some cases it can't be used for like hormones and different different sort of structural components in your brain but it can be used uh in the cell membranes of your cells including your red blood cells and that it makes a bit more stiff and rigid and if it gets too rigid they die and your body your body pulls them out of circulation so if you're eating these plant fats then even if it's just some your red blood cells are not going to live as long so hb1c is is a marker of your average um blood sugar levels but it's assumed that your red blood cells are living three months but they not necessarily if you're eating more plant fats they will not live as long as three months and if you stop eating those things and only eat animal FS they will probably live longer than three months so it could very well be that your blood sugar has gone down a bit and that your a HB andc has stayed the same because you're you're comparing two and a half month average to a three and a half month average so that's going to be that's going to be different that doesn't mean that that doesn't mean that um uh that your average every day was was the same it means that it was at a lower level but exposed for longer because that's what this is from it's from glycation damaging the hemoglobin and if your hemoglobin is lasting longer your Red Bloods are cells are lasting longer they're going to get glycated more before they end up getting pulled out of circulation and so uh that that actually happens quite often and there there are many people that have noticed that and then they check their blood sugar actually fingerprick test I'm like yeah actually that's not really uh that's not really lining up it's actually much better so it's uh it's a very blunt instrument hba1c I wouldn't worry too much about it it's not it's not my favorite um thing to to test it's the once it gets down into the five I don't think it's really all that accurate or necessary uh to check but um yeah you know when you're talking about people that have like HBA of like 14 and they go carnivore and it drops down to like four or five and it's like wow okay huge difference and at that point you I'm not too worried about it but remember sleep stress both raise cortisol both raise blood sugar so you need to make sure that those are are okay as well and obviously medications that can raise blood sugar also okay Damen Williams thank you very much for the Super Chat uh some frog Tad Poes have half of the young eat vegetarian the others are cannibalistic if the pond doesn't dry up the herbivores Thrive if the puddle dries up uh the cannibalistic ones grow quickly interesting H um yeah I I didn't know that um I have no idea what tadpoles eat frogs certainly tend to eat uh other other things such as other frogs and insects and animals and things frogs are pretty pretty aggressive animals they're pretty aggressive Hunters some of them are quite voracious e they some of them actually died trying to eat things that are bigger than them they just like choke and die and they just both of these things are dead and he's got this one frog with a bigger frog stuffed in its mouth and they're both just dead pretty wild you know the the you know nature is just pretty damn wild so it's uh it's pretty amazing to see but yeah that's interesting um yeah very cool and you it's just just a so yeah um it's always interesting to see these examples in nature and see how how the life uh works and survives so thank you for sharing that uh KR thank you for the Super Chat strict carnivore for three months 200 lb uh 6'1 12% body fat lost 15 PBS and gym L and energy down dramatic ially struggling to gain weight eating two pounds of ribey six eggs and a pound of 7030 mints what should I do um well you know like like we heard from uh you know earlier earlier people uh it can take longer than that um especially for athletes full keto adaption uh takes several months so we see this in uh checking people's uric acid levels so you can you do that you can check your uric acid levels uric acid and ketones compete for elimination in the kidneys and so if you're having if you're not quite keto adapted and so you're not using all the ketones you're spilling some out in your urine then that will block out some of the the elimination of uric acid and so you'll have higher levels of uric acid and so if your uric acid is a little up that can be why and so and that can be a marker of your keto adaption and so if you if you see that that's high you just understand that you're still still adapting probably are at at three months so yeah and and as I said some people take as long as six months before they start getting better but then they really start getting better and they're strong and they're faster and all these other sorts of things and in the studies in top Elite athletes um it's uh you know some of them like for the elite athletes you know after six months that's when they're really performing better than other people uh for just you know the um for for everybody else are just sort of you know just Weekend Warriors and just trying to stay fit and things like that usually about 3 weeks three four weeks or sorry four to six weeks um is is a pretty good range but you know if you're really going after it and you're really trying to uh you know go as hard as you can in the gym you know it can take longer than that um the other thing is too is that if you um first of all you lost weight that's great U 12% body fat doing really well um you need to eat enough sounds like you're eating a lot you know but are you eating until fatty meat stops tasting good that's important are you eating before you're working out that's important because you're not going to feel as strong you're not going to feel as good uh if you're if you're working out um after you've eaten you're just you're just not and so I would try working out fasted and see how you go then eat directly after uh you finish your workout as well and then just just be patient make sure you're getting out everything else you have if you're using pre-workout drinks and things like that I would get rid of those I feel much better not using pre-workout or BCAAs or anything with artificial sweeteners or anything like that so I I'd get rid of those especially you know if you're taking artificial sweeteners that can in some people that can that can spike your insulin which can drop your blood blood sugar and make you feel uh not as good and drops your blood sugar it also suppresses your ketones and so you go into the gym and you're supposed to have all this energy but now you're you're you're weaker because you're not actually producing the energy that you need so get rid of all of that stuff if you haven't already and just drink a bunch of water train fast it eat as much as you can eat until fatty meat stops tasting good and um and just keep going like you'll you'll uh if it's just an adaptation thing you'll get through it if it's uh something that you're doing something you're still including thing just get rid of it just fine-tune those things and um and you'll do great so good luck with it and also focus on the other things too you know I mean obviously we have certain things that we focus on because that's that's the I that's what we're here for we want to we want lifts and this and the other to get better but but what are the other improvements you're having you know and so if you're having these other improvements you know that's that's really important to remember those and to focus on those because that's uh that's you know you can lose sight of of those benefits because the one sort of thing you're fixating on is is not improving as you would like it to uh Rena side thank you very much for the Super Chat I started the carnivore diet two two months ago and I've have only lost five pounds I'm only eating red meat salt and water and I doing something wrong I do feel 100% that's the most important thing it's just a matter of how you feel and your health there are a lot of reasons why you may not be losing all that much weight um you could for instance be putting on muscle and losing fat and you know you don't and that offsets on the scale so you know take a take monthly uh progress photos just you know on the first of the month every month just take a picture um coming up on the first of the month so perfect timing take a picture you know with you know with minimal clothing in the mirror and um and just and then check it again in a month you know and you might see that you're actually much Slimmer much more ton more muscular things like that and then the scale says the same thing fine you know that's okay you know your body is changing your body composition is changing and so I mean I I noticed that I lost weight early on and then I lost no weight with whatsoever uh for months and months and months but I was taking those progress photos and I was amazed at how much different I looked uh every time and so you know it's uh it's it's something that that can be very helpful and so I I knew I was putting on muscle and I was losing fat so I was staying the same weight I was like cool I I don't care about losing weight I want to lose fat and I want to you know put on muscle and I want to get fit I want to get healthy I want to get fast and I want to play rugby and I want to you know smash people like that's what I was car that's what I was worried about so you know keeping that weight was great because I had I had you know more mass to to smash people with so you know just remember that it's a number one important thing to worry about is your health distant second is your body composition nowhere on that is the scale uh because the scale doesn't tell you anything about your health or your body composition and so uh just remember that and be patient because the thing is is that you know I've um I have patients that they don't lose weight right away way we look at their Bloods and they they're metabolically unhealthy they have high fasting insulin they have high leptin they have all these other sorts of things it's just like you have a depressed metabolism and it's going to be you're going you are going to have slower weight loss and so they just understand that going in and um you know just not losing all that much weight is is understandable and then all of a sudden you're just losing you know a couple pounds a month a couple pounds a month a couple pounds a month or not losing much and then all of a sudden bam they just they just start losing a lot of a lot of excess weight and um because their their leptin's coming down their insulin's coming down all these things are are improving their metabolism is going up and eventually gets to the point where the body just shifts and they just are able to to lose a lot more body fat more quickly so it could be all of those things um so just be patient focus on how you feel and just and just keep going and you'll be fine and be as strict as you can I mean that you're doing that right you're not doing anything wrong just uh you know just keep going and be patient take those progress photos maybe even do a dexa scan get your body composition checked and and see uh or or one of those um things you hold in hands and things like that some of those are actually pretty accurate so you get one of those more accurate ones and you check your body composition and then in a couple months you check your your body composition again you go oh look at that I've actually lost 10 pounds of fat but I put on eight pounds of muscle so great pretty good all right so just keep that in mind too um okay so this is from San 90 thank you very much for the Super Chat if on a strict carnivore diet do we actually need to brush or floss our teeth I would I do in fact um you're still going to get build up and um you know I don't I don't use like you know um you know bunch of toothpaste and things like that I I typically use making soda or the um tooth powder from Stone and spear Tallow who I work with and um and uh you know they sponsor the show and everything like that so uh and that's like it's just like a bit of an abrasive and that has like a bit of peppermint or something like that in it and it's like you know it's not the end of the world um but it's um it's a lot better than all the other stuff so I I don't use like normal toothpaste unless like I sort of have to I've even brushed my teeth just just with the brush you know you're just sort of getting off you know the plaque buildup and things like that uh or baking soda baking soda works great it's just a bit of an abrasive and it just you know gets that sort of clean but you know people people prehistorically didn't brush their teeth and they got little up and and scaling and things like that and that you know may have protected their teeth and gums and they had very strong healthy teeth and you know and we see that build up in the fossils uh but yeah I would you know it's just you know you're going to have a bit of you know it's not going to have horrific breath but you're going to have little stinky breath and and you're going to get build up and you're going to get you know scaling and and things like that and so brushing can just keep that down it's it's probably not you know a huge issue from like Health Point of View because you know like animals in the wild they don't brush their teeth or anything like that but when they're eating their natural diet their teeth are very healthy their oral biome is very healthy so I think from a health standpoint I don't think you're you're uh going to harm yourself uh but it's more just from a you know societal Norm sort of thing just having you know just you know nicer sort of teeth and things like that and uh you know even even like the Messiah for them like getting like certain sticks and sort of just brushing their teeth and just sort of getting some of the gunk off and things like that it's just sort of a preference but um they do drink a lot of milk too so who knows but I I I still brush my teeth I think that's probably a good idea and uh but you can use very natural things like uh uh or very you know basic things like baking soda or that tooth powder from Stone and spear or you can get those natural there's like Tom's natural toothpaste or something like that and uh it doesn't have any of the fluoride or any of the garbage in it or in the weird you know titanium uh uh micro nanop particles and things like that you know that that we have no idea what they do in our body but they certainly don't belong in our body in nature so you know might as well not have them there and um yeah so that's what I do anyway I I yeah I don't use floridated toothpaste I don't use things with a bunch of dyes and chemicals and thises and that I just uh I just used very simple things and but I I definitely still do brush my teeth okay
