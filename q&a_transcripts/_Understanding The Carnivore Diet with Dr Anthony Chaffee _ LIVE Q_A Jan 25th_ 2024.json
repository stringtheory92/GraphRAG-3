    "title": "\ud83d\udd34Understanding The Carnivore Diet with Dr Anthony Chaffee | LIVE Q&A Jan 25th, 2024",
    "transcript": "okay hello everyone thank you for joining another live this is for January 25th in America 26 in Australia um just had a bit of a of a delay had to get some some technical issues uh sorted out and thank you everyone for being patient it's good to see you all thank you very much for coming down so um before we get to the question just wanted a couple announcements I just had um fantastic interview with good Dr Georgia Eid who is a psychiatrist and um you know she's been at Harvard she's been at Smith college she's been all over Massachusetts and um she wrote a book called change your diet change your mind and so this is the same idea that um my former guest Professor Chris Palmer from Harvard um spoke about basically using dietary interventions to fix mental health issues and so obviously she's been doing just amazing work in that field and treating hundreds of patients with this now um and and getting clinical trials going uh obviously involved in uh help write up a clinical trial out of France where they had 31 participants that agreed to be in part of this study and they had refractory psychiatric issues where for decades nothing was working you know the counseling and medication treatments weren't working they actually worked with a specific psychiatrist in I think toose and for decades and just didn't get anywhere didn't get anywhere didn't get anywhere put them on a ketogenic diet uh 28 of them were able to stay on the ketogenic diet you know keto carnivore diet very high-fat meat-based diet with maybe a bit of vegetables and found that the yeah 28 were able to stick with the past two weeks every single one of them improved every single one and these are people that didn't have any Improvement for decades and all of a sudden bam every single one improves and across the spectrum of psychiatric issues so major depression anxiety bipolar OCD schizophrenia and so very very powerful study now apparently they involved in randomized control trials seeing this so very compelling to show that these people responded like that obviously if you randomized them and controlled it it would be a bit more convincing in that regard however it's it is already quite compelling because you compare this against standard treatment you you compare this against themselves because nothing has worked for these people for decades and yet now this works in a matter of weeks so they had something like um you over a dozen of them had full resolution of their symptoms within a couple weeks right like three four weeks and they had like complete resolution they've never had they've never got anywhere with this but then in a in a few weeks just changing their diet get get resolution of their symptoms which is absolutely amazing so now they're doing randomized control trials which is absolutely fantastic and ex exactly what you need exactly what we need we need to get more of these things out in the literature like that the things that we're seeing all the time we're seeing millions of people improve their lives and now we just need to get it official into the literature with rcts and other studies to show hey look this is this is a real thing and this is really important to get people to get people um aware of this stuff I'll also have and so that will be going out in two weeks so not this coming Sunday Monday but the next following Sunday Monday so the 4th fth of February this coming weekend is is going to be a really good episode as well that's going to be with uh Dr Nick norwitz who's a Oxford train PhD who's in his third year of medical school at Harvard and has been involved with uh Dave Feldman in the lean mass hyperresponders uh research which is recently published so I had a number of people with a with an average time on ketogenic diets with markedly elevated or markedly high LDL for however much you if you want to call it high because I don't and I think this is physiological and they found that they had no progression in their atherosclerosis and in fact the trend was to go down and they had one of the top lipidologists in the world you know compile this data and help help write it and he's of the opinion that you know if you have high LDL over time this equals atherosclerosis and even he said and he's like hey I still believe that but apparently for this population that is not the case so very interesting we're coming out of there so we'll be talking to him and he had a very interesting study of the N of one crossover study trial that people are talking about now which is which is the Oreo cookie trial basically showing the thing that I've been saying for years which is you why does LDL go up when you when you go on a ketogenic diet carnivore diet for the same reason that it goes up when you're fasting is because you're running on fat your body needs to move fat around your body and LDL is the molecule that transports fat around your body so it's pretty straightforward and so they're showing this clinically where this is a metabolic State change and so his LDL is up he's in that lean M hyperr phenotype and so he had very elevated blood sugar or sorry um serum cholesterol ldlc and then he had that up he ate a sleeve of Oreal cookie 12 Oreo cookies I would have G gone with a double stuff myself if you um if you're going to do something like that horrible for your body I think you might as well go for the double stuff that was the only kind of Oreo I ever really liked anyway and um so he did just the normal Oreo cookies which probably design flaw in the in the study just joking and um and it lowered his his LDL by like 76 78% down from like 400 down to like 111 and they went oh that that may be like an outlier maybe we just take it the next two days and it it kept going down then he went on high do Statin so we had a wash out period so as LDL came back up over 400 went on high do Statin and on for six weeks and it only came down like 36% and that was actually after four weeks it took far longer so two weeks on the Oreos four weeks on the Statin and that was the the ner at four weeks it only came down like 36% so something like that anyway not that much not nearly as much and then it started actually coming back up by the six we mark it was higher than at the four-week Mark so the reason he picked Oreo cookies which I thought was hilarious was because obviously I mean who the hell in the right mind is going to try to argue that Oreo cookies are good for your heart I mean you have to be a Madman uh I'm sure there are going to be people that do it and you know it's an N of one so that that's going to be the first point of attack but you know it it is it is a demonstration of this metabol State change and it's a sort of a you know thumb and nose to these sorts of people that um you know have have just no have you no flexibility in their thought and they just can't possibly just so Inside the Box closed-minded thinking like nope this is what it is everything you know they can't just think well maybe these boundaries are wrong maybe this box is wrong maybe this box isn't the whole universe you know I mean Einstein thought that too at Einstein's time they thought the Milky Way was the the entirety of the universe and so they're trying to make a theory of everything that we can sort of explain all this well like you know maybe maybe you could do that with one Galaxy if that's the entirety of the universe which you can't but when you have hundreds of trillions of galaxies like yeah maybe not so you know when you're not working with all the information you're just you're sort of in that closed box thinking like you're just you're going to get things wrong so it's at least hopefully we'll just sort of wake up some people on that and that will be we'll be discussing all that and more on this weekend so hopefully people can come out for that Premiere and um that'll be at the same time so 9:00 am Perth time on Monday which should be 5:00 pm um on Sunday in in America um I might play around with that just just because I have uh some some work stuff that morning morning but if if I do I'll obviously announce that and everything like that so it might be might be a couple hours before that or one hour before that potentially like starting at 8: am 4 pm Sunday anyway take it keep an eye out for that that will be happening this weekend and um I know hope to get a lot of people there for the premiere because obviously the more people premere commenting and liking and things like that the m does much much much better with the algorithm and YouTube pumps this out to a lot of people so hopefully people can can show up for that so there were a couple super chats that that came in that unfortunately didn't get uh starred streamyard sort of doesn't allow us to to sort of catch things before everything starts but uh able to copy and paste these sorts of things so I'll just read them out but I won't be able to put them up the first one is from JS designs who gave a Super Chat thank you very much for that that they say my uncle was diagnosed with prostate cancer including including his lymph nodes he eats a standard American diet are you aware of specific studies on this can you talk a bit about this topic so I can share with them well so if you if you want to go look at um Professor Ben bikman who's a professor of biochemistry biodynamics whatever whatever his exact title is um at BYU he's been studying insulin insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity and the different effects on the metabolism of the different things that we eat and for decades and he has spoken about prostate issues in his book why we get sick and um so you can you can find a lot more information there specifically about the prostate um specifically about just cancer on its own all cancer uh have damaged mitochondria that we know of and so prostate cancer is no different to that and because of that damage to the to the mitochondria it it it cannot process glucose properly and so it needs about 400 times the amount of glucose to get the requisite energy obviously has higher biological demand as well metabolic demand as well because it's rapidly multiplying so because of it the inefficiency of its it of its energy metabolism and its high metabolic M it needs a lot of glucose it's called the warberg effect and so you go on any ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet this this reduces the amount of available energy to the cancer cells perfect demonstration of this is a pet scan is probably something that your uncle has had um certainly people I mean that's generally how people know that it's in the lymph nodes or metastasize around their body they do a pet scan they give radiol labeled glucose as an inje ction and they see where that goes right so that's so that's the a demonstration of that so you see like oh that's where all that glucose went that must be a cancer or something like that there's other places too like your brain and other parts of your body that will it will have high uptake but cancers will do that too and so every time you eat sugar every time you eat carbs alcohol it goes that's what you're doing just remember that put that image in your head of that pet scan with a hot bright lot of glucose right there that's what you're doing you're feeding that cancer and you're giving it a lot of energy you're going to make glucose so that's going to have available energy for that cancer however last thing you want to do is double triple quadruple that because then you just you're just pouring gas on the fire so take a look at my interview with Professor Thomas SE freed who's one of the top cancer researchers in the world and his um and that and ketogenic metabolic therapy that he uses uh to treat cancer in uh lab animals and clinical trials there are quite a lot of human trials with ketogenic metabolic therapy uh showing you know significant Improvement some of them are are smaller studies some of them are larger studies so it just depends on the cancer as well and so I would W watch that watch that with your dad and uh you know you know then then do what you guys think you need to do but I would if I or family remember had a diagnosis of uh cancer I I know exactly what I would do is I would try to get my gki glucose Ketone index down below tube down below one with a combination of a very very very pure meat and water diet only high fat and with with periods of fasting if I needed you to get that gki right down and then look at other sort of um treatment modalities that that may may help like if something that's um glutamine is another fuel source for cancer answerers and you make glutamine just like you make glucose but there's ways of limiting this and and interrupting its metabolism there's ways lowering your glucose things like you know metformin and other sorts of things that you can talk to your doctor about uh but also just fasting you know and then periods of refeeding so you're not losing too much weight it's all in there in the uh in the episode and um and available on different Publications that Dr s and others have put out there so that's what I would do good luck to your dad I hope he does well uh with that and the first very first thing you should do is just stop eating processed food and sugar and and uh refin carbs that that that has to go right away because that is flat out feeding his cancer and making it worse so question from Joel Super Chat from jeles thank you very much for that vegan for 24 months uh three months carnivore um ended up in hospital for 14 days some symptoms low blood sugar ketones is very high drinking and peeing heaps acid issues and prolactin levels High scared to try again advice please well it depends on what you mean by high ketones I mean it would be higher than others certainly if it's if it's high up in the type 1 diabetic range well then obviously that's that's different um and did that come down is your body making insulin is what what was the diagnosis that you had um at the hospital you know because your your your body just just switching over to you know ketosis shouldn't cause you to go to the hospital I mean people go periods of fasting they go into ketosis it's not just you don't have to just eat meat in order to go into ketosis you can just fast and so you know billions of people around the world fast every single year for religious or health reasons or other reasons um sometimes because they are forced to due to their situations and their circumstances poverty so that I I couldn't imagine that that is what caused these issues um so I would wonder what what your doctor had to say about that um you should not get acidosis just from not eating plants that's not really a thing prolactin levels are high so there could be something going on with your pituitary um I mean you're in for 14 days hopefully they did give you some sort of diagnosis as to this and didn't just blame you know you tried to switch your diet also you on Carnivore for 3 months so you were already you already had a metabolic State change so you know if there was going to be a problem of you you know with this it should have it should have happened early you wouldn't have just been able to convert over which everyone will be able to that's just that's just human biology so I would I would need some more information on sort of what happened but I would I would hope that they they would have figured out you know what was causing that and what was what was driving that but no I I don't think that that the diet was the cause of that at all um it's if you want to just try to fast for a couple days and see what your body does when you when you switch your metabolism over you could do that if you're scared of eating meat but meat doesn't cause those problems it doesn't cause acidosis that's more of the funniest things people say that that meat is very acidic and you need to be alkaline first of all that that whole idea of you need to eat alkaline foods is flat out insane you need to eat human food that's what you need to eat and your body does what it's supposed to do with your alkalinity um so we need to be alkaline if you're in an alkaline State then cancer can't grow and all that's stupid as hell your body is very slightly alkaline it the blood pH is 7.35 to 7.45 and if it goes outside of that range for anybody at any time with cancer or not you get very sick and then you die if it doesn't get corrected so this has this is very tightly controlled by your body it has nothing to do with the kind of water you drink or even the food that you eat um unless you're really overdoing it just just throwing in massive amounts of Tums or something like that or um you know now it used to be like alkaline water now it's just like hydrogenated water I haven't looked into that but more hydrogen equals more acidity that's what that is free um ionized hydrogen that is what acid is you know that's that's you know H+ that excess H pluses that are going around sticking sticking to things right so that that's what an acid is and so you know we're doing alkaline water and now it's apparently acid water apparently that's the big thing meat is not acidic there's no acids in meat you know except it's like arachadonic acid which is an omega-3 and something that you need for your body and your brain but but there are things like citric acid you know they say plants or or alkaline like is that is that why they have acid in the name like citric acid and um and that's how we know the pH is actually like lemon juice and things like that you know or have lower phes they're they're not alkaline they they are truly acidic some of these things um meat is not meat is not acidic it's it's you know it's uh that's that's sort of a ridiculous thing but anyway no I don't think for a second you me it's not going to cause a prolactin level to go up it's not going to cause acidity um you know drinking in peeing heaps that's pretty normal um but ketones being up can also be normal I mean if you're a type if you sort of lost the ability to make insulin first of all that one of the main treatments for that uh for type 1 diabetes was ketogenic diets that was sort of the only thing that prolonged people's lives uh before we had insulin available and there are uh a few anecdotal accounts of people that have had early on you know that have had type 1 diabetes hit on they go on Carnivore diets some of people have actually been able to start remaking insulin and bringing back F ability and they don't have type 1 diabetes anymore I just I just spoke with a patient about this last week and he said that he had a client he's a you know physical therapist that he did that he got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes he and his dad went on a carnivore diet ketogenic diet and um after you know like a year or two he ended up not needing any insulin and his endocrin like how how the hell did you do that like what the hell happened like well you know we did some research into nutrition how this affects things and this is what we did and you know who knows how they're going to respond to that or what they're going to do with it but they should sit up and take notice um it's in the literature for animal studies that putting putting animals like mice onto a ketogenic diet reverses type one diet diabetes and type two diabetes but specifically and impressively with type 1 diabetes it it triggers the pancreas to start making insulin again which is amazing and so they they've started human trials for that as well I believe at least that was suggested in the paper on on the preclinical trials but uh I don't know of any published data on that yet um but this worked in animals and so potentially can you know work work for humans but um no I don't think that any of those are would be attributable to just eating meat especially you're on for three months you were at that point you're pretty much well adapted to everything so I I would I wouldn't be too worried about about going back on and look you try it again and you start getting sick you can always stop you know it's not it's not um something that like if you if it if you don't think it's working for you it's not something you have to do but I I really would doubt that that's going to happen that this is going to actually cause problems for you so um hopefully you do well and good luck with that I think I think if you get back on it that you'll do do very well uh Super Chat from Bailey Russell thank you very much 29-year-old with hashimotos thyroiditis 10 months um PP and breastfeeding um concern is dumping oxalates and it's affecting my baby through breast milk is it safe to switch to carnivore now or wait until I wean the baby well I well you know oxalate dumping and first of all I have no idea you know what um you know what what you know like like what oxalates and things like that can cross into the breast milk ostensibly it could I don't know I don't know if anyone knows that's a very good question but I haven't I haven't heard that asked before maybe um dropping that by Sally Norton she's the resident expert in oxalate but no I think that it's very important to eat eat a carnivore diet as as early as you can especially in your child's development because that is going to change and improve the quality of your breast milk and that's going to improve the nutrition to your child and you will see them they will they will start developing faster once you switch to a carnivore diet I've seen this many times where people switch to a carnivore diet during breastfeeding and their kids just just started developing off the chart so I I do think that it it's it's a great idea you know if you think you're having if you it's also going to help your Hashimoto I mean that's really important especially you know you get you know that you have enough thyroid hormone while you're breastfeeding that's a very important time to take care of your thyroid health and just your overall health so oxalate dumping is is not um you know like severe oxalate dumping even according to to Sal Orton isn't isn't something that that really causes huge damage to people um typically you know it's something that can happen she said that most people even if they have a ton of oxalates stored in their body will have basically a couple bad days or a couple bad weeks and then it'll get over it and they'll be fine but it's just some people will have extremely bad cases they'll get very very sick and what they do is they just have a very lowd dose oxalate te like 50 to 100 milligrams of oxalates in the tea per day and and that seems to suppress that so if you think you're getting those sorts of things add in a bit of low oxalate tea and um and and that should suppress it that's the idea anyway but no I think I think the benefits to your child are it's it's far more likely to benefit your child than for you to get oxalate dumping at the time and hurt your child you can always just throw in the tea after that and so you know if you're not eating carnivore you're eating things with oxalates and so then you have oxalates in your body and you have oxalates in your breast um milk as well potentially if you're going to get if you're going to oxalate dumping in there then obviously the oxalates that you eat are are going to be able to get in there as well so I do think that it would be worth that obviously you need to you know make your own choices there but you you you can always you can always follow that Sally orange protocol if you feel that there's that there's a problem with oxalates you can even do it preemptively just have a bit of oxalate tea and then just carnivore died after that I mean I personally would just go straight carnivore but you know there are options there and I don't think that you're going to hurt your baby by going that I think you're going to really benefit them so good luck with that so Grizzly uh thank you for the Super Chat any thoughts on Carnivore uh results regarding Graves disease I'm on meds normal levels monitoring with Endocrinology uh two months into carnivore great bumping into you the other day uh Wes so I I've had a couple patients with Graves disease come to my clinic they have all improved so it's it is in the anecdotal stage I haven't seen in the low anecdotal stage I've I've seen you know people and spoken to people online and obviously seen discussions uh where it improves you're already on a cornivore diet so I you know thing is just see how it goes um I would be very strict with any autoimmune issue you just need to be just as close to Pure red meat and water as possible for best results and so that's what I would do and I just keep going with it and see how it works for you you're going to get a lot of improvements anyway you're going to feel a lot better hopefully at this point two months in you you do feel a lot better and see how it goes with your Graves disease also another good resource are the the Facebook group such as um uh zero carb health and zeroing inal Health they're fantastic they and they have this massive res source which is their their search criteria you can just go in there and look up Graves disease search for Graves disease you'll see conversations going back a decade or more of people having the same questions that you have and you'll see all the answers and people talking about their results on that um and at the end of the day you know you're already doing it and so see how it works for you if it if it helps you and improves your situation doesn't really matter what other people's situations are if it's not doing as well for you as you'd like you know maybe you sort looking at that those resources to see what people did to troubleshoot that being just red meat and water those sorts of things and uh and see if it helps for you and um I would expect that it would because I've yet to see an autoimmune issue not respond very well to eliminating all the things that cause autoimmune diseases so super chat from Roger Charles thank you very much what book or course would you recommend to get started on the on the basics of real nutrition uh what takes into account carnivore findings um or which takes into account carnivore findings so I don't know of any real courses at the moment um you know maybe things like you know Professor Tim noes um in South Africa I mean I I haven't taken his course but it it's obviously you know it's like the science about you know ketogenic diets and how this works in our body and carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet should be a ketogenic diet and so uh that could be a good place to start um I don't I I haven't taken any of these things so I I'm very much selftaught in this um but as far as books are concerned I mean you start with the classics so you go Dr JH Salsbury and his the relation of alienation and disease you read um vomer stanson's the fat of the land you read uh Weston a price you read um oh Dr I think it's Walter velan he gastrologist wrote a book called the Stone Age diet 198 1975 and and things like that and you know and then obviously there's more more contemporary ones like you know Dr Baker's the carnivore diet um I haven't I haven't read Dr saladino's the carnivore code um but he sort of gets more into the the uh plant toxin side of things and um and then I'm I'm writing a book myself but it's not going to be out for uh maybe a few months or several months yeah we'll see how how much time I had to get on onto it but you know that's that's talking about carnivore diet and things like that but it's it's really just arguing that you know making the argument as robust as possible that the so-called chronic diseases we're treating nowadays are not diseases they're they're toxicities and malnutrition toxic buildup of a species inappropriate diet and a lack of species specific nutrition so namely too many plants that were not b ologic Al designed to eat and can't contend with and uh not enough meat which we're designed for so yeah so you start with those go with the classics anyway they're they're fantastic so super chat from JS thank you very much for that any tips for keto breath day 24 on Carnivore and my wife says my breath is horrible um lamb beef bison butter salt bacon uh 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt Max um you know that that sort of that Ketone acetone sort of sort of breath um it's it's thought that that's from like very high ketones if I'm if I'm correct in that um so you know as you go you'll you you'll sort of your body will get more efficient at using Ketone so you're total Ketone level won't be so massively elevated sort coming down like then you would have very low ketones and to the point people say Well they're just not in ketosis I pretty sure they are they only eat meat you know and so whether or not they're in ketosis or not really doesn't matter I mean they're you eat what you're supposed to eat your body's going to work the way it's designed to work and that's really all there is to it so the point is whether you're in ketosis or not you're still only supposed to eat meat um so that's uh that's my thoughts on that but um you know of course they're in ketosis their body's making blood sugar it's making glycogen it's making ketones and so you're in that metabolic state where you're mobilizing your fat stores and running on your fat stores you're not you're not running on exogenous carbohydrates and so your insulin is not massively elevated and causing all this sort of ruckus um excuse me um so that that could very well be that your your Ketone levels will just come down could be something else going on but I don't see anything in what you're eating there that you're telling me that that should really do that maybe brush your teeth a couple more times I don't know some Listerine but maybe that can help or you know it uh it may be you know yeah the Ketone sort of acetone breath it's it's quite uncommon I I really don't really see that uh that often but that's probably what that's from if you have you know the ketones levels are just you know really high you know it's just something that you know people in keto tried to do I don't really worry about it I just let my body get on with it but um uh you know that can just if that is the case and that can just settle down on its own um your day 24 which is still early days when you get fully keto adapted it's likely that your Ketone level will sort of level down and that will just sort of take care of itself and so you do the other normal things that you do to to take care of uh inconvenient breath and um and then you just sort of weit that other side out of it Super Chat from David or Dave thank you very much Dave 1 I'm 22 years old I have been on PPI proton pump inhibitors for over a year yet endoscopy shows no gastritis and now recently uh Regan I want my life back but my gut isn't getting better can a lion diet reset my stomach high cholesterol is a worry um so it can it can certainly address a lot of the problems that people commonly have with their gut and so you know is it going to fix every problem no but U it fixes a lot of them you know a lot of these problems that we have are a direct consequence of of eating a species inappropriate diet and so when you go to eating a more appropriate diet then you know then then that improves dramatically and obviously there are a lot of different things that that can cause us to be an issue so you know it just depends on what what's going on with you precisely um high cholesterol is a worry for a lot of people but you know it's been it's been you know addressed by myself and others Dr Paul Mason Ken Barry um Baker saladino uh Kilts thousands of of people online that have had their own sort of stories and saying hey my all yell has been nasly elevated and and my AOS scos is actually going backwards I have um you know people in my patreon group that have had that exact experience you know one gentleman had a complete occlusion of his right cored artery and one year later it was not occluded anymore completely had had still had a lot of blockages but it was it had it was patent now and there was blood going through it was the year before it was not right that's not supposed to happen that's not certainly not supposed to happen eating a high-saturated fat diet right so you know take a look at at um you know the sort of evidence for that I have a video called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease it was just a scapegoat for the sugar companies that's all there is to it it's um you know sugar and processed foods seed oils those sorts of things this this is what's causing the disease that we're we're seeing now and heart disease in particular and that's um and and they wanted to protect their investment they make about 1.3 trillion do a year trust me they have money to throw around to try to you know throw the scent off the Trail um Trail you know send people off the trail and um and so you know that that's that's a historical fact I mean that's that's in the published literature their own internal memos talking about how you know they did this and so it's not supposition it's not an accusation it's just it's just a fact that's what happened so I would watch that I'd watch you know Dr Paul Mason's uh work on YouTube videos and lectures on on um cholesterol i' look at Dave elman's and uh Nick norwitz is uh recent Publications on lean mass hyperresponders look at the Oreo cookie trial like I said like Oreo cookies will lower your LDL cholesterol more than um than statins will if you're on a ketogenic diet or or just fasting because when you fast your LDL goes up when you go on a ketogenic diet your LDL goes up because it's carbohydrates that are the problem there that that's the difference there you stop taking carbohydrates in your body body has to make carbohydrates your body's running on fat now you have to mobilize fat that's what LDL does and some people actually have their LDL go down generally people that are that have more uh excess body fat some sort of relationship there which is interesting so I I there's no there's no direct correlation there's not even a strong correlation in fact a lot of large St show an inverse correlation between cholesterol and heart disease and there's no association between saturated fat intake and heart disease I mean that that has been there's publication after publication in massive massive journals rcts metaanalyses of rcts um showing that so I wouldn't worry about that um and it could absolutely help you I I don't know for sure what's causing your uh stomach issues but this has helped millions of people around the world with their digestive issues so uh maybe someone in the comments or the chats has ADD similar experiences to you and can can maybe help a bit more with their experience okay so we'll get to the ones where we can we can actually click on now so question from Daniel Morin uh guessing a medium rare steak is the um optional thing to be eating or maybe optimal thing to be eating on a carnivore uh ideally one a day and do men and women have different needs on Carnivore no uh it's just each individual person is going to have specific demands for protein and fat and the different nutrients that come with them um it doesn't doesn't matter if you're male or female everyone's in in a different place in their life and they need a different amount of nutrients so you know I eat maybe two plus pounds of fatty meat a day um if I'm working out much more active it might go up to four or more and then you have uh you know people like lady Claire uh who was uh vegan and anorexic and used the veganism to hide her anorexia and you we just went to places oh I'm vegan no I can't eat anything here I'm just not going to eat you know so it was it was a good excuse for her to to not eat and she got very sick she had BMI of I think nine at one point got sick just couldn't her body couldn't even fight off a flu and she died she went think she went to respiratory failure and arrest and and uh was resuscitated after 6 minutes and they're like you you have to start eating things with with meat in it you know so she did because she sort of ate a bit of it for about a year she said she was surviving but not alive she wasn't living and then after a year she went on a carnivore diet and just all of a sudden her life came back her brain came back and she started she was eating 8,000 calories a day that's what her body needed she was extremely deprived and so she was she was eating more meat than I was you know she's a very slender too slender person at the time and you know I'm you know 240 pounds you know and so it's not um it's not about male or female it's about where you are how much nutrients your body needs so is one a day enough for me it seems to be unless I'm unless I'm working out heavily so what you need to do is you just listen to your body there's no things you need this many grams this many this that's that's not going to apply to a lot of people you just need to eat enough fatty meat that you get to a point where it doesn't taste good anymore it will taste good if your body wants it it'll stop tasting good when your body doesn't want it and so you just keep eating until fatty meat stops tasting good and then you stop so um yeah so that's all you do and you try that at least once a day if you can add in a second time or if your body needs a third time fine you know you do that so you just listen to your body you know if you're an athlete and you're working out a lot your body's going to need more and if you're not giving your body requisite nutrition you're going to lose more weight than you maybe you want to and you're not going to pull it on and uh you know put on more muscle mass than you than you may want to or need to depending on your goals for uh for working out but you know my friend Ron talbat who's been on the show a couple times you know NCAA division one all two-time allamerican in the decathlon um you know went carnivore and his his performance just went through the roof at first he was losing too much weight and weig he just needed to eat more so we like hey you just need to find places you can stuff in meals and so he did that and then he got he had the other problem where he was putting on too much muscle he was just like I actually have to like pull back on my workouts and not work out as much because I'm I'm putting on too much muscle I'm getting heavier than I want to and I've got to you know Run and Jump and pull and do all these sorts of things and so he needed to he needed to keep his his weight in a certain range and get that you know power to weight ratio up and so that's a pretty interest it's a pretty good problem to have I'd say so medium rare to rare whatever you want whatever your preference is I like rare like just seared and then basically raw in the middle and um but whatever you want you know we've been cooking meat for 800,000 years I don't think there's a problem with cooking meat I think there you you you make some nutrients more bioavailable by cooking you make some less bioavailable you make some you know not available you cook them out such as you know torine and and glutamine things like that so I think go by preference and how you feel if you're for me I'm just eating less and less cooked meat you know BR meat's pretty good actually that's what rare meat tastes like the rare meat in the middle that's what raw meat tastes like it's pretty damn good so that's that's what I do anyway and you know for this one too you know think about you know ask ask a question this do the male and females of any species eat different diets no you know you might have a higher demand for food and nutrition at a certain time in your life like pregnancy and breastfeeding uh for a woman or if you're severely underweight or something like that you've come through famine or about a veganism then you know maybe you're going to need more nutrients but there's no no difference between male and female male and female lions eat gazelle you know they all take down a kill they all eat that same kill um you know same with male and female elephants male and female blue whales male and female Condors I mean it's just it's just the same thing so um yeah it's it's going to be the same for us too Molly and Neville thank you very much for the Super Chat strict carnivore for over four months lost my cycle the last month what could be the reason be plays well a lot of people have hormonal disruptions or just hormonal changes it's not really disrupting it it's more balancing out if you're not eating enough if you're exercising too much if your stress levels are way too high if your sleep is crap those can all affect your cycle as well if you're eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you're doing that every day then you should be optimizing your health and you know depending on your age at some point people will lose their period even on a carnivore diet but there I I've seen it it's been pretty typical for people to have some sort of disruption of their period which is just a a demonstration that your hormones are sort of changing and rebalancing um and that you usually goes back to a very regular schedule or even a more more regular schedule after about four or five months so you're sort of at four months so normally I'd see that initially when people are changing and then they get to the sort of four five months more and then it sort of gets back to normal um so hopefully that just is just a blip for you but make sure you're eating enough make sure you're eating enough fat your hormones are made out of cholesterol remember you're not taking anything else there going be other medications and other sorts of things that can get in your body and interrupt them right so make sure that you know we we we we change to a carnivore diet and we think that's the only thing that's going to change in our life and then we don't realize we've added other things in our life or we've taken away other things in our life and that can affect it as well so always keep that in mind there's other variables and stress levels and um and stress levels and sleep issues those can make you lose your cycle pregnancy can also make you lose your cycle as well so obviously you know you need to need to sort of think of all the different sorts of options but if you're just if you're eating enough meat you're eating enough fat and you're not not doing anything else the diet shouldn't make your cycle worse if anything it should make it better but there can be sort of a you know a bit of a disrupt for a couple months and then it generally gets back to normal so hopefully that is the case with You Vince s thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Anthony I was on Carnivore for 70 days derailed during the holidays for 20 days but now back on it very good uh day 14 um and the past few days I had hunger but no appetite which one should I prioritize um interesting I think you you know a lot of times early on you're you're hung signals can get a bit disrupted we get um carb Cravings sugar Cravings those sorts of things that aren't actually to do with Hunger it's to do with our body and possibly even our microbiome desperately wanting this drug that they that they are used to so you still just do the same thing try eating fatty meat at least once a day and keep eating it until it stops tasting good so as long as it tastes good keep eating and then once it stops tasting good stop eating and it's the same thing and then and then sort of signals will sort of get back to normal always people always have to relearn their hunger signals they are very different on a carnivore diets so just make sure that you're that you're being aware of how what what signals your body's giving you say is this hunger is that what my body's telling me try eating meat or eggs if it tastes good you're hungry keep eating right and uh should settle down anyway that um maybe just just you know just a bit of more of a retransition issue um but yeah same thing same principle applies try eating at least once a day if it tastes good keep eating till the Stop's tasting good and you should be fine Nicole s Maria thank you very much for the super chat um question is 54 year old female um recent cancer diagnosis current chemo radiation soon uh serotic liver found during uh cancer surgery can you speak to carnivore benefits in the setting of non-alcoholic fat liver curosis 50 pounds overweight in all Labs within normal limits well within normal limits for for the lab is generally average for the community you know for your your complete blood counts and your renal function and liver function there's they're pretty good um some people just you know for their kidney function if Ura is elevated that's not necessarily bad thing um if your creatinine is normal but your Ura is elevated that's not kidney dysfunction that's not your body not being able to clear Ura it's just it's high for other reasons because if the creatinine's low and normal kidneys are clearing just fine um and you can you can just make more Ura when you're when you're metabolizing protein for energy which often doesn't even happen if you're getting enough fat as well and then your body's using fat as energy and not using proteins energy you ually protein as building blocks and building material same with that but you use it for energy as well so as far as um non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver curosis this has largely been shown to be a consequence of of fructose you eliminate these things out of your body goes away could be highly refined carbs and Seed oils can also play a role medications can certainly play a role uh different um plant toxins can certainly play a role in damaging your liver so non-alcoholic covers everything apart from alcohol so there's a lot of different things the main thing is is you're eliminating out all of them when you go on a carnivore diet and you just you let your body get on with it curosis is scarring so that is permanent but that doesn't mean that the whole thing is fibrotic and and just one big lump of scar tissue if you have curosis that means it's it's pretty Advanced there's a lot of scarring there's a lot of damage to the liver so the you know it's most important for you now just to get all that stuff out of your system so your liver what parts of it are still functioning can get back to normal can get rid of the fatty liver uh issues can get rid of the the other sorts of harm and toxins that are happening to the liver so that the rest of it does not become cerotic as well and so um you know you get fatty liver then you get therosis right so it's fatty liver is is reversible damage therosis is irreversible damage we have people that have scarring and it it softens you know I have have scars here that were just you pretty noticeable from rugby and now they're they're very very uh subtle now you know so scarring isn't going to go away completely but maybe it just sort of softens it a bit but your if your liver has a high capacity for recovery so it's um it's uh still very likely that if you address this now and you know go on Carnivore stay on Carnivore and the you know the chemo and radiation don't further damage your liver that you can make at least you know you you can make back as much ground as you can and hopefully not have problems with your liver going forward and and that's my hope as well you know same thing is going to going to help with your weight loss as well being on a carnivore diet a ketogenic diet um is going to help potentially with your cancer diagnosis as I mentioned please do watch Professor Thomas C Freed's interview on my channel um and where we talk about this ketogenic metabolic therapy with cancer diagnosis also not even um in that in that talk that we did U I don't think it was in that talk but anyway there are studies showing that being in ketosis on a ketogenic diet when you're getting Chemo when you're getting radiation helps optimize your results with chemo and radiation so studies published in 2019 2020 showing that being on a ketogenic diet improve it sensitized the cancer cells to chemo and radiation so it made the more cancer cells die and it protected your native healthy cells more as well so you had less damage to your body and the cancer had more damage to it and it also helps from an energy State as well starving out the cancer so uh I think that going on a on a high fat meat-based carnivore diet is going to is going to improve all of those issues that you just raised and so you know good luck to you I hope things go really well Michael Greco um has a question here Dr chaffy is there any reason the Randall cycle is not talked about I see this is the cause of inflammation where the cells have two sources of energy and can only use one at a time blocking the other no it's it's talked about um fairly regularly you know um Dr um uh Bart K Professor Bart K talks about this you know a lot and he he he would be you know the expert in it and um you know he's he's been teaching this sort of stuff for you know 25 years and now and now teaching it on on you know YouTube and the internets as he says so that I would I would go check that out I mean he he does uh great works very very interesting um his interview on my channel we got into the Randall cycle as well I thought it was fascinating and um you know absolutely explains a lot that's going on in our body in our biochemistry so uh yeah so I you know I think that you know for me I I really love that stuff I think it's very interesting I try to keep things very you know Broad and just speaking general principles go back to First principles what are we as a species what are we supposed to eat what are all animals supposed to eat they supposed to eat what they've been eating for millions of years what have humans been eating for millions of years you know let's keep this simple and um and then you you look at things like the Randall cycle and you see how that fits in he's like y that fits in perfectly this is actually very very good thing this is this makes perfect sense in that context of we're only supposed to eat meat when you only eat meat the Randall cycle you know is um you know it's sort of doesn't you know doesn't uh cause problems you're not getting all these excess carbohydrates that are sort of screwing up uh your cells and your your cellular metabolism so no I think that's um that is something that's spoken about not as many people know about it you know I didn't really know about it uh until I spoke with Professor K so that's where I would go um I sort of leave that stuff to to him because he's he's the guy who knows the most about it so check out his channel if you haven't already um and uh yeah and our interview was was excellent it was this fantastic interview um you know i' I've done two two interviews I've had him on my channel twice um and they they were both great the first one we we had you know two three hours that we were really just really dug into it so you know and we talk about the Randall cycle there as well Maria Lancaster thank you very much for the Super Chat oral health and the carnivore diet I am M 43 swollen tongue deep grooves covering the surface scalloped tongue around the edges indicator of other health problems carnivore fixed uh yeah well that can be it can be a sign of nutritional deficiencies um and so you know I don't haven't seen your tongue so I don't know what that lines up with you know I'm not the the the best at those I mean there are things that we go over in medical school that you know just hasn't been part of my practice um in the last decade so it's not something that that I see too many of but yeah no that's that's a well-known thing you start having these physical changes to your mouth to your tongue your nails they can they can mean very specific nutritional deficiencies and a carnivore diet is not deficient in any nutrients and so if you're eating a carnivore diet then you should not have any of these uh problems um or you should at least try it should at least start filling the gaps you know it can take a long time it can take months and months and months of even eating you know a proper human diet a proper biologically appropriate diet with replete with the nutrients uh it can take months before you catch up this is why things like liver early on are a great idea to sort of catch you up you you sort of add those things in now and start going on a carnivore diet and and that will hopefully improve you need to see your doctor though you know if there's something specific you know if you're having a health issue you know you should see your doctor about that if it does turn out to be a nutritional deficiency then yes a carnivore died especially with some liver to help catch you up quicker would be very helpful if you have a specific uh nutritional deficiency that is severe and is causing problems a targeted supplement in the short term probably a good idea if you had extraordinarily low B12 I would get a B12 shot you know it is really important to have normal levels of B12 and if you're in the normal range for B12 you're low I mean that's i' I've just never seen a a B12 range anywhere in the world that actually encompasses what I would consider the optimal range for B12 so you know if you're sort of middle of the pack for B12 low normal for B12 I'd say you you definitely need more B12 and so um just just remark on that and if you're actually low for there like sweet Jesus you need some more B12 and you really do need to get probably a shot quickly you know to help you and you you'll improve your your symptoms quite rapidly at that point but again it can still take time to sort of come up it'll come up and then it'll sort of drop down it come up and sort of come down and so you need to keep eating good things eating liver eating nutritious meat getting rid of the antinutrients that that can strip these things out of your body and not let you absorb them so that is what I would do Kimberly Marshall thank you very much for the the Super Chat I had live screen testing today and awaiting the results but my labs over the past two years are showing um creatinine is 1.18 and um estimated chular filtration rate is 59 should I be concerned about continuing carnivore 3 weeks in no I don't think so um you'll be eliminating a lot of things that can damage your kidneys do make sure you're getting enough water that's a very common things of of reason that creatinine can start creeping up um but higher protein diets have been shown to actually improve kidney function not worsen it which is um you know just a a myth that needs to die so many things in in medicine have just been best guesses at the time and theyve just been didn't have anything else really competing and or maybe someone was famous enough or influ influen ual enough that the competing theories really just didn't get much air time and it just gets repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated and then it's just like oh yeah no more protein equals harm and you got to understand how doctors think if you go through Medical School you are now an expert in health and so any preconceived notions that you had even if it was based on nothing now because you are a doctor well I'm the authority and bygum that's what it is and you talk in an authoritative Manner and then when you ask him it's like okay can you can you show me the evidence for that can you show me where you're getting that from some of them will get quite defensive and and to be like all mad at you I was I was actually talking to um Dr Georgie Eid about this she you know was a you was a psychiatrist at Harvard and so during that time when she started getting more interested in nutrition she decided to do the nutrition courses at the at the Masters of Public Health sort of um uh classes at Harvard which are very plant-based people I I've known a couple people that doctors have done their masters in public health at Harvard and they came and they all came out vegans I mean that's just like oh no no no this is what it is and so there's a lot of indoctrination goes on there and her one of her professors was just all about you know fat just kills you causes heart disease and all this sort of stuff so she just asked him man this she's a doctor and she's a she's a Harvard psychiatrist right so they they should be colleagues right and so she asked him in his private rooms uh in his um uh you know in his in his office and uh just said hey you know I'm really interested in that can you show me um what like like a few of your best uh studies on on saturated fat you know causing heart disease you know I'd love to take a look at them and he got irate and just started chewing her out wouldn't answer her question you know it's just like okay so probably wasn't based on anything legitimate right so you know if you have if you have good ideas that are supported by evidence you know you'd be happy to to provide that evidence it's pretty bloody easy right so you know that's the thing with a lot a lot of medicine is just just best guess and it's just been just repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated so many times and so higher protein diets like a cornivore diet are going to improve your kidney function generally based on the on the data and I've I've seen this so many times go on to go on to those YouTube or those um Facebook forums that I mentioned zero carb Health zeroing in on health I mean I I used to be very active in them a number of years ago you know four five six years ago and um it just sort of got too busy at this point but um you know they're great and they have I I saw so many people improving their kidney function you go through the search function there you look at kidney function all the sort you will see just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of of posts probably thousands at this point where you know they talk about this and people kidne function improves I've seen three people come off dialysis which is nuts um there's another young man that has kidney failure on dialysis and he's making more urine and so that's good so he's he's putting off having a kidney transplant for a year just to see what carnivore can do for him he's about 6 months in doing very well he's not off dialysis but he is making more urine so that means something is waking up in his kidneys if they can wake up more and they can get back to a more normal function then he may not have to go through a kidney transplant and that would be amazing but maybe he does still need to maybe I mean there is such thing as as damage done just like with cerotic liver if you have permanent damage just can't be overcome completely to get normal function then you know you still have a big problem but if you're before that level then then certainly there's there's room to improve so no I wouldn't uh be worried about that in fact I i' would be very encouraged and I would expect that to get better drink enough water if you're see if your creatin is going up it's because you're not drinking enough water in this context I would say so good luck with that and uh I'm I'm sure you'll do well but please I hope that you do and please let us know how you do Brandon Schultz thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy I've been trying to stick to carnivore but struggling with constipation and stomach aches ER says it's colitis eating only a is it though eating only eggs 8020 ground beef and riby any advice please yeah just just drink eat more fat if you're if you're getting constipated as in dry hard constipated Rocky hard stools you are not eating enough fat by definition if you considering constipation infrequent B motions but they're still soft that's not constipation that's just your body absorbing 98% of the meat that you're eating and not 5% of the plants you're eating 95 coming out the other end that's what happens with fiber you cannot absorb it digest it or break it down and so it has to come out that's not the same with meat so you you'll absorb pretty much all of it 8020 ground beef is a bit more lean than I would go um and if you are having dry hard stools it's definitely too low so you just increase the fat at a certain point you will get eat enough fat that your body cannot absorb it because you have a limited capacity to absorb fat and there's an overflow valve right so if you are eating more fat than your body can absorb it's going to come out that's what's going to keep your stool soft if you're eating a lot more fat than your body can absorb it will come out in liquid form and so you will get to that point eventually if you keep eating fat and so obviously you just increase it until you get to a point that it's just nice and soft and so that's what I would do just eat more fat Mo thank you very much for the Super Chat how well can our teeth heal can cavi heal it's taught my understanding is speaking to dentists not carnivore dentists but just normal dentists that enamel will not heal cannot heal you know all all and see at this point you know I mean it's uh you know it's uh it's hard to say I mean that that is the thought is that they don't heal but they also said that you can't put on any bone density after 25 and that was wrong so we'll see I think that's a great question for uh Dr Kevin stock and Dr step Lynn both carnivore or um basically carnivore uh dentists I don't know if if Stephen is 100% carnivore he's definitely big fan of of meat base and Weston Price and and Kevin is is carnivore I think they're both carnivore pretty damn close anyway uh if not completely and um so uh I don't I haven't asked them ever if if they've ever seen cavity sort of heal on their own certainly can change your oral biome so that you don't have the bacteria that are going to cause more cavities and so it should just keep your keep your oil Health improved and just stop the degradation of your te teeth and so you sort of fix any sort of problems with fillings and this that and the other and that should be pretty stable from a cavity's perspective after that um and it will will fix gum issues like gingivitis and so that uh you know reduce inflammation and and infection and things like that so it's um it's something that be very helpful it's it's the teaching that an animal can't heal but potentially Dr Lyn and Dr Stock have seen different and that's that would be an interesting question next time I speak with him I will try to remember to ask that question from Tracy Hamp how safe is it for pregnant women in third trimester to switch to a cornivore diet it's very safe you know it's just it's you know is it you know how how safe is it to stop eating poison you know that's that's basically a rephrasing of that question because the things that you're eating besides meat can cause harm and they can have toxins in them and they can you know pass the placenta and get into your baby and so and same with your breast milk and so I think it's very safe and in fact uh very important to do this at at as very the best time to go on a carnivore diet is in the womb the next best time is right now for anybody in any situation basically I'm sure there will be examples where maybe uh it's it's not but the nutrition will always be the best maybe you have your mouth wired shut because you're an accident and broke your jaw and you just you can't physically get it in your mouth but you know that doesn't mean that the nutrition is suboptimal at that level just there's a there's a physical barrier there so uh yeah I think it's I think it's not only safe but uh important to go on this so again is it safe to stop eating poison in the third trimester yes it absolutely is is it safe to get optimal nutrition for yourself and your baby in the third trimester absolutely so um you know very fair question um but I think that uh yes it would be it's it's going to be a big benefit to you and your and your child to do that thank you for the question Super Chat from Rob thank you very much have parasites ever been a concern to you because of eating so much red meat no um you know especially like well red me has like no parasites in it in in Western countries I mean if you're if you're eating Wild game yeah sure there there's going to be parasites in there you have an immune system that's specifically set up to deal with parasites um but you know this is this is what's you know very normal to uh normal recommendation to to cook wild game more than you would you know like beef from from Safeway um the you know USDA checked beef and lamb and and meat is is um you know like if they if they have any sort of contamination or parasites or bacteria they just pull the whole load back they recall everything uh as a public safety matter so you know if you're not hearing about that if you're not hearing about a recall because of some contaminated meat that parasites or something like that it's it's pretty pretty low odds that you're actually going to get something something in there um Wild game different story different countries that don't have the same uh you know protocols in place um then testing in place different story but um no I I I don't have any any concern about that at all um you know you might have more of an issue with you know raw fish Sashimi sort of thing but you know even then um it's generally pretty safe to do that and you know they're obviously prepared in in specific ways to try to deal with that and um you know you should get symptoms you know you should get problems with that if you have couple old parasites or something like that living in you on you and you have no symptoms it's not causing any problems you know then you're not getting a problem from it if you are starting getting problems from it you know then you you see your doctor and you get it sorted out generally a day to three days of U you know these anti- parasitics and it's gone so it's pretty straightforward but uh no there's I don't I don't I don't worry about parasites and things like that in fact there are people that have horrific allergies and they purposefully introduce parasites into their system because it's their the immune system that's supposed to fight parasites that ends up attacking you as a as a as an allergy and so when your body AC starts doing what it's supposed to do which is attacking parasites it lays off on the allergy side of things and they feel a lot better with those parasites so you know you have to sort of think about uh that as well we are supposed to be exposed to parasites to a certain degree and we're supposed to be able to fight them off too which you know you largely can and if it gets out of control you use medicine uh and the help of your doctor to get to get over that Brandon roach thank you for the super chat doesn't look like something's attached but maybe further down the the chain uh just symbol AE I don't know what letter that is in Russian or something like that anyway thank you for the Super Chat I've done 32 liver flushes in the past eight years three of which were on the carnivore diet I was hoping this diet would solve my liver and gallbladder congestion but I'm still removing loads of stones with each flush any comments on this well if you have a buildup of stones have a buildup of stones and it's going to be um and it's going to be uh you know a while before those things get out but if you're eating enough fat everybody's going to be expressing this these stones in this bile so you're not going to get more Stones um as long as you're eating enough fat so it's not just a carnivore diet that does that it's getting enough fat your body makes a a specific amount of Li bile every day that gets stored in your gallbladder and that's gets expressed for you to absorb fat if if you're not eating enough fat it gets stored in the gallbladder and it just stays and stays and every day just adds up and adds up and it gets concentrated because it's a small space so it has to get concentrated so physiologically it can go up to 20 times the concentration right so maybe some people can concentrate even more who knows but either way what does any hyperconcentrated solution do at rest forms crystals right that's what gallstones are so if you're getting enough fat that you shouldn't be making any new ones um it should be the case that you are that you are uh if you're getting rid of these things that you're eventually you're going to run out of them you shouldn't make new ones if you're eating enough fat every day we also have to wonder you know what what these liver flushes are doing you know are these things actually pushing out stones or are they themselves you know forming something in our gut that looks like stones when they come out I don't know I haven't done these things I haven't looked too closely into them um but if you get an ultrasound and you have stones on your on your on your gallbladder and you know and that then that's a good sign that you have these things but if you you get an ultrasound you have no gall stones in your gallbladder and you do this cleanse and little things are coming out then it's obviously not from your gallbladder that that's happening but let's say that it is I have no reason to suspect that it's not but you know so you know it's just throwing that out there but you know let's say that it is if you are eating enough fat every day you will not make any more period right because you can't because there will be no bile in your gallbladder for uh for more to be for more precipitate and crystals to be formed so that's that's the thing just make sure you're eating enough fat JFL thank you very much for the Super Chat do do you think the carnivore diet could possibly reverse degenerative disc disease I am a candidate for a two-level disc replacement but I am not in massive pain um that's a good question I you know you after you have you know significant damage in degeneration of the disc uh probably not I mean it probably uh improve the health of the disc improve the health of your body so that excuse me so that so that it's not causing as much of a problem and if you're not having a problem if the the vertebrae are aligned you don't have a spal athesis and a slip of those vertebrae it's just it's just you have these squash discs or degenerative discs and you're not in pain you're not symptomatic you don't you don't just need surgery for the sake of it right and so um it could be that you're you're you know that you're symptomatically fine you don't have any issues so that that's fine too is it going to reheal your disc probably not you know once you get damage to the point there's just sort of desiccated flattened and degenerated you've already caused a lot of damage to that it could stabilize that will it come back probably not but uh it can certainly improve symptoms it doesn't sound like you have many symptoms but you know people can improve their pain they can improve you know a lot of different sorts of things Sor my cat's just doing weird things over there and um you know so you know if you if you don't have symptoms if you don't have a problem you don't necessarily need uh disc Replacements you don't necessarily need surgery so you know um speaking to Dr Gary feck he's orthopedic surgeon he was saying that there was already studies showing that knee degeneration like knee cartilage degener generation has been shown or at least you know some causes of KNE degeneration has been shown to be from glycation from high blood sugar that's causing damage to the cartilage and that sort of softens it and breaks it down and you get arthritis and um he said that you know there he looked through the literature for dis degeneration and see if this was caused uh or you know could be in part caused by um high glucose levels and glycation he said he couldn't find anything people just basically haven't done those studies so it' be very interesting to see if that's um you know to run that that trial and see you know collect disc material of just you know barring someone having an injury or something like that where they explode their disc that's you know that's a physical issue um you know but you can have physical issues on top of dis disease that have been glycated but you know so taking out the disc material setting it off see if it has you know these uh you know ages you know the the advanced gly and products and different signs of glycation and damage you potentially so we don't have those studies yet um but maybe hopefully someone we'll do them maybe I'll just have to do the damn thing um but either way once once the damage is done it it depending on how far gone it is probably not going to come back I had completely desiccated l45 and 5 S1 discs when I was 20 I got an MRI when I was 20 I didn't have any pain nerve pain shooting down it's just back pain just my back just bloody hurt all the time uh and then I I just inadvertently went carnivore after that no back pain for like seven years you know and I also was doing the hang upside down thing so like the the inversion table it was hanging upside down and after you sort of get used to that um obviously you know if people have specific medical issues that preclude them from doing that then don't do that talk to your doctor but for me it really helped and the combination of going carnivore and I just happen to have that hanging upside down thing at the time my God was that better and that can sort of dessicate they sort of pull things up and pull fluid and nutrients back in there so that could potentially heal it but it's completely degenerated and damaged and flattened and destroyed probably not coming back from that so it depends on on where you're at with that hit uh mix toe thank you very much for the Super Chat what's the key to lower body fat to 7 or 8% if you're stuck at 12 to 133% is it doing more workouts or eating less even if carnivore I don't think it's eating less I mean you can I mean people doing the bodybuilding sort of thing um they would they would eat a very marginally well some do like um um you know Robert Sykes goes by keto Savage I had him on my podcast he talked about this he does sort of Keto carnivore mostly keto um bodybuilding and dude's jacked you know he's he's a pro bodybuilder keto bodybuilder and he said that it works really well for him and he works for himself does for himself and he does for his clients you know it's a matter of sort of eating up and then just very slowly reducing the intake to sort of really shred down to a really low body fat percentage and uh but you have to do that very carefully you have to do that very slowly because if you do it too fast or too much then you'll actually slow your metabolism and you won't and you won't lose any more fat and you actually put on fat because that's what your metabolism does your metabolism is not stupid it's not just like a one in one out sort of thing there's a lot of inputs that uh are happening there if your body thinks that you're in a famine you're not getting enough it's it's going to hold on to your fat stores and just be it's just less coming in less going out that's all there is to it and then it's going to want to save it's going to want to want to you know protect that U that that energy resource so you could do that you run the risk of lowering your metabolism then there's people like um you know Richard Smith uh buddy of mine I've done multiple podcasts with he's European Pro bodybuilding champion and he got down like 3% completely carnivore and you know he didn't he didn't do all that cutting um to my understanding if you're working out more and you're lifting weights and you're doing Anor robic exercise you're doing sprinting you're doing weightlifting depending on your age and where you're coming from you should be able to get down to pretty low body fat percentage when I'm not working out I hover around 10% body fat when I am working out that can drop down to 5 6% very easily and that's with eating like twice as much as I normally would so you have to you have to realize too that our bodies have a particular place that they it wants our body fat percentage to be and so you know if you're eating a certain amount if you're eating what your body's telling you to if you're working out it may be that your body just wants you around 12 13% you know you can do things to manipulate that you know for like bodybuilding purposes um are they necessarily healthy no not necessarily are they going to be the best thing for your metabolism probably not what I would what I would suggest first and foremost more exercise more weightlifting more sprinting and really try to wear yourself out and that will hopefully bring that down try playing a sport you know depending on your age and where you are and and your abilities to to you know and and desire uh play rugby you know play soccer do something it's it's high intensity sprinting you're going around doing things like you're gonna get jacked you know doing a sport like that where you're just working out like crazy for multiple hours a day and going to the gym and playing games on the weekends you're just going to get shredded I mean when I whenever I was playing uh Jesus when I was playing when I was on Carnivore I mean I was just shredded but even when I wasn't on Carnivore I would get pretty shredded in season and then I'd get out of shape and put on fat and lose muscle and I have to fight to get it back again you know every time every time we start playing again uh when I was on Carnivore it was just like that throughout the whole year so you know but either way you know putting in a lot of hard work will get you a lot of good results um thank you very much Anthony um menaka for the very generous super thank you so much for that um Anthony says I have been one week on the diet and excited my father is on blood clot medication type two diabetes could this could this diet help well 100% for the for the diabetes yeah absolutely so me blood clotting medications that you know just just depends on what's causing that um quite often it's genetic issues sometimes it's atrial fibrillation so your heart's not beating properly so it can build up clots um largely people have to stay on their their um blood thining medication for whatever reason um I have seen people say that they've improved their atrial fibrillation but you you it's it's it's a bit of a gamble just sort of coming off that because even if you if you don't experience atrial fibrillation and you don't feel it anymore it's not as symptomatic anymore it may not actually mean that it's not happening because if it you have what's called paroxysmal atal fibrillation where it just every now and then just sort fibrillates and you could build up this clot and they said well after 48 hours it's you know higher likelihood you develop a clot but you could develop a clot earlier than that and so you don't know and so if you're not symptomatic it's not really affecting you you don't really notice it it's only happening every now and then you know you don't really know you run that risk of developing a clot and then having that clot flick off and cause a massive stroke so I I would work with his doctor on that one um you know there are other sort of treatments for that too for atrial for potion and people can potentially come off blood clotting medications if it's a genetic issue it could very well be that that this helps his genetics work better so that he doesn't have a clotting disorder but we have no evidence for that so I that's not something that I would personally run the risk on but type two diabetes absolutely that can reverse type two diabetes that can put that into complete remission for many people and even come off insulin and and injectables and other medication and it will improve his life in a lot of other ways well he will get a lot out of it he will be a lot healthier his life will be a lot happier he will be on less medications he will be healthier going forward and he will likely live a lot longer I I wouldn't I wouldn't expect him to be able to come off his blood clotting medication though but diabetes and the rest of it absolutely Mark Tech thank you very much for the Super Chat 34-year-old carnivore for for two weeks exma and skin inflammation noticeably worse why is that beef pork salt and a few spices eggs and seafood keto Mojo still only showing around 0.5 milles of ketones um yeah so some of these skin issues can can get worse before they get better you're in in you a lot of people have teething issues within the first couple weeks also remember that when you're losing fat you have a lot of fat but a lot of different fat soluble toxins that are stored in your adapost tissue that then get released East and then that sort of can cause weird issues joint pain muscle aches brain fog skin issues and so you know if that's the case then you know it just you just need to wait that out eventually those will get out of your system your body will clear those out and they'll go away but I mean you look around I mean there's just hundreds of thousands of people that have specifically cleared up eczema it it just takes time so some like I said sometimes it can it can get worse before it gets better if you want to if you want to make sure that nothing is is triggering this or exacerbating this just cut down to beef salt and water nothing else and uh and see how you go and then you know if you if they start getting improvements and things get better great and um and and they will eventually you know they will some some people it takes months you know it's not just a it's not just an overnight thing for everyone for a lot of people it is but um not for everyone so some people have a more stubborn case some people are leeching toxins from their fat cells you know that when they're losing weight that that's going to keep triggering this and so you just have to you have to let this stuff work its way out of your system and you have to be really really on top of it with just beef salt and water and there's also other things in your environment different soaps and detergents and fragrances and makeups and all these sorts of things that can exacerbate this so don't uh don't forget about those as well um I wouldn't worry too much about your your ketones you know it's um as long as you're eating very fatty meat very fatty meat meet like one to two grams of fat per one gram of protein and then adjusting for your body how much body how much you're absorbing how much your body needs eat until it stops tasting good you know you should be you should be fine I've never once checked my ketones I I don't think it matters much unless you're in the context of uh cancer or something like that and so you know you just you you're supposed to eat meat you're designed to eat meat get the best quality meat that you have access to can afford and that makes you feel the best and you know whatever happens happens you know if your body is in ketosis it's in ketosis if it's not it's not it really doesn't matter you'll probably be in ketosis you are in ketosis you're making blood sugar you're making glycogen because you're you know you're conscious enough to be writing this P this H Poe and so you know obviously you are making the requisite energy just because your ketones aren't through the roof uh doesn't mean that you're not not doing it your body may get better over time at doing this but you know the innu like I said their Ketone levels are pretty pretty low as well so that that's not that's not necessarily A Bad Thing the point is is that you just eat you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and that uh and that's what you're supposed to do you let your body get on with it uh Mars Zayn thank you very much for the super chats not seeing a question with that but possibly down the road here's one from our friend Brendan roach from the previous Super Chat who says my friend doesn't seem to be able to to eat she has Crohn's disease and after two mouthfuls of meat uh runs to the toilet and passes blood any suggestions you can try fasting for a period of time um I mean if she has two bites of meat and then she has a bloody stool probably that was going to come anyway you know even people with cron the transit time is not immediate um and so uh just fast you take a couple days off eating entirely and let that settle down then try eating um you know you can also check out um Dr J salsbury's book the relation of aimation and disease the relationship between what we eat and the diseases we get um and uh and he was talking about people with you know very serious digesting issues you know like Crohn's and also citis and people having horrible times with their digestion and um and you know curing that with a pure red meat and water diet also we get used to uh you know sort of psyching ourselves out when we're eating um when we're eating uh uh meat only di because we're oh my God meat meat's so bad meat so worse and maybe even had a gastrologist say don't eat meat oh my God that would make it worse bloody well won't um you know there are there are clinical trials in humans showing that if you just go on an elemental diet where you just don't you just get just nutrients in nothing else you know is highly processed sort of thing it's a scoop and you're just getting nutrients and nothing else that's a better treatment for an acute flare of Crohn's than steroids right so this is crazy so just not eating certain things is a better treatment for Crohn's than steroids uh which is the gold standard so that's what a stake is is it's um it's an elemental diet and it's just it's just the nutrients you need nothing else uh but she could she could try fasting you know just fast for a couple days it'll settle down you know and if she has a sort of a psychosomatic response you know hard to hard to uh make up you know hard to force your body to cause bloody diarrhea but you know it's um you know it's likely that she's having that anyway and it's not a consequence of the meat fast for a couple days let it settle down start introducing some meat ready meat and water is really the most important things uh to eat things like pork chicken farmed fish eggs dairy could absolutely trigger her Crohn's so red meat and water only at first and then after things settle down after a month or two you can try reintroducing things she'll probably have a problem with them stick to red meat probably for six months to a year for best results let the gut heal let that leaky gut settle down some people can re ruce things like eggs probably get rid of the egg whites the egg yolks seem to be more tolerable pasture Rays as well all these little tips and tricks um are there you can have her watch my video on autoimmune disorders it's called like you know Auto what they don't want you to know about autoimmune diseases and um and with my friend Phil escott you know he's been suffering with autoimmune issues for a long time he has autoimmune Facebook groups and he's been dealing with a lot of this stuff and you just get more encouragement and advice you know from watching those as well but uh it it will settle down maybe just try fasting a couple days and let it settle down initially and then then red meat only for a while Randall ree thank you very much for the Super Chat I've been doing carnivore since the beginning of the year have only had one pound of weight loss not currently tracking M macros should I start n not necessarily uh just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good if you think that you may be unding maybe and you can just sort of see like wow you know that's not all that many calories maybe I maybe I should eat more if you are chronically undereating then you will suppress your metabolism and your body will stop allowing you to access your fat and you won't lose very much fat also if your hormones are way out of balance if your leptin is very elevated it's called leptin resistance can be very difficult to lose uh body fat until that leptin comes down until those hormones normal aliz and then you actually find that it's much easier to lose weight after that or lose fat specifically that's the whole point is that you're you're wanting to lose fat the other thing is exercise if you are exercising you will be putting on muscle muscle has weight and so you will be offsetting some of the weight that you're losing from fat with the muscle that you're putting on and so it can you know change that up and and make it look like you're not losing weight or losing fat but you actually are losing fat it's just you're putting on muscle as well so those are to think about also um but yeah if you're chronically undereating you will slow your metabolism and you'll sort of lose a bit of weight and then it'll sort of plateau and then you might actually gain weight eating less right which is a bit paradoxical especially to those dinosaurs who still desperately cling on to the calories in calories out model even though calories aren't a thing uh you know as far as food energy is concerned that's heat energy that has nothing to do with weight calories don't weigh anything thing um molecules weigh things atoms weigh things calories don't weigh things um so you know your body is very you think of it as someone who's very fiscally responsible you lose you know you get your hours cut at work the last thing you want to do is start blowing out the credit card debt you know like every government does right so what you want to do is you want to you know cut costs live within your means and survive until you know your your fortunes change and you get more hours at work you get another job you get a raise or a promotion all these sorts of things and so your body's looking at that in the same way like no we have less coming in less has to go out we need to shut this down but also if you've been in that situation for a number of years when you get your you start making more money the first thing you do is like yeah let's buy a Ferrari it's like holy that was awful I'm going to put this money in the bank I'm still gonna I I I'm comfortable living like this we can happy to just not spend a whole bunch and be extravagant I'm gonna I'm gonna start saving as much as I can that's your fat and that's what your body does your metabolism goes down and it stays down and then when you start eating more your body goes nope that's going in the bank and that's why people yo-yo die they starve themselves for a while they get decent results and then it plateaus and not losing not losing not losing and it's miserable and so they say screw this I'm going to go back to eating the way I was and Bam spikes up and they end up putting back on more weight than they lost um so that's what happen so you want to encourage your metabolism with a carnivore diet if you're eating the right thing then you can eat as much as your body's asking you for and so you're you do that and you'll encourage your you tell your body we're not in a famine we don't need to scrimp and safe we don't need to put anything in the bank we're fine you know and then your body goes great raises your metabolism we don't need all this savings we can we can live a bit uh you know more more liberally so uh that's that's what I would do I wouldn't worry too much about it some people lose a lot of weight early on some don't you know it just takes time you know just don't worry about the scale the scale is not important your health is important your body composition is distance secondarily important weight is not important because weight does not denote body uh body composition right so you just need to give it time let your body heal your body's going through a lot of different processes now there's a lot of stuff to undo and event it will and eventually you'll keep losing more and more fat and you'll uh yeah you'll just keep getting more and more of the results that you want make sure you're eating enough eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good do that at least once a day if not twice okay super chat from Rob thank you very much have parasites ever been concern of yours while eating so much meat especially rare so I think this was Rob's question earlier um no I haven't had a problem with that in um in places that you know regularly rigorously check their meat parasites aren't really a problem I mean there hasn't even been a case of trichinosis in farmed pigs uh in over 25 years to my understanding so unless there was a recent one but um you know a few years ago I heard it was you know 20 years without one and so unless there was one in the last couple years then it's 25 years without without one so um in those in that context no I wouldn't worry about that Jennifer hackit thank you for the Super Chat uh can a carnivore diet help or reverse improved mitochondrial uh myopathy yeah absolutely so any ketogenic diet can um it can there's studies showing that being on a KET ketogenic diet for a number of months um increases the number of mitochon you have by a factor of four and increases their efficacy and efficiency by a factor of fours there's a massive massive multiplication of of mitochondrial Health also when you go on a carnivore diet specifically you are removing things that cause direct damage to the mitochondria a lot of these plant defense chemicals specifically Target and attack and damage the mitochondria like cyanide cyanide directly damages mitochondria there are 200 different plants that use cyanide like aaba you know tapioca right that's that's from cassava and that has cyanide in it almonds bitter almonds all these sorts of things they have it um and uh there are people actually in in uh Australia I was just talking to a patient about this who got very sick after eating some vegetable chips she was carnivore and obviously well I'll have some vegetables are good for you had some vegetable chips which is not the same as vegetables and she got very unwell she got very sick hit her very hard and she was very unwell and the next day she's like what the hell was that so she looked it up and these vegetable chips had tapioca flour in them then she looked it up found that other people around Australia been having health issues to do with tapioca flour and and and potentially than those vegetable chips um if I remember correctly and she looked into it and there's actually a you know for some reason there's a much higher load of cyanide in those batches of of Tapioca And and vegetables vegetable chips and so you know potentially other people have a problem so you know the who um and this this was her sort of saying that she looked into it and like the who re you know says it's safe up to like 10 milligrams a day which is like do you want any cyanide in you a day no thank you um but know it's safe up to 10 milligrams a day okay well how much is in your damn vegetable chips you know you should have a bloody warning label on there saying hey only half a bag of this a day or else you meet your maximum recommended uh cyanide allowance you know I mean why the hell isn't that on the damn chips right so they have these things out there and they're just like yeah no there's there's a maximum here you know so our our our hormetic friends are saying oh everything's good for you because of hormesis even the who says no more than this amount but that's nowhere on these packets that's nowhere on almonds you know it doesn't say you you can't eat more than this many almonds a day or you'll exceed your limit for Cyanide consumption nowhere does it say that so you know if you know that these things have have you know a toxic load after a certain amount how the hell can you ethically legally not put that on the bag and tell people hey don't eat this past this point more no more than one bag a day you know is safe it's obviously they would never sell another bag again and that's why they don't do that but like why the hell is it legal to not do that when you can have people have have this sort of injury uh even you know like cassava bitter cassava can kill you the amount of cyanide it has uh sweet cassava won't but it's uh you know viic they can sort of reduce the toxic load to a certain degree but that doesn't mean that it's getting rid of all of it and so even lowd dose uh chronic cyanide exposure can cause neurological dysfunction cause thyroid damage widespread uh mitochondrial myop mitochondrial damage and dysfunction so that's very serious and that's just one that's just one of many many plant toxins that damage the mitochondria seed oils directly damage mitochondria linolic acid directly damages mitochondria the Omega 6es directly damage mitochondri this oxidative stress that that uh lenol acid omega-6 is do in your body can directly damage mitochondria as well so a cornivore diet is eliminating out as many of those as you possibly can and and your your mitochondria just start to heal it can take months but it it can heal um let's see how many super chats we have all right um how about we cap it there uh everyone s been going for um s the last nearly two hours so why don't we um maybe ask people not to do any more Super chats we'll try to get through all of these and we sort of end it i' I think 3 hours is probably where I need to to cap this sort of ending at noon um is probably where where I should do because I I've uh we've got it's it's a stria die to die so we got some things planned there's actually rugby in town I don't know if I'll actually have time to go see it um because I've got so many other things on but uh the sevens rugby is here and it's just like that would really piss me off if I didn't get to see something and uh watch the USA uh play I don't actually no I took a look I didn't really recognize any of the players on the US team so um but uh it' be good to sort of uh watch them play anyway and support support the home team in the away crowd so um and then obviously Australia always support the home home country that I'm in as well unless they're playing America so um but yeah be great to see those guys um so uh Super Chat from Jasmine Ortiz thank you very much for that doctor I've been on Carnivore for seven days now now overall I feel great however sometimes my stomach feels sore and Bloated is this common um you know not necessarily but you know it's not it's not it's not abnormal you know your body's going to be going through a lot of things it's only been a week that's very early days and a lot of times your body is healing from from uh from a lot of things that um you know damage that you've done to your body so just give it time you know it's likely this is something that's going to heal uh just eat fatty meat till it stops tasting good cut out everything else herbs spices all those sorts of things because your body could be reacting negatively to those um red meat and water for best results and you know should settle down and you should should keep getting better better as long as it's just you're not eating anything else with the meat especially red meat you can also do like a a food journal diary where you sort of see like you know if certain meats or certain spices or whatever you cut out just cut out all the spices just to be safe but certain Meats if they're giving you stomach ache or not you know say what you ate at what times and you know if you got stomach ache and if you did at what time sometimes you can see an association there and and that can help guide you as well um silvercat 151 thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy my 76-year-old husband has stage five less than 10% kidney function and two uh iliac aneurysms would a carnivore diet help with his kidneys I'm worried whether it would help or make make things worse um in in my experience and according to the literature higher protein diets improve it that's what the literature shows is that higher protein diets improve kidney function or can improve kidney function depends on what's causing the kidney function dysfunction um and carnivore dietes absolutely remove so many things that are directly damaging to your kidneys like oxalates and other toxins that can be nephrotoxic also uh there's new research coming out showing that ketogenic diets uh in general will help with polycystic kidney disease which is a major cause of kidney dysfunction and and um failure so not really going to probably not do anything for the aneurysms but the kidney disease potentially depending on what's causing it it could it could improve that and so I I would think that that would be uh helpful uh for him and um i' I've seen a number of people reverse even uh that level of kidney dysfunction and it's certainly not going to make him worse drink enough water as long as he's not on fluid restrictions you know obviously that you know take that um you know listen to your doctor on that but you know if otherwise you drink as much water as he's as is appropriate for him to drink that can help improve the kidney functions and then going on a cornivore diet has absolutely helped people's kidney functions even with as advanced uh disease as your husband depends on what's causing his his kidney dysfunction as to whether that's going to improve it and make it better but it will not make it worse um I don't think so that's um that's i' I've never seen people's kidney function get worse on this and you know again according to the literature higher protein diets improve kidney function they don't worsen them so good luck with that Jason hum thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat it's very kind of you um Jason says don't have any questions I live the same life as you for the Last 5 Years life is optimal and I'm thriving I hope to meet you someday uh what you're doing is great well thank you Jason I really appreciate that and that's awesome that you've been doing this for five years it's you know it's great to see more and more people that have been doing this for a long time and can you know share their experiences with others and show them like hey look no we're all doing this and and it's all great and so uh thank you for that thank you for sharing and yeah hope to meet you too you know if you're in the states I'll be at ketocon in what is at may end of May and uh there's a number of other um conferences that I'll be at um in Australia and in England and uh even one in Spain so that's kind of cool too and uh yeah and so if you're around definitely come out and uh and check them out Penny awful thank you very much for the Super Chat to what extent do calories matter on Carnivore well look I mean you well calories don't matter because it's not a it's not a proper a description of of the energy that we're getting from food but Food Matters you know if you're eating a certain amount of food your body's going to respond in a certain in a certain way if you're eating less then your body's not going to have sufficient nutrients and nutrition uh to function properly you're going to slow down your metabolism you may actually even gain fat you certainly won't be as healthy as you could be if you are eating to the extent that your body is asking you to generally that that's optimal if you're Force feeding yourself past that it's usually very pretty difficult to overeat on a carnivore diet because it just doesn't taste good and you don't want to but you can do it and if you do that then yeah sure you know it's not going to be the the right thing for your body and it could mean that you put on extra fat or you know have other sorts of issues but um as I think what people generally mean when they ask this question is do they have to track macros and all these sorts of things on a carnivore diet and to that I would generally say no if you because you can listen to your body's Natural Instincts and so if your body is telling you to eat a certain amount I think that that's pretty safe to listen to that if you eat more than that then yeah sure you're getting more than you want so the idea oh calories don't matter or the amount of food you eat doesn't matter that's not that's not what we're saying certainly not what I'm saying what I'm saying is that you don't have to tr track your Macros because your body tracks your Macros your biology your physiology and biochemistry track your Macros your brain tracks your Macros you have sensors in your stomach that track your Macros and micros and they see yep that's how much nutrients we have in there we don't need anymore and so you get a signal to your tongue that don't we don't need any of this stuff anymore stops tasting good tastes less and less good you get negative feedback from the food that you eating even though it tastes good The Next Bite will not taste quite as good and on and on and on um until it doesn't taste good at all and then that's you just stop eating you just listen to your body and and uh once it stops tasting good you stop eating so in that regard um no you don't need to like perfectly track exactly what you're eating as long as you're not on taking you know like cortical steroids like you prazone pricone something like that um or other medications that can that get that can alter your your hunger signals um you know you should be able to especially you know long term you should be able to listen to your hunger signals and so you just listen to your body so you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you stop once it stops tasting good and to that extent you don't need to to track macros and micros uh but yeah you can you eat more food and that's going in your body and food has weight and that goes into your body and then you have weight right so that's that's where that is calories don't weigh anything you know you have a glass of water at room temperature you heat it up to you know by 50\u00b0 has more calories weighs the same damn thing so uh calories is not is not an issue food is an issue you want to get enough you want to get the right amount for your body and just like any lion or hyena or V they know what to eat they stop eating naturally they don't get obese they don't get the these these sorts of diseases of excess and civilization that we get unless they're eating the wrong thing and so if you're eating the right thing your body should tell you the right amount to eat uh Clean Coal thank you very much uh for the Super Chat not seeing a question attached but oh here we go uh can an undiagnosed bam condition be discovered uh on a carnivore diet um it would depend on what you mean by a bam condition um like bile acid malabsorption is that I'm trying to think of the acronyms there's just so many thousands of different acronyms in in medicine so um unless it's in your particular field you don't necessarily know the acronyms for that I'm going to guess that that's you know the bile acid malabsorption sort of issue um yeah I mean potentially you know if um I i' never treated that that's not something that that I do that's not part of my practice but you know if you have if you have a condition where you're not able to absorb fat properly you know and you're eating a higher fat diet then you know that can that obviously can raise its head I I would still just eat the amount of fat that your body's asking you to and um because you're going to absorb a certain amount so let your body absorb that amount and um and then you know don't don't worry about the rest it could be that your body fixes it if you're not doing well and your and your body really can't absorb fat and you need to you know you to sort of accent that and your doctor is is concerned that you need more fat and all this sort of stuff which maybe one in a thousand are going to at this point um you know then you can you can entertain things like ox bile supplementation which normally I don't think is a good idea but also if it's a malabsorption issue your body's just not able to absorb the bile you know that may not actually do anything anyway um so either way I'd still do the same thing eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good adjust the amount of fat to your absorption levels and hopefully hopefully you do well with that plant sparing carnivore thank you very much for the super chat um had covid sorry had covid 5 months ago um neurological symptoms of depression anxiety persist I'm very sorry to hear that lfts are optimal good um Alp raised to 150 um High sensitiv CRP under one ESR is 048 do studies show long Co covid symptoms worse in those Jabs your thoughts appreciate your work um I yeah I I don't know too much about this you know I mean there's a lot of things I've seen peripherally there there people that are doing a lot of really good research on this like you know Dr Peter McCulla and um and um Dr Malone who like invented the technology um the the RNA vaccine technology back in like the 90s I mean think he that's the original patents for that and other people used his technology to to sort of do these sorts of things um and so you know they're very well versed in these um I know that that Dr Peter McCulla who is is a preeminent cardiologist down in Texas and um in his specific field of Cardiology is the most published uh person in his whole field so you know he's he's no slouch anyway and so I think he's published a a protocol on how to how to sort of sort out getting these Spike proteins out of your system and help with long covid as well um I I don't know what that is off hand but you know you can look that up just look up his name and and um you know D toxin uh protocol um and then I was speaking to a patient about this the other day so this is secondhand information but they were saying that one of Dr mulla's um you know statements was that that people that use nicotine seem to not get as affected because the the nicotine sort of bound onto receptors that uh that that displaced the spike protein and potentially this could help with long Co don't don't quote me on that that is that is secondhand that's something someone said that Peter Mulla may have said look it up see if he does that but you know there are protocols out there um that you know by Peter Mulla and others that could potentially help with this I mean being on a on a carage carnivore diet is going to at least help your body you know optimize in as many ways as it can and hopefully get rid of a lot of other things that can may be exacerbating the long covid issues and help in in a lot of other ways you know depression anxiety these These are generally uh helped quite significantly by keto carnivore diets ketogenic carnivore diets and so I would I would certainly try that if you haven't done that I mean say in the name plant sparing carnivores you're probably already on that but you know if you have any little things slipped in there just get rid of them and then uh if that's not enough then I would I would try to check out um the different protocols um like Dr mlla that's probably one if I had that problem I probably that's the one I probably would use he's just been doing tons and tons and tons of research on this and and I think that uh that that's one I would I would personally go for Stannis L thank you very much for the Super Chat my favorite daily meal uh I like is 500 gam of 20% beef mints uh mixed with five eggs air fried in form of meatballs and added chicken liver is this good for cornival yeah it sounds great you do make sure you're getting enough fat I mean the liver is great um you know if you enjoy the the beef you know it's like you know 20% I'm assuming that's 20% fat um might be a little lean but um you know just make sure if you're getting constipated you know eat more fat add more fat to that you'll get fattier mints and uh don't you know cook it so much that you cook out all the fat and um and you should be fine but no that's great you know just as long as you're getting enough fat and you're doing well then go for it Max the dream thank you very much for the Super Chat any advice on gaining weight on Carnivore I'm young and skinny should I avoid milk starting out do avoid milk starting out that changes your fundamentally changes your metabolism spikes your insulin which you don't really want and that can cause all sorts of different problems testosterone Can it can tank your testosterone and growth hormone as well um not just one glass of milk but you know um just excessive carbohydrates longterm can do that um milk probably has different Co factors and things like that but people would argue probably increases it you know who knows but either way the um raw milk maybe but you know the carbohydrates raising insulin can interrupt your normal uh testosterone and growth hormone uh metabolism so uh I would avoid that and also it just screws with your it just screws with your metabolism in general puts you in a fat storage metabolism as opposed to a fat utilization metabolism and you don't want to gain fat you want to gain healthy lean body mass you don't want to gain fat so I would just I would avoid milk I'd avoid Dairy and I would eat uh just as much fatty meat as you uh enjoy and work out you know you need to lift weights you're still a young young uh person so you know you need to you need to uh sometimes just you have to just put on years and years and years and work I was pretty skinny when I was a kid and I started working out more regularly you know hitting the gym just lifting weights and lifting weights and exercising and working out I was just I just started putting on more and more weight and more and more weight and eventually I got to a pretty good muscle base that I maintain pretty easily on a carnivore diet so you just need to work out push yourself in the gym you know a responsible uh but you know intense workout regime and you need to eat enough so you need to eat keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good you need to try to do that at least twice a day if you are uh on if you're on a um uh you know if you're trying to gain muscle if you're working out a lot right so you know you need to eat enough if you're working out you're sprinting you're lifting weights and you're eating enough you'll put on weight you'll put on muscle more easily than um than you ever have before hands down and it's lean body mass you're not putting on it's not doing this stupid bulking nonsense you're just putting on a whole bunch of fat and glycogen and water weight that you didn't have to lose anyway you're just putting on muscle mass and so that's and that that's that's there for good I mean you keep that as long as you um keep stimulating it and keep eating right Kimberly Marshall thank you very much for the Super Chat when you say eat more fat and 8020 ground beef is still lean uh what would you recommend wagu and not drain the fat then add butter well it does it's not necessarily wag you it's just you know a higher fat content so um you know I say one to two grams of of fat per one gram of protein that's generally the range that people want to get into depends on their body and what they're doing um but you just aim for that what is two grams of fat to one gram of protein in ground beef terms it's 65% lean 35% fat that's two to one fat protein so that's what you want to sort of aim for 70327 is around one to oneish you know so that's pretty good um you know so that that's what I would aim for you know that sort of range you know if you're not quite getting that if it's sort of 8020 to add some grass-fed butter to it or some grass-fed Tallow even better butter probably tastes better but Tallow probably is better uh but they're both good and so but it's it's all about you know taking it in as much as your body wants right and so if you're getting constipated dry hard Rocky stools you know you're not eating enough fat if you're getting liquid stools you could be eating too much fat or you could be so constipated that you're getting a pseudoobstruction and there's just liquid stools is is squirting around it and you get you know liquid diarrhea watery diarrhea intermix with you know these horrible Boulders that come out every now and then um then you need a lot more fat so that that's what I mean everyone's going to be different in what they in what their body needs go by your stools and go by your body and and what tastes good and what your body uh is telling you to do coffee house for truth Seekers thank you very much for the Super Chat I was at the hospital today uh with severe vomiting I'm sorry to hear that it tasted like fish and a chatbot told me it could be the thha from excess protein uh I don't know about that I've certainly never heard that I don't know why you would um um I don't know why you would get vomiting from um from that I don't actually know what th is standing for um as well again these are these acronyms that you know uh there's so many acronyms in the world I just I don't know them all so um uh please do spell those out uh everyone um don't just assume that I know the the acronym because I know some of them I don't know all of them but either way I don't I don't think that anything um you know that that you're going to get vomiting from too much protein um either way just listen to your body take it easy when you start eating again when your stomach settles down just start with you know just small amounts ease your way into it lift your way up if you're eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good you shouldn't have any of those problems it should not cause vomiting there many many many many things can cause vomiting I have never heard of uncontaminated meat causing uh vomiting I've eaten a lot of beef jerky I've eaten a lot of lean meat I've eaten a lot of fatty meat never seen that and I haven't heard of that either um so I don't think that that's what it was but you know you either way just be careful EAS your way back into eating and you should be fine uh Le petulante thank you very much for the Super Chat this is very generous of you hello Dr chaffy um I'm mom developed guon ber symptoms uh three months ago still in pain after two courses of immunog glob globulin any feedback please with gon baret syndrome and carnivore please thank you very much uh greetings from France well hello France um Deon Beret is a neurological disorder sort of an ascending paralysis starts from the feet up it's very serious and um obviously needs to be treated directly by a neurologist generally in the hospital and so um do listen to the doctors and and and and follow any sort of medical protocols and medications um as far as cornivore concerned I have seen a lot of extremely encouraging neurological recoveries going on a carnivore diet I mean even you know uh that my friend Dave Mack who I've had on the podcast and I've done a couple lives with he had a stroke 30 years ago had right-sided weakness that hadn't shifted in that all that time he went Carnival for two months and it it significantly improved his symptoms so that he didn't really have to worry about it he was able to to walk normally go up and downstairs nor was able to run up and downstairs uh now where normally he he was very very very unstable on his feet so it can it can it has anyway uh helped with significant neurological recovery so that could very well be the case with your mom I don't have any U studies for that you know this is just something that is is very much worth trying and seeing specifically with G guon Beret it's not something that's common enough that I've seen too many cases of this so I don't know of too many people that have had guon Beret and gone carnivore however there are some but again this is just there's a few people's individual experiences that were positive and also they get other a lot of other positives from the diet as well so it's still worth doing hopefully that improves your mom's symptoms it will improve a lot of other things for her as well so if it's something that she is able to get on and I think it would help hopefully it will help with the guon Beret it will definitely help with everything else so good luck with that good luck with to your mom Bishop steep learning thank you for the the Super Chat thoughts on bone broth um it's fine you know I mean I don't think you should be just guzzling tons of it um because it might make you eat less meat which is what you need bone broth obviously is doesn't have all the nutrients that you need and so you might be you might end up eating less meat which has all the nutrients you need and not be not be so well off but you know when people are having coffee or tea and they like having a warm drink from for the ritual side of things having bone broth or you know uh you know the British used to call it beef tea my great-grandfather used to do that have like a thermos of this stuff and go to you know soccer games or something like that and they'd have beef tea they just sort of warm something warm and keep you warm throughout the the cold miserable freezing games and so you know that's something that you can do and that then that's something that can be quite enjoyable for people um I wouldn't I wouldn't go to town on it I wouldn't go too much because you know you know like I talked about with your taste you know your body wants these nutrients if your body wants those nutrients they're going to taste better and so there are nutrients in bone broth and so you'll get that good taste it taste good taste good taste good taste good and then your body's going to taste less good less good less good less good less good and so now you start eating meat those same nutrients that were in the beef tea now don't taste as good the bone broth don't taste as good because you already have them the other ones taste good but the overall experience may be a bit lower this's all theoretical of course but you know it could be that this affects your taste and it stops tasting as enjoyable earlier before you get all the other nutrients that you need right so you're getting some of them and that that can sort of curtail your experience to it so that's my concern with that and that's something that that the longterm people like can uh zero carb Health um have said i' I've seen them mention that in years past about how this this could potentially make you eat less and get less nutrition which is not what you want so but if you're using it every now and then having a cup here and there and because you enjoy it I don't think there's any problem with that um just don't don't have too much I wouldn't have it every day and uh certainly not have it in abundance every day Kevin Moore thank you very much for the Super Chat what is your opinion on fermented foods and non-alcoholic fermented drinks like drinking vinegars um does fermenting the food make it safer through the body it certainly does make it better it can it can lower the toxic load of certain plants I mean I don't I don't think it will lower toxic load plan I don't think you can just ferment anything necessarily I think things that we've traditionally been fermenting we've been traditionally fermenting them for a reason there's sort of that stood the test of time that's going to lower the toxic load and increase the bioavailability of the nutrients that's why we ferment a lot of things that's why we put things through a process like nich talization which is what we used to do to Corn what the mesoamericans used to do corn in order to lower the toxic load and increase the bioavailability and he just said oh corn look at that it's easy it grows well you know let's take it and they they took the corn they didn't take the nalization which is where the word tomale comes from and so not great not what you want and so you're not going to get as many nutrients and it's G to have a higher toxic load so yes it will reduce the toxic load does that make the toxic load zero don't know depends on what it is depends on what's fermenting it depends on what can be addressed by fermenting probably not it's probably reducing it but not eliminating the toxic load um and vinegars I mean that's like oxidized alcohol I don't know if that's a great idea certainly not to drink it I certainly wouldn't recommend drinking apple cider vinegar I don't think there's any point on a carnivore diet we we got to think of these things biologically what we're designed for what were we eating 50,000 years ago during an Ice Age wasn't apple cider vinegar you know most likely apples probably didn't exist you know in the tundra on the Frozen Tundras of of the ice ages so really just eating meat and so I think that that's what you do as a baseline some things are going to be more or less bad for you and fermenting is certainly going to improve things and apple cider vineer may have benefits in certain circumstances like any medicine can but you don't just take antibiotics for the sake of taking antibiotics because they well they have antimicrobial fixs like yeah but you don't have an infection so that's not a benefit right that's not something that's going to help you you're actually going to damage yourself you're going to kill your microbiome and your oral biome and uh you know unhealthy bugs can can take over and you don't have the diversity right so that's that's a reason why you wouldn't take uh antibiotics just for no damn reason but then people say oh you should take garlic and you should take ginsen because they're antimicrobial like same reason why you wouldn't take antibiotics you shouldn't take those things so same same you know if if there's some sort of reason that you're taking apple cider vinegar is helping with that fine you're using sort of medicinal P purpose I can't think of any uh medicinal purposes for apple cider vinegar in the context of a carnivore diet I don't I don't think that that would benefit you if you want to try it and see how you go and go for it like I I I don't know why it would help you or what situations it would help you in um but is it less bad than other things sure but that doesn't mean that it's the best thing for you so people people should understand that that's what I'm talking about when I talk about you know the recommendations that I have for eating the way I eat I'm talking about what what do I think is the absolute best optimal maximum that you can do I'm not talking about well everything is bad except for this I'm saying that this is the Pinnacle and that's what what I aim for and so if you're aiming for the Pinnacle this is what I would do um other things can be perfectly fine and be a lot healthier you know especially in respect to other people eating other garbage um but the bar I'm setting is okay what's optimal let's shoot for the best you know and then if you miss you're you're at least you're missing up right you know because you're you're still you know you're going up and say a let's go let's shoot for the middle here and then you you hit lower than that aim for the top and if you you fall short of that you're still doing a lot better than than everyone else so that's that's what I mean when I talk about those sorts of things yes you can ferment food isn't the best thing you could ever do um as far as a toxic load sort of thing no from a a nutritional standpoint no you get all the nutrients you need from meat you don't need fermented foods you know if you wanted to reset your microbiome that's something you could think about if you had fermented food that had the live bacteria in it which is not always the case if you're buying it from the store um then you take a small amount chew it up with meat you swallow it together so you get that bacteria past your stomach and small intestines to where it's uh it can sort of live and thrive you probably can do the exact same with uh you know with Greek yogurt with plain Greek yogurt and uh and do just fine uh I've never used fermented plants I've had some Greek yogurt things like that I'll I'll probably get my microbiome checked here at some point um but I've never had any sort of issues that would make me suspect that I have a microbiome uh dysfunction and um you know the Inuits don't really use fermented vegetables or anything like that they have some of the health healthiest microbiomes ever studied when they're only eating meat so and also if you're oh and um and when you're when you when you have an established microbiome the things that you're eating should you be eating the right thing should perpetuate that microbiome so um I think that you know if you once you get that done with fermented vegetables or fermented dairy fermented meat you know whatever uh once you've EST L your microbiome it should can perpetuate just eating meat and that seems to be what happens with the Inuit and and others this go the prebiotics Prebiotic and probiotic right probiotic has the bacteria and Prebiotic feeds the bacteria meat is a Prebiotic and so once you get the right bacteria in there it should should keep them there Bary Jones and danger dog thank you very much for the Super Chat does lactose feed cancer like other suar sugars do any any well so lactose is is a disaccharide meaning there's two carbohydrate molecules chemically bonded uh and and and that's glucose one part glucose one one part galactose and so your body Cleaves that and then it's just glucose coming into your body so it's glucose and yes that will feed cancers galactose goes in your body it's metabolizing process and turned into glucose so yes that that can indeed feed your cancers uh like other other carbohydrates do Stanis lot thank you very much for the Super Chat is it healthy to eat whatever melts and falls to the bottom of the air fryer after cooking uh yeah it should be fine as long as you're sort of keeping it clean you're not of letting it build up and get get you know Mankey um but you know if it's if it's sort of clean when you start and you sort of do that and it renders fat out yeah you can absolutely pour that fat back on and you should I was actually going to suggest that earlier when we're talking about you know air frying the the meat and liver and things like that uh yeah you should be you should you you should be able to eat the rendered fat at the bottom of that absolutely Rob Stewart thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy could you advise on your refrigerator setup my um most beef beef keep in plastic or glass uh but one of your older vids with fridge had it everywhere open air any particulars uh for preservation thank for what you do so if you if you're so what you want to do is you get it in um the the cryovac packs from the store right so you're not doing it yourself that that should be able for beef anyway don't do this with like chicken or pork or fish or anything like that but um for beef you can keep it in that vacuum steel cryovac uh packaging and um and then that then that will um sit in the fridge for very safely for a long time you don't need to freeze it you you can it's very common that people like restaurants will see like 30-day wet age 30-day dry age steaks if you really want to spend a fortune on a on the dinner and that's what wet aging is he just keeping in that cry backpack and it just sort of softens and tenderizes and and gets nicer um and then after that you're sort of doing a bit of a dry age so I'm not doing a full dry age where I'm letting the bacteria soak in and get hard and and things like that on the outside and then trimming that off and just having the inside it's more of a of just drying it out so you might call like a dry brine although I don't really use salt anymore I just let it dry out a bit and that concentrates the flavor if you put salt on it before enough salt for you doesn't have to be a ton of salt just as much salt as you enjoy then uh that salt soaks in helps dry it out a bit and it concentrates the flavor it Browns much better too and so it sort of crisps up and is nice and has a nicer flavor and so that's what I do so you put it on a wire rack on a cooking sheet and uh not touching anything else so it can't be touching anything else you needs air circulating around all sides at some point you want to flip the stakes over so the bottom side gets more air exposure as well um as long as you do that it doesn't go bad it just dries out turns into beef jerkey you know if you leave it long enough don't leave it that long and um you know so play with it when I do I like 3inch thick steaks you know so you know big big bastards and so that I mean those things can be sit in the fridge for you know two three weeks it's still moist in the inside right not not as much but you know it is and it it just tastes amazing Browns and crisps you know so much better than any other Sak you'll ever find in your entire life it's just amazing and um so just play with that play with you know this thickness of steaks that you have if you know much thinner it's like you don't really want to do that more than a couple days because it's just going to dry out too much and it's not going to it's not going to be as nice so just do that and um and see how much uh time you like having it in the fridge and just make sure it's not touching anything so that it doesn't grow bacteria because if it's touching other meat it'll grow bacteria at that point of contact Giovani thank you very much for the super chat um if I have two cheating days of a lot of sugar is that a dramatic switch if you are in full ketosis for the body uh or the body adapts to that look you know anytime you're putting poison in your body it's going to have an effect on your body it's going to have a negative effect on your body the longer you're you're on a ketogenic diet you're not eating sugar the less your body worries about you doing something silly like trying to poison it with sugar um and so when you're eating chronic carbohydrates your body preloads insulin it pre- makes it and it's ready to go because it is so important for you to get that blood sugar down because it is toxic uh after after normal uh blood sugar levels and so when you stop doing that your body goes oh thank God this person is actually being smart about this and it doesn't preload your insulin okay so what happens is then you eat sugar and your blood sugar goes up too high your body's scrambling to make insulin so you have a transient bigger spike in sugar but then it comes down so is it all that huge of a deal not all that much in a couple days you'll start pre- makak insulin again because your body is you know just giving up on you and just decided it can't trust you and it just has to make this stuff and defend itself um and then you stop after that you know fine that's better than than if you kept going certainly and so having a couple days every couple months not every week um then you know it's uh you know your body can tolerate that if you're doing it every single week really what you're doing is you're keeping yourself addicted to an addictive substance and you're never going to get over cravings and you're never going to get uh through this and feeling the best and being in you know proper ketosis and and having your body work properly it's going to take a couple days to recover from that and get back into ketosis and then you're eating sugar again and uh and you're just starting the process over again you're keeping yourself a so I certainly wouldn't do two days every week by any stretch of the imagination I don't think that's great for you also remember that you know you you guys should watch Dr Gary fet Key's um lecture on fructose and sugar and how it's how it's a toxin how how high blood sugar is a toxin so as he points out you you at any time you have four grams of glucose in your body four grams of sugar and just increasing that by one gram up to five grams is a toxic load is toxic to your body and your body responds to it as a toxin by trying to detoxify it that's what it raises the insulin to get that blood sugar below four grams below four grams it's safe above four grams it is toxic and so after years and years and years of doing this to yourself you can develop diabetes your blood sugar starts going up in spite of massively raised insulin and you start getting significant damage to your body through glycation those fructose mole or glucose fructose molecules do it too all carbohydrate molecules do it physically fusing to other molecules and and permanently damaging them and this is what permanently damages diabetics this is what causes them to die this is what causes them to get their legs amputated for their kidneys to fail for their heart to fail for their brain to fail for their life to fail so this is from one extra gram of glucose in your body it is poison so you know our our friends who drone on about hormesis without any evidence or any backing or any specific examples this might be a useful example below four grams glucose is beneficial above four grams it is toxic so that's the line and you have to know the line you know just like the who says you know 10 milligrams of cyanide is is fine it's not fine well let say it's fine at least you're drawing a line and then you say okay well I'm going to eat this amount they don't tell you how much cyanide is in cassava or in almonds or in tapioca or in any specific product that uses any of those ingredients they don't tell you that they just have it in some obscure back web page on the who saying oh yeah it don't have more than 10 milligrams of of Cyanide and then you look at tapioca okay how much tapioca is in here how much Cai is in Oh okay that's 16 times times the amount of cide I'm supposed to have in a day in this one little tiny packet of vegetable chips they don't tell you that crap but you know there if something is hor and Al a hormesis with with uh with cyanide that I'm aware of it just causes harm and so um you there's no hormetic line there there's a there's a well we we we're okay with you if you poison yourself to this extent thanks I appreciate that how about you how about you do it you know and and then you can tell me how great that was um so I think that that our body really bends over backwards to try to keep your blood sugar down because it is so toxic you're raising your insulin which disrupts your hormones all your hormones and completely rearranges your entire biochemical structure your metabolism and your physiology that is a major major major blast to your system that's a major effect that it's having it changes your brain and your heart and the rest of your organs from running on their optimal energy source which are ketones to now run running on the secondary backup uh fuel source which are which is glucose it's so important to your body to detoxify your blood sugar down below four grams that is willing to let your brain run on secondary fuel source that should tell you something that's pretty shocking so you can cheat but it's just like having cheat days with cigarettes cocaine alcohol heroin you know child abuse like you just it's not a good idea it's not a good idea it's something that that is is causes a net harm uh in in the world right so you don't want to do that so there are some things that you just you just want to cut out Sugar's really one of them sugar is absolutely one of the worst and also when you have cheat days people tend to splurge they tend to really binge on those days because well this is my day and I can just go to town it's like having a cheap day with with cigarettes well I don't smoke during the weekend just just go to town on the weekend you end up you end up doing more damage um and and you keep yourself addicted and that's the main thing is that it just makes you feel miserable during the week and you just want to keep having sugar and you're as soon as that starts calming down you go and get yourself addicted again so I like yes is it better to eat sugar twice a day than every day if you're eating the same amounts daily sure if you're eating more in those two days than you would during the week no and um and is it better than not eating any sugar at all definitely not so uh please take that under advisement and uh and think about that you know if you wanted some sugar every now and then like every few months maybe you know but do remember what that's doing to you that is damaging your body body it is a toxic dose and so your body's going to be tox going to be have toxic effects that's all there is to it can you recover from it sure um do you want to keep doing that to your body not really so do it that what you will but you know that's that's uh a very you know uh good explanation as to why I don't touch the stuff anyway so this will be the last one everyone I think that's that's pretty good we're we're probably going to end right around uh 12:00 which is uh which is perfect so last question from uh gour gaming thank you very much for the Super Chat and thanks everyone for the Super Chat she very very kind of you sorry um that we couldn't go longer but um I think three hours is is pretty good um or two and a half hours uh gourd gaming says uh thanks for all you do my friend uh is type two diabetic just went through triple bypass oh I'm sorry to hear that doc says say low salt lots of Vegs and lean meat carnivore is a way to go is it not hard to uh hard to convince I definitely think so obviously you know it's it's difficult when you're when you just had a major surgery like that and the and the doctor says do this exact opposite thing um can be very difficult check out Dr Philip aadia he's he's a cardiothoracic surgeon that does bypass surgeries and he will tell you go high fat carnivore the evidence is not there that um you know that fat and cholesterol cus heart disease in fact the evidence is pointing to the opposite of that um a recent study just came out saying that there's no association between saturated fat intake and and cardiovascular disease none um and there's been more like that there was a a major paper out of the journal American College of Cardiology in 2020 showing looking at doing a literature review looking at the randomized control trials top levels of evidence the metaanalyses of randomized control trials and so on and they found zero association between increased saturated fat intake and the development of cardiovascular disease heart attacks and strokes and they in fact they found an inverse relationship between saturated fat intake and stroke rates so the more saturated fat people were eating the less Strokes they were having the less saturated fat they were eating the more Strokes they were having so this is protective this is good for you this is what we have been eating for millions and millions and millions of years this is what all animals eat in the wild they don't eat lowfat carnivores eat animals that are made of fat and meat fat and protein right and they generally go for the fat first herbivores eat fi ones that eat fiber God knows what the hell a metabolism of a hummingbird is but the metabolism of a cow and a gorilla and a rhinoceros and a ox is such that they still run on fat and protein why is that because they can't break down fiber no animal can break down fiber not even termites it's the microorganisms in their gut that eat the fiber and as a waste product they produce saturated fat and then the bacteria or the protozoa die off and they get absorbed as protein so gorillas may eat a bunch of green leaves but what they absorb is fat and protein usually about 1 to one grams of fat to protein so 70% calories from fat uh 30% from protein same is true of rhinoceroses and Ox you know have these GameChanger guys they're like saying like oh look at an ox you know he just eats grass look how muscle he is yeah idiot that's because he can turn the grass into fat and protein you can't so you need that from your diet uh or your steroids and a bunch of supplements and all all the other crap you put in your body which is not going to end well sorry to say and hopefully they they sort of you know come around before they do too much damage to their body but um you take a look at those things you know take a look at the you know my video on the truth about cholesterol and heart disease is just not there the evidence is just not there that this stuff causes harm it was a scapegoat by the sugar companies to you know cast the blame away from sugar and uh and to say sugar is safe this is their words not mine their published documents said that they did this and who they paid off and how much they paid them so this is not conjecture this is not up for debate this is an historical fact and no but shut up this is not up for debate this is a fact this was published this was their words they did this so this is just not it's just not the case and you have people you know who listen to this advice or you know the consumption data in America is very clear you know we've we've been eating less fat less red meat lowering cholesterol through diet life lifestyle fiber intake and medications we've been increasing fruits and vegetables increasing heart healthy grains and heart healthy heart healthy polyunsaturated fats and Seed oils and lenic acid and Omega sixes and all that filth and what happened well heart disease rates have tripled for one and obesity rates have sex tupled and so have diabetes rates and cancer rates have tripled and stroke rates have tripled and you know all these things have gotten worse not better you know so we lower red meat we lower cholesterol we lower fat we you know increase um fruits vegetables and polyunsaturated fats which are all supposed to be good for the heart and our heart conditions have gotten worse and you know and and the Liars out there you know the Dr alos and the Simon Hills of the world will tell you that well in the 60s and 70s uh you know the the mortality rate of cardiovascular disease peaked and then it started coming down after that that's not what we said we said the rate of heart disease has gone up the prevalence the incidence the amount of people the percentage of the population that has cardiovascular disease is going up decade by decade in America and around the world the incidents the amount of people that get new diagnoses every year having firsttime heart attacks but are surviving are going up in America and around the world decade after decade and the death from cardiovascular disease around the world is going up and it's going up out of proportion with the growth in uh the population so it's just in America the deaths sort of peaked and then sort of came down but the rate has continued to go up if this treated it if this was the underlying cause was more meat more fat more cholesterol causes this and you reduce all that the prevalence the rate the incidence should all go down it doesn't our interventions have gotten better our ambulance systems have gotten better we have private jets in Australia called the royal royal flying doctors that fly out to BFE picking up someone who's had a heart attack 24-hour drive away from you know a major city they get a cath lab or some sort of major intervention and you fly them down right hugely expensive but you're saving people's lives right it's obviously abuse you get you know peripheral hospitals that just want to Turf someone and get them away from their hospital and they they force them you know to come down and and and you and you get there and you're like there's nothing wrong with this person you know um and then that cost $20,000 a leg so that's not good however you know it does save lives and so you're having a heart attack out in the middle of nowhere in the 70s yeah you you're dead you're not going to make it we have bypass surgeries improving we have more cardiothoracic surgeons we have more Interventional cardiologists we have have different sorts of stenting and early detection and people stop smoking as much too I mean that's a major reduction uh in mortality just there which is G is going to come from the reduction in smoking but all these interventions have improved and so people having their heart attack for the first time but surviving is going up so you know you try these red herrings these straw man argument oh but no no no no that's not the argument and you damn well know it and you you're you you're being purposefully misleading because you're a shill and a con and um or just too dumb to understand what statistics are so you know don't let these people uh convince you into bad health I mean it's it's just total  I mean they're they're doing this for their own purposes they're either being paid to do this or they're just they're or they're trying to you know build up some sort of reputation I mean I think some you know uh some people just don't have better things to do they don't have a real job I don't know what Simon Hill does besides just talk a bunch of vegan nonsense which he's completely insincere about I mean you see him talking about like oh I don't think I could live in a world without animals animals like the F no clearly never took any acting classes because that was horrible you know but he's just pandering to these people that um you know that he that are are paying his bills because he doesn't have a real job because all he does is is do is you know podcast sell his book and try to try to you know go through different sorts of um you know self-aggrandizement so I mean you know that's ridiculous you know purposefully misleading people and purposefully changing the argument in order to knowingly mislead people and make them think that you know that that that the mortality rate from cardiovascular disease going down it has anything to do with the rates and the prevalences going down and and you know these people know this I mean this is this is a common common common thing that they say and you know they damn well know better so this is on purpose right and so you you have to ask them what their motivations are but I mean they're not good you know it's not good one way or the other to intentionally mislead people to intentionally try to suggest that because the mortality rate has come down that means the overall rate is coming down that means these interventions are working that means that the cholesterol lower medications are working that means that you know eating less meat is working because it's not and they know it's not which is why they aren't arguing prevalence incidents they're arguing mortality rate that's a different thing and they know it's a different thing and that's why I say they're dishonest and that's why I have no time for these people because that's disgusting behavior and you know and that that truly makes me me pissed off because they they are hurting people you know their advice is hurting people and potentially killing them and that pisses me off because they're not just doing it's not an honest mistake anymore they are knowingly misleading people they are knowingly trying to uh spread misinformation by that that pisses me off and so sorry for the rant I know got went way past uh where where I mention on that but in any case there there's there just reams of evidence to show that um that the the traditional recommend ations on lowering fat lowering cholesterol lowering meat are complete and utter and reams of of very highlevel uh studies and experiments and randomized control trials showing that actually saturated fat and meat is protective Improvement I mean randomized control trials replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fats to lower LDL cholesterol did indeed lower LDL cholesterol and more people died of heart attack and strokes as a result of that and they've buried that Stu study because they're dishonest bastards and they don't want to actually help people they want to push their agenda so screw them don't listen to don't listen to all these other people do your own damn research I mean that's the thing who who the hell has ever you know been on the right side of things when they say don't do your own research just be ignorant and listen to us your Masters and the unelected elites and the the you know like as Thomas Soul says you know the self-a appoint the self-anointed you know they are just the chosen ones of their own choosing and so don't listen to yourself don't actually do your own research don't read a book don't try to be educated only listen to us sounds like a great plan you know um never listen to anyone who says that you know you you don't you don't agree with my conclusions fine I mean I I put the studies you know in these different in these different descriptions you go down you know and you look at them and you you see for yourself see if you're convinced by it I certainly was and I try to show you know the evidence that that I base that on um if you're not convinced you're not convinced that's that's up to you you know I try to be transparent with these things um if someone is telling you oh don't do your research oh that's just ridiculous you should listen to experts you know sorry but you know F experts you need to be in control of your own life because no one else is going to care more than you if you get sick and die you know is as Thomas Sol says it's a really bad idea to let people who pay no PR to people make decisions who pay no price for being wrong they have these other people saying oh this is what you should do and you have to do and all these sorts of things and if it's wrong they're not the ones dying they're not the ones getting heart disease they're not the ones whose parents are are you know going in you know getting mentally feeble and enfeebled and and going into nursing homes and having a horrible horrible last several years of their lives or Decades of their life and then dying early and in pain you know that is  they have no business business doing that it's you that are going to suffer it's your parents that are going to suffer it's your children that are going to suffer so you need to take responsibility you need to look at these things and you need to find out what is right for you to do and then you experiment a study can only tell you it only guide you and give you an idea of what is best for you to do but then it's you who do it you have to do it you have to take the risk and then you try and you see like okay yeah this helps me great or you say I don't really believe that study I'm going to do this other thing and you have the exact opposite results of that study well obviously that study wasn't applicable to you or it was a bad study or it was you know you know um you know bad for other sorts of reasons by intentionally or unintentionally right either way you know it doesn't matter what A study says it matters what happens to your in your own life right so if you're getting better and better and healthier and healthier and people say you're GNA die you know but there's evidence to suggest the exact opposite and the most direct evidence is you're getting better you why are you listening to those people you know and so you know do do do your own research do educate yourself you know this is age-old saying you keep people ignorant you keep them under control don't be controllable be uncontrollable by these bastards that are trying to control you be a freethinking individual be educated as as much as you can and every subject that you can and the more able you are to do that the more independent you are the more fiercely independent and the more educated you are the harder it is for them to control you and to take over your life and it is your life it is not their life it is only yours and so you deserve to live your own life these bastards do not have a right to make your decisions for you and to control your life don't let them so you need to be educated you need to be healthy and I think this is the best way to do it okay I'm gonna I'm gonna end it there or I can just keep keep rambling forever um thank you everyone I really appreciate it um I do have another couple lives uh coming on um um and let me just take a look at
