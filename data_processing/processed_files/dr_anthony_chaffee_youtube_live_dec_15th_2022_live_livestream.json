        "body": "all right okay all right hello everyone uh thanks for coming on and yeah so we're just doing a live trying to get on on a multiple different platforms here so we'll see how that works and then just anyone who uh has a question you can just just pop it up as you go and I'll try to um answer them all hey Mike good to see you hey everyone cheers a lot of people jumped in okay all right hey everyone ketovore King hey buddy so [Music] okay so someone asks um how much butter to consume for high fat with just as much as you need really just as much as your body wants so you can go by how you feel your energy levels and also uh your stool so if you're getting dry hard stools uh that are you know sort of uncomfortable then you should probably eat more fat if you're getting loose stools you don't need to eat as much fat but that can be confounded by um by people that are eating you using artificial sweeteners or coffee as well because those both work as laxatives so that's not um um that's not going to give you an accurate picture of just your fat content uh hello Nashville um is carnivore safe to take uh if you take a blood pressure medication uh yes it is but the thing is you have to realize is that once you go on Carnivore there are a lot of there are a lot of reasons why your blood pressure will actually normalize um and so once you're eating normally your blood pressure can actually normalize as well and so you need to be careful when you're on blood pressure medication or diabetic medication because sometimes the dose will be too strong and you'll get low blood sugar or low blood pressure things like that and so you just need to be mindful of that so you do need to be careful but it is safe you just you may need to talk to your doctor about reducing your dose as you go so just check your blood pressure um daily and if it starts getting to the point where you're getting a bit lower than than you should or getting sort of dizzy lightheaded especially when you stand up you should talk to your doctor about about potentially changing the dose um question is do I need to change my workouts because of carnivore yeah you just need to just go even harder because you can you know you can push yourself way way harder on a carnivore diet your recoveries will be almost instantaneous your body recovers so much faster you don't get sore you don't get Doms that really pisses people off to your mouth because they just they like they think that it's just a lie but it's true like you will not get uh sore and painful uh achy muscles after you work out so that's uh so that's something you can do is you just just push yourself even harder because your body can take it um do you get a lot of questions of help with getting off caffeine so yeah the best way of getting off caffeine is is just going cold turkey and just stopping it you might get headaches for the first couple days that will go away your energy levels will improve and get better generally the withdrawal effects of caffeine and the and the Cravings will only last you know sort of a week at most two weeks the absolute outside but headaches should be gone in first sort of three or four days so I would just go cold turkey and just just get rid of it um so keyboard King asks my blood sugars uh were 2.1 um ML on Carnivore is that normal so your your blood sugar well it depends on how you feeling it depends on if you're um if you're feeling lightheaded you're not feeling great generally when you're in ketosis it your blood sugar can be a lot lower than it would normally be otherwise when you're only running on your blood sugar so there have been studies back I think in the 50s where they intentionally drop people's uh blood sugar but their ketones were up and they didn't have any adverse effects and they're and their blood sugar was actually in the point that you would you would consider quite dangerous and so that's that's not a very ethical experiment to do you wouldn't be able to get away with it now but they they have done that and so we do have that information uh let's see that's what do I think of sweet breads nutrition wise um so sweet brands are just different organs you know like the thymus um I don't I don't remember all the other ones but yeah I mean they're fine you know it's um they're they are nutrient dense organs are quite nutrient dense and I don't think you have to have them but if you want them that's fine if they taste good and you enjoy them you'll go for it but I don't think you need them necessarily unless you have some sort of deficiency um let me ask what do I think of deuterium depleted water will I use it personally and um so do Jeremy the whole uterine depleted water and the do uh deuterium concept is a very interesting one it's one that I've only just come across in the past several months but I've spoken to some of the world's experts in in that and it's it makes perfect sense you know I I my primary degree was in molecular cellular biology and biochemistry and you know talking to these guys it does make sense that this is going to to have a significant effect in your body and it and in fact it does you know we've done these um Dr Lazo borosh at UCLA he's professor of Pediatrics there he did a lot of experiments and tests with deuterium at UCLA and and found that yeah this is this makes a significant impact in in the cell cycle so um being in ketosis will lower your deuterium levels just by making molecular water that is deuterium free and you'll excrete out excess deuterium deuterium is heavy hydrogen so that's um so it's it's a hydrogen molecule that has a proton and it has a neutron so it's twice the weight of a normal hydrogen molecule as you're making water with that with with heavy hydrogen and so uh it just it just behaves differently so that's something that I think is you know is is real that I think that's a real thing and it doesn't matter as far as drinking deuterium depleted water it's difficult to come by I think like rain water will have depleted deuterium just by the virtue of you know misting out of the of the ocean and and then you know um it sort of separates out some of the the heavy water that way um and different latitudes going up to further north or further south the rain will be you know even more deterior and depleted so you know I always sort of wondered if that's why people that that drank Wolverine Water and said they felt so healthy doing that maybe that was that was something uh something to do with that um will I drink determine water deuterium depleted water myself um maybe every now and then um if I were to get something like cancer I think I would um and you know because I really want to sort of attack this on all fronts and that's something that's um these experts have seen in their studies to help and so I think you get a lot of that from just being in ketosis and on a carnivore diet but you know if you have something horrible like cancer you just want to sort of throw all the guns at it um GMS do I have appointments in Perth I do I I generally work in a clinic in functional medicine on the weekends so that's at the rensburg clinic in Mount Hawthorne or the or the Hobart Clinic is also the name of it and so you can try and try and book in there and what do I think about eating breakfast sausage it depends on the breakfast sausage so you know they're all they're not all made equal they can also be they're also be a lot of sugar or plants added so that's you know it's not going to be ideal so you want to look at the ingredients you want to see exactly what's added in there and if it's just sort of meat and salt then that's fine but it almost never is they're almost always have sugar and different spices and Seasonings added sorry goodness so I'm just going to use the bottom here oh my God quite a lot of questions coming at me okay uh uh let's see can carnivore diet help with Ms multiple sclerosis well it it seems to have been there are there are many people with Ms who have been benefited by this so that's anecdotal there's no um big studies or trials looking at that that I know of maybe they're all with keto that's something I have to look into but autoimmune issues in general seem to be from exposure so you're you're eating something you're exposing yourself to something that is not reacting well with your body and and it will uh cause a problem so when you eliminate out all of these different things it seems to help quite significantly with with autoimmune issues and whether or not it helps with your particular autoimmune issue it will help in a thousand other ways as well so it's it's definitely still well worth it but yes I I know people uh and that have been significantly helped with their MS by going carnivore uh good morning Dr chafee what is what's your feelings on nitrates particularly from processed Meats like uh choco I'm not sure what that is I don't I don't know what choco is but I'm not too worried about nitrates you make nitrates in your saliva you know and so that's uh and in higher quantities than you get in these processed Meats and everyone talks about how nitrates are so bad but then say Oh this is nitrate free they just put celery powder in that well the reason they put celery powder is because there are way more nitrates in celery powder than just this than just the nitrates you add to it so it's it's just it's just a marketing scheme they're just trying to you know they're just you know they're just trying to sell you something and they're just trying to scare you off on somebody say oh look at this it doesn't have nitrates in it but it does it uses the celery powder but of course it's a plant and so plants are really good but no it's um it's not something that I'm too worried about you know the the closer you get to just meat just meat from the animal and um you know the the better you'll be and so um I wouldn't you know I wouldn't be too worried about things like like some little things being added in but you know you know just eating whole meats and cooking yourself you're going to do better in general overall uh um okay say I hear all about this carnivore diet and all the healing it does well it helps Cushing's Disease that's a good question um I have no idea I've not seen anyone with Cushing's Disease uh try this um so that's an excellent question that would be that would be really good to know you know Cushing's Disease true Cushing's disease is like from a pituitary issue where your your uh pituitary gland starts secreting more hormones you start producing way more cortisol than you should and you get you get all the problems from basically someone who's been on long-term steroids so if you've been on not not steroids like anabolic steroids but corticosteroids um like cortisol and so you get hydrocortisone or prednisone prednisolone dexamethasone all these things people maybe prescribe these uh steroids in order to suppress the immune system but they have very very very uh harsh side effects on your body and and that's cushions you can basically give yourself Cushing's disease and um so will that shrink down that pituitary adenoma and make it not produce uh all these hormones I have no idea but that is an excellent question I would suspect yes but it could be that you know it's already sort of hit uh it's already changed the cells and and to start this process on that maybe is irreversible at that point generally you have to do brain surgery so we we see these patients with Cushings and we put cameras up people's nose go into sort of in the middle of their of their head there and work our way through the thin bone between the nasal cavity and the brain and the pituitary because it sits down in a little Sac called the Cella and and then we're able to sort of resect out that bit of pituitary that's that's over secreting these hormones so I have no idea but you know again you have a thousand other reasons to to go on a carnivore diet um and you never know it could help but that is something that we'll need some more data on uh is there any way to raise blood pressure well depends on why you have low blood pressure could be for medications it could be uh because you're not drinking enough water could be you're dehydrated that's a very common one so if it's just something normal you're not on a bunch of medications or any other sorts of uh you know treatments that could drop your blood pressure that you maybe you need to talk to your doctor about pulling back on uh then start with start with water you know quite often people get dehydrated and that just reduces your blood volume and you'll have low blood pressure because of that so just make sure you're getting enough water as well what size is my bed um so I uh so I have a um a queen bed at my at my house and in my girlfriend's house is a king's bed so um problems digesting fat will carnivore eventually help with that so you should be fine digesting fat and absorbing fat when you just eat a carnivore diet you're not eating all these things in plants that disrupt your body's ability to break down and absorb fat and protein but you know like things there are things in in plants like in wheat and soy like protease Inhibitors also lipase Inhibitors that will actually stop your body from absorbing things breaking them down properly and and this is the plant's way of disrupting your digestion making you get less nutrients than you would have otherwise so that if you're eating that plant you're basically not going to thrive as much as if as if you were eating something else that didn't have these problems and so you know your your line of animal will not be you know causing too much of a problem uh to that plan so that there's uh there's quite sophisticated defenses that these these planets have um when you eliminate all that out then your body should be able to absorb these things just fine unless you had a pancreas you know insufficiency or you had some sort of you know surgery or cancer or some sort of illness that made your pancreas not work properly uh you'll be fine and after you know a few days a few weeks your body will will re-adapt to eating fatty meat and you'll make all the all the enzymes that you need um so it depends on what you mean by digesting fat you know some people say you know they're getting diarrhea they're not they're not absorbing as much fat well maybe you just don't need to eat as much fat as all that your body can only absorb a certain amount of fat because of the bile uh after after your body runs out on bile it's very difficult to absorb fat you can do it a little bit but not a lot and so you need to just recognize that and then you just don't need to eat as much but you know you should be able to actually digest and absorb fat to that extent that your body wants it very easily on a carnivore diet unless you have some sort of a medical issue foreign [Music] Perth very good and living in the UK they're also very good I started carnivore three months ago to heal serious um menaraja and feel like I'm getting worse though [Music] and not sure if I should persist or ditch uh the nor that's the steroid I don't know what that is um that might be something that was prescribed by your doctor for like HRT or something like that um not something that I've used specifically uh menorrhea not Menorah sorry and um the thing is when you go when you go on Carnival it can change your hormones and eventually it should normalize and rationalize your hormones and give you a proper hormonal balance in the meantime it will you know cause different things to happen in your body and women in particular they might see this affect their their menstrual cycle and either increase bleeding produce bleeding change the frequency or or consistency of their of their periods but that should stabilize that should normalize when your body normalizes its uh its hormones um and it could be that you know if you're going through I don't know how old you are but if you're going through menopause obviously that's going to have other changes in and of itself and so things can be a bit unsettled that way but I would definitely keep doing it you'll eventually uh normalize and stabilize your hormones is that going to get rid of your memory I don't know um there are other treatments for that but it's uh it will help you in so many other ways that it will absolutely be worth it in you know overall um someone has to do strict just meat has it helped uh yeah I'm just strict meat and water that's it you know very rarely I'll have some cheese with some meat or something like that um but it's almost almost exclusively meat and water and yes it has absolutely helped I feel a thousand times better than I've ever felt in my entire life and you know that's coming from someone who's played you know High a lot of high level Sports worked out quite a lot pushed myself very very hard for many many years and when I'm on a pure carnivore diet versus just a standard healthy Whole Food meat and meat and vegetables and starch diet I feel just dramatically better I mean it's just not it's not even a comparison how much better I feel um so let me see that one was that one was interesting A friend of mine has Type 2 diabetes with major pancreas issues will carnivore help his doctor tells him to stay away from meat the skeptic in me thinks there's no money and cures I think you're right there exactly uh yeah you can't you can't you can't sell uh you know the idea of not eating certain things right um you know you can sell pills you can sell insulin and um you know the idea of like you know the the saying stay away from me why why exactly you know I I'll ask him why to say okay what is your evidence for that what is that based on you know where is that coming from you know because it's coming you know straight out of his backside because like there's there's no good reason to not eat meat you know especially you know as a diabetic what does that have to do with anything diabetes is is blood sugar control there are no carbs in meat you know I mean very few scarce amount so you're saying don't eat you know something that will that will not affect your blood sugar what a stupid thing to say and um yeah so I obviously disagree with that dramatically uh yes to answer your question yes that will absolutely help uh their diabetes this is something that like diabetes just just uh goes away you know um you could have permanent damage to your pancreas and not be able to make enough insulin so you might actually be dependent on insulin but it'll be a much lower amount of insulin and many many people who are insulin dependent type 2 diabetics come off insulin in a matter of months there's a lot of work done by Professor Steve Finney who's a professor at UC Davis you know did his went to medical school at Stanford did his PhD at MIT and um and uh you know he's been he's been studying ketogenic diet especially in the context of diabetes for a very long time and and he's shown that this this really does help um and then the other pancreas issues I don't know exactly what what pancreas issues those are um but I think that anytime you're eating your biologically appropriate species-specific diet your body's going to work better than it would otherwise and so it's it's always a benefit to do that let's see do I still use the X3 bar or did I go back to commercial lifting I do still use the X3 bar um it's you know it does give a very good workout and it's convenient it's um it uh you know you can get a lot done in a short amount of time which is great especially for me I I had my I had like so a knee arthroscopy uh in October uh just to clean out some some loose cartilage but um you know so I haven't haven't really been you know lifting too much or doing too much uh since then I've just sort of been letting it rest and just doing a bit of rehab on that and I'm just I've never been the type of person that just does upper body I've just I've hated those guys that just go to the gym and just get you know uh you know arm buff and uh and and don't don't work legs I think it's silly so it's um it's so I just sort of neglected working out in general for the last couple months but uh something I'm getting back into now I do still go to the gym there are things in the gym that you can that you can do that just can you can you can work your muscles in slightly different ways that you can't really do on the X3 bar but the X3 bar is great for the big compound list and getting most of the the major um muscle muscle groups and and you work them very very well so um there are a few things I like doing just at the gym as well but I do still use the X3 bar now yeah I do like it uh what principles do you use when creating a workout routine well I you know I just want to make sure I'm hitting all the muscle groups I just want to make sure that I'm doing things equally um I want to work to fatigue I want to push myself very hard and you know and then just you know um try to make that consistent you know whatever you do you just want to be able to do it consistently so um you know whatever your workout routine is you need to just make sure you're able to do it you know three four days a week without fail and um and then you can sort of build from there I like getting in and getting out just just short and sweet if I can but you know if I'm doing a lot I want to work and I want to push myself I might be there for actually like a few hours which is hard to do because I don't have a few hours anymore but when I did have more time that's what I would like to do so that's the main thing just try to hit every every muscle group you know alternate things and just push myself work very very hard and work to failure I do like running and sprinting Hill Sprints as well I think I just get a lot out of that I like feeling Dynamic that I can I can run and Sprint and you know Chase someone or something if I need to it's uh it's just your body feels good and healthy and and dynamic and so I like to work that in with weights as well foreign [Music] three weeks into beef salt and water no change in psoriasis no prescriptions what is the average time frame to see symptoms regress should I still be trying to moisturize or apply anything um psoriasis can take a while most people will see improvements in a few months um you know I'm yeah sorry that you haven't been having uh any any benefits from that it sounds like you're doing things right you know if you're not using any seasonings or dairy or you know even eggs you know people people that have some of these issues need to be a bit more strict but it's saying beef salt water so that sounds like you're doing everything right there I would just I would just keep going and uh and it should sort itself out it can just take a little longer and just make sure you don't have anything else in your system or in your environment that aren't going to you know sort of contribute to this as well um as far as moisturizing and applying anything maybe I I don't you know psoriasis isn't something that I treat directly uh I'm not I'm not a dermatologist so I don't um I don't know what the best things for that is you know using like some even oil or Tallow to moisturize the skin you know works for me and it makes you know I feel I have healthy uh skin from that and so that might be something you can look into but again I'm not a dermatologist so I don't I don't know uh the best answer for that uh how do I feel about collagen drink supplements I don't think you need them on a carnivore diet you'll get plenty of collagen you'll get plenty of protein you'll get plenty of the essential building blocks for collagen you don't need to do it um I have like a collagen protein shake sort of thing um from equip foods that basically I just use if if I'm I finish a workout and I don't really have time or the inclination to cook and eat directly after but I want to you know get some protein in or something like that and I'll just sort of take that I don't know if it does anything good you'll get a lot of collagen and a lot of of the precursors for collagen just for meeting meat so if you're eating a carnivore diet you really don't need it would I reckon my men carnivore for a man whose hematocrit is slightly elevated due to testosterone pellets uh yes I would recommend carnivore for absolutely every human being in any situation because you know I I truly believe that the evidence shows clearly that humans are carnivores biologically and that that is our biologically appropriate species-specific diet and so anyone is going to benefit from that uh is carnivore good for PCOS I'm not losing much weight it absolutely is just just any sort of ketogenic diet is very good for PCOS um there are a number of causes of PCOS however a major one is just from elevated insulin so your insulin goes up and that blocks the conversion of testosterone into estrogen in the ovaries not everyone knows this but women make testosterone first and then that is converted into estrogen in in ovaries and higher levels of insulin will block that they'll block that conversion over so you'll end up with too much testosterone not enough estrogen and you can develop PCOS as a result of that and and all the problems from that and infertility and so forth so just getting off the carbs will help that uh generally if that's what's causing your PCOS right because there are other things that can cause it as well but it it generally will I would just stick with it and um yeah and then just just see how you go you'll benefit in a lot of ways as well um you know the weight I wouldn't worry too much about that you know muscle weighs more than fat a lot of people will put on muscle and lose fat and their weight won't change too much so don't focus on the scale focus on your health focus on how you feel focus on your energy levels and yeah and just and just go from there you know the weight will come you know that that will go off it will it may take a while but it will happen you know just focus on on health first because that's that's really what this is about would 80 20 be a good way to go for a 60 year old woman having a hard time losing weight uh I assume that means 80 calories from fat and 20 calories from protein uh yes but you know some people have a different demand for fat you want to get enough fat you want to get enough protein and so that may be different for you um generally between 70 and 80 calories from fat is a is is good for people uh just go buy your stools if you're getting dry hard stools you're not getting enough fat if you're getting loose stools you're probably eating too much fat as long as you're not drinking coffee or artificial sweeteners um so I'll just go buy that so aim for that and and adjust as uh as your body tells you foreign thank you for all your hard work for us Dr chafee well thank you um what do you think of iodine supplementing I don't know I don't think it it's gonna hurt you I think you know Dr Barry was talking about this um uh how like the Japanese because they use so much Seafood they get um you know did they get just like a ton of uh iodine and um and so you know they don't they're not really uh having any problems with that even though they're getting you know you know quite uh you know quite a lot of um iodine you know much more than other people would and um you know so I think that supplementing I I don't think you're gonna hurt yourself but I I you know a lot of people um on a carnivore diet don't supplement iodine and uh and seem to do just fine I haven't really supplemented iodine um but you know the thing is you can test these things and if you have an iodide deficiency or maybe your thyroid is is not up to Snuff you know it might be that you're having a bit of iodine is is of benefit sometimes there's going to be well there is going to be different amounts of iodine in your in your food um depending on where you are as well you know just like iodine blows in from the sea sort of sea water like blows in and uh gets into the into the ground and in the soil that gets in the grasses that the animals eat and it gets into the animals so if you're if you're if you have an animal sort of more Inland they're not going to have as much iodine as like a coastal uh Coastal cow so just uh so if you have a deficiency supplement with it if you don't I don't thin k you need to um thank you very much uh Tamara for the"

        "body": "k you need to um thank you very much uh Tamara for the k you need to um thank you very much uh Tamara for the Super Chat really appreciate that and thank you Luke as well um I appreciate it [Music] and great let's see here last in your gravis carnivores for about two years any thoughts uh well you know that that's a that's again another one of these these autoimmune issues that um that may uh benefit quite significantly from from eliminating these things out uh from your body so um I would actually ask you you've been in front of war-ish for about two years how have you done how is that how has that gone with your myasthenia gravis um I think the if you do have these issues the more pure you go of just beef salt water the better you'll be so even just carnivore-ish will help a lot but you will probably get a lot more benefit from completely eliminating you know all all plants and sugar and drinks and things like that so good morning from Portugal I have started carnivore a couple weeks ago I'm not hungry at all but also not losing weight um well you know again weight is a is a a variable thing you can put on muscle and lose fat and you will stay the same weight and you can even gain weight some people very rarely will put on weight they won't lose fat at all for a while and their hormones the body just need to sort of get better and um and heal and eventually that'll sort itself out and you'll start losing weight so just focus on on feeling good and focus on your health that's the main thing the weight will happen just you know make sure you're eating enough and and exercising and things like that and and the weight will take care of itself not being hungry that's normal your hunger signals will change dramatically you won't feel as hungry and so you need to make sure you're eating enough because that can actually slow down weight loss as well if you're not eating enough your body will slow down your metabolism you'll get very tired and you won't burn much fat your body will think like oh we're in a when in some sort of famine and we need to sequester and store all of our fat stores so you can actually put on fat paradoxically so I just make sure you're eating enough eating enough fat eating until meat stops tasting good uh McCarthy ass good morning from Florida good morning is it true that age uh age to meet maybe aged meat can cause a histamine response in some people I am waking up in the middle of the night with joint pain in my fingers which I've never had before three months carnivore that's weird um yeah I wonder exactly what you're eating uh some people for some reason seem to respond to aged meat and you know I don't know if it's histamines or or what else it could be but at the end of the day if you're reacting to age to me or any other way of preparing storing and serving meat then just don't do that so um you can try changing your um you know the things that you're eating and if that helps then that's great so um yeah just just yeah just play around with it and see how you go and make sure you're not eating anything else um that can cause that sort of reaction as well Dairy can be pro-inflammatory you could fish chicken pork they can be pro-inflammatory as well probably to do with what the animal's eating more than anything foreign so Kevin says he got no surgery when he was 14 and 19. since then uh his nasal mucosa is extremely dry suffering from Suffocation unfortunately nasal moisturizing with infrared light helps mucosa oh sorry to hear that that sucks I have yeah I've broken my nose a number of times uh more than I can count because I played an entire season of rugby with a broken nose and just kept getting broken every single game not like once but like 30 times because every time I make a tackle or get into contact you just Smash It smash It smash it more and more and more and so that was not fun and I've had a few surgeries just so I can breathe properly out of my nose and uh so yeah my sinuses don't work very well either I don't know much about infrared light with the mucos although it's not something I've tried or looked into so I don't know if I can help with that what is the best cut of red meat um trust provides the most B vitamins and fat maybe which provides or that provides so the best kind of meat that red meat that provides Most B vitamins and fat well you know most of the skeletal muscle meat will have a similar complement of vitamins and minerals and the fat will will vary um and um you know so you can just get fattier Cuts you know like a ribeye brisket um and things like that are all uh much fattier as far as B vitamins you'd have to start looking at the organs to get more of a complement of B vitamins such as the liver will have more more B vitamins in a certain regard certainly more um folate and things like that so uh yeah so if you need if you need more B vitamins you should look into the organs as well but don't overeat them because you can get too much you know and and too many vitamins is just as dangerous as too few vitamins so be careful with that um carnivore diarrhea fix suggestions so I'm assuming that you're having diarrhea on Carnivore this is usually one of three things um either you're still drink coffee which is a diet which is a laxative or you're using artificial sweeteners usually in coffee and again artificial sweeteners are again a laxative um or you're eating a lot more fat than your body can absorb and it's just going to come out in dramatic fashion and so those would be the first things get rid of coffee get rid of artificial sweeteners all of them none of them are good whether or not they have carbohydrates in them and they can act as laxatives and then after you've gone just down to meat and water and you're still having loose stools then you should reduce the amount of fat that you're eating the other side of that is that you're eating so little fat that um that uh you've actually become constipated and um and so constipated that the the liquid stools are just sort of running around that and um and um and it's called something called overflow diarrhea or spurious diarrhea so you you alternate between serious constipation and diarrhea and so if that's the case then you're not eating nearly enough fat um should you start keto first or jump just jump into carnivore I just jump into carnivore you know it's uh you're you're it's never a bad time to stop eating poison that's my theory on it and so you just stop eating these things that are bad for you plants have defense chemicals they are harmful and you know the keto group has gotten in the right direction you're getting rid of carbs and sugar and that's great but there are other things that cause harm as well and that's these these other plant defense chemicals that we start designed to uh to eat and to utilize so I would just just cut it all out and and go head first in for perimenopause symptoms night sweats Etc extra tips thanks um well you know I mean the main thing is is you know on Carnivore from people I've spoken to they have much much more mild symptoms of menopause they're not getting as dramatic hot flashes or night sweats or the different sorts of problems that they were having before uh and and that's going to be because your your hormones are going to be more stabilized you're actually going to they're actually going to be better you're going to have higher levels of of estrogen and progesterone and so that will make to transition much more mild and easier to cope with so I would just just do that and just um just eat right and to treat yourself right and uh oh and eventually your body will will normalize and it should be more mild on a carnivore diet but there's nothing extra that I would that I would add on to that um so Kevin says whenever I eat apples I feel the mucasa is more dry in the note obviously that for the dry nose uh question when he eats apples the mucosa is more dry in the nose is it because of Advanced glycation and products still rejecting meat only diet unfortunately can't even have apples uh I have no idea what's going on with the apples and making your your nose dry um that's that's anybody's guess um still rejecting the meat only diet unfortunately can't even have apples um I don't really understand what you're talking about are you saying that your rejecting the meat-only diet and not really helping that because obviously apples aren't part of that but uh yeah I mean the thing is is that you know people people try Apples or they try these sorts of things after they've cut them out of their of their diet and they notice that there's an effect there well that that effect was always there it's just that we it's been drowned out by all the other things that we've that we've stuck in our body and so it just sort of got you know uh just mixed in with the chaos and and you didn't really see what was happening now you eliminate out all these things you add something back in it's like oh actually I do notice that does something to me and I don't like it and so you know that is something that you will notice when you go on a carnivore diet all the more reason not to eat that stuff so all right sorry now sorry okay where is this I lost my questions there we go if you go of course with a meal like a work Christmas party with some carbs you need to fast to get back on track or just back just go back into carnivore so you know you don't yeah you don't need to fast I mean like the whole thing with fasting the benefits of that is just not eating the things you're not supposed to eat and that's what you're doing on a carnivore diet anyway you're getting back into the metabolic state that you're supposed to be in you're in that so-called fasting state but of course you're not fasting because you're eating you know 3 000 calories in meat and fat but your your metabolism is in a fasting metabolism so it tells you that's not a fasting metabolism that's not a metabolism you go in when you're not eating that's metabolism you are in when you don't eat carbs and so that's what you're supposed to be in all the time when you do eat carbs that's the change so you eat carbs and that that takes you out of it so um uh you know it just puts you into an alternate metabolic pathway so um no just go back straight into eating carnivore that's fine so Kevin followed up with the apples thing is um our apples in my case unhealthy uh yes I would say so you know again apples or plants and um you know and I know there are people that say that that you want to eat fruit and fruit so good but they're uh wrong in my opinion I don't think they're good for you you know if you're starving out in the wild and you need a quick hit of energy yeah and Apple's your best friend but in general when you don't have that problem and you have access to meat then no apple is not a good idea uh hemochromatosis and carnivore is there a possible issue with iron Overload at all um you know potentially but you know probably not the um you know you'll get a lot of you know heme Iron and bio available iron in meat which is good but you know you'll have a lot of other changes to your uh metabolism of of the iron that you that you have in your body and how that works and so I haven't had anyone uh with hemochromatosis myself but you know Dr Baker has he has a large database of people now like over 12 000 people um and um and and they've actually seen hemochromatosis patients actually improve um even if you don't and you still need to get venipuncture and and you know give blood transfusions then you know you're still going to benefit in a thousand other ways um from be on a carnivore diet anyway and so you know it's still it's still worth your while to do that um can I talk about minerals and electrolytes please um I guess uh what would you like me to talk about minerals and electrolytes just generally you will get all the minerals and electrolytes you need from meat you know because this is what we're meant to eat and so if this is what we're meant to eat then we should be able to get everything we need in the proportion that we need them and that's exactly what we do so you shouldn't need to supplement at all when you're going transitioning from eating a bunch of carbohydrates and having high insulin levels sometimes this can disrupt your equilibrium at the level of your kidneys and you might excrete more electrolytes at that time but that's transient that doesn't last that long if it happens at all many people don't experience any problems with their electrolyte levels I certainly didn't and um you know really none of my patients uh have as well but if you're having a bit of you know if they're off a bit then you can just supplement for a little bit and uh eventually your your body will normalize that and and normalize and rationalize your electrolytes so I wouldn't worry too much about that uh let's see uh carnivore for a manual and testosterone pellets with slightly elevated hematocrators that okay I think we already answered that yes that's fine um eight months carnivore and still having headaches after eating uh that's weird you shouldn't really get headaches after eating meat uh maybe it depends on what you're eating what sort of meat you're eating it might be something that's disagreeing with you you know uh you know people talk about the Aged meat giving them a bit of problems so uh you know is it is it every meat that you eat is it every meal that you have uh this headache um what is bringing it on what are you eating are there other things that that maybe don't give you as much of a reaction or some things that give you more of a reaction you could sort of piece that together so I was sort of um just look a little more into that get a food diary write down exactly what you're eating when you're eating them when you're getting the headaches and like the severity of it like a scale of one to ten and and then you might be able to piece out what's what's triggering these headaches foreign really contaminated and should we buy water filtration systems depends on where you are you know some places will have like mountain spring water that's their their city water and so that should be fine um you know if they're adding a whole bunch of nonsense to it you know you might want to filter that out if it's in an area where the water isn't all that great then the filtration system is probably a good idea also but it depends on where you are and where what's uh where your your city is sourcing its water strict carnivore for a year zero cheats during that time only lost 33 pounds to have 50 more to lose nor hormonal issues already exercise any ideas of what the problem might be so only lost 33 pounds um that's that's not only like 30 pounds that's a great great great uh accomplishment you know most people talk about it's like oh if you lose like you know two pounds a month like that's that's the healthy thing to do and it could take years and years and years to lose that much weight that you've just lost in a year so a lot of times people get a lot of you know such good results so quickly that you know they want it faster and faster and more and more not realizing remembering that they've never had results like this ever before in their life so you're doing great you know 33 pounds in a year that's fantastic so just keep it up keep going we're also remember you're exercising so you're going to be putting on muscle and so you're going to be offsetting the weight you're losing in fat by gaining muscle so the weight loss is not as important so people need to stop focusing on weight loss focus on health primarily and fat loss that's the main thing so you can get like a dexa skin like a body composition scan and see exactly you know how much fat you've lost and how much muscle you've gained it's going to be dramatic I would I would bet that you've lost more than 33 pounds of fat and and that you've put on a decent amount of muscle in that time and either way just keep going you've lost 33 pounds that's amazing you know and just just keep going like the rest of it will come off just keep working out keep pushing yourself and just keep eating right and it will it'll sort itself out don't worry about it uh hi doctor what are your thoughts on sea greens like spirulina CMOS and uh chlorellia I just I don't even like saying that name um they're all plants you know um are they as bad as other plants I don't know I don't really care to know you know it's information I can do without um it's uh all plants are going to have defense chemicals of some form or another and some are going to be worse than others uh none of them are things that you need there is nothing there are no nutrients in plants that you have to have that you cannot get from meat but there are tons of nutrients that you can only get from meat that you can't get from plants and there are things in plants that can cause harm so you know is are those those sea greens less bad than others if you're out on a desert island and you know you're just struggling to survive are those a good options I don't know maybe but you don't need them and they will have defense chemicals so I would just uh abstain unless you're in a situation where you don't have the choice um but yeah I would just I would just eat uh just meat and water I don't eat any plants my hard rule is no plants no sugar nothing artificial and that goes for sauces seasonings and drinks as well because they're all going to have some form of Defense chemicals and so I just don't want any of that stuff in my body MK says I'm six foot one 180 pounds and eating when hungry and stopping went full but not eating a lot is that normal and going to the bathroom only once a week yeah that's all normal just eat when uh when you want to and uh keep eating until meat stops tasting interesting I tend to cook more than I think I'm going to want to intentionally have leftovers so I know that I've saturated my bodies uh desire for food and nutrients and and that should be fine and yeah you'll only go you know once maybe twice a week because you're going to be absorbing 98 to 99 of the meat that you eat and so you're just going to have less waste and you won't need to go as often so you know that's a good thing can I discuss uh bun and kidney function on Carnivore sure so what people are talking about here are really you know uh urea nitrogen um when you process amino acids there's a there's an amino group what's called an amino acid that contains a nitrogen so that Cleaves that nitrogen off that is then converted into ammonia and then converted after that into urea and people think that it's like oh then that's sent out as waste but actually it's not it actually has a lot of of important processes in your body it is one of your body's most important and strongest um anti-inflammatories so you know that's actually good so your levels of your your urea will go up and that's okay that's actually good it's helpful it's more uh of a of you know has more antioxidant effects your kidney function will not be damaged urea is not a function it does not show kidney function necessarily if you're creatinine is up and your urea is up well that could be a an elimination issue um your reaction goes up as well if you're sick if you're you're septic or something like that your urea is going to go up why is that well because you know your body's trying to fight these things off so it's trying to give your body more uh useful tools to fight this thing off um but you know if your creatinine is low and your urea is high it doesn't matter you know your kidney function is fine and uh people's kidney function will improve on a carnivore diet that is something that we've seen in a lot of studies looking at higher protein intake that actually improves kidney function it doesn't harm it and people say oh well it's harder for your kidneys you have more stuff to get eliminate that's not true it actually helps your kidneys are protein you know these this is going to help give the building blocks to keep them strong and robust so uh yeah your kidneys will do fine your kidneys will actually do better foreign [Music] where are we going there we go um I have a very low heart rate at the moment will carnivore help well I don't know I mean it may not be even be a problem carnivore can only help problems that are brought about by eating the wrong thing or not enough of the right thing and so it will fix nutritional deficiencies and it will eliminate out different toxicities and foods that will disrupt your body's normal workings and so if your heart rate is as a result of something that you're eating then yeah that that can help um but you know some people just have a lower heart rate and that's then that's not bad they don't they don't have symptoms from that and um you know and that's just normal for them other times people have medications that lower their heart rate like beta blockers and you know that's not going to change on a carnivore diet because that's the medication doing that uh is it true well done roast is bad for you doubt it yeah but um you know there are studies like with cats in like the 30s and 40s feeding them raw meat versus cooked meat and you know it they were much less healthy um with a cooked meat and even generationally they got more and more sick and didn't develop properly and after three generations they couldn't they couldn't reproduce after that just by eating cooked meat and so there's something deficient there so it's knocking out some of the nutrients that they needed um is that going to be the same for us I don't know you know we have been cooking for at least 800 000 years so half a million years longer than Homo sapiens have existed our earlier human ancestors were cooking with fire there even evidence of like you know ovens or cooking with ovens with this even distribution of heat about 700 000 years ago so you know there's been sophisticated cooking methods for a very long time and you know even further there's people that think there's like one and a half million or even two million years we've been cooking meat so maybe but it's been a long time anyway I've been cooking for a very long time so you know you would imagine that we do okay with with cooked meat uh because we've been doing for a very very long time so we would have adapted to that if it was an issue um that being said I do find that I just enjoy the flavor of raw meat or or you know blue steaks a lot better now too so I just I just go with what what makes you feel good and what tastes good and if you're having you're not feeling as good when you're cooking things more well done then don't cook it as well done uh what is the best way to avoid protein poisoning while on a carnivore diet just by not eating too much protein generally A good rule of thumb is you don't want to be getting anything more than like four grams or 4.5 grams uh you know per pound of body weight um and um I think it's per pound it might be per kilo but I think it's per pound um so that's a lot of protein that's a ton of protein it's very hard to do and so you just you get enough fat you know that'll that'll replace that so you know you do need fat you do need protein so you need to get enough fat you need to get enough protein and um yeah so just yeah just don't get like ludicrous amounts of of you know just completely lean meat and you'll do fine um how do I know that I'm taking enough fat so that that's from um generally from your stools you'll find out if you have dry hard stools then your body is absorbing every ounce of fat that you're eating and none is going out in waste okay so it's that little extra that's going to keep your stool soft and give you normal soft stools and otherwise if you're absorbing absolutely all of it well that might be just enough or it might be that you know you're not getting enough and so if you if you're getting normal soft consistency stools and you're not drinking coffee you're not using artificial sweeteners it's just meat and water then you know that you've saturated your body's ability to absorb fat and a little more so you know that you haven't have enough and so that's what I do is I just look at that and um yeah and just just um you know because because you you can only absorb fat with bile your body makes a certain amount of bile I think that that's physiological and physiologically means that's how much fat your body wants to absorb you know your body's very efficient it's very selective it's not going to waste energy or materials building something like bile just for the heck of it you know it's it's doing that for a specific purpose it wants to absorb fat and so you know after a while just says okay you know this is how much fat we want so I I trust my body I trust my physiology um and so I think you can just you can just go on that should we pay more attention to anecdotal evidence well I guess it depends on what anecdotal evidence uh that you're looking at you know one person having one example is you know uh you know it's interesting but it's not necessarily uh something you should change your life over um but if you're seeing hundreds of people thousands of people with the issue that you have fixing that problem that's something you should probably pay a little more attention to and the anecdotal evidence that is most important and that you should trust is you so if you do something you go on a carnivore diet and this is helping you and your body's getting better and you're getting healthier in your your autoimmune issues or your diabetes or your your your whatever is improving that's all that matters that's the only thing that matters is if you're getting better you're getting healthier you're coming off medications that's it that's the only thing uh that really matters and yes that's anecdotal but who cares it's you know it doesn't mean that it didn't happen you know so it depends on the anagital evidence but you know if you try something with your body and it helps your body then yes you should pay attention to that many carnivore Advocates promote grass-fed meat I'm wondering if grain-fed meat is harmful long term doubt it I mean I I mostly just eat grain fed um I like grass-fed I actually feel better on grass that especially like older cows that way more nutrients way more flavor they taste so good I got a 10 year old cow who's just grass-fed his whole life it was the best meat I've ever had in my life and I felt just super charged all the time when I ate it was amazing smelled different too it was amazing had much more beefy flavor as well that's more nutrients than you're tasting and um but you know the vast majority of what I eat is just grain-fed grain finished I should say meat beef because that's what's accessible because that's what I have access to um but you know so I don't think that's that you're going to have too much of a problem with that um and uh you know but just just go with you know what works for you and and um you know if you like grass-fed and grass-fed grass finished and and that's something that you have access to and you can afford then you know go for it make sure you get enough fat Fat's very important um you know so if you're getting that you know the grass-fed stuff they're going to be more lean because that's why we give these things carbs and Grains is to make them fat that's what we do to cows and that's what happens to us you know people don't get that you know we literally give cows and sheep grain in order to fatten them up that is a known response animal husbandry and animal nutrition is actually quite a robust science because you can actually do randomized controlled trials with it throughout the entire course on animal's life uh ethically you can't do that with humans and so everything's sort of you know gleaning information off of like surveys and stupidity like that in in nutritional and human nutrition which is not even a soft science it's just a joke is really what it is for the most part but animal nutrition is an actual hard biological science and they can actually do real uh robust studies with it and they have and you give them grains and carbs they get fatter you know that is what happens and so you know people say oh well there's this study in this survey and you know this epidemiological nonsense that people get carved and did this didn't actually change it I don't care I don't care what you say that that study is garbage it's weak evidence the animal models uh or the the animal uh nutrition studies they're they're actually like real randomized controlled trials that you can do with thousands of participants and you can see exactly what happens and then you can you know slaughter them and check the body composition and the fat content and the marbling you know exactly what's happening and you know how to do it and it's reproducible sorry buddy like that's that's what's happening carbohydrates and Grains make you fat and that is why we feed them to animals um and that's what that's you know people talk about gladiators as well oh they ate a whole bunch of grain they call them grain eaters and things like that so it's like yeah they ate grain so that they could become fatter that was why so get more abdominal fat they get more fat around their viscera and uh and on their body so if they got stabbed you're much less likely to hit a major organ because if someone's like lean and there's not much fat around the organs well knife goes into your gut it's hitting an organ right whereas if there's a bunch of fat there it's less likely to so that was actually a preserve it was a life preserving uh action there was to get fatter you know so yeah um yeah but anyway so next question uh what are your thoughts on bacon uh should we just stick to Pork Belly I know it's hard to come by bacon uncured without sugar yeah it's much better if you get things without sugar uh you know and you can find it you find it I think um Patterson Farms has a sugar-free bacon I think hemplers does as well I don't know if that's available everywhere though it is available in in Washington state though um but yeah you know uh pork belly I generally get pork belly that's what I normally do because I don't want all that the garbage sugar and things like that uh so Sandra Jansen says I enjoyed the interview with uh Sophia Clemens uh thank you I enjoyed that as well she was really really interesting lady to speak to and doing I mean amazing work you know she took this and ran with it she's like hey this helps people uh I'm gonna help people with it and she is helping people which is pretty amazing um how was your stance now slash different about the amount of protein per person per day um again it's just a matter of getting enough protein you want enough protein you want enough fat how that tends to work out as a as a distribution of calories between fat and protein can vary but you know if you're if you're a big guy with a lot of muscle and you're working out a lot you're going to need more protein than someone who's you know a slender you know girl who doesn't work out a lot like it's just your protein demands are going to be different and your energy Independents are going to be different so you just it just needs to be individual so you need to get enough protein you need to get enough fat it's a it's a it's about it's not necessarily about the percentage split it's about getting enough of it and so just get enough protein enough fat your taste will tell you A lot of that and so you just need to listen to your body make sure you're getting enough food training wise do you maintain muscle if you don't train for a month or so more than you would on a non-carnivore diet and do you gain muscle any quicker uh than non-carbon I don't know this is this is me not working out for the better part of a year that's that that's dead ass accurate so I've I was consistently working out about a year ago that I was like putting a quarantine lockdown and all that nonsense and then uh just sort of got out of the Habit was sort of working out maybe you know once every week or two um and then there were like it work got so busy and then I started doing the podcast and I got more um you know time dependent and I just didn't work out I didn't work out for months at one point um your body does maintain as much musculature and body fat percentage without having to work out I'm not as muscular as I would have been I would be you know probably another you know 10 15 pounds of muscle bigger than I am now um but and probably a little leaner as well but you know for the most part it stays you know and for a month two months you probably wouldn't notice too much of a difference it would stay pretty consistent um and but it slowly Ebbs off after that and uh yeah and you can put muscle back on way quicker it is so much easier to put on on muscle I I was putting on quite a lot of of um of muscle whenever I get back into the gym and I just I consistently work out I mean it may sound crazy but you know I I could put on like a pound of muscle like every time I work out which is just crazy that's just an insane thing to say but that's what I was seeing on the scale and um and so yeah it's it's night and day difference uh Michelle says I struggle a lot with what to eat when I'm in a hurry or don't have the energy to cook I often end up turning to things my family has on hand like sausage or chicken nuggets what is the least bad so the least bad will just have the least amount of plants and nonsense in it so chicken nuggets are you know most of the time they're going to be breaded that's going to be worse you know any sort of carbohydrates or sugar that's going to derail your metabolic system and and put you into a fat storage metabolism as opposed to a fat burning metabolism so I would definitely not eat anything with carbohydrates or sugar anything breaded definitely not um you know having some sausage or bacon or some some sort of meat that's processed in a certain way what are they process with the process with sugar and plants and plants are where we get sugar from so um that's the problem with processed Meats is that they're processed with plants and it's the plants that are harmful so just get the ones that are that have the least amount of junk in them and definitely stay away from carbs and sugar and Nick asks uh says good morning doc uh good morning and what is your favorite meat beef beef is definitely by far my favorite Ribeyes uh Again by far and you know I do a bit of salt don't use much salt anymore um and put them on drying racks let them dry out for a few days that concentrates the flavor and then I cook them in a pan usually with a with a thick bottom coating of Tallow and it sort of crisps it up and Fries it and it's almost like deep frying the steak and it gets all crispy and nice on the outside it's amazing and so that's that's my favorite is those uh those steaks that I make the the Ribeyes especially um Okay so we've just gone a bit over an hour guys um I might do just a few more questions and um and then maybe call it a day uh let's see um where is it now okay I ate a lot of organ meats and had very high ferritin levels how often do you test your iron and donate blood oh that really depends you know if you're first of all your ferritin can be like an acute phase reactant so it can be a marker of inflammation in your body it's not just the amount of iron that you have available in your body um so if you're sick or you have inflammation or there's something else going on your ferritin levels can go up or they can go down um if you're if you have sort of hemochromatosis or you have some sort of issue getting tested every six to eight weeks is is pretty good if you're if your Bloods have been pretty consistent you don't need to do it as often you know three months six months is plenty really six months is plenty once you get stable once a year maybe if you're feeling unwell you think there's a problem then you get tested and you get tested earlier than that but if you're feeling fine and your Bloods are being consistent that wouldn't worry too much about it um and and again ferritin can change for a number of different reasons organ meat can be a problem if you're eating more organs then uh would exist and now if you kill an animal you kill a buffalo you're eating that thing for two years it has one liver it has one pancreas right so your you need to eat organs in proportion of the animal that you're eating I think um you know because that's that's you know what we were doing we were eating animals that we hunted and they only had a certain amount of meat and organs in them so you know just be mindful of that um there's a question what if you don't have a gallbladder in regards to bile and fat absorption yeah that's fine you'll still you'll still make bile uh from your your liver and it'll just just track down into your better here track down into your um into your intestines normally would get stored in the gallbladder some would spill over and someone gets stored and now all of it's going to go into your intestine and so you may just not be able to eat a big hit of fat at one time because your um you know you're not going to have as much bile available as you don't have a gallbladder it's not going to squeeze out a big hit of concentrated bile to then absorb all that fat and so you'll you're going to not be able to absorb as much fat which means that you are going to you know not absorb it it's going to go out and get you can get loose stools and diarrhea um so if that's the case if you're getting loose stools anytime you eat a big fatty meal but then you just need to split up your fatty meals throughout the day and that's fine there are a lot of people that form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is just an out pouching of the common bile duct and it just acts as a as a gallbladder it's just this little pouch that collects bile and can squeeze it out when it when it's needed it's quite interesting that it can do that and so if you're in that category then you don't need to worry about it you can just eat normally but if you are in the first group then you just need to split up your meals fatty meals throughout the day foreign [Music] any other ideas for a quick easy carnivore meal I don't like the taste of unseasoned or dry meat well you can add salt then if salt uh helps things taste better um you know but just just eggs and meat everything's just really just whole meat Whole Foods is really the way to go there are a bunch of different recipes actually just got um uh carnivore cookbook sent to me by um Maria Emrick and her husband who I'll be speaking to um probably next week and um and talking about that and I have a QuickBook out of carnivore cookbook so you can have sort of different ideas from that um but you know for what I do I like to keep it simple I just make steaks you know ground beef patties eggs things like that works great it's good food it's good for you tastes good A little bit of salt to taste if you want it and your the longer you do carnivore the more you will really come to appreciate the taste of meat and you just want meat that's what you're gonna want and so you're all you know you'll just enjoy that and appreciate that and um yeah uh somebody asked do I only eat beef do I eat other animal protein sources eggs dairy or fish and chicken yeah mostly beef um but you know sometimes I'll have a bit of chicken sometimes I have a bit of pork or lamb uh sometimes fish uh eggs occasionally as well I don't have a problem with those ones some people do people with autoimmune issues and they have a problem with those things I don't but I just feel better when I'm eating beef and so that's just what I've just naturally come to to eat um either Chaffey I watched her talk on the low carb down under uh titled plants are trying to kill you I immediately sent it to all my workout buddies and family well that's awesome well thank you for that thanks for sending that um yeah it is sort of a of a provocative title and um uh you know but it's it's just to make people think you know these you know that's that's what my professor said to me 22 years ago when I was taking cancer biology and we're talking about how plants use defense chemicals and they uh you know they use these chemicals to deter animals and insects and pathogens and fungus from eating them uh because they're they're sitting ducks you know they can't like they can't do anything so uh you know physical to defend themselves so they need other means and um you know or are they do they have something out against you do they want you to die maybe maybe not um I don't think they've uh thought about it like that um you know if you die and you go into the ground and you Decay your nutrients go into the soil and that's better for them you never know maybe they do want you to die but either way they they don't want to die and if they get eaten they die right so you know it's um it's it's important to understand that and it's important to understand that there are more than just one bad thing in the world there's more than just you know it used to be fat cholesterol but there's obviously other things uh in fact cholesterol aren't bad for you they're very good for you so um you know and now you know the keto group have been saying oh well carbs car is really bad yes they are but they're not the only ones and so that's a low carb Down Under um group that's that's a group of doctors in Australia and in America um low carb down under and low carb USA low carb Denver all that sort of stuff these are these are doctors and clinicians that that understand that a ketogenic diet confers health benefits and and we've been looking into the biochemical reasons for that and and coming up with very interesting results as as a as a product of that so I wanted to make the argument and make the case to that group that yes carbs are bad but they're not the only things that are bad there are other things that come with plants that cause harm and that we need to recognize these things as as poisons and that a lot of the diseases that we're treating as doctors are actually poisoning and you treat poisoning different than you do a contagious disease right a disease you're trying to treat with you know supportive care you know antibiotics maybe and let the body fight this thing off with an exposure you get rid of the exposure first and foremost get rid of that so you have lead poisoning you get rid of anything that can contribute lead to your person so lead pipes and things like that that's the first thing you do maybe there's some chelating agents that you can use to help get the stuff out of your system faster but the whole point and Mainstay as you get you get the stuff out of your out of your environment you know you don't give someone a chelating agent oh yeah don't worry about your lead pipes just take this pill I mean no one in their right mind is going to say that so you need to get rid of the lead types okay so these are our lead pipes just like the Romans you know they had lead pipes they didn't realize that this was causing harm they all got getting low-grade lead poisoning and eventually they figured out oh okay we're being poisoned and this is what's doing it okay and this is this is our lead pipes you know vegetables plants are our lead pipes we don't realize these are poison but they are poisoning us and they are poisonous as a people as a society as a civilization as a planet because this whole plant-based movement has gone all across the world and you know meets bad fact bad cholesterol is bad only eat plants it has absolutely devastated the health of the world people were simply not this fat sick and unhealthy uh 50 years ago they just weren't you know and we have so many more advances in in medicine and pharmaceuticals so we should be getting better but we're not we're getting worse okay so that's an environmental exposure relationship and so I'm making that case uh to a lot of doctors and clinicians that this is what it is this is this is an exposure and uh and that we need to sort of consider that when we're treating patients and thankfully it was it was quite well received and a lot of uh doctors came up to me afterwards it was like you know they really like the talk and they're like saying like oh my God I never wanted eat a vegetable again and so so it was good so it had its had its desired effect it at least made people think a bit more and there's a lot of people in the keto space or just nutrition in general that have now had to you know make things saying oh yeah that's you know that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] and here's why just you know fine they can do that um but at least it's it's creating a discussion and and making people have to address it and have to think about it and even though they don't think about it and they haven't really addressed it they're just saying oh well I know better they haven't actually looked into it they haven't said like hmm am I missing something here am I um you know am I is there something to this uh they didn't do that you know a lot of people that just dismiss it have not done that um but they should but at least they've had to address it at least they've had to you know bring it up and so I'm glad that it's um that it's done that had that effect anyway okay um I might just pic k one more question guys um well actually oh there's a"

        "body": "d stop uh right then and there okay there's another uh d stop uh right then and there okay there's another uh Super Chat thank you very much Connor um hey Anthony I am finishing off a seven day water fast only is it fine to break the fast with a tiny amount of fatty steak and then slowly have more after a few hours yes that is fine um you know sometimes you can after about five days you start worrying about refeeding syndrome where it just sort of throws your body out of whack because it hasn't eaten in a while and then things get a bit screwy so the the normal recommendations for that is yeah you start in slow so the only thing you should ever be eating is fatty meat and so that's what you should break your fast with and so try that just have a little bit you know if that goes well later in the day maybe have a little bit more the next day you can do a bit more and and so on and then you can just your body will naturally sort of start building up more um you know more of a desire for for food and then you can keep going so um yeah well that's interesting that uh you know so I you know I don't I don't fast myself um unless I'm forced to because I just can't get home from the hospital and I'm just just working overnight and the next day and just don't have an opportunity to eat um but I don't I don't just just deprive myself I think that you get the most of the benefits from fasting if not all but if it's fasting just by not eating plants and carbs and by being in the proper metabolic state so one benefit of fasting is is that it can lower your uh gki your glucose Ketone index and so this is something that we're seeing in cancer studies and cancer models the lower your gki the better because you are extremely limiting the amount of available glucose for these cancer cells cancer cells require 400 times the amount of glucose than your normal cells do and so if you limit the amount of blood sugar available then you'll limit the amount of available energy for those cancer cells which is good you don't want them to have a lot of available energy your cells can run on ketones cancer cells cannot they have damaged mitochondria and it's actually that damaged mitochondria which are which precipitates the cancer you know this is um the metabolic theory of cancer this is something that was you know shown by Otto Warburg you know 80 years ago now 70 years ago he published in 1951 um you know a paper called like you know the origin of cancer it just shows this is coming from damaged mitochondria or they can't go through oxidative phosphorylation properly and so they get uh they get serious problems from that and you can get cancer you can get a lot of other things going wrong with you as well like psychiatric disorders uh Dr Chris Palmer from Harvard just wrote a book called um or just published a book called brain energy which shows that the underlying unifying theory behind mental disorders and psychiatric conditions are mitochondrial metabolic issues and that if you revert you can reverse them actually reverse schizophrenia which is crazy to think about that you know these people have had to suffer from this their whole life and all they had to do was just stop eating carbs and stop eating plants and they would they could actually reverse these sorts of things um is is wild so if you're if you are fasting sometimes you can get your gki down so sometimes we're doing these human models with Cancer's trials um just doing ketogenic diet sometimes isn't enough but fasting can bring their gki down a lot on a car or not your GTI will be pretty low you want it below 2 in a cancer well that seems to be where people um do best with is a gki below 2 closer to one is is the best and you know carnivore and I can certainly do that you can keep your gki around one uh on a carnivore diet and um and but if you're not having too much luck with that you know fasting can can help bring that gki down as well uh Chaffee for president okay that would be so miserable politics is just so disgusting but you know honestly it um you know it just drives people you know good people out of there because it's just like well I don't want to deal with that nonsense which means that only the people that you know want to profit by this sort of these nefarious means are the ones that are actually you know in there doing doing something um you know it involves it all and that's that's not good for everyone so you know sometimes it's it behooves us to just throw our hat in the ring and just be like hey look I'll do my my civic duty used to be a civil service it actually used to be you actually did not make money as a politician previously in America anyway uh before all these lobbyists and special interests came through after FDR changed the um you know where they said that you couldn't do you couldn't spend Federal money on um special interests and they said no no even a special interest that that's part of the general interest uh because of I help you know Ford uh well that's really good because there are a lot of people that work for four and a lot of people that buy four so that actually helps everyone it's it's complete nonsense it was just a you know a lie that they told themselves and the rest of us to to break the Constitution and um and things have gone downhill since then you know a lot of other things have caused this to go downhill as well but that was one of them because that brought in lobbyists because now I got all these special interests and vying for federal dollars and that did not happen before you know you couldn't buy the interests and power of a politician previously because they didn't have any power and so you you know if you didn't have any power in the first place you don't have any power to sell and so you know it uh it doesn't attract those people that ar e corrupt now it does uh okay sorry there's another uh"
