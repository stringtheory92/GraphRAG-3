        "body": "all right hello everyone thank you very much for joining me for another YouTube live um today's September September 6th I tried to bring little cat um because my sister complains all the time when I don't so now he's now you know why I don't always bring him because he's a cat he doesn't always like coming and doing the things that we want him to but he's okay he's a good boy so so thank you everyone for joining sorry I was just finishing up a um a another interview and it took a little longer uh than expected so back now have another couple hours and so we should be able to get to a lot of questions and um and hopefully be able to answer everybody's questions so there's a couple questions that that came up earlier one was from RF said Dr chaffy I'm a fellow carnivore but you made two claims recently that I can find no sources for one is that the Mongol horde of gask Khan we're all over 6'2 and that um or 6 foot and two that animals are in ketosis well animals are in ketosis typically and they have done studies on lions and wolves and found that they're uh into ketosis but also you can extrapolate from other ones that haven't specifically tested that on because what are they eating um there 70% of of animal species are carnivores so they're not eating carbohydrates so they're eating fat and protein and uh so they'll be in in that metabolic state that we call ketosis where you're running on your fat stores where you eat food you store energy as fat and then you run on the fat that's what we call ketosis um and also a lot of animals that go through periods that they're they're not eating so especially Predators Hunters they they may go days or weeks without or a week or so without uh eating and so what else are they going to be in they're going to be in a state of ketosis and that so-called fasting metabolism which is not a fasting metabolism it's just a non-carbohydrate metabolism and that's actually what it's being called now in Biochemistry classes um but then herb fores who eat fibrous plants what are they eating they're eating fiber but they're not absorbing the glucose the bacteria and the protozoa or other microorganisms are eating the cellulose and they're excreting saturated fat and then they're dying off and they're being uh consumed as protein so even though they're eating fiber they're eating fiber to feed and harvest the bacteria so really they're just bacteria farmers and they feed the bacteria and then they eat them just like we feed cows and then we eat them and so they're getting fat and protein from the bacteria we get fat and protein from the cow and so they're be in ketosis as well so um I don't know if anyone's everever tested that in cows and gorillas um but that's just a fundamental understanding of the biology and biochemistry um hummingbirds no idea what the hummingbird is eating bunch of nectar or honey bees or those sorts of things no idea what their biochemistry is don't really care herbivorous animals that eat fibrous plants they're they're absorbing fat and protein animals that eat other animals they're absorbing fat and protein so they're going to be in that metabolic State and they're not taking a whole bunch of carbohydrates uh when you put cows on grains and high carb foods the exact same thing happens to them as when uh as happens to us they overeat and they de and they deposit um pathological variant of fat in the muscle in the organs and around the organs and so in the muscle called myosteatosis you see this on MRI and people that are metabolically sick and then we're trying to reproduce this in cows and what do we how do we do that we give them grains and and we want we have fatty liver disease non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and we say woo we don't know what happens with that but you know how to make it in a duck you stuff a feeding tube down its throat and you pour grains in its mouth okay so carbs carbs will cause those those pathological effects so we see those same pathological effects when they're eating carbs and you see all those problems go away when they just eat their you know when they get their fat and protein which is what we're getting so they're going to be in that same metabolic State because the similar metabolic States and hormones cause the same problems in us as it does in those animals um genghiskhan the Mongol horde um there are a number of books and Histories on the fact on the subject just go around and Google and say oh how tall were these people they compare um this to they they they try to extrapolate from Modern average heights where people are living in a modern post-agricultural society um look at those averages and then trying to say well gask Khan was probably around that height too you know you're talking about Thousand-Year disparity between the two and entirely different um diet and so you look you go out into the you know into the steps in the step country like the the Mongols out there they are still just eating traditional meat things these are big dudes and you get in the cities and all sort of stuff with this post agricultural garbage that people are eating you know very different and so and their their height and health are very different as well and you see this in pre-agricultural and post-agricultural societies everywhere in the world in the fossil record and as it changed and change from pre-agricultural to post-agricultural um you see the height and health and brain size uh diminish and you know so we see that that in the Mongols going to a post-agricultural society as well so pre- agriculture they're going to be taller and in there's a great book by Jack Weatherford called um genghiskhan and the making of the modern world it's an amazing book super interesting and um it's uh it it talks about how these people were very tall very big extremely healthy and that their specifically their diet was very rich in proteins and fats and animal-based nutrition so they were much healthier than the people that they were fighting now there's going to be differences and disparities especially because a Mongol horde grew because they would go and they would take over an area and they basically say hey you want to join me you'll be accepted in you know full citizens you know will accept you in adopt you know your some of your leaders and kids as you know our leaders and brother you know like genghiskhan had his mom adopt a lot of different you know people kids of of of tribes and Nations he took over so that they would be his brothers and so they would be in his inner circles and things like that and then their troops would be allowed in and um and just as as completely full uh with full rights and things like that and they wouldn't be punished um but if you resisted then they would they would make extreme examples of you so people would keep joining in obviously they're fully developed you know who knows how tall they are but the multigenerational ones that are just eating meat those guys would be really really tall and you know he talks about this in there about how gasan was an extremely tall man even compared to his um you mean it compared to his uh peers and um you know and then you talk about and they talks about the disparities in the height and health between these different armies is significant as well so um you know there I don't know if he specifically says you know what what their average height is but you you can extrapolate from a lot of these sources how tall these guys were and um and different fossil records show the average heights of different populations I mean going back in the Chin Dynasty I saw a study God when I was in probably Junior High School about how in the in the first you know dynasty in China the Chin Dynasty the soldiers there were on average like six foot3 and so this would have been sort of before um you know they really move to like you know very rice based sort of uh population so uh you see a lot of these things and I mean look at you know people in China over the last century they've just gone shorter and shorter and shorter because they were starved and weren't able to eat meat and they were able they were just you know had these these famines like you shrink if you are um as a population you shrink if you're not able to get enough nutrition during development we know from uh the I don't know if I ever said specifically they were all over six foot with Kangaskhan maybe but I that would have um um you know would have been an extrapolation but there have been fossil records uh from people you know hunting the big Mammoth Hunters and things like that showing that they were on average up to 6'2 some some places up to 6'4 average so these are big strong people Native Americans the Cheyenne uh in the Great Plains in the late 1800s were on average 5 foot 10 and there's a paper in the 2001 called the tallest in the world and showing that these people in the you know Great Plains in America were the tallest human beings alive on Earth and way taller than the the average um American at the time or average European at the time and the interesting part about that is that they were already on the reservations they had already wiped out the Buffalo and the bison and um and they had uh basically didn't have the same supply of meat and food that they normally had before and so they said that the older Generations were way taller than the younger Generations that had been raised on the reservations and things like that so they said if they they done this you know study 50 years ago 100 years ago it would have been much taller still you know when they were all just eating bison um and so that's what we see every single time in the Mongols and and account after account after account historical account not just you know some blog post um like Jack weatherford's book which is great I'd highly recommend it for for everybody it's very interesting you know they talk about you know the the the health and um Vitality of these people because of their diet and and they were just bigger physically than everybody else um so that's I don't know exactly what you're referring to saying that they're over six foot I don't know if I ever said that but just they really big tall people maybe they did but that would have been sort of from from that um also wanted to give a shout out to my buddy Chris brandlin who's been helping me um patent uh all my podcasts so Chris brandlin it's called the Carn is goes by the carnivore lawyer and he uh helps other people in carnivore communities with free legal advice um if if things come up so people can find him at brandlin law BR an DL i n law.com and uh can check came out there all right uh let me see here um here's one from Rob Miller says is it necessary to limit the amount of liver one eats I don't trust the people who say we should um I think it's I think it's probably a good idea not to go overboard it does have it's very nutrient dense but you know there in lies a problem you get too much and you can get uh nutrient overload you can actually get some what's called V hypervitaminosis so too many vitamins and that can be a problem especially the fat soluble vitamins um that uh the fat soluble vitamins that um that that show up like vitamin A for instance there's a lot of retinol in liver it's actually unsafe to eat polar bear liver because there's so much vitamin A it's actually will be a lethal dose it can kill you and if you eat enough of seal liver that can kill you too that's why polar bears have so much vitamin A in their liver because they eat a lot of seals that have a lot of vitamin A in their livers and so uh you know cows don't have nearly as much as all that but they do have a good amount and so U for those reasons you know you can you can get too much of a good thing think of it is as uh you know we're trying to do this naturally right we're trying to eat our natural diet and our natural diet consisted of animals we would uh hunt raise and kill and we would typically you know have access to the animals that we hunted um and so you know you take down a buffalo that thing has meat on it enough meat on it to uh feed an individual for two years or more with tons of meat and fat every day just from the skeletal meat and fat and it's got one liver it's got one heart it's got two kidneys right so that needs to last right and so one Li one liver over the course of two years it's big liver but it's two years so just try to I I just try to keep things in proportion you know so if you get if you're just eating you know half a pound of liver every single day it's it's going to catch up to you you know at first probably it'll be fine because you know almost everybody is is nutritionally deficient and so starting out on a carnivore diet uh it's probably a good idea to get uh some some extra liver in you but once you catch up you can get hypervitaminosis so that's where that comes from so you know I I don't think everyone needs to have liver most people just do just fine just on SK skeletal meat and fat I checked their bloods I checked their nutrients I checked mine you know I've had I had liver sort of three four times in a decade and all my nutrients were in optimal ranges and so um that's fine if you're eating certain meat that's maybe you know more grain fed and it's not near as nutritious as other sorts of things you know bit of liver is not going to hurt you if you have genetic disorders like MTHFR and you require just a bit more B12 and folate you might need a bit of liver if you have um malabsorption issues if you have pernicious anemia or partial pernicious anemia where you can only absorb a certain amount of B12 but not all the the B12 that you eat you're going to need higher concentrations of B12 so those sorts of things you know change and so you know maybe someone would benefit from liver um not everybody will most people don't you'll everyone will improve but if you have some sort of nutritional uh malabsorption issue you know maybe liver is a good idea um if you're going to eat liver and you're going to eat liver regularly I usually just say try to keep it in proportion try to keep those proportions in mind you know a couple ounces of liver a day should be fine um couple ounces of liver a couple days a week is is often more than enough so keep that in mind and um you know just uh do what's right for you check your check your blood work check your nut nutrients if you're in a perfect level with that amount of liver keep going you know if you're a little lower than optimal you know bump it up a bit if you're above where you need to be well you know you don't maybe need to eat as much so just keep that in mind I'm try what's happening oh little cat getting into things hold on a second okay he's fine so apparently he does want to stay anyway um so getting on to to some of the supe r chats um Rick Diaz thank you

        "body": "u'll do great Julie halabi thank you very much for the u'll do great Julie halabi thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy my friend has alopecia and I was telling her about the lion diet have you ever heard of Li diet curing this thank you yes absolutely um it depends on how damaged the hair fol because it are so alcia you you lose hair when you're not supposed to and um eventually you know you can damage the hair follicles to the extent that they die and that at that point they're they're not coming back but they can still fall out and not regrow when they're still alive they're just dormant they're just not healthy enough to regrow hair um and so when you fix the problem underlying and they can actually get better and healthier and they actually start having more hair regrow but it can at least stop the underlying process of alpia some of the alpia can be you know autoimmune in nature and so that can definitely stuff up any autoimmune issue and reduce your antibodies towards your own body and you stop the damage to your own body now you can have permanent damage from what's already happened with your autoimmunity um but whatever is temporary and whatever can heal can heal and you at least stop the process of the autoimmune attacks on your body and uh so that can address the underlying um cause of alopecia as well it depends on what's causing alopecia there are other things that cause alopecia as well but um they can definitely address many of the of of the causes of that so yeah it's definitely worth a try and and she'll improve in so many other ways too that that it be way way worth well worth it you know sometimes people are losing hair they're doing these things oh my God it's not working or it's making it worse and then all of a sudden you know four months five months down the road they start seeing these little hairs growing in they're like oh look at that or their their hair stylist or something like that may say like actually you have a lot of hairs growing in here little tiny ones that you may not see in the mirror and so just to keep that in mind that when you're a woman you have long hair and you're just seeing it get thinner and thinner and you're feeling it's like oh this is getting worse and worse that can be very concerning um and it takes years to grow that hair back out as long as the the rest of your hair so it's sometimes you don't you don't see the benefits for a while but um keep an eye out for it and um yes it can absolutely help here's a nice comment from Simon or Simmons RC 143 days strict carnivore but who's counting um 40 lbs down and so many health issues she's gone thank you Dr shafy that's great really glad to hear that Simmons that's amazing um this one from my creative Angel hello Dr chaffy carnivore Ron here from the Philippines uh Professor CA freed said that glutamine is one of the cancer Foods aside from glucose and animal foods are high in glutamine should I worry plant foods are high in glutamine too and you make glutamine so um that's that's the thing so uh you can't avoid glutamine it's ubiquitous you get uh proteins from plants you're going to get glutamine get protein from animals you're going to get glutamine this is why fasting can potentially increase um have increased benefit in the case of cancer on top of a coronal I think the vast majority of benefit you get from fasting comes from just not eating the wrong things but specifically in cancer I think it could also be that you're going to be limiting out more of the glutamine as well and uh that's just an idea I've had but um um you know it would make sense from that standpoint different cancers rely more or less on glutamine and so some don't really take up much glutamine at all so it's sort of a moot point others take up a lot such as GBM flu blastoma brain cancer um so uh so um it's uh it's more important in in those cancers right so it depends depend on what kind of cancer you have too but even ketogenic carnivore diets with GBM that takes about 75% of its energy from glutamine significantly improves um when when people go on ketogenic diets like carnivore diet um even though there's glutamine and meat other thing to remember is that glutamine is denatured by heat so you cook meat it will denature the glutamine I don't know the exact temperature uh that denatures glutamine so I don't know if it has to be well done or medium rare is enough or medium well but uh heat does denature glutamine maybe someone can can look that up and share with the class but um you do that uh but this is why Professor CED also um you know um Champions the use of glutamine disruptors um this is why some people are saying that that cancer is not actually cancer it's it's a a parasite infection and that's because you give people parasite medications and it and it helps and the cancers reced well maybe but you know when we look at cancers under the microscope and we look in the cells we don't really see well at least it has never been reported that I'm aware of that people have seen parasites in the cells or in those clusters of cells Etc we don't see that we you look at every Cancer under the microscope that's how you diagnose cancer um it's not not just by looking at someone or seeing it on a scan you have to get it um cut up on a slide under a microscope that's how cancer is diagnosed in all cases so we don't see parasites as of yet but interestingly parasites require a lot of glutamine and so one of the great ways of disrupting parasite action in your body is to block glutamine and so you give the medications that block glutamine like fendol or mebendazol there's Dawn that was used as a actually chemotherapy agent in was it leukemia or lymphoma and same thing blocks glutamine um metabolism in the cells and now the cancer cells can't use glutamine cancer cells die and so uh that's what some people you know Professor cfre talks about this and so there's different protocols that uh utilize Fen bendol or mebendazol Dawn when you can get it um not everybody can it's you'd have to get that prescribed you know preferably from an oncologist but I think some places are starting to to use this now I think in Canada there's a place in Vancouver I don't know the name of it but um think the hypocrates Institute or something like that they might be starting to use that now but don't don't quote me on that I just a sort of a a vague memory of that um but either way uh plants have glutamine animals have glutamine cooking gets rid of it fasting doesn't even bring it in the first place and different medications can block its utilization in the body because you make it yourself just like you make glucose and so things like metformin lowering your glucose and and um raising your ketones even more can potentially help in uh in the ketogenic metabolic therapy as well so all these things uh come into play and but you're right you need to consi der glutamine as well free thank you very much for the"

        "body": "ason's works thank you very much for the very generous ason's works thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat would love to get your thoughts on fat-free mass index um calculators measuring your ankle and wrist diameter and height for the amount of muscle your frame can handle h that's an interesting concept I haven't looked into those that's very interesting something that that would be interesting um you know it's you know if you're if you're looking you know to put on muscle naturally and so how big can I get naturally you know might be interesting um if you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you work out really hard you'll put on muscle more easily than you ever have in your life and you keep doing that you're going to get to a natural point that your body just sort of maintaining that um and if you're able to work out more and push yourself more you'll and eat more you'll get more and um there will be sort of a a balance point for me it was 240 pounds you know and that's where I can comfortably eat twice a day and work out for an hour you know 45 minutes to an hour and um four days a week and that's where my body maintains 240 pounds you know around 6% body fat and and I feel great I feel great doing that if I were able to work out more and eat more I would probably put on more muscle but I'm not too worried about it you know and I and and I don't have the time so you know it might come to a point where I I'm not working 14 to 16 hour days and uh seven days a week and not traveling internationally literally every month this year for U medical conference to speak at um and I might actually have time to to actually work out and and play sports again but um now is not that time and so um you know for practical purposes I just think you just work out as hard as you can eat as much fatty meat as as your body is asking you for and just see what happens I'm not too familiar with those calculators though but that's interesting um I I think a lot of those calculators they they give you sort of a Rough Guide but most of them just don't they don't have all the variables to you know to take um to take everything into consideration and so it can be possibly generally applicable to a lot of people but there's got to be outliers and so just work out hard eat a lot of meat and make yourself be one of those outliers and uh that's that's what I do um might be interesting though it'd be kind of cool to to check mine because you know when I was younger I was I was quite skinny um not like horribly emaciated skinny but I was very slender you just you know SK skin skinny teenager you know and uh and then I just started you know uh lifting weights and working out more and I just started putting on weight slowly but surely and then I went carnivore when I was 20 and just really started putting on a lot of lean body mass and lean muscle mass and started getting stronger and stronger and and um more and more muscular I think at one point when I was 24 23 24 I was freaking jacked and I'd been carnivore for like four years years and like my life was working out and playing rugby and and um and uh you know doing a bit of school on the side for some of that but majority of that time I was just just full-time playing rugby and uh I was a moose I remember seeing a picture and um I sort of was turning around like that and sort my shoulder sort of shrugged up like that and I was like oh my God it was like a bulls neck and um you know so I don't know if that's just you know my Frame Works I don't know if that would fit in with that calculator but you know I get pretty big and then when I was off of that and just eating sort of whatever I think my heaviest I got to was like around 270 most of that was muscle but definitely had you know a layer of fat on that and then when I went back on Carnivore and just started lifting weights and playing rugby again it was again again it was down to like 240 245 just you know yeah around usually around 6% body fat I I know it'd be interesting to to check out one of those calculators maybe send one of those on and I'll I'll try and check it out and see if that lines up and it just says yeah 245 you know rip badass for my measurements be like well okay pretty accurate but um otherwise I don't really know sorry about that question from Pilot OBET um does carnivore help with ebph or prostate issues just lost a friend oh sorry to hear that um to prostate cancer recently it does in fact help with Bine prostatic hyper hypertrophy and other prostate issues um my friend Professor Ben bman wrote a book called why we get sick and talks a lot about insulin resistance and um and how this contributes to so many different diseases um made enough to myself [Music] and um that actually reminded me of something else sorry about that and um so and he he talks about how insulin resistance is is is is tied up with uh the prostate and how insulin is an anabolic hormone and so it causes certain tissues to grow and prostate being one of them and so you get rid of that and your insulin comes down your prostate goes down as well and so that can help also and then just cancer in general is improved dramatically by ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet because of mitochondrial benefit and function you when you have um improved mitochondria you know and healthy mitochondri you don't get cancer you really can't get cancer that's been shown in in um lab trials transferring uh mitochondria and and DNA to and from uh cancer cells they find that healthy mitochondria suppress Cancers and um damage mitochondria put in healthy cells cause cancer and but the nucleus the the DNA being transferred to a healthy cell with healthy mitochondria doesn't behave as cancer you can actually clone them into you know mice and frogs and things like that I think they use in the the experiment so it can certainly help with any cancer I think uh due to that those principles of the warberg effect that you're limiting out amount of glucose that's available and and cancer cells require 400 times the amount of glucose as normal cells so that's a big one right there and then you're going to be improving mitochondrial Health three four months on a m on a ketogenic carnivore diet you're going to have four times the number of mitochondria and they're four times as effective and so you're not going to be able to get cancer because you have healthy mitochondria so um I I do think it would help quite a lot and um so uh yeah so good luck with that sorry about your fri end Gunther SB thank you so much for the very generous"

line diet great job mostly 100% grass-fed beef salted taste two to one fat to protein ratio in grams two meals a day still have low energy especially a few hours after meals same as before carnivore what might I be doing wrong well first of of all um if you're getting tired after eating meals maybe you're eating too much during the day maybe eat smaller amounts um if you're eating uh your main meal at night you just eat a whole bunch of fatty meat at night and you get lethargic good go to bed it's time for it anyway um I noticed that too you're going into a rest and digest mode you're put you're dedicating a lot of of blood and uh to your intestines to um absorb break down and and utilize those nut UT that you just ate and so that's blood that's not available to your body and your brain you're going to get tired you're going into a rest and digest mode you know turning your parasympathetics as opposed to your sympathetics and you're going to chill out and your body's going to tell you to chill out because it doesn't want you going around wasting energy you got the energy you got the food now relax take it easy rebuild repair and get ready to do it tomorrow because every day is a grind right so uh that's pretty typical that you'll get tired after you work out or sorry after you after you eat especially if you eat a lot so if you're eating during the day I eat sort of a half meal half as much as you want um and see how that goes don't eat so much that you get tired and it should be a mount that you just have a bit and you take the edge off and you feel better but you're not you're not um uh lethargic you're not doing it to the point that you're lethargic then um if you have low energy in general you're probably still keto adapting and fat adapting that actually takes months and months and months and there are some people to do it fully now most people get better energy within the first couple of weeks first few week or after the first few weeks um but not everybody does and there are a number of people that have gone to the the three-month Mark and just really had poor energy the whole time and then eventually something clicks and they they get their energy back so a lot of people get that about where you're at now about the three-month Mark more people you know obviously get it done earlier but of the people that are sort of holdovers a lot of people click over it about three months I have seen a couple people take as long as six months and obviously that's not where you want to be but the good news is for them it did come and they had amazing energy after that if it's taking this long you have to wonder if you have some sort of nutritional deficiency or hormonal imbalance like maybe you have a thyroid problem you're hypothyroid and um and you're and it's going to take longer than this for your thyroid to heal and you just may need to be on some thyroid support um if you have a damaged thyroid from everything before um and if you have you know low B12 those sorts of things like if you have an um a malabsorption issue and you can't really absorb B12 very well then even though you're getting more nutrient dense food that has way more B12 effects meat is the only uh you know animal products are the only source of of naturally occurring um B12 in our diets right you can't get it from Plants um you know go suck on an algae bed if you want to but you know you get poison from the algae and the swamp water as well so that's not a really good option um but you know you're going to be getting more B12 so B12 should be getting better but if you have a malabsorption issue or pricious anemia or something like that or whatever you know there could be some reason why you're not optimal so check your Bloods you know check your thyroid check you can check other hormones and check your uh B12 and folate things like that maybe you have MTHFR maybe you just need a bit more B12 and foli or you need to add in some liver maybe when you add in liver after a few weeks you catch up with all these vitamins you start feeling better so have those thoughts in mind if it's if it's taking you know three months six months to uh feel better you know just check your Bloods as well I mean I catch these things early on in my patient population because I check their bloods first thing they do you know they walk in the door and we talk about all their problems and I I get a a you know big full deep set of blood test for them and then then we go from there and then I check their bloods again in a couple months if there's problems with their B12 I'm seeing I'm checking it I'm checking it from pernicious anemia and it shows up I actually diagnosed a number of cases of pernicious Anem emia long before they've completely lost the ability to absorb B12 but of course you want to catch it before then you want to stop it before it's a a disaster and then they're you know dependent on B12 shots for the rest of their life or they die um so you know when I see that and I'm I'm seeing them they're eating meat they're eating liver I've given them a shot and um and then another shot and then B12 goes up and then it comes right down it goes up it comes down it goes up and just keeps coming down it's like all right well you're obviously getting enough and eating meat and liver there clearly a problem you're checking for pous anemia lo and behold they have it and um and then you just know okay well you need you know sublingual B12 you know or injections regularly and all of a sudden they just feel amazing so it could be something uh like that too so just you know make sure that you're that you are uh you know not not uh mis sing something like that Striker Fam thank you for the"

right after eating cause heartburn um it couldn't some people it depends on how patent your your you know um inferior sphincter is that connection between your esophagus and your stomach if that's if that's uh possible to um you know that sort of little patent hey buddy come here buddy come here little guy um if that's able to if that's able to close off then you won't have a problem you know people sleeping on their uh you know one side versus the other sometimes they have more heartburn or stomach issues um but you know if you find that you get heartburn straight after eating then you know you know don't do that that's fine uh I don't have a problem with it and um a lot of people are fine with it too uh but if you if you suffer with heartburn um and you get that worse after you eat then then yeah take it easy and uh you know sit up for a bit and and um don't don't be recumbent straight away okay this my sister being howdy uh the amount of crap he gave me for watching Star Trek and now he's making Borg references people understand the Borg it's a very is a very apt reference and not many other things that that um that that relates to and uh yes I gave you crap for watching Star Trek but I gave you crap for watching the stupid Star Trek like the the um uh like deep space n and Voyager and all those just wretched versions you know um the original was was pretty corny but it was you know it was fun too uhh but you know next Generation that was good that was fine watch that you know don't waste your time on the other stupid ones uh that's what I give you sh and I really give you for Babylon 5 that was awful that was such a bad show um and so yes I did give you a hard time for that but it wasn't just Star Trek in general for the sake of Star Trek it was those specific and and worse examples of Star Trek and Babylon 5 because come on Babylon 5 sucked um okay so here's here's a question from Thiago Napoli says hi doc any tips on how to get uh the elderly to join carnivore my mom is in her 70s actually thinks it me is making her sick certainly and that's the thing is is that you have to get over that that conditioned response um you get psychosomatic reactions when you're like oh that's bad for me that's bad for me that's bad for me you can actually make yourself physically ill when you eat that you can become you know turn your stomach and all that sort of stuff so you have to be careful about that um you just it's just education you know just understanding like actually Fat's not bad for me the it's not bad for me it's not going to hurt me it's going to make me better you know you look at the actual Mediterranean diet it was a lot of meat it was a lot of fish and these sorts of things were really helpful and really beneficial um uh and and and sometimes the older Generations can remember that you know what did your grandparents eat when you were a young girl you know what they eat oh they ate a lot of meat and fish you know and what did their parents eat when they grew up oh okay um if they could afford it it was meat and so you you can you can try that and see how it goes but it's it's just about education and and and deconditioning these things you can decondition these things but you know takes some time and just sort of understanding meat's not bad Fat's not bad plants are they have toxins objectively we calculate we can we can catalog them and categorize them and we have and uh to a large extent and of there is not a single damn thing in meat that's harmful not a single one you know the only one they could they had uh to to talk about was saturated fat and cholesterol that's been thoroughly disproven I mean they're clinging on to it desperately um but it's just you know it's it's just getting pathetic at this point really because they have no evidence that it ever caused heart disease so you know they're just they're just um you know they're just you know throwing a temper tantrum at this try time at this point trying to get their way but they have no leg to stand on um and so there's nothing harmful to meat there are harmful things in Plants this is an objective fact and reality and so when you understand that and you and you educate her on that she understands that it becomes easier and like okay well maybe just try a little bit see how you feel try it without all these other things because when you eat things uh you know depending on what you eat them with you know you you absorb things differently digest things differently plants have digestive disruptors and antinutrients that stop you from digesting and and absorbing things properly and so if you eat them if you eat meat with plants you will have a different experience than if you just eat meat on its own so give it a try see how it goes and um you know they'll come around it just it just have to sort of decondition themselves from that way of thinking and I did too I I would eat fat and I be like oh god oh I have to cut off the fat and I'm like wait what the hell am I doing you know trust a research trust the evidence that's good for me eat the damn fat but it was hard I had to recondition myself I had to eat a small bit of fat with a lean piece of meat and I was like okay that tastes good I can do that and it took weeks and weeks and weeks before I got more and more comfortable just eating fat and um it's it's you know we condition ourselves in a lot of ways it's just deprogramming you know you know you know you get brainwashed like we're in a cult we're in this Cult of cholesterol and and we have to be deprogrammed and so it takes a bit of time but you know we can so just work on that and um that's how you that's how you get people to come around young or old you know there's a everyone's been brainwashed and we just need to get out of this stupid Cult of cholesterol and mov e on with our lives Austin thank you very much for the"

        "body": "e on with our lives Austin thank you very much for the e on with our lives Austin thank you very much for the Super Chat is keto acidosis something we should be worried about on Carnivore absolutely not that is um just because it has a word keto in it does not mean it's anything to do with ketosis or nutritional ketosis or or just having and making and utilizing ketones so keto acidosis is when you're getting acidotic because you're producing tons of lactate you're going through anerobic activity and you're you're generating energy that way you're not able to you don't have any insulin so you can't get any energy into cells properly your cells have to go through different mechanisms of of energy um of energy generation you build up a lot of of acid as a as a result of that you become acidotic um and you have very high ketones but you have enormously High ketones and you have enormously high glucose as well and so it's it's a completely different phenomenon it is not a natural biochemical state which Ketone which ke ketosis is and so um you know when you just fast you know if you fast for 5 days or 10 days or two weeks or a month are you going to get into keto acidosis no there's nowhere anywhere no one suggests that anywhere okay well you're in ketosis right so why would you if you're not going to get it there why would you get into it when you're actually eating food and um and just still in that same metabolic State no it is not something you have to worry about just that that's you know the the beginning of that word uh keto scares people like oo keton keto acidosis oh that's bad it's a different word you know and um you know it's you know and it's like saying that asphalt is bad because it starts with same start as as assault and so asphalt is going to assault you it's going to kill you because it's the same word as as assault you know we we have different words for different things they mean very different things so just because it has keto in it just means that there's ketones in the process it doesn't mean that the ketones are causing the acidosis or the harm and so it's a completely different thing so no don't worry about that but that is something that people oh my God you're gonna get go into keto acidosis no you're not no one goes into keto acidosis except for type 1 diabetics that can't make insulin even type two diabetics unless they're insulin dependent cannot go into keto acidosis so it comes from not making insulin and not being able to utilize um any um glucose or or ketoses or get any energy into cells uh with insulin right so very different very different and no it's not something you have to worry about oh very sweet little Ellie Melly um who we just got engaged um if people hadn't come across that we just got engaged on our Wyoming trip so little Ellie Melly um says I love and appreciate you we're very grateful for your help care and commitment and everything else um thoughts on eating the trending moldy beef um yeah that's what people call High meat um maybe you know who knows you know maybe there's there's some some bacteria there that can help your microbiome if your microbiome is already established and probably don't need to worry about it though you know Inuit that that have just been eating meat their whole life and not necessarily horribly rotted meat you know they have very healthy microbiomes and more and more people coming to carnivore even from clean omnivorous diets or clean omnivorous ketogenic diets they're high in fiber and all that sort of stuff actually improve their microbiome just by going to un rotten meat and and cutting out everything else and so um The Moldy beef some people have found that it really helps them you know some people have have just been so sick and they have so many illnesses and they found the moldy meat side of things first and that was the first thing they went to and and they really helped but you know my question is you know did they try just a normal carnivore diet first because I'm I'm pretty sure that it would have it would have just would have been the same it would have helped anyway and um you would had eaten rotten beef you know which is um I've seen videos some of these people on news interviews and things like that and it's like their whole fridge is like furry like furry mold just like you know um not what I want and they didn't want it either they're like yeah it's disgusting it's horrible you I open the fridge it stinks up the whole house I have to eat it outside it's horrible it just it makes this the house smell disgusting but this is the only thing that's making me better and I have to do it and that's that's understandable I mean people get so sick that they just have to do something and um that's one of them that's one that they get to but uh I would really really want them to try just a normal carnivore diet with like a normal steak and see what that does and if that's not enough and that's not good enough and they think that the high meat goes down better then sure go for it I mean I'm fine and so I don't uh feel the need to do that you know some traditionally prepared meats that are let spoil a bit you know like in Norway there's like rot Fisk and that was sort of like this half rotten salmon that um that the Vikings would pack into barrels and then that just people have packed barrels and um they would travel with or they'd have for you know for for long Winters and all that sort of stuff and they couldn't get fresh meat um they ate that you know I I wouldn't have a problem eating that sort of stuff just making letting things just rot in my fridge probably not I you don't really know what bacteria is on there you know you get any sort of different sort of you know staff you know staff orus with some sort of super toxin secreted you get very sick very very sick so I think that letting it raw I mean eating raw I don't have a problem with as long as it's not you know visibly contaminated or you know doesn't smell off or all these sorts of things I don't have a problem with that uh that's fine I I actually do that fairly regularly um just from preference I think it tastes nice Raw Liver you know that's the only way I'll eat liver and I don't eat much liver but um if I do it's raw and um so but letting it rot I mean you're not really in control about what bacteria get on that you know some of the traditional ways of of preserving fermenting um and and and spoiling meat or dairy in a controlled fashion um you know that that is you know going to be a bit better um but I don't think I mean if you don't need it why would you and the thing is is that you know I argue to people well you know if you haven't um if you haven't gone carnivore I mean like well I feel fine I feel good I don't need to go carnivore because carnivore is for healing sick people no it's just for being your best it's just for being optimal and so I tell people it's like well I don't I don't need to because I feel good it's like well actually you I don't think you realize how shitty you actually feel um and and and you won't until you stop feeling that way you go carnivore and you'll realize just how horrible you felt your whole life I'm sure people can make the same argument to me about like well you haven't tried High meat well then you don't even know how bad you feel could be could be you know but do I need that information right now I don't think so so um yeah I don't know and the thing is though I haven't come cross people who have people that I that I've seen that have just gone they've just gone straight there you know and uh they they they skipped they skipped go and just went you know straight to Boardwalk they just went boom and um they uh had benefits and that's great but was it just from cutting out all the other things and going carnivore or was it actually The Moldy carnivore uh that was the benefit I don't know I think it's important to do this in a staged series of progression and you know maybe those people that are on high meat maybe just try normal meat and um and uh you know uh see how you go and and maybe you just feel just as good maybe you feel better maybe your breath doesn't stink all the time like rotting meat and your house is able to entertain guests and maybe even have a date you know those sorts of things so um food for thought and uh but yeah those are my thought s on moldy B Raja the king thank you very much for the"

        "body": "y thoughts on that Rubik's thank you very much for the y thoughts on that Rubik's thank you very much for the Super Chat should we worry about the mucus layer eating gut bacteria uh that are supposed to help us but only if we eat fi no fiber or the harmful protein fermentation byproducts of our microbiome yeah so that's not true it's um you know maybe in some cases um but like if you sort the the idea is is if you're just eating a whole bunch of processed food it's hyper palatable it's also hyper absorbable because it's just a bunch of you know just free glucose and things like that and you just eat these things you absorb a lot of it you don't really have anything else going into your small intestines so bacteria don't have anything to eat so the argument is that they're going to eat the mucus layer and that can you know get rid of some protection but is that actually what happens in real life do we have any strong evidence of that I'm actually not convinced of that and I haven't ever SE I've seen people make that assertion I've never seen anybody back it up with any like actual data I don't know where they're getting that they're just saying it and it may be based on something but I haven't seen any of those people making that argument actually Supply the evidence and so when someone says that you know be curious and just say okay great what's that based on where where does it say that that happen oh this guy said it okay no but what's the evidence that that actually happens because what happens when bacteria don't get enough food as they die out and other other bacteria take their place that are able to survive in those in those circumstances and you know you know that's the same or I mean that would have to apply to to fasting populations and if we have people that are fasting for religious purposes or whatever and they're not eating for a number of days at a time are they are they stripping their mucus layer and getting diseases and harm they're not eating fiber they're not eating anything and so no food is getting into their into your gut and if you have bacteria that predominantly rely on uh fiber and you stop eating fiber those bacteria just go away they don't just all all of a sudden start turning pathological and and turn into you know a problem like that they just die you know and other other bacteria out compete them that's what happens your microbiome changes every single day based on what you eat and so um it's I I don't buy it and people that have um been carnivore for a long period of time and um and Inuits Etc they have very healthy microbiomes and they don't have any of these problems that these theoretical problems that people have come up with to say that well this is going to be a problem because you're going to strip away your mucus lining and yet they don't so you know it's a theory um but it doesn't seem to be worn out in reality the other thing too um you know one of the one of the major proponents of this is uh Dr Robert lustic who I've got a lot of time for I I really love Dr rusk's work on sugar um and you know he talks a lot about fiber and things like that but he has specifically said that in the context of carnivore you don't need fiber for your microbiome right and and he and he goes into that he talks about the Inuit and how they don't eat any fiber and they've got really healthy microbiomes and they're really healthy in general you know so it's it's if you're eating a mixed diet or especially a processed food diet that's a problem or that he argues that's a problem and that you want you want the fiber free microbiome in that context but if you're not doing that and you're just eating meat you don't need it and um you know what fibrous plants were people eating when they were crossing the land bridge from Asia to North America during the last ice age in the Arctic right the Runo plants you know this is 1500 miles north of what is now Seattle and Seattle was under a mile high block of ice you know so what the hell did the the Arctic Circle look like you know it's it's um there's no plants growing I mean they're not they're not growing corn up there so you know it's uh it's just not the case you know if if this was something that was essential they said that fiber is essential for as an essential nutrient essential means it's essential to life and you die without it and here I am you know and here are the Inuits and here are all our ancestors that have made it through all the uh es and flows of this past two million years of ice ages that we've had so sorry you know not not uh not necessary so yeah no and you definitely don't need it for your microbiome no absolutely not uh check your microbiome you can see for yourself and you can see how healthy it is when you're on a carnivore diet people have been doing it more and more and they're getting uh really really excellent results so y eah check it out uh kingle thank you very much for the"

        "body": "eah check it out uh kingle thank you very much for the eah check it out uh kingle thank you very much for the super chat um your thoughts on occasional fasting uh mimicking diets low protein to uh stimulate uh autophagy well the um fasting mimicking diets are ketogenic diets so they're saying that like well when you're fasting you want to mimic we have all these studies to show the benefits of fasting but you know that's really hard to do uh what about a diet that mimics fasting so fasting mimicking diet that's just a ketogenic diet and what that does is it's just a diet that keeps your insulin low and it's in insulin being low that brings about autophagy that stimulates autophagy why because High insulin stops autophagy so it's it's not the fasting that's going to do this and it's not um anything to do with just not eating it has to do with your insulin being low so yes any diet that lowers your insulin will stimulate autophagy and you know lower your insulin goes down to normal levels because you need some insulin uh it's very important hormone you die without it but um too much you die with it and too much you will you will block autophagy so you just get that down to normal fasting levels normal stable levels and you will be going through autophagy and so studies has actually shown that ketogenic diets in general bring about autophagy and mitophagy and so after 3 four months on a ketogenic diet like carnivore you have four times the number of M Andria and they're four times as effective so this is not because you're starving yourself this is a normal housekeeping process that your body has to go through all the time to break down old tired scile cells and mitochondria and organel and replace them with newer better versions to keep you young it's just it's just something that keeps you young and healthy and when you eat more carbohydrates you age quicker for a number of reasons one it blocks growth hormone which is BAS the hormone of Youth it keeps your your tissues re regrowing and and repairing themselves and as your growth hormone in igf-1 goes down you age faster so that's one and Insulin blocks the actional growth hormone but also because you're building up ages that age you uh there Advanced glycation end products you're getting rid of those and you're going through autophagy when your insulin is down so you're doing you're literally aging much more slowly and sometimes you're aging backwards if you able to repair a lot of this damage and and fix your hormones in a lot of ways autopsy is just is just a normal functioning part of your physiology and so if um if you just have normal insulin levels you will be going through autophagy the whole time you don't need to fast and you don't need to do a special version of a carnivore diet carnivore diet is so-called fasting mimicking diet as long as you're fasting insulin is low you're in autophagy and you'll be fine as long as yeah as long as your insulin is generally low throughout the day you'll be going through autophagy and so they see this in ketogenic diets that you still get the same effects of autophagy um by by being on a ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet and so this is just normal it's just a normal part of our life and our bodies so ano ther question from nav nav thank you very much for the"

        "body": "ther question from nav nav thank you very much for the ther question from nav nav thank you very much for the super chat um I have loose stels on strict carnivore could I have oh sorry buddy got you I caught you little boy hey buddy okay so back to nav nav says I have loose stols on a carnivore diet could I have an actual condition that causes fat malabsorption like Epi or something like that how can I find out I mean I suppose you could but you know um on my mouth um if you if you eat too little fat you can get watery diarrhea if you eat too much fat you you can get diarrhea as well so it's sort of a U-shaped curve so you want to be right in that middle ground you're eating enough fat that it keeps it soft but not too hard but also not liquid um and uh and if you do that then then you should be fine also when people are you know going on Carnivore they they don't always cut out all plants they don't go full 100% carnivore they still drink coffee most on Earth drink coffee don't know why I've never liked coffee but um it is El laxative and it causes a laxative effect and when you take out fiber it has a much stronger laxative effect and so when people go carnivore they still drink coffee and so they get loose stools or they drink tea and they get loose stools or they take magnesium supplements because they think they need magnesium supplements and they get loose stools or they're diabetic and they're on me metformin which can cause loose stools or they use artificial sweeteners usually in the coffee or the tea and they get loose stools because artificial sweeteners are um are uh laxitives as well you know and so uh all those things need to be taken into consideration as well and then you need to eat enough fat try to get one to two grams of fat um per gram of protein and and see where that lands you if you're getting a bit of constipation mixed in with uh watery diarrhea and most days are like watery stools and then you be a bit of hard stools that's overflow diarrhea you're eating so little fat you're nearly you know getting so sort of obstructions you need eat a lot more fat and um you know if you're just eat if you eat just any amount of fat and just comes right out of you right away could be that you're just eating a lot more fat than your body can contend with or you're just not absorbing it but you know just eat the amount that your body's absorbing and um and you should be fine your body will absorb some and so just eat that amount and if your body wants a lot less than other people's maybe you know less than one gram per gram of protein and that's what gives you normal stools fine you know try it you know if you're just eating lean meat and you're still getting loose stools you're not eating enough fat it's not that you're eating too much fat and you're not absorbing fat it's that you're not eating enough fat and you're actually getting too much protein and that can actually cause loose stools protein poisoning one of the one of the symptoms of protein poisoning is diarrhea loose stools and watery diarrhea so it can come from too much protein and from not enough fat um where you get over you get partially obstructed and um and get what's called overflow diarrhea uh but it can also come from too much fat so you just have to play around with it but there will be a spot where your your body will just be able to absorb that fat and uh and be fine with it and um just make sure you're getting enough make sure you're not getting too much protein and you'll be fine and and cut out all all that other stuff oh but I was drinking the same amount of coffee that I was before yeah but before you were eating um fiber a bunch of other crap that slowed down the um the transport of your stools throughout your intestines so just uh cut all that stuff out just meat salt water that's it if you're having a lot of salt that was another one I've come across this before where people are just adding like rock salt and tons of salt to their water they're like oh you have to have so much salt if you're on Carnivore no you damn well don't don't use any salt and there are a lot of people that are on long-term carnivore that have never used salt for decades so no you don't need salt some people need more salt in the early adaptation phase when their insulin is rebalancing and their kidney function is rebalancing from the lower insulin and then that goes away and once you're adapted you don't need excessive amounts of salt um there are isolated cases you know my friend um Dave belman seems to need salt he just feels a lot better with more salt uh he's the only person I've ever seen that has been on a ketogenic di for years and um needed to keep adding salt I you know he's not 100% carnivore would that change anything I don't know but um I haven't seen anybody else have to do that um but at first sure and then but then some people just really really take it to heart that they need a lot of salt so just dumping salt in they have like quarter of their thermos full of rock salt and they're just drinking that all the time that's a that's a colon flush you know that's um that's that's how you flush out your colon that's causes a LAX laxative sort of effect you know it draws in a lot of water through osmosis and and um uh and you just flush out just all your intestines so uh just keep all that in mind and you should be able to to get to a happy place place I'm going to just let the little boy out real quick I brought him here just to satisfy my sister but he looks like he wants to get out one second [Music] okay about that just the little boy out okay so question from John John thank you very much for the"

        "body": "oing to be great Keith cerak thank you so much for the oing to be great Keith cerak thank you so much for the Super Chat You said Dr amar's hair looks like a muppet I don't know if I said that but maybe as thick as a Muppets um what do you think about his fermented protocol um maybe I did say so I don't think I don't think he looks like a muppet I think his his he said his hair was thinning now he has really thick hair ha maybe I equated that to how thick like a a Muppet's hair was which is actually true you know thinking about it like Burton Ernie it just big thick TFT of of hair he does very thick hair and he's you know he's 60 now and um and so uh his fermenting protocol um I don't have a problem with it I think if you're going to eat plants you ferment the hell out of them why would you eat anything else that's going to lower the toxic load and and up and um increase the availability of those uh nutrients um but uh he doesn't do it for the plants he does it for as a supplement for the bacteria that's what he wants he wants bacteria he wants that bacteria for his microbiome and I think that's great if you're trying to reestablish your microbiome and you know get a good healthy gut bacteria but if um and he does it in certain ways like he he eats it up choose up the ferments with meat so we bite choose them up together and it helps them break down together and also helps trojan horse that bacteria through the the the stomach acid and things like that so they don't get killed uh straight away um you know there's you know um you know people that that say that that doesn't happen and just get killed anyway but you know probably does kind of get some some slipped through um but the thing is too is that that once you establish a good healthy microbiome it's just there all all you need now is the prebiotics not the probiotics you um just eating meat is just going to keep supplying the the food requisite to to keep maintaining those really healthy species of of bacteria and also the other thing is is your oral biome changes as well it changes dramatically when you start eating meat and cut out the carbs the cavity causing uh bacteria are the um are the ones that that thatat carbs so you stop eating carbs and those bacteria die off they don't eat your mucus layer they just go away and they stop causing cavities they stop eating your and rotting your teeth so when you eat food you're actually putting a bacterial load in the food Bess and that's going down as well and so I think that that's probably what's seeding your microbiome because people's microbiomes change when they're just eating different things without prebiotics probiotics and um you know as uh as a friend of mine Ben asadi aadi who um who does the the keto Camp those sorts of things been doing keto for years and um he had you know a very healthy diet a lot of fatty Meats but also you know vegetables and fiber and Whole Foods okay great um then he checked his microbiome while he was keto for years uh it was okay he said was good it wasn't great and then he went and then the the suggestion was eat more um you know fruits and vegetables more fiber Less meat and less red meat and and your microbiome will get better and so he said okay I'm GNA do the exact opposite and only eat red meat and drop all fiber and plants and fruits and vegetables and what happened in three months his microbiome was far better than it was before now it was excellent and now he had six new species of bacteria that didn't exist in his previous microbiome test so where did those come from were they just too small to detect possibly or did they come from somewhere else like your oral biome uh which is got to have is going to be very different on a carnivore diet so I you know I'm a big fan of Sean he's a good friend of mine and uh and I like I like he does he helps a lot of people he does a lot he's a pretty badass dude by the way he was a he was in the military then he was a then he was a uh um a uh a lawyer and a um a prosecutorial attorney um he was uh then he decided want to go to medical school became an ER doctor um he was in the military as as I said he continued in the military as a doctor um he retired like a full birg Colonel and um he also in like the early 2000s he was like awarded like best doctor in the armed services there was like this whole thing so he was like the best doctor in the armed services and as a result um then Vice President Dick Cheney who was having a lot of heart issues at the time actually just picked out was like okay you're the best in the military you're my doctor so he was Dick Cheney's personal doctor um during during the Bush Administration and uh and you know uh probably afterwards um so he he's he's done a lot of cool stuff and then he got into like full-time nutritional research and and all that sort of stuff and and came to carnivore which is awesome and so um you know he's he's quite an accomplished person so you know he's uh he's very well read he's very intelligent and he's such a like a just an overachiever I mean seriously he was talking to me about um you know making like eating meat's the best thing but talking about you know the best what about the best nutrition for cows that makes the best meat um so he's saying I think I want want to go back to vet school so that I can figure out the best beef product so we can make the best human food and the best humans possible I'm like dude just doesn't slow down he's so excited he's just so into these sorts of things and just and just learning more and optimizing People's Health so you know you know I don't I don't have anything wrong with what he's doing um I think that you can probably do the same thing with fermented animal products fermented dairy even fermented meat if you want to get those bacteria I have I have a sneaking suspicion that your oral biome because you do have bacteria in your mouth right unless you're using Listerine and bleaching your mouth all day and then you know eradicating all the bacteria in your mouth which you don't want to do you want bacteria there you just want the correct bacteria there um those bacteria are going to go down too so I I I supect that you know you're going to have very healthy microbiome um regardless and that's what a lot of people are finding I have yet to check my microbiome so that's something I need to need to do but uh I would I would expect it to be very good um and and I guess we'll see but a lot of other people are doing that too so you know if you've taken back antibiotics probably good idea to take some fermented yogurt things like that I don't I don't think you necessarily have to use plants but you can use you know fermented uh Dairy so like yogurts you know plain yogurt things like that um and and Reed that or if you have you know just eating an unhealthy diet and you're eating a bunch of garbage and you're adding some yogurt and fermented dairy and and meat products and things like that sure you know um once you've established your microbiome it should be able to be maintained just with u just your diet alone you shouldn't have to keep re repopulating the bacteria because if you have to keep repopulating bacteria obviously that's not an environment that those bacteria can survive in you have to keep getting more and more and more and they just die out and die out and die out well obviously that's not the right environment for them and so the right environment for the right bacteria are going to be fed by the right diet by our right diet and whatever our evolved optimal diet is that will bring about cultivate and support the optimal biome microbiome oral biome and gut biome and that's what makes sense to me from an evolutionary biology point of view so uh yeah so those those are my thoughts on that but Dr Omar is great I'm a big big fan o f Sean here we go El melon thank you very much for the"

        "body": "'m carnivore six months oh that was oh you did another 'm carnivore six months oh that was oh you did another Super Chat that's what it was um well thank you for for both super chats I'm cornivore six months I've lost 20 kgs amazing that's great I H I'm having full abdominal hysterctomy because of my fibroid growing oh I'm sorry to hear that can I still be on Diet before uh during my operation and after recovering 100% and in fact it's going to be even better because you're going to be healthier uh and you're going to recover better I mean we already have tons of studies showing that people get better wound healing postsurgery with higher protein diets and Caro diet is a lot more protein than the standard diet um and you're also going to be in ketosis you're going to lower your inflammation so you're not going to be in as much pain and you're not going to have as much swelling and inflammation and and slowing of your wound healing process so you should find that you have better wound healing as a as a result and better recovery as a result um I'm sorry that your fibroids are still growing in fact ketogenic diets have actually been shown to help shrink fibroids but sometimes the horse is out of the barn is sort of too you know too much and um and the body can't really recover but um you know it's a you know it it has helped other people it has shrunk fibroids in other people um but uh you know so is is there possibly a chance to get another scan now that you've been carnivore for six months and maybe see if they're still growing or if maybe they've shrunk um might be worth it it might it might save you a surgery actually and then this is sort of a moot point but yes 100% you can still doing this do do this before during and after your surgery and I think it would be a very good idea if you did in the hospital you're going to have to bring food in because it's just sugary crap uh every single meal of every single day at those at those places which is just insane you have this sickest people in the world and you're giving them the worst Food it's so stupid so you'll have to bring in your own food if you want to actually eat like a human and um if you want to eat like a a pig in the 1930s being fatten for Slaughter then yeah you can eat the hospital food uh but I wouldn't so yeah uh yes you can definitely do it and I would I definitely would encourage that so good luck with that good luck with the surgery I hope that goes well the happy housewife this will be the last question everybody um and um and we have some super stickers but that then we'll have to to cut it because I got to run uh to work uh Happy housewife uh says hi Dr chaffy is there any info on a carnivore and preeclampsia my first pregnancy had it severely resulting in premature delivery my most recent pregnancy was carnivore and didn't have it at all I don't know if there's any studies that ever been have gone out I I do have the memory of pre-clamp being associated well certainly with diabetes but also just insulin resistance in general um if I'm not mistaken so you know that sort of thing would would you know help prevent it uh as well um one thing you can look at you can look at you know just on PubMed or Google Scholar is actually really accessible for people and you look up things like preclampsia and ketogenic or low carb or insulin resistance or diabetes and you can then see they'll have some studies that say like oh yeah preclampsia is strongly associated with diabetes and insulin resistance and all that sort of stuff um or that you know maybe people have done know ketogenic diets people have history of pre lampia they put them on ketogenic diets and all that sort of stuff uh there have been thousands of studies using ketogenic diets uh in humans for very specific health issues and uh and and distinct medical outcomes so there's a lot of information out there and my memory is that yes um that is related to things like insulin resistance and diabetes and so going on a cornivore diet you know should eliminate those at least those causes of preeclampsia um but don't quote me on that that's just that's just my memory um so but yeah I think so I'm pretty sure but you yeah you can you can sort of find that on on Google Scholar or Puget uh but that's great that you didn't have it with your second pregnancy I think that you know if you're eating what you're supposed to eat and your body's working the way it's supposed to work you're going to have pregnancies the way they're supposed to go which are a lot less morning sickness much more smoothly the fetus is going to develop faster the baby's going to be much strong stronger and healthier and develop better and they're going to live a much longer healthier happier life because they're going to be so much better developed and able because of what you their very nice mom has done for them so congratulations to you you're doing everything you can to to make your child as healthy and happy as they can be and they're really going to benefit from that so great job lucky kids they got a very nice mom okay thank you so much there's a couple other little chats here from Kinkle says I'm 75 and love carnivore and thriving it's great to hear um and then from Tracy uh had a super sticker thank you so much for that Tracy and um and then from Dirk Vander tan another Super sticker thank you very much for that Derk I really appreciate it [Music] um then there's another um message here from Striker fam it says uh carnivore for four weeks now medically retired uh law enforcement officer back and neck injury um overtime I blew up uh down 20 pounds brain fog gone depression gone able to focus uh so much better and you start on Miss thank you well that's fantastic um and great it's only four weeks you've lost 20 pounds and all those all those issues have gone away it's just amazing Toxin and toxicity you know that's it you remove the Toxin and toxicities go away brain fog is a toxicity um depression is a toxicity weight gain is a toxicity it's a byproduct of toxicity and um or can be anyway and so it's uh you know you're getting rid of the toxins and the toxicity goes away and it can go away pretty damn quick and that's what's so wonderful about this and you add those things back in guess what they'll come back and that's a cause and effect relationship so um that's all the evidence you need really and and um and uh if if somebody wants a randomized control trial with 20,000 people before they start it okay it's their life you know they want to keep suffering in misery and illness they can I'm sure a  not not a chance in hell so um you know great job everyone who's uh willing to you know take take the chance and actually try something uh new for them that can um benefit their life and getting all these massive benefits you know and please do you know leave in the comments what this has helped you with it really helps people can't tell you how many people have come to these these um uh you know q&as or videos and they're like oh is this really I don't know this sounds crazy but then they just see all the comments of all these people changing their lives and they're like hold on a second that that sounds like me I have those problems and I've seen 50 people with the same problem uh get better and they say okay well I'll try it and lo and behold it works for them too it's almost as if it's related and um and that really helps so that really helps people um and so you'll help a lot of people by being active by commenting by telling people your story making videos leaving comments being active you know with those idiots trolls and haters that go on all my all my posts and things like that and you know try to you know talk trash and discredit me and try to say that I'm not a doctor and so you shouldn't listen to me well I am a doctor and even if I weren't um that doesn't change the veracity of what I say you know that's ad hominum you know is what I'm saying true or not it is and it's backed up by evidence and I am a medical doctor with a medical degree and a and a a functioning medical license unlike other people who uh you know like Dr EDS who does not have a current medical license but he's the one throwing around uh shade trying to say that I am the one that's not the practicing doctor well no that's uh that's him and well that's what that's the um impression he's giving people Anyway by his careless words so you know you guys help others with that you know you guys going into the comments waiting into the those you know Lane Norton's comments and being like no this is you know this has helped me this has helped all these other people and you're just you know you can be nice about it be saying look you know you're you're being blind you're blinded by your ideology you want to be right you're making excuses for it you're making excuses why this works for some people and all that stuff but you're you're dismissing it you know and and dismissing what it is and um you know they need to be held accountable you know call them out and use your example and say that and more and more people that get active on this you know will overwhelm the haters and uh people will have to start paying attention and the good thing is is that the people that matter are paying attention there different researchers that are figuring this out starting to research it and publish more and more data on it and and the the people are figuring this out and saying you know what that's enough evidence for me I I think it's worth um I think it's worth trying it myself and seeing what happens and um and it works so uh that's the only thing that really matters is that it works and that people are getting benefited by it so well done everyone please do share uh your experiences with carnivore diet and again and if you want to be part of different uh published case series for these amazing things that that people have cured with cornivore diet please do email me at Anthony chaffy gmail.com thank you all everyone I will see you next time"
