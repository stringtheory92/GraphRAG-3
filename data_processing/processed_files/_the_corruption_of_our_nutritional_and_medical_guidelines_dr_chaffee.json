        "body": "[Music] [Applause] and something that I've done for a number of years throughout my my playing days and just throughout my professional career I I've looked into diet and nutrition how that affects health and chronic disease and athletic performance and I've come to different sort of conclusions that many here uh may know of for people that don't uh I do advocate for a uh species specific biologically appropriate diet for our species all animals have a species specific diet something that they eat specifically and uh we are no different and so it's very important to identify what that is and I think all the best evidence shows that that is actually a carnivorous St diet eating mostly if not exclusively fatty meat and that's what people have been doing since the dawn of humanity and whatever you've been doing forever that is what you're used to doing that's what you're biologically adapted to doing because that's how nature works if you're not adapted if you're not biologically evolved to eat a certain way you're going to die you're not going to make it it's survival of the fittest and so whether or not we were adapted to this way of eating 2 million 3 million years ago after 2 to three million years we Dam well are now and so anyone's saying that no no no actually eating something that didn't exist 50 years ago that's what you need to do uh you can you can just write them off as a lunatic so uh meat has always provided essential nutrients right so this this is something that we require okay how do we know this well the innu exist right there are no plants in the Arctic Circle there are no plants during an ice age in an Arctic Circle what plants were available for the people who crossed the land bridge from Asia to North America America during the last ice age there were none so obviously if you can't get everything that you need in the proportion that you need them from meat then you can't survive you can't live generationally and we don't exist we don't we're not here right now none of our ancestors would have made it through the the numerous uh ice ages and the Inuits wouldn't exist right now but they do and many other examples of of humanity do you like the Messiah there and so animal- based diets but they provide the nutrients were evolved were biologically designed to eat these things and uh there are number of different examples of that uh a number of different people such as the Inuit such as the msai such as the nette the native Australians these people have are well documented to be eating a lot of meat and they would know which plants to eat maybe used medicinally or if they were in a point of starvation and so a lot of people will say well they had access to these things sometimes they ate them therefore they were eating them all the time well you can't say that about the Inuit because they just never had them so it's always a good example always good to think about the the Inuit or the nette or people living during an ice age and one of the main things is they did not have chronic disease at all so there are a number of accounts going back hundreds of years that found that these these populations did not get the so-called diseases of the West that's what they had to call them because only people in Western countries were getting these diseases these people were not now since they' been incorporated into Western Society they're eating more Western food Western alcohol Western Sugar Western seed oils they're getting Western diseases right now we just call them getting older right plant-based diets these are sort of in Vogue hopefully not for much longer but they are missing many essential nutrients B12 D3 K2 retinol which is vitamin A dhaa EPA we touched on those those are the essential Omega-3s that you have to have that you cannot get from plants and we don't really make them well ourselves we need them from the food that we eat retinol vitamin A people think well what about beta kattin can't you turn that into Vitamin A yeah but only 55% of people can fully 45% of human beings cannot convert betacarotene into retinol they have to get it from meat you can't get it from anywhere else so what does that mean that means we have to eat meat right we have to eat it to get B12 too that doesn't exist D3 doesn't exist well vitamin K we get that from kale right vitamin kale no K has K1 and just like ala that's an omega-3 but it's not the right omega-3 K1 is not the right uh vitamin K we need K2 and we can't really convert K1 into K2 so we need it again from our meat so any nutritionist and this is sort of the Crux of this discussion any nutritionist who advocates for a plant-based diet or even a plant exclus exclusive diet is ignor ignoring those fundamental facts they're they're recommending a diet that is fundamentally deficient in basic nutrients how can you call yourself a nutritionist if you're advocating for a diet that is devoid of nutrients how can you say that that's an optimal diet that that's a good diet or even an appropriate diet for anyone at any stage in life it is if it is fundamentally deficient in nutrients but the problem is is they do a lot of people do and a lot of these colleges of nutritional Sciences advocate for a plant-based diet so we know it's not how we evolved and some people would argue some nutritionists argue well that's okay because everyone died when they were 30 anyway now we're eating these seed oils which is so great they're so good for your heart and then you can can live longer well that that's not true first of all they live much longer than we did we actually know that genetically we're supposed to live 120 years and yet we're dying in her 60s and 70s so anybody who oh my grandmother lived to ' 92 she ate a lot of carrots great she died 30 years young you know and and the fact of the matter is is that that the reason that they died on average in their 30s was because of infant mortality right you also can't tell the age of a of a pre- agriculture skeleton because they don't get arthritis they don't get Decay they don't lose their teeth so you're looking at this wow this is young healthy example they were all like that because they weren't getting the chronic diseases that we got immediately after the Agricultural Revolution you started seeing the degradation in the skeletons arthritis tooth decay tooth loss crooked teeth small jaws shorter stature on average 5 in shorter on average uh much smaller shorter femurs signs of infection poor wound healing things like that so how did we end up with plants being in a healthy diet why is that that's the main point of the talk today okay well one of the reasons we have these dietetics associations and they argue for they argue for plant-based diet they say that the healthy benefits of a vegetarian diet and they even say it was a well-designed vegan diet should be should be the best diet for you and yet they recognize well you do have to be careful with you know B12 D3 K2 vitamin A uh iron and all these other sorts of things but if you take care of those and you supplement it should be fine which is a bit ridiculous for a nutritionist a nutritional body to suggest that and they'd also say about the low carbohydrate diet this is a fat diet there's no scientific evidence and yet there are thousands literally thousands of studies in humans showing the benefits the medical benefits of a ketogenic diet in humans and uh they've actually had to had to change that recently because now a ketogenic diet is in the National schedule for diabetes treatment in Australia it's part of it's part of the guidelines right so they had to sort of walk that back but you see the sort of the biases right so the problem is is that the the daa the dietitians uh Association of Australia they are highly compromised so they basically make no they they show no evidence for why a low carbohydrate diet is a fat but then they say a vegan diet which is nutritionally devoid that you know this is a good diet for these reasons and they and they listed previously before they took this down they listed four uh studies every single one of those studies was actually uh funded by or written by someone from sanitarian Foods someone from the food companies or someone from the Seventh Day Adventist Church which we'll come to and that's very important a lot of these studies ma majority of these studies come from compromised sources a lot of them will come from from processed food companies that are trying to push their own agenda Coca-Cola alone spends 11 times the amount of money on nutritional research every year than the NIH the National Institutes of Health in America that's just Coca-Cola there's Nestle there's Pepsi there's Kelloggs there's sanitarium there's all these other sorts of of food companies they're all pumping out research they're all funding research they're all paying universities to do research okay so the majority of these research studies are biased or at least potentially biased and what do they look at they say eat more plants they're good for you when people eat more plants then you know they're healthier compared to what though they say well you take away meat but is that the only thing they took away because what they're really comparing it to is a processed food diet where people aren't eating fruits and vegetables maybe there's some meat in it like in a bun of a hamburger or something like that with some trans fats dipped and boiled vegetables potatoes and a sugary drink or artificially artificial sweeteners right so meat is the the smallest part of that so you go away from that and you go to Whole Food plant-based diet and people improve I don't I I don't doubt it okay but that's not because you got rid of meat that's because you got rid of all the the plant-based process Foods if we go back to our friends Messi they were part of the only study that I know of that actually compared what we're talking about which is a whole food meat-based diet and a whole food plant-based diet and that was in 1931 really havn't done anything since then and that was in published in the journal American Medical Association there's a British study and they looked at the Messi and they had a very good example there because the Messiah are largely eating meat blood Dairy and not much else but their neighbors uyu were almost the polar opposite they ate a lot of plants they a lot of tubers and leaves and seeds and nuts and all these sorts of things so they were largely plant-based alive at the same time in the same area and this is late 1920s 1930 so this wasn't the era of industrial Agriculture and crop farming and pesticides and insecticides and fertilizers all these sorts of things it's a vegan's dream they're out on a commune in the middle of Africa just just living off the land right and and it was also very interesting because they were genetically similar or near identical because actually intermarried and so they would go back and forth so genetically they were a very similar population they ate very different diets everything else was about the same so it's a very good somewhat self-controlled trial and they looked at them they looked at their health they looked at their development and they found that the Messi were on average five inches taller brains were larger they were 50% stronger and they were on average 23 pounds heavier of lean body mass there is no fat on these guys it's only lean body mass they had full well-developed Jaws no tooth decay big bright white teeth they don't have dentists they don't have teeth whiteners or anything like that they're eating what they're supposed to eat and their mouth is working the way it's supposed to work the opposite was true of the akuu they were shorter they were weaker they were more sickly they had crooked teeth decaying teeth they had vitamin deficiencies nutrient deficiency genes they were anemic they were getting infections they were getting diabetes they were getting all these problems that them theze simply were not and the British tried to supplement them and say okay well we'll we'll take care of your your supplements this is what the the dietitians say okay this is a deficient diet but if you supplement then you'll be fine well it wasn't fine they didn't actually improve their health it wasn't until they replaced the plants with meat that they actually improved their health outcomes so that's the only study that I'm aware of that actually compares what we're talking about a meat-based diet a whole food meat-based diet and a whole food plant-based diet the other studies are looking at comparing processed food garbage diet with more plants right because you're comparing it to the norm that's what they're looking at you eat more plants and you do better than the average person the average person is sick the average person is unhealthy 93% of Americans uh have at least one metabolic disease 70% are overweight or obese so you don't want to compare yourself to the norm that's not a good bar to uh to put yourself against so why is the da doing this well it starts about 150 years ago crazy enough with the Seventh Day Adventist Church which is which is very very strange and a lot of this uh most of this is coming from uh the work of Belinda fety who's the wife of Dr Gary fety who's a Tasmanian orthopedic surgeon and she really broke the case open on why in God's name we are having this shoved down our throats for so long that's it so Ellen G white was a prophetess and she had so-called vision from God and she was told that meat was evil meat caused lustful feelings it increased sexual urges and of course lust was a sin and so therefore meat was a sin and it was as bad as smoking and drinking and all these other sorts of substances and so and it caused you you know it caused you to to feel in a lustful way and this was bad she was influenced by Sylvester Graham of graham crackers who also advocated for a bland diet to suppress sexual urges and this this was in their writing specifically was to suppress sexual urges because sex was evil and and also for this was part of the temperance move it as well so talking about you know self viice which is masturbation this was thought to be one of the greatest sins you could commit against yourself and she wrote a book called an appeal to mothers where she said that if your child masturbates it's like putting a gun to his breast and and pulling the trigger they're just dead on that instant and so they took this very seriously and one of their uh one of her little Pro days was a guy named John Harvey Kellogg and he was her typ Setter when he was 12 years old and set the type for these books that she was writing so he was ingrained in this and he you might recognize the name grew up to become Dr Kellogg and he and his brother founding Kellogg cereals and he invented Kellogg cereals while he was the director of the battle Creek sanitarium in Michigan in order to give food that would suppress sexual urges and desires that was his mission he also would see parents who would bring in their children who were masturbating they wanted to stop them he put them on a vegan diet put them on a plant-based diet give them a bunch of these corn flakes in order to suppress their sexual urges and he would also circumcise them without anesthetic boys and girls he would actually cut the clitoris off of girls and he or use acid or other custic substances to scar and score uh the clitoris and labia to make it painful to them and punish them and to make it painful for them to do it again and he actually pushed this on the rest of the country he thought this was a very healthful thing he pushed he convinced the medical establishment in America to push for male circumcision he tried it for female circumcision saying this was better for their health he didn't tell them what his his actual motives were which was to uh suppress and to uh suppress masturbation but that's what it was and so he convinced the medical establishment that it was actually in in the health of the child's in the best interest of the child to uh to circumcise young boys and this is why most Americans uh our circumcised is s starting to change because people have have become aware of this more recently and he tried to do it for women too he thankfully didn't get get through with that one but this is this is where these people's minds were at so the Seventh Day Advent church has actually set up more than 20 different plant-based food companies they are they are the origin of the process food movement so Kellogg and his brother founded corn made Corn Flakes and and a lot of other different sorts of cereals that came along with this there was something like 36 different serial companies came up around Battle Creek Michigan during this time because they were all influenced by Kell Kell was an extremely influential doctor and scientist in America he was sort of a doctor to the star uh you know back in the 1800s early 1900s presidents and movie stars and and politicians would come to see him at his sanitarium in Battle Creek and you know he was he was extremely influential he really pushed his case very hard he had a lot of very very strange uh predictions like enemas he always put everyone on enemas he gave himself two enemas a day he had a high-powered machine that uh could pump in 60 lers of water in and out of the rectum uh in less than a minute so he he would do this he thought this was part of good health and then being on vegan so he had he had very peculiar uh very very unique sort of thoughts uh and so uh but he was very influential and so a lot of other other uh serial companies came up as a result of this um one with sanitarium Foods here in Australia it's it's one of the larger food producers processed food producers in Australia they are still owned by the Seventh Day Adventist Church they still uh benefit from tax exemption status because they're they're part of a religious organization and their mission statement is to push a plant-based agenda for this religious ideology they don't tell you that but that is what it is and they say oh it's for healthful this that and the other and blah blah no it's not it is to stop you from uh being horny basically so how they influence our diet okay so that that's the origin of the processed food industry but they had they've had so much more influence since then we know now that they've had undue influence on most of the major dietary guidelines and decision-making processes of the last century and in fact it gets worse than that because the Academy of nutrition and dietetics in America was actually founded by the Seventh Day Adventist Church members so the entire field of nutritional sciences and dietetics was founded by these people who are religiously anti meat so it's always been about plant this is why when I grew up uh next to a nutritional College one of the top nutritional colleges in America called baser everyone coming out of there was just Whole Food vegan Whole Food vegan Whole Food vegan I knew that that was insane because like we're we're apex predators apex predators definitionally eat animals and so I knew that that was silly but I never thought like wait how why and how are phd's nutrition being taught that we're supposed to only eat plants when they're deficient in nutrients and we clearly on meat now I know why because they were founded by the sth Day Adventist Church um the uh Adventist nutritional dietetics International Association these are very influential around the world as well Lolinda medical uh medical school and University um and Medical Center was again a 7th Day Adventist Church when I was applying to medical school back in 2008 I remember I was living in California at the time and I I was looking around the different California schools and I came across Linda I said okay who are these guys I was not even allowed to apply it says in order to apply you must be a member of the Seventh Day Adventist Church you can't even apply you have to get a letter from your Deacon uh in order to apply so that's who they are but then you have the McGovern committee or the McGovern uh report which was the original attack against fat and meat this was this was the first government sanctioned advice to the public to say hey you need to reduce the amount of fat that you're eating you need to get more healthy grains and vegetables and fruits and things like that so the problem with that is the the main author in that report was a Seventh Day Adventist member okay and then we have Nathan pritkin do we does anybody know who pricin is pritkin diet that was that was that was for decades thought to be the gold standard in uh heart disease prevention diet well he was a professor at lominda University I don't know if he was a sth day Adventist member but he was certainly influenced by them and he taught at a school that does not allow anybody except seventh day Adventists to go there so he at least had some very strong ties with them and he read all the books of LG white which were like dozens she was just a prolific uh lunatic of a writer she just wrote absolutely insane things um and he also testified for the McGovern committee these are the people that are pushing forward you know the the food pyramid sort of ideas right this is where they came from they also wrote the first textbook on nutritional science at the University level okay so they wrote they started the the the institution they wrote the text book they wrote the curriculum and they have been perpetuating it ever since that book is still in print in its current edition that's current edition is still being taught Sally Norton who people may know she wrote a book called toxic superfoods is all about all the different toxins that are in Plants she was a nutritionist she went to Cornell University and Ivy League institution in America and studied nutrition got a MERS and she was just learning go just eat plants just eat plants just eat plants and she was getting sicker and sicker and sicker until she almost died in her 30s from the amount of toxins that were in these plants that she was eating that were supposedly the most healthy thing that she could eat that was her textbook the most recent Edition that she was taught in at Cornell was that textbook the most recent edition of that textbook they have been at the ground floor and influencing nutritional thought for 100 years it gets worse so now they're they're invading into the medical Sciences as well so all doctors have been influenced by this oh You' have to eat less meat eat less saturated fat we've all heard this we all know this most of us have been taught this and most people have pushed it most doctors still do push this but it's gotten worse because lifestyle medicine was founded by the 7th Day Adventist Church in 2003 and it was for this direct purpose of pushing a plant-based agenda in medicine so it sounds good you want to change your diet you want to eat right you want to exercise okay sounds good I I advocate for the same thing but what they're telling you to eat is more grains more fruits more vegetables Less meat go vegan start exercising and you'll be right and you won't be so this was founded by the Seventh Day Adventist they founded the the the specialty they write the exams they write the curriculum and they are still running the show this is this is all over the world now in basically every Western Country this is now a specialty having exams it's lifestyle medicine is here in Australia it's in America it's in Europe as well um all of these processed food companies have ties to exercises medicine exercise of medicine was founded by cocacola so they're trying to get you away from thinking oh what I eat is a problem I should fix my diet just exercise that's the only thing that matters calories in calories out you know if you want to drink a Coke or or eat a pizza or something like that it's fine as long as you're moving enough that's okay no it's not okay you know is it okay exercise if you do heroin does that just cancel that out you know no there there are things that you can put in your body that are harmful and you should not put in your body and they're trying to sell them to you okay and unfortunately uh even the the you know the daa here in Australia they are very much compromised they have a a corporate uh partnership with Nestle Kellogg sanitarium and freedom foods and it's in that corporate partnership that they have to to push that agenda saying that carbs are healthy grains are healthy even sugar is healthy because they sell that um the CEO of the de daa actually personally targeted Dr Gary fety in Tasmania because he had the audacity to actually cure his patients of uh of diabetes so that he didn't have to amputate their legs right so he was an orthopedic surgeon he was doing a lot of amputations and he was the only person that was basically willing to see these poor people and and what needed to be done everyone else they just didn't want to deal with it so he was the only one stepping up to the plate and he and he you know came across uh low carb medicine he saw what it could do for people he started recommending this to patients and what do you know they they didn't need the amputations that they used to so he's literally saving people's lives and limbs saving millions of dollars to the Public Health Care system and he comes under attack and he was he was attacked and abused by APPA for years and the CEO of the de daa personally called his medical director and said you need to get rid of this guy he's a problem all right and that actually came out there was there was uh minutes from uh different meetings of the processed food companies and and uh and and some of these other sort of nutritionists that the low carb down under uh organization actually came across and they found that they they specifically singled out Dr fety by name and said we need to silence this guy this is one of those low carb doctors our Ser serial cells are down we have to take him out okay so these people are militant they don't care about you they don't care about nutrition they care about their bottom line or their religious ideology so Kelloggs and all processed food companies they they unfortunately have uh some more conflicts of interests as well because they actually are invested in Pharmaceuticals as well okay so it's not enough that these people want to profit it's not enough that the the church thinks that they're helping people by stopping them from masturbating I me I mean how how's that working I don't know but now it seems like they understand that the way that they're teaching people to eat is actually causing harm because they're also investing in Pharmaceuticals and so when I was speaking uh with Dr Fey we talked about this and and there seems to be a very uh well it's just just quite a devious and diabolical sort of pairing of these companies where they're heavily invested and actually producing you know blood sugar medications diabetes medications and they're also selling things that cause diabetes right that to me is knowledge of forethought you're doing something that you know causes harm and then you're profiting off of that harm I think that's truly sick I would hope so yeah but you know we'll see we'll see you know the the problem is is that with the tobacco companies for decades they lied and said oh there's no evidence of that look at all these studies oh look at these nice studies all studies that they paid for and these studies say all great things well these studies say that you're full of it well but we just got these studies there's conflicting evidence who knows what's going on right and so that's the stage we're at now but we actually do know that the food companies and the sugar companies have been involved in in this sort of work knowing that their that their product are harmful the sugar Association actually influenced the McGovern report as well because they paid off three Harvard professors to falsify data and publish fraudulent studies to make it appear as if cholesterol caused heart disease when it was really sugar and to exonerate Sugar and say it was safe say it was good and that we should replace our fat calories with sugar calories because they're an empty calorie they're safe that's what they said one of those professors was named head of the USDA and it was he who authored and published the 197 7 declaration saying that cholesterol caused heart disease when it was really sugar okay that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2016 that's not an opinion that's a historical fact it's in the peer-reviewed literature actual internal memos from the sugar companies stating that stating what they got paid we know their contracts they were paid $6,500 in in uh at the time it's about $50,000 in today's valuation so you got they got a Camry out of the de and they just completely screwed the health of the world okay so that's how corrupt this is and it goes back all the way so that that's just talking about Coca-Cola again you know the the majority of spending and funding for nutritional research is coming from the industries who benefit the most by lying to us that's a clear conflict of interest and that's something that we need to be aware of that the studies that don't come from Industry Show stark contrast just like that study with the Messiah 1931 that's the only sort of study that we need to look at we need to look at Whole Food plant-based diet and a whole food meat-based diet and then we can see what's the difference between eating plants and eating meat or eating some plants with whole meat and mostly meat that's the only study that matters they don't do those studies because they know what the answer is going to be this was fun so people may have seen that Goldman Sachs asked in a report is curing patients a sustainable business model right so in that report they said well you know it's it's great to think about this we can take you know gene therapy and just cure a disease and that's wonderful however you you don't get return customers so is this a good business model is this what we should be spending money on actually curing things or should we be putting things forward to treat the symptoms perpetually these chronic disease States and just treat the like diabetes like heart disease blood pressure statins you know they're trying to put everybody on statins if a child has high LDL they want to put them on a Statin that's actually a recommendation now and that's because it's just like any drug dealer you know you hook them early and you get them for life right and so that's what they want they don't want to cure disease right here they just said it they don't want to cure disease they want to be profitable so they're not going to help you doctors in general are going to try to help you but they're being influenced by these guys okay they don't even realize that they're being influenced by these guys or who they're being influenced by they don't realize they're being influenced by industry or there's a religious agenda behind it or that there's a financial agenda behind it they're just these are the drugs that we have these are the pills that we have available and that's great because it gives them a tool in their Arsenal to go and and and face the world and face these sorts of diseases not understanding that is by design that these are never going to fix a problem we have more medicines more surgeries more people working on these problems and people are getting fatter and sicker and less healthy and actually the average life expectancy is starting to come down okay so it's not working so you need to take control of your own health you need to understand what you're up against you need to understand that these people are not going to do it for you you have to do it yourself and so you know what do you do you listen to people like you know Max and and uh everyone that that's here and understand what is it truly to be healthy a healthy human being biologically what are we designed to eat that's what you should eat okay that's the only thing you should eat koalas don't eat anything except eucalyptus because other things will kill them okay why are we eating a whole bunch of random plants some of these things didn't even exist broccoli is not a real plant okay we hybridize this corn is the same thing these things did not exist all that long ago now we have seed oils and all these processed chemical uh you know chemical processes to make these you know impossible burgers or all these other sorts of things you look at the ingredients these things did not exist very recently okay how can something that didn't exist last year be what we're biologically designed for okay we're much older than that so we're just designed to eat meat it provides all the nutrition required and nothing harmful that we don't and that's important because there are other things that cause harm you want the things that are beneficial to you and you want to exclude the things that are harmful smoking drinking drugs plants right not everybody gets that but can we eat any of these plants out there make a salad out of that tree it's a plant it's a vegetable it's a leafy green it's literally green leaves right so why can't can't we eat those if you just get lost in the woods and run out of food you just eat any random plant make some fresh Garden salads you know out of the Bush no they they would make you very sick and we know this so why don't we know this about spinach why don't we understand that for the last 2 years we've studied the amount of oxalates that are in spinach and how harmful they can be and how all the different people that have died of acute oxalate poisoning from spinach and other sorts of plants Liam Hemsworth put himself in the hospital after 3 weeks of spinach smoothies massive kidney stones and acute oxalate poisoning okay but no one talks about that no one talks about the the normal defense chemicals that are inherent in every single plant that can cause harm to varying degrees and you can get by and you can do okay but that's like saying you know saying that well you can eat plants you can eat vegetables you can do just fine that's like saying you can smoke and drink and do just fine because it didn't kill you right I I saw a guy smoking the other day he didn't die he didn't drop dead right you can do this for decades but it is over years over decades that you build up this damage to your body your body can deal with a lot our bodies are great they're designed for it but the problem is is that you can keep damaging yourself and this will build up and you will have problems and you will get 93% of people being metabolically sick you will get 70% of people being overweight and obese okay it adds up and chronic diseases are only on the rise why is that we know that our our our primitive counterparts didn't get these diseases until they started EA the things that we ate so what does that mean that means that something that we're eating is causing these and so that's why meat is so important because it provides what you need in the proportion that you need it or else then knew it wouldn't exist I wouldn't be here been six years I I haven't eaten a plant no so if there was anything I was missing I'd be very sick I don't feel sick all my Bloods are great okay and I it doesn't have anything that is going to harm you you know despite what the who will tell tell you about meat going back to the who their 2015 report saying that processed Meats were a carcin a carcinogen red meat was a likely carcinogen well who was on that report who was on that panel just happened to be our good friends of seventh day Adventists vegans and vegetarians who cherry-picked studies to make it to to only select ones that showed a very weak association between people who ate meat and a whole bunch of other things because you're doing a survey how much meat did you eat how many other things did eat these are people that are eating a lot of other things and smoking and drinking and and engaging in Reckless Behavior and they were had a slight increase very slight increase in their risk of colon cancer okay but when you can correct for those confounders and you actually just isolate out the meat you find no such correlation and there was a um a gentleman I I'm blanking on his name but there was a gentleman who was on that panel and he said it was one of the hardest things that he had to go through in his professional career because he saw saw Time After Time After Time high level highquality studies showing no connection between meat and cancer and especially red meat and cancer being thrown aside and ignored and other less good quality evidence like horribly uh put together uh studies being used to to write their decision and he said to them you're all vegans and vegetarians and Seventh Day Adventists you need to report your bias and they refuse but that's their bias so unfortunately our perspective on nutrition has been skewed by a mainstream narrative that started over 150 years ago and has continued to grow over the years they have extremely wide influence and reach there's over 22 million members of the 7thday Adventist Church I know a number of them they're very nice people and uh they all tell me well most of us are normal you know but there are like 5% are these hard hardcore gung-ho sort of vegan vegetarian sorts of people but that is absolutely what is passed down from the top down this is what you're supposed to eat you're not supposed to eat meat you're only supposed to eat plants and all these sorts of things like this that is 100% true and they are everywhere they are on these nutritional boards they're in the wh they're on Tik Tock right and they are uh in Harvard or at least influencing people at our major institution so Walter Willet is the Top nutritional researcher Harvard he's extremely influential extremely well regarded he's been on panels with sanitarium with these food companies with lifestyle medicine okay so I don't know if he's a seventhday Adventist but he's working with them and he's pushing their agenda okay and unfortunately the proliferation of modern diseases has accelerated dramatically the more of a foothold that these people get and these chronic diseases were almost non-existent a century ago they were nearly almost non-existent in the 70s but they started getting worse and worse and worse right in the last 40 years heart disease diabetes cancer stroke rates autism arthritis autoimmune issues psychiatric disorders all these things have increased dramatically and we have better interventions we have better medicines we have better surgeries we have better knowledge of these diseases and yet they're getting worse they're getting more and more prevalent and some people will say well heart disease actually peaked and deaths like mortality deaths from heart disease peaked around the 1960s and 70s and then started coming down right when we started lowering cholesterol and that's true deaths did go down but first time heart attacks went up it's just we're surviving them so heart disease rates are going up prevalence is going up it's more abundant in the population incident is going up there are more new people every year getting it there are more new people having a heart attack every year but surviving because we can go in and take that clot out we can go and take the clot out of your brain we can put in stance we can do triple bypass quadruple bypass quintuple bypass surgery we can do bypasses in the brain okay we can do amazing things for people but just because they're surviving doesn't mean that that disease rate is going down we've reduced red we've reduced saturated fat we've reduced cholesterol we've increased fruits and vegetables we've increased grains and yet all of these diseases are getting worse okay so that's clearly wrong and in fact I would argue that there's a direct relationship between what we're eating and the diseases that we're getting because I don't think that they're chronic diseases I don't think they're diseases at all I think that they're a product of malnutrition and toxicity we're getting a toxic buildup of a species inappropriate diet and a lack of species specific nutrition namely we're eating too many plants that we didn't evolve on that we not designed to eat and we can't detoxify as safely as we would like and we're not getting enough B12 D3 K2 proteins fats and all these other sorts of things that are required for our healthy existence so this thinking originated from is still influenced by a religious objective that I wasn't aware of until very recently until I came across uh fet Key's work and I I encourage everyone here to look her up on YouTube she she goes into way more depth than I do and uh this is just sort of a teaser on that and um you know you you will you will never look at a nutritionist the same way again and if you're a nutritionist you'll never look at at yourself the same way again and um and you you'll you'll just have to ask questions and that's the important thing ask questions like okay you know maybe I'll take a look at the evidence for myself and see what I think and not just think what I'm told to think and of course of course there are Financial objectives as well and that's I I hopefully made that uh clear during this presentation but the the vast majority of information is being put out there by the exactly wrong people the people that profit the most from going against our objectives our objectives are good health feeding our kids feeding our family growing old age gracefully having our parents not succumb to dementia and Alzheimer and part arkinson and and die in a nursing home not knowing who they were okay that's what our objectives are at least most people that is not their objective they said it themselves we're not going to try and cure diseases we're going to try to perpetuate a disease State and then sell you the remedy so to quote Belinda fet key we need a separation of church and plate all right to be uninhibited in our eating our species specific diet eating what we're designed to eat eating what we're supposed to eat to give ourselves the most health and not be influenced by other people's agendas now if you want to avoid eating meat for your own reasons be they religious ethical or or you just think they taste nice even though they're gross then you you can that's perfectly fine but we should be allowed to make that decision and we shouldn't be influenced and told that we should be eating something because it's good for us even though it's bad for us because of someone else's agenda because they want to profit from us they want to sell us some garbage that they just want to make money on they want to make us sick to then sell us the medicine for it if that is their desire or that it's a religious agenda where they think that meat is just evil and we're not supposed to eat it and it's for our own good well thank you I can make my own decisions on that one so thank you very much I hope that that was um interesting for people and it and it sort of opened people's eyes to a new way of looking at this thank you very much [Applause] so I think do we have time for any questions yeah so if anybody has any questions we can we can pass the mic I was just thinking then vegans they always say you have to supplement B12 so they'll concede that but they will never talk about the others why do you think when there's K2 vitamin A a I think it's another 10 essential nutrients that plants don't have why do they why will they concede on B12 but don't conceed on the others well the thing is it doesn't matter how much they concede on B12 is enough right you can't get basic nutrition therefore it's not what our our bodies are designed to eat right so you can just stop them right there oh but all these doesn't matter B12 just stop it just stop the argument to to answer your question though um again you know goes back to those those those similar compounds that just aren't quite right so oh there's there's vitamin K in things there's a lot of vitamin K and kale and it says that at the grocery store because they're trying to sell it to you right it's K1 we can't use K1 we have we have to have K2 we can convert some of it into K2 but they don't know that they just know vitamin K right um but it's a very small transfer and then same with well you get you get all the vitamin you need from carrots no you'd actually have to beat three kilos of carrots a day to get enough re get enough uh beted keratin to make vitamin A if you actually can convert it at all and fully half of humans cannot do that but of course they don't know that they they they don't know you know because they're they're pushing an ideology right and they hear something good and they just they just try to run with it but even even you know there there's Simon Lewis who's a uh a you know nutritionist over in Sydney and he wrote a book there's a whole book and he's a nutritionist and none of it covered anything on nutrition except for like the last piece of the book and he just went over briefly like oh yeah you can sort of get what you need by Simon Hill not Simon Lewis did I say Simon Lewis it's you yeah so Simon Hill sorry sorry about that so yeah so so no s Simon Hill um you know wrote this book and it was all about you know just being vegan and all that sort it's exact all all all the same nonsense that's been going on since 1800s you think this is a novel book it's not it's it's 18 you know 150 years old basic basically and and he tries to say oh you can you can get this you get he's saying that you you can convert ala into DHA and EPA but he doesn't tell you that it's like less than 1% conversion rate you know and so the amounts that you would have to eat like you would literally explode and the amount of toxins and nonsense that would come with it are are exem just impossible impossible to get you can't get these things without supplementation on a vegan diet you just can't um not everything not all the time and um so it's just impossible but you don't even need to go that far like vitamin B12 can't get it we're not we're not meant to eat it that's not the way we're not supposed to eat a plant only diet now maybe you can say mix maybe you can say that I would argue no that that's not our optimal diet but you cannot say that a plant- only diet is optimal if it doesn't contain even one nutrient that we need even one nutrient you know not having enough of one nutrient is still not enough you have to have an everything all the different sort of nutrients in the proportion that you need them and you and and the list goes on too so you know we have have uh beta keratin and retinol but there's there are you essential or you know sometimes non-essential but sometimes essential amino acids like carnitine so carnitine only comes from meat it does not come in any plants any fungus anything like that it only comes in meat but people say well you don't need carnitine because you make carnitine uh you do better with more we know that from many many studies but also only 70% of people actually make carnitine or enough carnitine so again it's like the retinol beta keratin issue 30% fully 30% of people have to get carnitine from meat they have to get it and carnitine has been shown by Texas A&M to actually deficiency in carnitine during development has been shown to cause autism and this is why vegans and vegetarians have much higher rates of children with autism because some of those kids can be deficient in their ability to make Carn there's a lot of cartine and red meat there's some in other meats and dairy but there's a ton in red meat what's the first thing the vegetarians do is they drop red meat right because they think it's the worst well it's actually the best and then vegans they don't have any animal products at all so they don't get any carnitine right and so if their child is deficient or unable to fill that Gap then they're going to develop uh autism because it's it's required for uh neuronal development and for proper mitochondria function which we are now understanding is one of the major drivers of chronic diseases and psychiatric disorders and diabetes and cancer is met as mitochondrial dysfunction so you know you the mom may be making enough carnitine that can get through in the breast milk and as soon as she stops breastfeeding goes to formula or goes to you know plant nonsense that's when they start displaying symptoms shortly after that and and you will see that that's that's a very common timing in the presentation of of autism is is you know in the months after uh weaning um this isn't so much a question but more of a statement concerning the investment of big food and that malice of forethought that you were going on about before who's noticed the prevalence of um cholesterol lowering wheat bcks and low carb potatoes and all these things creeping in because they know there's a push back they know we're pushing but they still want their money grab so they got to go well okay well if I can make a low carb potato or a low carb low carb potato low there are have you not seen them in the supermarket yeah low carb potato and who's walked past the weat BS I like I haven't honestly done it for a long time but plant-based weat B low carb yeah yeah low carb wheat BS and cholesterol lowering weight bcks so we're feeding you something that's raising you know like they just they're just using the same old arguments and just churning them over and over and over again but they're feeling a push back cuz you know well yeah and and and we have to push back you know we have to we have to make it hurt on their bottom line because you know they had they had these religious ideologies first and foremost but now they are very much wrapped up in their financial um Financial desires so if we if we hit him in their pocketbook and and that's why they targeted Gary fety and I'm sure they've got their sights on on me and others uh is because I me Gary FEI had you know 5,000 people following him on social media and he was just basically telling his patients he was making uh you know that that this was a beneficial uh way of eating and uh and giving talks on things like low carb down under and and different conferences and but he he made he made a big enough impression with them that it was they attributed his uh his influence on lowering their cereal sales yeah yeah yeah so that's the thing they they yeah so they're they're losing money and now they're going to going to attack and now you know keto is being more and more accepted mainstream so that's why you see so many of these keto this and Keto build that and low carb low carb wheat you know so like whatever the hell that is but you know and yeah low car potatoes is just hilarious but you know that that's the thing so uh we we just need to keep hitting them that way and uh you know that's why you you supporting your local ranchers supporting people that are making these products because if you you vote with your dollar as was said uh previously you know that people are going to pay pay attention to that you know people just making noise no one cares if you start spending your money differently that's when they start care a question over here thank you Anthony for your presentation it's it just sits so well the um I've got leaky gut um Sol CDs 14s High um broccoli sprout powder for sulfurane is there a better form of sulfurane to actually close my epithelial celles please is is there a better form of cyanide that doesn't kill you so Su sulfur Fame is so toxic that the that the broccoli cannot keep it in its in its natural state it has two different chemicals that actually when you when you mate it when you chew it when it gets crushed it releases those chemicals and combine into sulfur Fame it's basically a kill switch right so it's it's like you're going to kill me I'm going to take you with me right same with with cyanide I use that example specifically because there are 2500 different plants that have that same kill switch with Hydro hydrogen cyanide and so when you crush like an almond or a bitter almond or cassava then it's going to release those chemicals and they're going to combin uh to to make hydrogen cyanide to poison whatever the hell is eating it so I would never uh eat any plant if you want to just you know be healthy but but specifically for for leaky gut I would say very far away from those sorts of things now people say well maybe it's hormetic and very low doses okay you know a prove it put it in a pill and and uh you know and test it on large populations to see when and how and how much to use that's what we do with all medications and yet we're just saying oh yeah just just go for it right too much is a bad thing probably any is is going to be a bad thing is there anything that help uh time so you you just need you need to get away from all of those sorts of things that that damage the gut lining like uh you know different sort of vegetables uh fiber and specifically gluten is is very uh damaging to the gut lining as well so you just get rid of that and you just get rid of all plants and fiber and things like that it'll heal on its own yeah and also you won't be introducing things in your body that are going to sneak in through those gaps and then get in your body and cause a problem so you're you're you're helping yourself in the short term and the long term okay JT you're next yeah I it's it's very good to hear about the studies on on the Messiah people but as far as my knowledge regarding the Messiah over the the years and still their tradition and they become still very old they eat a lot of meat meat is but also they focus on a lot of honey and they also focus a lot on their Dairy from the animals so they've got a lot of milk and they've got that sour milk type of thing and then they also make a a brew from honey and milk uh type of thing that uh they use quite a lot over the time so that's part of the is not just the meat only no it's not just meat but but it's it's a whole food meat-based diet I mean that meat based but it's felt on with that things and that keep them so Health yeah yeah so yeah and they yeah a lot of a lot of dairy a lot of like the women and children will drink a lot of the dairy and the the Warriors will will mix that with blood or drink the blood uh directly and then then eat meat as well um no the point is is just it's not it's not about only carnivore versus you know whatever it's just eat is eating a lot of meat bad for you if it's in a whole meat animal version and the Messiah are a good example of that they're eating a whole food meat-based diet maybe they're eating some other things but they're predominant they're eating a lot of meat and you're comparing that to a whole food plant-based diet that is not eating a lot of meat and what are the differences you know and there are Stark differences and so that's the thing what what all of these other nutritional studies are trying to show is that that meat is bad you shouldn't eat meat you should eat fruits and vet when you say when you eat more fruits and vegetables people automatically think you're eating that instead of meat right that's not the case you're eating it instead of processed garbage and if you're eating it instead of meat you will have poor health outcomes just like the akiyu Cindy so there's a gentleman at New York University and he's name's I think Matthew Tao and he's um professor of bioethics and he wants to create um people he want he wants the human race to become allergic to meat they know they can do it with the tech I've seen that guy yeah WF guy so that's kind of scary when this agenda has been happening to this point you know what happens then you know like I just want to know do people understand the agenda is so big that this is what they want to do yeah I mean it's all it's all wrapped up in in weird political sort of uh you know things I mean this is is where you're saying that you know cows are horrible you know there was a there was a video that just went out that went sort of viral uh with the an aerial footage of Kuwait where they're burning 7 million tires years just these big black clouds and it's just like it's just like we're doing that and we're blaming cows you know people went on the farm tour I mean did that looked like just a polluted mess and hellhole cess pit no it was just a very very healthy wonderful uh you know Glade it was it was exactly what it was supposed to be and so you know people people need a bit more common sense but unfortunately there being inundated with this sort of thing and you get those people I mean he could be very well-meaning oh my God this is so important we got to get rid of this or he could be absolutely wrapped up in these sorts of agendas and being being paid to say these things or or or you know involved in the Seventh Day Adventist Church or at least influenced by them indirectly it's uh it's it's you know it just goes so far and wide you just really can't trust anybody you just have to sort of look at you know what are we designing to eat that's what I should eat okay what is the what is the environment is plants and animals living in a symbiotic relationship right how does that work so you know you you take that out and you just go to crop farming crop agriculture industrial processes those things are are devoid of nature by definition right any industrial process is is not natural and it's not mimicking nature either so they're they're making the argument from an environmental and ethical standpoint point but in fact they're doing the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do right they're saying we need to save the environment by doing all these things we need to save Nature by doing things that are wholly unnatural and these natural processes that been going on you know throughout the entire history of the world those are now somehow bad even though they weren't before we got there I mean it's it's a bit silly but yeah you're right I mean that's that's why you have to really fight and not not give an inch on any of these sorts of things because if you if you end up in a society that the rulers and powers that be get to decide that they can just inoculate everyone here with something that makes them allergic to meet you know that that's that's nowhere you ever want to live because that is not where it's going to stop so um hi sorry I'm over here oh oh okay hi um thanks coming all the way over from Perth as well it's a long flight I kind of have two questions one of them should be pretty quickly I've got a younger brother he's about oh he got diagnosed when he was about how old was he 14 13 with CRS he I think he was one of the youngest to be diagnosed in Queensland um he gets obviously he goes in oh he gets really bad episodes of it I saw on your Instagram you posted someone who was able to was it in remission um just going purely Carnival I guess it kind of goes off his is it just time that gets there or is there anything that he can I I guess like speed up the recovery of like if he was to go full Carnival cuz every doctor he goes to is high fiber very low meat and like that's against that's against the literature as well that has nothing to do with carnivore that's just that's just flat out against the literature so the quickest thing and this is clinically proven the clinic quickest way he can resolve his Crohn's is by stopping to eat all those nonsensical things so there's a study in Crohn's looking at an elemental diet which is highly processed is just you know it's a tub of you know protein powder basically but it has all the sort of macro micronutrients that you need it doesn't have anything else okay putting people on that and just avoiding eating all those other things was a better treatment and intervention for an acute flareup of Crohn's than pricone are you talking about those poppies no well an elemental diet is uh is is basically just your nutrients just getting the nutrients that you need you can get this in sort of shake form and so it's just you just sort of pour out this powder and put it in to shake but it's like it's it's um you know you wouldn't just get it at the store you know um and most people don't even know that this stuff exists but what what is an essential diet what is it you know that that Extreme Elimination Diet where you're only getting nutrients it's a stake right so you're just getting the nutrients that you need in the proportion that you need them you're not getting anything else and so it's the elimination of all those other things that is causing the Crohn's and so it's a better treatment for Crohn clinically proven in humans to just stop eating all that garbage then pricone which which is the gold standard on any of these sorts of flareups which obviously has huge ramifications and side effects as as uh you know Jacob was talking about he wanted a steroid shot so that's what predone is it's it's a dose of steroids to just calm down just basically suppress your immune system and and stop this from happening just stopping eating that garbage works better than steroids so there really is nothing quicker than that you know you're you stop introducing the thing that is perpetuating the problem and the body heals and the body will heal I generally see people if they go pure red meat and water and it's very important because you know as common theme here you know it matters what you eat even with meat and so people that are eating chicken and pork and farmed fish that are fed the wrong things you know some of those things get into the meat and it gets into them and so some people actually respond very poor they respond worse to plants but even like pork and chicken and fish that are Factory farmed uh they can cause reactions as well so most people with autoimmune issues do the best on red meat and water grass-fed and finished but even just grain finished is fine uh if it's red meat for most people most most autoimmune sufferers there was another study um in the literature looking at uh just eliminating out fiber and carbs from the diet for people with crohn's and and see how long they could stay in remission without medication it was up to 51 months which is over four years without medications just just eliminating carbs and fiber so there's something in the carbs and the fiber something that come along with the carbs and fiber that is causing the Crohn's right contrast that with control group that didn't remove carbons and fiber they stay in remission on average zero months without medications it's not a lot of months right so that's clinically proven now you can you can sort of translate that over to a carnivore diet because a carnivore diet is an elemental diet it's only giving you the elemental things that you need and nothing else right and you're REM removing carbs you're removing fiber so his doctor saying you need to eat more fiber is is strictly going against the literature for Crohn's disease specifically and I I have never seen someone with crohn's or UL colitis or any or really any other autoimmune issue that did not resolve or or at least significantly improve when on a strict red meat and water diet so if he goes on that on a on a strict red meat and water diet and nothing else then he will significantly improve in the coming weeks in about 3 weeks to a month he'll probably have no symptoms in 3 months I would I would bet you that he would have no sign on biopsy okay thank you no problem sorry yeah just one more um this is actually my partner's question but I'll I'll answer it I'll ask it he's he loves playing sport being an athlete one of the biggest questions he always asks is what about carbohydrate you know before a big game obviously being an athlete I thought that you might be able to touch on this yeah so I mean I I played I played high level Ry for 5 years on a carnivore diet eating no carbohydrates and that was when I was physically at my Peak ever in my life except for right now uh and now unfortunately I have screwed up knees so I can't I can't keep playing um but between 20 and 25 I was you know sort of the highest levels of of American and Canadian rugby and I played in in England as well and I was on a pure carnivore diet I couldn't get tired I couldn't run out of energy I couldn't wear myself out could not the hard I could not work hard enough to push my to to to wear myself out it took a while to get up to that you do have to you know get fit but I was right away I was already at a different level when I was 38 and I came back to a carnivore diet uh two weeks into it I just felt so much I was way overweight and excess fat hadn't hadn't really worked out in months really because I I was in Bangladesh doing humanitarian work hadn't played a full rugby season in 3 years and so I was very much out of shape but I felt so good it was like right I'm going back to play some rugby and I went back into my uh my team in Seattle called the Seattle sariss then turned into SeaWolves and that year they turned professional uh know really really professional before that it was just the top league but you just you just weren't getting paid for it and and I was out there with these professional athletes and they're attracting you know big pros from all over the world now and me having done nothing it was the first time I'd run really in a year uh I was able to just be step for step with all these guys who' had been training for the last few months that I've had been Bangladesh and 2 weeks into into training we did a modified bleep test you know the the conditioning test for the team I came in top five out of 92 people with two weeks of training it's all diet and I was fat right so you know and it it's it's unreal so that I I do a lot of posts about this and I do I do a video called you know high performance training on on Carnivore uh but the biochemistry is very clear when you stop eating carbohydrates you make all the carbohydrates glucose glycogen ketones that you need and you have a you have an unlimited source and Supply because you have over 10 times the amount of energy even on a on a skinny person that doesn't have all that tofy fat you know just a a slim person you have 10 times the amount of energy in your fat Supply than you will in your your glycogen and when your insulin is up and you're eating carbohydrates your your glycogen cuts off and you cannot replenish it you have to eat more sugar you have to take those you know slurpie sticks of sugar and things like that you can't you can't do anything else right so but when you're on a carnivore diet and you're you're fat adapted keto adapted then you will you will just constantly replenish your glycogen and your ketones uh from your fat stores we know this from from studies in wolves in 1981 they said they oh you know you know they you know you need carbs to burn carbs but wolves don't carbo low before they chase Caribou for 10 hours you know so what the hell do they do do they have glycogen do they have blood sugar and they found out yes they do and it's rock solid it doesn't move because the second they use it they replenish right and we actually know this in in athletes from the work of uh Professor Tim noes in South Africa he's he's one of the the best top uh nutritional scientists and doctors and Sports Medicine doctors in the world for decades he was pushing carbohydrates about 10 years ago he went o got that one wrong really sorry and he's been doing his Mula ever since saying hey guys I I've been lying to you for 30 years I'm really sorry this is wrong you don't need carbs in fact you're better off without them and he has been showing in randomized clinical trials in humans that you get the exact same output with or without carbohydrates but the difference being is that you can keep going without the carbohydrates because you can keep tapping into your fat stores but you get the same output right but you never stop and then you switch the groups one and fed the keto group carbs and and uh switched the carb group to keto brought them back in 42 days they said that that was Overkill but 42 days just to make sure that they were keto adapted again they both had the same output right so no you don't need carbs in fact I would I would say you don't want them fer up um two words coffee question mark yes sir so yeah so for so for me I I I sort of go by by the principle of you know all plants have some sort of Defense chemical that's their nature all living things uh have a defense right as killer be killed for plants as well as animals these trees are out there they exist why is that there are bugs there are insects there are birds there are animals why aren't they just completely destroyed and and eaten to Extinction the reason is because they are absolutely not defenseless and they the majority of their of their defenses are chemical in nature and so all plants are going to have defense chemicals and we have been living basically as carnivores or hypercarnivores meaning we get the vast majority of our nutrition from meat for the last 2 three million years and then some so we've been out of that evolutionary race you know plants and animals are an evolutionary arms race plants becoming more and more poisonous so less and less animals can eat them so they can survive and thrive and then animals becoming more and more adapted to specific poisons in specific plants so they can eat that plant and survive and thrive uh but they don't eat other things that's why quales eucalyptus almost nothing else eats eucalyptus but they don't eat anything else right and this is why 70% of animals are carnivores they eat other animals because it's really difficult to contend with those toxins and actually turn plant tissue into animal tissue So based on those principles I don't eat I I have three hard rules for myself which is no plants or fungus no sugar or any sweeteners nothing artificial and that goes for sauces seasonings and drinks as well so my you know Paradigm is is such that you know you say okay well what about tea or coffee it's a plant so I don't touch it well what about honey that comes from an animal okay well it's sugar first of all and second of all it's not of an animal it's just from an animal really be vomit right so it's I'm sorry this hurts your business on the the honey form but um but but I think of it sort of as cud right you know I mean that that's that's partially digested and it's very nutritious and broken down for a cow and it would be better sort of like kimchi or some sort fermented sort of uh plants or something like that would be better for us but it's still not food for us it's food for a bee has some things that are good for you but it also has a bunch of sugar and other sorts of things so that's how I think about the uh about those sorts of things but you know I I think that the main thing is just eating a lot more meat not being afraid of meat not thinking this is bad thing for us because we know that that was right so meat's not bad for you animal Fat's not bad for you it's actually essential it's essential that we eat meat and eat fat okay so I think you just eat more fatty meat try to avoid certainly processed foods sugars uh processed carbs any carbs really and alcohol and all these sorts of things that's the main thing and the more meat you eat that's going to replace out all these other things so the more meat you eat and the less other things plants and things like that you you will be healthier some people really need to be Bare Bones just meat and water and they they can't even do coffee I I spoke to a gentleman uh first of all you know caffeine is a neurotoxin it was developed by plants as a neurotoxin insecticide to fry the brains of insects when they try to eat it right and a coffee bean is a bean that's a seed that's a plant's baby and plants protect their babies more than anything and the seeds and beans and nuts and legumes that's generally where you'll find the highest concentration of poisons and it goes for coffee as well so you have to roast them that's try to to denature some of these these toxins but caffeine itself is a toxin but it also has 150,000 other chemicals in it as well so you'll find that if you just take a caffeine pill you'll feel better than if you drank a cup of coffee because it's very pro-inflammatory it has oxalates fiic acid tannins and all these other sorts of things that that are going to sort of mess with your system there are a lot of people that they still drink coffee and they do very very well but a lot more people when they ditch coffee they feel better and I you know it it's been in the clinical literature for 100 years that putting people on a ketogenic diet is a very good treatment modality for uh epilepsy and I had a gentleman uh who I spoke to who went keto and it helped reduce the amount of seizures but he didn't get rid of them he went carnivore that completely eliminated them and then he had Cofe and he had a seizure so he's just like this is a neurotoxin I'm not going to touch this but you know most people do fine with it and I think you know if you like it and you enjoy it that's fine but you know I would I would encourage people just to try try without for a month just try just meat and water for a month see how you feel you add coffee back in and it doesn't doesn't damage you doesn't bother you you know go for it for me it did you know like when I I don't get sore anymore doesn't matter how hard I work out doesn't matter the Gap in between workouts I do not get sore and that's because it's really those inflammatory factors in plants that are causing that pain stiffness and swelling and you know and that's the plant's way of telling you to go away don't eat me I'm going to make you sick I'm going to make you hurt right and so I had one cup of coffee and all of a sudden I was sore for two days I'm like nope not doing that again you know so so for me I don't want to do it but you know a lot of people do but as long as you're eating a lot more meat not being afraid of the fat and and being cognizant of of what plants can entail for you I do I do a whole presentation in lecture if people haven't seen it on at at a medical seminar called plants are trying to kill you it's very straightforward I'm not I'm not I'm not pulling punches like they're just that's what they're there for they're there for themselves and not for you Doctor uh now that you've destroyed my honey chicken and pork Enterprises I want to claw back a little bit of ground if I can no but no but the thing is the thing is is that is that your your meat production is exactly what people should be eating you know what I mean it's it's it's the factory farm sort of stuff that that people seem to have a problem with but like the the actual like sort of you know range pasture fed animals don't have nearly the problem people don't nearly have the problems with those my my question is actually about marbling uh in beef and red meat but before we get to that I haven't heard you talk about eggs Pro eggs yeah yeah eggs are great Pro eggs great thank you I'd sell eggs too right now so I get asked about when I do my tours and I've I've I've I've caused a little bit of trouble on Instagram with Dr PR yoga Nathan um dumping on the wagu crew uh and I get asked about it all the times I'd love to hear your opinion intramuscular fat in red meat marbling you know that it's been a big marketing push uh fat is Flavor red meat people know that but you look at the footage here of uh the MRIs in humans and you like marbling is a sick human it's a it's a it's a human with disease and the way you get marbling in animals is is a few in ruminants is a few different ways uh one you can genetically select select for that predisposition and um you know exacerbate it uh the second way is you finish them in with grain and the third way that I've I've realized is the older animals have more marbling maybe his muscles deteriorating as they age or something so i' I'd love to know your opinion about higher marbled red meat yeah well well certainly the ones that are that are marbled in in such a way that you're causing them to be metabolically sick I don't think is is a great idea now if we're talking about the difference between having you know a wagy steak or marbled steak and you know a carrot like I would say go for the wagu steak you know it's going to have a lot of the nutrients that you need people do very well on them but it's it's not nearly as good as like grass-fed grass fin especially like the regally raised sorts of things I mean I'm not I'm not doing this as as a as a commercial plug it's just a fact when you regeneratively raise animals you don't just like just stick them out there to their own devices when you move them around the soil becomes more healthy the grass becomes more nutrient dense and then the animals are eating more nutrient-dense food and so they're more nutrient-dense as well so you'll have massive increase and I've spoken to uh a couple regenerative farmers in America they said that the micronutrients are four to five times higher in their beef than than standard beef and so it it makes an objective difference or another objective difference is that when you grain finish a cow and get that marbling that you you lose out on some of the Omega-3s and so there was a study that that uh suggested that after about three months in a feed lot uh beef lost all of its Omega-3s and it was only Omega sixes after that so you need Omega you need DHA and EPA you need specific Omega-3s ala doesn't cut it and so you know you do need to get this from your meat so if you're only eating you know grain finished beef then you probably need an omega-3 Source uh on top of that some people have problems with folate most people don't but some people have like MTHFR Gene and they uh don't don't process folate properly so you need a bit more so adding in a bit of liver or something like that is important for those people most people don't need it but yeah there there's definitely a difference uh when you're when you're marbling these things because you're making them metabolically sick this is a sick cow uh Dr Shan omaro who who uh Dr um Gohan mentioned uh he won't eat that he won't he won't eat um grain finish he's like that's that's meat from a sick cow I'm not going to eat it but I think of it sort of as as like the olymp you know so um silver medalists being the the grass grain finished you know lost to the gold medalist right and so that sucks however they also beat everybody else on Earth so if you if you don't have access if you don't live near uh you know Jacob or you don't have access or you don't have the the means to to afford that sort of meat because it it is it can be more expensive um it's still better than anything else and so I I would I would aim to get you know the gold standard the gold medal but if if you can't for whatever reason it's still very good for you I have question that leads on from that over here you want to look at me I was out at Jake's yesterday getting his my beat and my steak and I looked at one that was marbled a little bit and one that wasn't so I want you to tell me which was like so this is all things equal from Jake Wy farm and one was marbled more than the other and I sat there thinking uh yes no yes no I want more fat I actually chose the marbled one I'm just wondering if all things were equal it's in Jake's Butchery which is the most help if it's in Jake's B Butchery and that that's presumably going to be like an older cow or one that's just genetically designed to have that because it's not going to be have that that marbling exacerbated by a feed lot because he doesn't use feed Lots right should be fine yeah yeah good and and older cows are amazing like I I don't know if anybody's had like an older cow they taste so much better and yes fat is flavored but you know generally older you know grass-fed finished cows they're they're leaner they have more they have more subcutaneous fat potentially but they don't have the intramuscular fat they taste amazing and they have much more beefy rich flavor that's that's absolutely fantastic so if people haven't tried those they can get their hands on it I highly recommend it it's also going to have a higher concentration of nutrients just have more time to lay down and enrich their own tissue with nutrients so it's better for you too Anthony we've got another one over here hi uh do you worry about mtor or think about it no so the thing is I mean mour is is extremely complicated right but um you know the thing is is you have trillions of cells trillions upon trillions of cells they have you know trillions of interactions and chemical interactions inside of each of those cells every second so you know trying to figure out one chemical process is is is going to be difficult you know because it's in such a complex system and so we can figure out a lot of things and and we do but a lot of these things are just gleaned information just sort of associations and could potentially because mtor goes on and off for different reasons at different times and there there's other factors that go go along with mtor that if those are off or on or a combination thereof between those two and mtor is on or off it it does very different things metabolically so there are a lot of combinations of things that can happen in your body and so mtor being on or off is isn't necessarily a good or a bad thing unless it's unless you look at it in the context of those other biochemical processes that are going on so it's very hard to do that it's very hard to know what to do but the one thing you can do is what are we biologically designed to do right so if if you live that way you know the idea of a paleo diet is what what is Paleolithic man eating what were people eating 100,000 years ago and what are they designed to eat you know that's what we should be eating what that really is is a carnivore diet that's what people are eating and so Native Americans in 1800s I was I was speaking about this earlier um they were shown to be in a study the tallest human beings alive on Earth the average height of a population is Den notes the average health of a population oh well they they only live 30 years that's not true by their own records they were living well over 100 years 115 120 130 years the longest self-reported uh Native American was 137 years Chief uh whitewolf yeah Chief John Smith whitewolf and people said oh well you know he was just lying maybe but he described fighting in the War of 1812 and he died in the 1920s it's a long time you know and and he and he descriptively described it and his family all said no no he he was 137 and we know genetically we're supposed to live 120 years based on our tiir length that's how long we're supposed to live on average so if you just do what you're biologically designed to do and just stay out of your own way and just let your body get on with it you should live 120 years without doing anything special without worrying about mtor without taking any supplements or you know doing any sort of you know taking any special drugs from you know David Sinclair or anybody else you know you should make it to 120 just just on your own and so I don't I don't worry too much about mtor because I don't think whatever mtor is doing in my body it's not supposed to be doing I'm doing I'm giving my body the inputs that it needs and so it's going to respond accordingly I'm I'm very convinced of that and when you and when you look at the longevity of these native populations you have to you have to trust their records and their you know them saying it which you may not want to do I I'm happy to because it happens again and again and again and again and again all over the world for thousands of years and it's always around that 120 Mark and we know as geneticists we're supposed to live to 120 right if you die before 120 something killed you okay that's what that means and so everyone that you know that did not make it to 120 something killed them prematurely okay and uh that's that's everyone right so you know mtor is very important it's absolutely important but it's a very complex system and all the best that we can say is if you if you give your body the biological inputs that it it requires for its design then it's then mour is going to work exactly the way it's supposed to ex hope that helps anyway all right uh we'll have one more and then I'm conscious that Dr chaffy has to jump on a plane back to to Perth Ben do you want to ask a quick question yes it is a quick one um uh I've been Carnival for six years uh and just on the coffee topic um the first four years of that I was drinking coffee every morning um and when I was in Prague two years ago I realized the insanity of what I was actually doing I was a slave to this bean and everywhere I went in the world I was trying to look for the Bean but not not only any Bean but the organic Bean and the less toxic Bean Bean and the nonsprayed bean um and all the bean was really doing was making me want more Bean but you know also also uh making me anxious not sleeping properly uh giving me headaches uh and when I quit it I just found my sleep was amazing and no stress you don't feel anxious all day and like on edge um well the decaf still had the same effects I don't know why but I still didn't feel quite right um cuz all that does is remove the caffeine and you still got a lot of toxins in there but my question is because it's a plant food and NES Cafe is one of the biggest Distributors of C coffee which is a one of those big food companies do you think they're also trying to push coffee because it's the world's most popular drink how did it get to that point do you know any sort of background there or no I I don't I don't know the background on coffee except it's a drug it's addictive and you know food companies love drugs and that's why the sugar and everything right so this this is like the opium trade you know historically people made made fortunes and Empires based on opium and now they're doing it on sugar and tobacco and alcohol and and uh coffee and things like that so uh people like drugs that's that's why people like to sell them drugs because they they have steady customers you know um so I don't I don't know if that that wraps up I mean Nestle is is um you know they're they're they do pretty pretty nasty things things you know um as a as a rule in their business model but you know I I think that's from what I understand that's that's more to do with with profit motives uh because the 7eventh day evangelist church is is is actually against things like coffee and caffeine and and cigarettes so they they I don't disagree with everything they say you know it was just the meat one they got wrong right so it was like no no coffee caffeine alcohol cigarettes all these sorts of things and meat they lump meat in with all of that right so I think that's that was just the fundamental flaw everything else I think is is is pretty good as far as their ideas eating living a clean life family oriented you know not doing drugs alcohol not the idea of not putting bad things into your body but they got one massive mistake there which is you know meat is the only thing that's that's healthy for us to eat and all these other things that they replaced that with are actually quite harmful so they got that one fundamentally wrong and of course their tactics are just completely uh out of out of bounds it mean just criminal sort of things you know pushing your agenda on people like that without their knowledge like like they just messed up and got it wrong well I think Ellen G white's a liar yeah I don't think she like had a vision from God no like no she was a plagiarist know she she she like like hundreds of her visions and things like that were actually uh uh you know just directly taken from other you know like prophets and religious holy people and Pope and things like that just they people didn't know so she's reading all these things I had a vision from God it told me what you know Pope Benedict II in 1640 said but you don't know that so I'm just going to look how how cool I am no she's a plagiarist I I I fully believe that she uh was just a fraud and just a a huster and she just you know and she just made her name by this you know there were there were other sorts of accounts of different sday Adventists they basically said that that a vegan diet was way to to sort of make their presence as a as a their own religion known that this was their own unique thing and that um I forget the exactly who said it but they they basically said that that this uh diet could be also thought of as as a as a religious you know um identity and help Forge the image of the sth Day Adventist Church more than anything so I think that that was largely to do with what it was now she could have believed that this helped suppress your hormones I mean I mean it does does it suppresses your hormones it makes you unhealthy and so you know you're not going to be you're not going to have the same sexual urges if you unhealthy you know because your body's telling you look you can't you can't procreate you're not going to be able to support kids you you don't have the resources you don't have the health you know and so yeah it can absolutely do that so but but her motivations were just different it wasn't for proper Health her motivation was to suppress sexual desire and she got that not a mistake no no no not a mistake know she's she's horrible yeah all right thank you very much Anthony that was fantastic thank you [Music] everyone"
