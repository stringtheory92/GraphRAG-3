        "body": "okay all right so we're just going to hop into uh the questions on that have been sent in and then anyone who has a a question can FM the chat we can we can go through those as well so first question is from Madeline she says I have been feeling awful on and off since going carnivore and it seems to be getting worse very sorry to hear that I feel depressed with the lack of motivation have no energy cry easily for nothing at first it was only before my period that I felt like this but now it's at other parts of the cycle too I watch a video with Kelly Hogan and Amber O'Hearn where they talked about some people having a hard time processing large amounts of protein at once due to a liver not processing protein too quickly the fix would be to spread protein intake over four times a day instead this really resonated with me for several reasons first I ate some candy yesterday and ate less protein because of it and I felt so much better the second half of the day so it could have been because of lesser protein intake second before when I was ketovor I was in D ketosis all the time but since going carnivore uh where I eat more meat and bigger meals I haven't been able to stay in ketosis or I am in light ketosis tested with keto Mojo do you think I need to reduce protein or spread meals out more to interesting ketosis well I mean being a ketosis is good it's neuroprotective there's benefits of that but it could also be that you're just not eating as much fat as your body wants either and that is often why people feel pretty low energy and they don't feel Great Depression uh could you know be from not getting enough fat fat getting your cholesterol up normalizing your hormones giving you energy can certainly uh help your your mental status as well as well as having higher ketones so if you feel that you know I don't know you know what you're eating too differently I mean being keto of War means you're eating a lot of meat and animal fat as well as some veggies just no carbs um you know the difference between that and carnivore is just not eating the veggies so you know you can still eat the same amount of fat and and uh you know that to protein sort of ratio so it could be that you're eating you know more uh more protein you're not getting enough fat the real thing is you want to eat enough protein you want to get enough fat and if you're someone who has has a bit of difficulty processing large amounts of protein at a time then certainly spreading those out is a good idea and most people can just have a whole bunch but if you're someone that can't then that's fine just just uh you know you can spread those out and then but also getting enough fat so you want to get enough fat you want to get enough protein so it's not necessarily you want to get a certain split but it does seem that people do better you know when their calories from fat and protein end up being around you know 70 30 80 20 sometimes it just depends on the individual individual concern some people need to be much deeper ketosis like people uh who have epilepsy or cancer seems to be much more important to have your Ketone level up higher and that and that is protective in a lot of ways so it sounds like you're in that camp and you need to bump up your protein and potentially even you know maybe reduce your pro or sorry bump up your fat and then either reduce your protein or split them up it it just depends so you can play with that and just um and just see what works for you just try increasing your fat you can space out your your protein meals you can just go back to eating what you were eating with on ketovor minus all the plants as well and just having the same fat and and meat content as well um so it sounds like you might might have been getting so many protein from like you know nuts or you know seed oils or coconut oil something like that it's just just replace all that with just animal fats animal protein but having the same sort of amounts and and see what that does and yeah hello everyone let's see what more people seem to be signing up that's good hello uh yeah hello Mike Danny and uh Olivia Rebecca uh faren all great to see you um from Jared my wife's Grandma uh you may remember we discussed recently on the 100 member Zoom has been experiencing some unusually high glucose numbers in the evenings even after days of strict carnivore last night her glucose was 185 that's very high uh is this is it too much protein to Fat ratio that causes this it really shouldn't be it uh you might may not get like a bit of a transient bump um but you know gluconeogenesis is is demand driven as opposed to substrate driven you know it's just like you have so much protein your body just goes oh what are we going to do with this turn it into glucose you know it doesn't really happen um you know it sounds like she probably has some insulin uh insensitivity already because you just won't get massive high glucose numbers like that otherwise so you know is she diabetic already is she taking medication so if she has she come off the medications you know I mean diabetes does take a while to reverse and sometimes people need to stay on some form of medications because their bodies have just been pretty damaged from Decades of eating uh these sorts of things that can damage your body so it can take a long time for that to reverse and so one thing people do is they get a bit impatient they say well I shouldn't have to take these diabetes medications anymore they stop them and then all of a sudden they're having these high glucose numbers so that's uh something to think about I don't I don't know if she has diabetes or if she's taking any medication but that's something to think about because getting a glucose of 185 is quite high so uh you know there might be something going on there um yeah after days yeah that's that's quite abnormal it really shouldn't be the high protein but you can always try it you can just see uh you can trial you know eating different things and if if you know there's some things in particular that she's eating that's just spiking things up you know just sort of avoid those for a while and you know she absolutely strict carnivores she's not speaking anything not to say that she would be but you know it's just something you have to sort of think about and um yeah and you know maybe if if she's you know very ins you know very insensitive to insulin and her you know glucose levels blipping up a little bit because of the of the big protein bullish is she's taking in uh and maybe she's just her body just can't respond to that as well as it would otherwise maybe that's what's causing this so maybe so you know just try try eating different things maybe you know split up the protein throughout the day um and and see if that affects things you know if it's if it's just happening in the evenings you know I wonder why that is is that when she's eating her big meal or is there something else so you'll try to you know try to sort of track what's happening what she's eating um you know she's eating sort of the same thing earlier in the day and is that giving the same rise or maybe not giving the same rise you know then it may not be the food that's that's causing it uh if she's eating sort of the same thing at different times and getting different results so there's there's a few things that need to be played around with there um so so some things to think about anyway and Madeline okay so you just answered me yeah so I just answered Madeline's question hopefully hopefully you caught that oh you just missed it all right well you were you were first on the boat so um yeah I think you can you can just watch it later I think it's um yeah I I yeah that um that should be fine from Matthew I'm nearly 24 and have heard that at 25 years of age people lose neuroplasticity I eat effortless learning supposedly High during childhood then decreases until around 25 after which only focus and hard work will do yeah now I'm carnivore this seems outright false unreliable to me I feel just as alert as I did 10 years ago I also noticed that after practice after practice of a challenging rhythmic computer game my skills improve to a meaningful extent in a matter of hours sometimes during the practice session itself sleep is still very helpful but my ability to learn effortlessly seems to start hours and hours before sleep and this seems to become more true the deeper in ketosis I am I can't help but guess that this might be part of why children learn so well at first and then why they lose tolerance to carbs with age uh you know they learn less fast uh partly because of that have you looked into that matter and what are your thoughts I haven't looked into that in that specifically but yeah I agree that your brain works dramatically different when it's on ketones and and as I've argued for a long time I think ketones are your brain's primary resource we only switch to glucose when we have an abundance of glucose in our bodies you know doesn't know what to do with all the stuff so we stuff it in and we suppress our ketones and then we don't have enough ketones to run our brain and so you have to switch to glucose but your brain always runs on ketones uh to at least a small degree no matter what your your state of metabolic State you're in and then when you get enough ketones your ketones get up high enough your brain only runs on ketones so it only runs on glucose when your Ketone levels are not high enough to to sufficiently maintain your your brain because your brain takes a lot of energy in proportion to the size of the organ it takes a lot of energy and so you need a lot of energy if you don't have a lot of ketones you're not going to do that so yeah as far as kids learning yeah maybe you know I mean they're going to be drinking milk you know are they necessarily in ketosis like you know I'm not sure about that but um but you do notice I've noticed anyway just anecdotally that you know kids of my friends who've done carnivore like these kids just learn so much faster they're they're racing through their Milestones uh much quicker than other other kids and uh and they're just doing very very well they're just just thriving um your brain keeps going I mean you know your neuroplasticity you know early on is is very very very different than later in uh later in your life like if you learn if you learn a language before you're at the age of five you will know that language better than if you learn at any other point like you know your brain just works differently it's very geared up to learning languages and that's because you need to learn language you need to understand how to communicate with the rest of the species and so if you get your kids to you know learning languages you know when they're very young what you know well before they go to school they will learn those languages much more fluently than they ever will uh throughout the rest of their life now you can learn languages fluently later on but it'll never be the same as if you learned it before the age of five and you know and and also uh it's interesting because you know the more languages you learn the easier it is to learn languages later as well and so that that sort of sets you up for for being very uh you know uh having a big Advantage later on as well so but yeah your brain absolutely works a lot better now and like you know my my brain works so much better you know when I was studying for my mcats I was you know just because it was easy I was just doing like whole wheat pasta and it was oh that's so healthy and all that stuff and I'd have some meat sometimes as well just because I liked meat but you know through the day I would just sort of make little bits of pasta because you know just take a few minutes and just boil it up fill me up and I could just study for hours and hours and hours and I always had brain fog and I was always like why is this happening why am I why is my brain not work you know I got plenty of sleep the night before and yet I just it's just you know I woke up fine everything was great and now the rest of the day I just feel like I'm in the days and I think that's what that was from so you know what we eat definitely affects our brains and negatively or positively so yes I think that um that this is is definitely a benefit and you know we know that you know after injury stroke traumatic brain injury uh ketogenic diet helps your brain heal it just does and so you know you bring can heal from a lot of things but it's a very very complex structure and it's uh it's not really possible to necessarily heal everything and but you're always making new connections you're always sort of rebuilding recrow and not to the same extent that is when you're a kid but but it you still have plasticity so don't uh don't believe the hype on that one I'm just gonna switch through just glance through um so one of the in the comments do you recommend MCT or collagen or both so if if you want to ask a question in the comments maybe try to do like you know at you know Anthony Chase or something like that just sort of highlights um and then I can see it better um do I recommend MCT or collagen or both I don't think you need to take any of these things I don't think you need to take any supplements I think you just eat meat uh and just just eat naturally and and um and you'll be fine if you wanted to take MCT you know you could I guess it would depend on what the source is from most of the time the sources are from uh you know plant sources uh coconut oils and things like that so I guess this house refined does it take everything out apart from the MCTS um you know that that you know maybe there's some things that that you don't actually want that that get along with it or are they completely isolate as an MCT isolate um collagen you're going to get plenty of collagen from eating meat and so you don't you don't need to take all that I think that realistically you don't need any supplements on a on a proper you know a proper biologically appropriate diet proper human diet as as Dr Berry says because that's by definition going to have everything that you need in it so um you take it if you want but I I think that you'll get plenty uh just from from eating fatty meat and yeah okay then Meg asks I have a friend who's exposed to mold in her home for years she now suffers from inflammation weight gain and hearing loss she found a new Doctor Who has put her on a plant-based diet I passed on your information and suggested she find your YouTube your videos on YouTube do you know of anyone if anyone has improved on mold exposure symptoms since going carnivore that's something that I haven't seen too much of but I have spoken to a few people who have had issues with mold and mold exposure which is nasty stuff nasty nasty stuff and that can cause serious problems and when you're on Carnivore your immune system is going to be much much much stronger and so you're going to be able to fight these things off but like when when you know there's mold and there's dust and there's there's bacteria and there's all these sorts of things that can cause issues most of them are just in the background but in certain circumstances sometimes it can cause a problem and so you have these opportunistic pathogens that all of a sudden once they once they get hold then you're you're you might be in in a bit of trouble you know we can say for some reason and then it just you know gets into you and or they make these different toxins that are just around you in your environment and and you get exposed to so it it may be that they just they may need to take uh medicine as well and get that treated some of these things just aren't going to clear on their own and you have to get get help with them um but yeah you I've I've seen anecdotally a few people uh that have had mold exposure and problems with that and that has helped them and and that's something that they noticed uh didn't make a difference but it's it's still difficult and you still might need uh some help with that uh medication-wise okay um and Jeff asks can carnivore help with Lyme disease and Hashimoto's famously famously helps with both of those so Lyme disease there have been uh there has it's been literature and I've been been written about it helping with Lyme disease chronic lyme disease since the 1800s there was a a book written by a lady I can't remember um her name or the name of the book um but she was sick probably with with chronic lyme disease and she had been bedridden for years I think something like seven eight or nine years long time close to a decade and she had such low energies that she just she really couldn't get out of bed she had to have people help her with meals and um and everything that she couldn't do every doctor that would come into town this was in the late 1800s every doctor that would come to town should get them like please help me what can I do and they all have their little tinctures and this is and that's probably all just you know different opiates to make you feel good for a second and then they get out of town and after they've sold you the Cure and and before you can see that it didn't actually do anything and nothing helped nothing helped nothing helped and then she came across uh you know salisbury's book um you know relation of alienation and disease and she was like okay this this makes sense I'm going to do this and so she just started eating red meat she started eating beef she couldn't even make it herself she had to have a neighbor go into town and get it fresh and grind it for a fresh and and help her with it after about nine months she got well enough that she could actually walk down like a mile into town and get the beef and come back and prepare it herself and then after like a year and a half she was back to normal and she was so impressed by this she ended up researching it more herself and writing her own book on it and so and there have been a lot of people that I've seen in just different discussion groups from people that have have I've spoken to directly that have helped Lyme disease Hashimoto's I have more direct um evidence of this I I treat people with Hashimoto's we have we have dozens of patients with Hashimoto's and in our clinic and they all improve on a carnivore diet all of them um not all of them have completely resolved Hashimoto's is one of those they're a bit a bit more um stubborn than say like Crohn's or all sort of colitis which responds very rapidly as well as as rheumatoid arthritis Hashimoto's takes longer um but immediately your your antibodies will start coming down thyroid function will start coming up and so there are people that after like a year year and a half get complete resolution and others that are Source still Linger on a bit but they all improve they all improve so yeah that those definitely are helped by this um question from Madeline in the comments can you improve or reverse Parkinson's disease with diet I think you can improve it I don't think you're going to be able to reverse it because well I mean there's different causes of Parkinson's but you know the Mainstays that you you the the substantia [\u00a0__\u00a0] is damaged and so you're not going to be able to make dopamine properly and so that's uh that that sort of damage done at that point you know so it might it might work better it might be it might be that you you can better utilize what you have left but you know there is going to still be a certain amount of damage done and and you're probably not going to recover from that but um it it can certainly be preventative for a number of different reasons and they even find that people with higher LDL cholesterol and um and saturated fat intake that's protective against developing Parkinson's later on in life as well and not eating lectins as well and um so there's definitely benefits on prevention and benefits once you have it as well which can also potentially slow down the progression or even stop the progression potentially it's going to depend on the individual and what's causing it and um but are you going to reverse it completely probably not there's there's going to be some damage done most likely um but you're going to improve in a thousand other ways as well and so your life with Parkinson's will also improve dramatically you know as I've seen with my my father and other people as well um Olivia s r the Lyme disease results specifically carnivore or keto2 well the ones that I've seen were specifically carnivore uh there may be literature with Lyme disease and keto I'm not sure I'm sure it probably would help because you know just being in ketosis your body's going to run better anyway and your immune system is going to run better anyway and so you'll probably be be all right um but those those uh anecdotes were specifically carnivore let's see okay so Rebecca asks she says okay please advise based on the information below from a local farmer as to whether we can eat this beef and the farmer says apparently the cows grazed during the summer but we have them feed well we feed them hay during the winter because there's just no growth or nourishment in the grass they do periodically get concentrates of sweets for cows that contain molasses Etc so we are able to work with them and to stop from going feral uh we put out mineral blocks after calving for the breeding females but they will only take it when they know they need it the garlic licks and garlic licks to help keep flies off them during the summer yeah I don't know about the garlic thing that's that's interesting that it keeps the Flies off they just stink like garlic and that keeps the flies away I don't know um yeah I mean I'm sure it's fine I mean it looks like it's probably better than most most store-bought stuff you know most store-bought you know when they're when they're going to a feed lot they're feeding a lot of grain and things like that you know giving cows uh you know some molasses and things like that that's pretty common thing like I mean I don't think it's necessary um you know or good for the cow um but you know that's that that can also help with the the marbling and getting that intramuscular fat um I don't know why that would stop them from going feral I mean there's plenty of ranchers that that don't feed their cows molasses and then the cows don't don't stage a Spartacus Revolt or anything like that um and um yeah but it does it does seem from the sounds of it it sounds like uh they're mostly just eating grass and hay which is basically grass and um and so if it's if it's that or store-bought that that probably sounds even probably better than store-bought so uh but there are there are definitely uh ranchers that don't use any of that that just have you know just grass or hay in the in the winter if they don't have enough growth or anything like that and um and so you can you can find those people as well okay and Lucia asks I started in May this year eating carnivore and have had some very positive changes so until starting carnivore I was eating vegan since 2018 well um but putting on weight as you do a lot of carbs and sugar available in in vegan diets she's 58 88 kg lost 10 kg since starting carnivore was awesome I had very high blood pressure when starting and now it's much improved very much improved now it's back to normal that's good um started with blood pressure medicine in 2017. and increased over time and in early 2021 started getting swelling in in her ankles and was feeling increased pain and then when I stretched my skin it felt like it was splitting her doctor wanted her to put her on another tablet to support the swelling however she refused to add another tablet I mean this is the sort of thing again these these prescription Cascades you just give one thing after the other after the other after the other and then you're giving medications to deal with the side effects of other medications and and and then side effects of that medication all that sort of stuff so it does get a bit crazy sometimes and that's a well recognized phenomenon in medicine so her blood pressure now has is now normal 1 120 over 80 and I've hacked her tablets and have felt really well which is great she just got some blood tests and all seems good the doctor says kidney results were a little high and has ordered another test to be done to check to see uh what or why uh probably just need a bit more water generally that will sort of solve most of these things you're creatinine goes a little high and and then a little more water just sort of sorts that out unless you're like in you know fulminate kidney failure and your body can't can't deal with the water that's a different story though um and uh and if it's just you urea that's up that's not kidney failure and that's not a problem that's actually good and you're it's it's recognizable um I've recognizable phenomenon when you start eating uh carnivore and just more protein in general and urea is actually good for you it's one of your body's strongest antioxidants it's very very powerful so that's not a problem if your urea is up uh and your creatinine is normal you don't have a kidney problem and and so she eats mainly lamb pork spare ribs eggs and butter and has two meals a day but she's experiencing but experiencing losing half of her hair volume and weakness in her nails and splitting that's now that's something you see every now and then and uh and and I still don't know exactly why because most people get much much better uh hair and nails as a result quite often it's from not getting as much fat as the body wants um so that would be the first thing I would do obviously you know getting getting off of absolutely everything that you're eating uh that that you know has to do with plants or sugar or anything like that it was the first step Second Step would be would be increasing the fat load that seems to help most people there are I think two people now that I've spoken to that even when they've increased their fat and they're getting a lot of fat and eating right and being very strict they're still experiencing a bit of hair loss so the other thing is just doing a deep dive into your into your Bloods and see if there's anything else that's going on there with your vitamins minerals hormones uh Etc but I would start with jacking up the amount of fat that you're eating and the amount of the amount of food that you're eating in general because it can be very easy to under eat especially when we're losing weight sometimes you you want to limit what you're eating in order to facilitate losing weight but that can be counterproductive for health reasons and losing hairs is is sometimes seen when you're undernourished and so just make sure that you're getting enough food make sure you're getting enough fat in general and and if that's not doing the trick then you know just get a bunch of blood tests and find out what's going on and uh you know and see what's happening because that's that's generally the exception to the rule most people will get stronger thicker hair and nails and uh and they'll see that pretty early on so you know just try those try those things and uh and then go from there um any other questions cropping up so I'm just going back and forth between both of these I just want to make sure I'm not missing any questions in the comments um then oh come on then uh candy asks at night I'm terrified of stretching my feet because I get awful cramps in my calves and I've never had them before I've tried electrolytes no electrolytes lots of water not a lot of water seems to come up a lot in the carnivore community so what's the deal with that and how can it be fixed that's a very good question um it yeah it is it is uh dependent on the individual uh I mean it sounds like you've tried all the all the normal things you know putting in electrolytes no I mean having some electrolytes cover your bases that's fine it's generally magnesium if it's going to be anything um and uh and then definitely more water is better than less water unless you're just you know rinsing out all of your electrolytes but if you're taking electrolytes and you're drinking a lot of water you should be fine most of the time it's I find that when it's late stages of carnivore you've been carnivore for you know a few months or a few years and you start getting cramps it's most often because you're getting dehydrated and it can take several days of drinking enough water to sort of get back up and I I've even noticed that with myself when I'm just you know I'm just working all the time I'm just not getting hot because I just for some reason it's just like there's just it's like the damn Sahara at the hospitals like you just you just can't get water very readily and so uh or it's like freezing cold like from the water machine so it's just like you you try to drink this stuff and you get like brain freeze if you want to drink any anything more than a glass and then a cup or two and so I find that I get I get very dehydrated so if I'm not very careful with my hydration all of a sudden I'll get i'll get very bad leg cramps as well and have like that same thing where you don't want to yeah you don't want to stretch out because all of a sudden you just it will just kick these things off um so um I don't have I don't have a great answer for you I would just try continuing on what you're doing but in in you know more regularly so so day after day after day you know consistently raising your water level getting more than three four liters a day and and then drinking more if your body is telling you to if if that's what uh if you're thirsty for more than drink more and and doing that consistently day after day after day after day for several days in a row because it can take it can take a number of days to build up before you get um you get any any uh some traction on these sorts of cramps and um and that's what I noticed in people that I speak to and I've noticed in myself as well it would take days it would take days of drinking more and more water to to catch up and um and then if you wanted to take electrolytes during that too you you know you could I mean it could be you know it could be a bit you know counterproductive like if you're taking all those those electrolytes and maybe your body's like flushing out more to try to like you know get rid of the the excess you know minerals and electrolytes in your piece you could you know sort of be um shooting yourself on the foot there but you know if you're trying electrolytes consistently and that's not helping then then give water a go um you can also just check your electrolytes and check your magnesium and calcium and if those are low then those are the ones you need to top up it would be unlikely that they're low but if they are that's when you want to top them up and and otherwise just hose in the water that's generally what's what's causing the problem um but uh it sounds like you're doing all the right things I would just I would just do it you know just keep it up and keep it consistent and do it for several days or or you know a week or more and then consistently after that because you know you're going to need to maintain whatever you're doing whatever hydration level or uh you know if it's electrolyzed then electrolyte level you're going to need to maintain that uh ongoing so you know you just need to sort of make that that uh that positive change and maintain and keep it going consistently um of scores is there an aspect no I don't think there's an Ask button it's just just in the live chat but like I think if you if you put at Anthony and it brings up my name you sort of push tab it should uh tag me in it and then it'll sort of highlight my name um and then and then that that can be a bit more noticeable for me so if you if I do this yeah like that there you go so Jared just did that so he just did at Anthony Chaffey MD and it popped up and so that that's highlighted orange for me and so I've just done that with your name and hopefully that highlights that for you so if you do that then that that just pops that up and that gets my attention because otherwise it's um it's a bit difficult because I can't I can't actually uh readily see uh see everything that's that's designed as a question um okay so Olivia um posted a question someone else on Carnivore today said they have aching kidneys they're not good that's not good uh would you give the same advice uh I.E water or anything else they need to do well I mean it depends I mean it depends on what's causing the aching kidneys right so I mean if they are like kidney stones and something like that then uh well yeah then actually the answer would be the same you do want to sort of flush that stuff out but also you know your organs have are viscerally innervated so the nerves that are in them they aren't uh somatic so they don't they don't you can't like you touch here I know where I'm being touched I close my eyes I know exactly where I'm being touched right so it's not the same with your organs your visceral or your your viscerally innervated structures um they're more General and so you get a pain some something's bothering it and you get more of a general pain in that sort of general area but it's not like pinpointed like oh that's my kidney necessarily and so it would just depend but um you know if you're having kidney issues you're having kidney stones or you're having all that sort of stuff water is a good idea in general but it just depends on what what's going on and if you're having having that sort of pain then you know and it's ongoing it's not sort of resolving after a few days you probably best to get it checked out uh talk to a doctor about that um and uh yeah yeah or you can just just type in capitals question production shape but if you if you tag me um and it highlights my name that's much easier and uh so I think that's that's most of the questions for the oh yeah it's all the questions that we had for that have been submitted so uh now it's just basically any burning questions and things you desire to know uh so so take your take shots um so question my brother is in a wheelchair and deals with chronic bed sores issue I'm so sorry to hear that that is that's uh very difficult um I did Plastics uh yeah I was going I was thinking about going into Plastics in medical school when I was at Duke um well I did a term at Duke in Plastics and we and we dealt with that tours a lot they can be a very very difficult uh thing to deal with and treat um deals with chronic beds or issues starting carnivore six weeks ago uh no wait yet you know I'm assuming no weight loss is this something to concern ourselves with um well no you you don't necessarily have to worry about you know weight loss I mean I'm assuming you mean weight loss there started six carnivore six weeks ago no weight loss um you would expect some weight loss like I mean even just just the water weight the water weight changes that you'll get uh when you try to get rid of the carbs and the glycogen and the and the water weight um that you would you would expect to lose some weight but I mean the most important thing is just just being healthy and um and just eating what's good for his body and and sort of letting him get on with that um it it should help with bed sores because you're going to increase the amount of protein that you have you're going to increase your your body's immune system and ability to heal from wounds and you will um you know and the and the collagen would be much healthier and stronger so it can protect you from from developing them in the first place or developing them as badly and then they can heal better as well I mean the main thing with bed sores is is the nurses need to be moving him constantly it's it's it can be very very tricky but that that is something that with proper rolling and moving and it's constant it's very difficult you have to be on top of this um that that can that is something that can largely be avoided if if done carefully and then after that when you're dealing with this sort of stuff carnivore can help and carnivore will just help in general because it'll just be it'll just be healthier in general um so uh and and the weight loss will come you know weight loss weight loss always always happens eventually some people take a little longer some people even gain weight at first but they feel healthier and they are healthier the whole time then eventually they're um their weight will will follow suit and so I wouldn't I wouldn't be too worried about that as long as he's eating eating the right stuff and eating enough is very important [Music] um yeah so yeah so I think everyone's playing with the with the Highlight thing now and uh so yeah enjoy that um does anybody else have any questions we'll sort of roll back through hmm foreign are you only saying hi to people in Vegas that's fine I didn't think there were that many people in Vegas um okay so is there anything else that people wanted to to talk about just in general it could be this is necessarily anything you know to ask me personally but uh you know just in general is anything any people are interested in um I don't know if I I announced this but um I was doing a big presentation to my department in neurosurgery and talking about the the metabolic theory of cancer you know what my you know what um my interview with Professor sea freed you know who sort of delved into and presented all the well not all but a lot of the data on the metabolic theory of cancer that this is stemming from the mitochondria and that you know very simple straightforward dietary changes getting people into high state of ketosis and low glucose levels uh is very beneficial for fighting cancer and actually going through the studies that have already been done for various Cancers and specifically brain cancers primary brain lesions and gliomas and showing that you know there's actually already been randomized control trials with you know 20 people so it's not a huge one but and then other other trials for perspective trial trials retrospective uh case uh case series looking at people that have been treated like Cedar Sinai Hospital in New York um and uh you know showing that they they've actually done very very well and and this has improved their survival and progressions free survival which is really the only metric that matters and these sorts of things and uh it actually went over very well I was very very nervous on how it would be received um but people were actually very interested and it's like wow okay you know that's good I remember one of the the professors of neurosurgery when when I told them the topic of my talk he was he's always a bit nervous he was just like oh okay um all right uh all right well you know because we were talking about maybe you're proposing that we do a trial ourselves and so users said okay well okay that's fine but you know you need to maybe do a literature review I mean this is supposed to be a literature review and he was a bit you could tell he's a bit nervous about how it was and even he said at the end of it that he was a bit like wow he's a bit out of left field and you know hopefully it goes well but he said that it actually made him really think and reconsider uh the situation uh with primary brain tumors and um and actually even asked I said hey you know you should do a study on this which is exactly what I wanted uh in the first place so uh so that's something that that we're going to get going so I'll be working um with the Department to set up a study and go through the ethics approval and then all the other good stuff and uh and and start getting getting another study going potentially join up with uh Dr uh Matthew Phillips uh his he has a trial going uh perspective uh trial going in New Zealand with his glioblastoma patients and um so we might be able to join that make that a multi-centric study which it which when you do a multi-center study it's always better or more well received in the scientific Community you're like hey there's multiple centers here and we're all getting the same results okay so that's that's something that's very powerful uh in in convincing people that this is actually good information and good data so that's something that um that I'm looking into now so that's very very exciting it does mean that I you know sign myself up for the next uh you know sort of five six years of of a lot of work is and and uh stats and and um and uh data entry but whatever I'll do it I'm happy I'm very stoked about that so so that was a very positive thing and and hopefully be able to get bigger Studies have this be a bigger study and and get more and more and more information out there and also just it gives it gives me a way to reach people and say hey you know why don't you give this a try and it's part of a trial it's official and then you know let people really improve their health as a result so that's that's something I was very happy with so that just happened last week last week Monday well so I've been I've been uh pretty happy about that since um Madeline asks a woman I know with Parkinson's got the advice to eat less protein from meat and more from lentils and beans well of course they did I mean everybody everybody uh is just bashing meat and and saying this plants are so great and it'll meet so bad for you and so you need to avoid it but you still need protein so get it from from Beans and lentils all that nonsense but again there was a study in 2015 out of Denmark looking at thousands upon thousands of people who had their vagus nerve cut and we know that that lectins which are abundant in lentils and beans to the point that if you don't cook them and prepare them properly they'll kill you um that they can actually track up your vagus nerve and get into your brain and damage your substantia [\u00a0__\u00a0] okay so we we have uh studies showing that and they found that people who got a bigotomy who cut the vagus nerves bilaterally um because you have two of them uh that they were 66 percent less likely to get Parkinson's so they study everyone who got a vagotomy who got their vagus nerves cut uh between like the 19 mid 1970s mid 1990s was like it's 20-year uh 20 years of of data and um and 66 reduction in Parkinson's so I disagree for that but also because they have a ton of other things in them that are harmful to you and you people say like well oh if you just if you just heat treat them then that gets rid of them well first of all not everyone he treats these things there's a lot of things in cereals that aren't heat treated and you're just eating these things raw raw oats all these sorts of things that that we consume uh you know the raw food vegan people they're like oh you have to eat this stuff raw raw raw that's all the way to go it's like it very much isn't and you know beans and lentils I mean you don't actually get rid of all the all the lectins you don't and so and then lectins are are just you know tip of the iceberg that's that's one problem out of you know potentially hundreds or even thousands that are in that being or seed or grain or whatever plant so you know I just yeah I I fully disagree with that for a number of different reasons um but yeah but but it's not surprising I mean just it's just there's a big plant-based push and and unfortunately doctors don't know anything about nutrition and unfortunately unfortunately and more importantly than that dietitians and nutritionists are flat out taught the wrong things and so it's not even oh we don't teach nutrition in medical school it's that no one teaches proper nutrition you know no one is teaching you know uh nutrition as it pertains to a proper human diet you know no one ever contended that that uh plant-based was how we evolved no one until just now when people started pointing out like hey that doesn't make sense you know the whole paleo thing came out like we were eating meat like we were hunter hunter gatherers we're eating meat maybe some plants um but really not that many and uh if at all and you know and so people are sort of challenging that well hey hey wait a minute you know should we really be eating this stuff or or or should we not be eating meat and they said oh well no actually we're herbivores and I mean look at our teeth our teeth it's clearly a river it's like um no they're not and um you know so this is just insane but uh yeah so it's just everything's just just pushing this whole plant-based agenda but you know as I pointed out before you know the who is very anti-meet and very Pro plant-based or or or meat alternative you know they have an entire page on their website talking about natural toxins in food and it says toxins in food it doesn't say toxins in plants so it's natural toxins in food and so it goes through all these different toxins in in the foods that we commonly eat and every single one comes from plants or algae every single one and so the only connection to meat is that animals eat this algae that has these toxins in them and then that goes up the food chain into the bigger fish that we eat and that can be a problem more than shellfish as well right that's not the animal that's not the meat itself there's no they they identified no toxins in meat inherent in meat zero zero all right the only things that they said were like this this stuff that the animal ate that then became a problem okay the animal itself was not the problem and so you know I'm sorry but like you know people have all these like theoreticals like oh well it can you know change mtor and it can do this and potentially do that and maybe gut biome and like it just they just make things up and it's like oh there's this epidemiological study and it's just like you know like you know 18 you know increased risk of of uh of bowel cancer and people who smoke and drink and you know and drive too fast and increase all to cause mortality I'm like yeah you think um it's it's nonsense there's no hard science to back it up there's a lot of hard science to back up the fact that plants are toxic you know who even talks about it and the who their agenda is completely against eating meat so you know you know you know it's not like they're pushing an agenda so unfortunately that's just that's just the world we live in right now there's a lot of misinformation and and flat out lies and um and that's one of them so I would not uh recommend eating beans and lentils for someone with Parkinson's I would not recommend eating that for anyone ever I think that stuff is poison um Jared asks uh when are you going to interview Thomas so that would be a dream come true I don't know if he would ever agree to uh to speak with me but like my god I've never um you know fanboyed over anyone in my life uh besides Thomas Soule like I mean I just absolutely love that guy I would I would just love the opportunity to talk to him about carnivore and try to convince him to get on Carnivore just to uh get him uh as healthy as he possibly can be and to and and so we could have another 20 30 40 Years of that man's in intense genius um you know maybe maybe I don't know maybe uh maybe my platform is getting marginally big enough to sort of attract the attention of people like him that would be amazing if if I could I'd have to think of some actual real things to um you know to to interest him to talk about that would be worth his while um but yeah that would be just amazing uh If he if he would be willing to do that just love that guy um we see it as what is a good amount of fat to have meat fat butter at the same meal um just as much as tastes good really and then and then go by your by how you're feeling if you're not feeling your best if your hair is not doing well if your Skin's not doing well if your energy levels are low if your stools are drying hard you know you need to eat more fat it's uh that's a good rule of thumb and then you'll go buy buy your stool like I think that's a good metric as long as you're not drinking coffee or taking artificial sweeteners both of which are laxatives um then then you can tell how much fat you're getting by the stools you're eating if you're not if you don't haven't had any surgery or anything like that or any medical conditions that predispose you to having um a disrupted bowel motions but if they're drying hard you're not getting enough fat definitely and if they're very loose then you're eating a lot more fat than your body can absorb and so you can just pull back if you want you don't have to if there's a there's a natural spillover effect and it's not harmful it's just very inconvenience and and if you're just getting a nice soft normal consistency stools that's that's when you are in The Sweet Spot for fat and um foreign so Mike asks uh who are some guests that you have lined up to interview coming up or have reached out to um I reached out to Dr Laszlo uh borosh who's uh a retired professor of pediatric medicine at UCLA Medical School and uh and apparently he he's like a protege of Dr Gabor Somali who I interviewed about deuterium and and so this is a very prominent uh you know you know high up academic you know full professor of medicine um in in one of the top medical schools around and and he is is very learned and knowledgeable in this and he and he thinks there's all there's a lot to the deuterium thing in in health and so I'll be talking I'll be talking to him tomorrow actually and then I've I've actually interviewed several people that I haven't put up yet uh there's you know Andrew scarbros that that gentleman who's uh had it you know um glioblastoma brain cancer he's and he and he just he got debulking surgery and then and then didn't get any treatment after that and he's uh and he's alive 10 years later now he's actually doing human trials in GBM and starting one up in uh in England and then uh Dr Philip lavadio is a cardiac surgeon in uh Florida wrote that book uh stay off my operating table you know so that's really great you know having a cardiothoracic surgeon someone who deals with the the end stage repercussions of heart disease that he's saying eat meat eat carnivore eat a lot of fat this is what's good for you this is what is going to help you and help reverse your disease and prevent it from from coming up in the first place so that's um that's it's very good to get people like him and you know you know Dr Sim Ultra who I've had on before uh who who are able to you know really from from you know the ground level in their profession dealing with heart disease tell you hey this is this is we got it wrong um I also interviewed uh Rachel Brown who's a a psychiatrist in Scotland and you know talking about how dramatically um diet effects um mental health and even psychiatric conditions which is quite remarkable um and then um I've had I need to publish um Sophia uh Clements as well from Pele medicina talking again about about brain Cancers and Cancers in general being treated uh by them in um in uh you know with dietary measures and then like Sally Norton as well we talked to we dove into the whole oxalate thing which it was it which was something that I knew about peripherally but didn't didn't know all about and she's just written a book as well mostly about oxalates but also just talking about plant toxins in general and um and uh so that's uh those are some ones that that will be upcoming and um and then and then I was just on uh with um with Chris Bell who's um I think it's Kristen and Mark Bell who uh goes by like smelly Bell or something like that you know they're like power lifters and um and uh and weight lifters and bodybuilders and that you know since the 90s and uh you know Baker's been on on with them a few times and uh and so he just had me on his podcast this week so that'll be coming out I was on a podcast with uh Thomas delauer um as well um who you know obviously is a big keto proponent and has a has quite a big platform and talks and uh tries to you know dig into the research and dig into the the studies as well and um and and talk about things from from an evidence-based point of view which I I think is a good a good way to do it you know um you know I like I like carnivore more than keto obviously but you know you know you know we're um uh you know we're certainly on on the same side of the pitch you know and so uh it's good to talk to people like him uh who have made a big impact in in um diet and nutrition and are trying to uh trying to have people on and talk about things from an evidence-based point of view I think is a very good um a very good approach so yeah so there's some upcoming I don't know if that one's out yet actually I don't know I'll have to check he hasn't said anything to me yet but he said he was going to have that come out sort of in a few weeks and that was a few weeks ago so who knows and uh and then my talk with uh that I get that I gave at uh that medical conference um sort of the low carb medical conference low carb Down Under um that'll be coming out I think on November 6th so just over over the weekend maybe or early next week and so yeah so there's a few things in the pipeline and then um and then I have to to set up other other interviews coming up I've got a number of them that are sort of in the backlog that I have to sort of get out that I'm uh sort of um uh you know waiting waiting to put out I don't like putting out too many at a time just because they're they are longer form interviews and I think people get a bit overwhelmed watching these things uh anyway and um and maybe uh don't want don't want too many of them to come out at one time uh Olivia asks do you have any good interviews come oh that was no like that was basically the same question do you have any good interviews coming up or doing good ones lately so yeah just answer that oh come on Why Did You skip around um any vegans willing to interview with you yeah you know we uh tried to get um Simon Hill on I I don't that hasn't you know it's not that that's not going to happen necessarily um but you know he I was traveling and he was traveling I had my surgery and then as soon as I was sort of like the two days after I you know had my surgery he went on vacation and um I think he's probably back at this point I'll have to touch base with him again but basically we sort of we're trying to plan something and um between my schedule his schedule and Lane Norton's schedule whose Lane was going to sort of moderate our discussion uh which I don't think we necessarily need a moderate I think we just should have a discussion and just have an actual friendly discussion and you know and talk about things I think that would be very very positive um but between the three of us it's been difficult to find something so I don't know um uh I don't know when that's gonna happen but that's that's sort of where that left off is that uh uh is when people were going on vacation things like that so I'll have to touch base with them again um but I'm happy to talk about any of these guys um you know I've I've had little to no luck getting anyone to engage and I I'm not even trying to attack anyone I just I just want to actually have conversations and I've had tons of conversations with people off camera and um you know and uh and and they've been very positive you know with people like vegans and vegetarians and things like that and you know it's just uh you know getting them to actually do it on camera is a bit more difficult so we'll see um Andrew huberman that would be cool I don't know if he'd uh care to be on my tiny podcast with his massive following but you know you never know uh it could be um he's uh yeah yeah very interesting dude I haven't seen I've uh you know I mean I my my podcasts are long his are really long so it's like some of these things like three hours and I'm like I um I don't have that much time to watch these things unfortunately I would like I would I would actually watch more of his stuff if um if uh if you know they were in more bite-sized chunks just because like I just don't I don't have uh you know feature length film uh and or two feature-length films uh worth of time available to me at any point in my life these days so um unfortunately I can't really do that which is a shame because they're the ones I have watched are very interesting and I like his stuff um Justin Olivia and Dr vadia would be a great one from Danny says Dr vatti we create one for me because I've had a heart attack at 39 and was told I had familiar uh familiar um it's a familial hypercholesterolemia I'm assuming uh carnivore diet for two years now which is great awesome um that's gonna that's gonna significantly benefit you and keep your information down and keep this uh damaging clotting and and uh and uh further damage from happening so good job I wonder Danny if you've if you've gotten your you know uh coronary artery calcium scores checked and if that's you've been seeing that come down which we normally do but it's always good to always good to ask [Music] um and that's already on patreon what's on patreon is that the um the the low carb down animals on patreon tomorrow when is that coming out Olivia do you remember you'll know um Jared asks would you consider doing interviews with patreon supporters I think stuff like that would be less intellectually stressful for your average viewer yeah absolutely you know I mean I think I think you know just doing things with um with uh you know people that have had you know a go at a carnivore whether successful or even if even if they're having difficulty with it that can that can be beneficial for people just see like what are the pitfalls and how are they dealing with them and you know it's not just me that's having these problems and and you know you know how do I go about it or you know other other sort of you know just success stories and things like that I think those would be very very helpful too so yeah yeah it was definitely um that's definitely worth doing I'd be happy to do that um yeah Rebecca says huberman's videos are time code uh so you watch only that's of interest you yeah that's a very good point and that's sort of the only way I've actually watched his stuff is is with the time codes um but um you know even then like it's just you know it would be nice to sort of see the whole argument in its totality and you know because everything fits together as well I mean you know he's a he's a professional lecturer you know he's a lecturer at Stanford and so you know the man knows how to put put a lecture together and so I'm sure the whole thing would actually be very very worthwhile and uh and I would like to do that so but yeah the only the only things I have sort of seen so far just looking at chunks on the time codes which is something I need to do as well that's uh it's just another another bit of time that I don't um I haven't been able to put together is just sort of going through and doing the time codes as well because that's very helpful for people um and it makes it easier for people to to navigate through and find the bits that they want and or even come back to them like oh that was interesting I'll come back and watch that and um which is what I'll have to do too and uh yeah so Olivia says my low carb down under talk will be on Saturday 6 a.m my time for patrons oh great um I'm actually doing a uh a YouTube live with uh Ken Berry this weekend I think that's at 5am on um on Saturday the 5th let me see make sure it's out at five or six am I think it's 5am no it's 6 A.M 6 a.m it's five it's it's 5 p.m central time that's what it is so 5 p.m Central Time In America which uh corresponds to 6 a.m in Perth because I'm I'm 13 hours ahead of of central time in the U.S so that's the idea I'll be going on doing a live with him at 6 a.m on Saturday and uh and then I'm doing a a lecture at um at my department on at like eight in the morning so I'll be doing that live and then running straight over to do do another presentation uh uh in talking about uh spinal cord tumors and uh medulla reaction modulary tumors inside of the Dura of the spinal cord which is thrilling to absolutely no one that doesn't do surgery on the spine but uh yeah so that's what it'll be but I'll definitely watch it later that day and I'm on call this weekend so we'll just have to see how my schedule is and um and just go from there but yeah I'll have to see and see how and embarrassed I am from my uh from my talk and all the different things that I forgot to talk about that I was like oof why the hell did I remember to say that and then I'll have to go through the slides as well and do another thing like with like the why we were carnivores one um and just go through that and actually you know make it a point to say the things that I want to say because I didn't yeah I just this sort of was trying to hurry the talk along and not not take a massive amount of time and so I I sort of sped through some things and missed some points that I wanted to to make so loved one doc sits in and answers questions on a recorded video plays it feels like he's able to be more engaged that way well thank you um but yeah oh you're saying Andrew Scarborough is what's already up on patreon yeah yeah so he's that's a really interesting one he's a he's uh you know very interesting person to talk to uh just in general he's just a you know very bright bright Guy and um and you know very nice guy as well and uh and it's just an amazing amazing amazing story that you know I I mentioned this before but for those who uh don't know the type of ranging where he has is the most aggressive form of glioblastoma which is like the most aggressive form of cancer that you can get and so on average for all all gbms from time of diagnosis if you don't get treatment it's a three-month life expectancy on average and for his his specific type it actually much less than that it would be the average and so you know for him to just get a debulking and actually leave some tumor there because it was in a you know um in a very important part of the brain that controls the motor function of the whole side of your opposite opposite side of your body um can't you can't go in there and dig that out and so um I had to leave that alone and then he just said nope I'm not doing chemo I'm not doing radiation and uh because there's no point because the kind of cancer he had wouldn't respond to it anyway and he just went down and dietary uh dietary Pathways and the tumor shrunken it's basically gone and he came off all his he was on multiple different uh seizure medications he's come off all of them his doctors saying you cannot come off your seizure medications you will die of seizures if you come off of them you can never come off of these things and um and so they would not help him wean off which is a very dangerous thing to do actually after a very very slow and control and carefully and he did it in himself because I want to I want to come off these stupid things I think I'll be fine and he was he was right and he now takes no medications no seizure medications and had no treatment and he is alive 10 years down the line and now doing his own trials and Research into into treating GBM with with um uh therapeutic ketosis so you know which is great so it's an amazing story um yeah okay all right guys well it's uh sort of been an hour 15 minutes and I think we're out of questions so uh thank you everyone I really appreciate you guys uh tuning in and uh and submitting questions and hope and uh we'll just keep doing these things and and as we'll try to find better and better times that are at our you know more and more available uh for people uh to come to I understand that that uh in the evenings for me is is way too early in the morning for for other people and so I'll try to do mornings my time which will end up being in the afternoons um or really evenings uh in the US and maybe that'll be easier with people with work and and commitments during the week um and then we have our weekend uh Sunday Sunday Saturday Zoom as well so we'll keep trying to play with it today unfortunately I had I had I was on call overnight so I couldn't really schedule anything this morning and I start pretty early most days and so we'll just have to we'll just have to play with it so okay guys thank you very much uh hopefully that answered all your questions and that was helpful to people um and uh and just you know uh keep submitting questions and that you want to know about or just come in and and have a chat and talk and we can talk about um uh anything else that that comes up uh during the talk okay guys have a good night and rest of your day"
