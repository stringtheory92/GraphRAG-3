    "body": "Carmen says I need some encouragement and advice to speed up recovery of chronic fatigue psoriasis and neck and shoulder pain I'm a 45y old female and have been suffering from these symptoms for 20 for 20 years well [Music] um I don't know how long I don't know if you've tried the cornivore diet I I would certainly recommend it if you have tried it I would go with it it takes a long time to undo a lot of the damage that our body built up over the years and and so it can be frustrating because you just want things to be better now of course and you and you find some Outlet oh this should help me and like it's like why isn't it helping me now well it's only been two weeks and you haven't found anything else that has ever helped you right and that's why you're here and so so you know if it doesn't if it doesn't work in the first two weeks or first two months that doesn't mean that it's not working that doesn't mean it's not going to work just stick with it focus on focus on positives I'm sure there will be positives I'm sure you'll feel better in a lot of ways I'm sure that objectively you're helpful improve in a lot of ways um chronic a can be there for many many many reasons it can be there for hormonal reasons can be there for metabolic reasons it can be there for infectious reasons and post infectious reasons and and just on and on and on and on and on nutritional deficiencies B12 deficiencies folate deficiencies you get extremely tired when you have these iron deficiencies all these sorts of things even before you get anemia you can get these problems that will later you cause anemia as well so you know it's um a lot of these things take a long time to heal and get back up to normal levels and to normalize to get you you back on your feet but but they often do you know some people with chronic L disease you it would take them over a year before they would get back up to normal energy but you know what they were getting better along the way and so even though they weren't back doing everything that they they did when they were 17 and in perfect health you know they are getting better so focus on things that that are improving focus on the ways that you're getting better and just be positive you know look at other people who have gotten better and say okay you know I'm I'm gonna get there you know you just have to just keep going be you know very strong the more strict you are the more careful you are with what you eat the better you're going to better you're going to be the more better results you're going to have and so to stick with it things like psoriasis that works you that that that responds very well to a corner diet because it's it's really eating these different plants that that are triggering the psoriasis and other autoimmune issues um sometimes psoriasis gets a bit worse before it gets better sometimes it's bit stubborn um and sometimes will actually benefit by putting Tallow like beef Tallow on their skin very good moisturizer best moisturizer you'll ever find as great for your skin that can help as well but just giv enough time most people in fact with psoriasis find that they improve in in the first weeks or months sometimes it like I said gets a bit worse before it gets better but it will get better you know and uh but then address other things in your life too stress levels ru stress levels you know prioritize sleep make sure you're getting enough sleep your body heals when you're sleeping when you're at rest and so you need to you need to definitely prioritize your rest time and your sleep time as well so all of those things and then pain neck pain shoulder pain a lot of these things come from inflammation you can have injuries of course and that those need to be addressed potentially with your doctor but if it's pain without any sort of real cause it's just like you just have a sore neck and a sore back a sore shoulder well you know then that can be undo inflammation from all the different things that you're eating and eventually that will settle down with a carnivore diet it will you're removing a lot of things that cause inflammation and you're also increasing your ketones which will again suppress inflammation on on its own so that can certainly reduce the symptoms of neck pain and shoulder pain as well it's not necessarily going to undo any physical harm that you've had done but it will certainly reduce inflammation can reduce the pain that you're experiencing and some people don't you know it's just sort of you the same thing you know you're not having any symptoms you're not having any problems so it doesn't matter you know what sort of underlying there if you're completely functional you that's that's what matters at the end of the day so a lot of surgeries are done because people just have pain you know compressed nerve it causes pain down that nerve distribution you change your diet it reduces inflammation you don't have pain down that distribution do you even need surgery the compression may still be there does it really matter if you're not having any problems neurologically physically probably not and then same thing with your shoulder or your knee if you have arthritis it's like this is this is really painful and I can't really function I'm going to need a joint replacement okay but then you reduce your inflammation you change the way you're eating and all of a sudden you don't have pain anymore well you still have the arthritis the cage didn't grow back but you don't have the pain you don't have the disability so do you need the surgery many people say say you opt to not get surgery at that point which is great you know you want to avoid surgery if at all possible and that's coming from someone who really enjoys doing surgery and can only do surgery if people want surgery done on them right outside of an accident or something like that so I like doing a surgery but I don't ever want to do surgery on someone who doesn't need surgery I I always try to encourage people to do things to try to avoid surgery and do whatever they can to avoid the knife it's always better do that if you can heal your body and and be functional without surgery then that's the best option sometimes surgery is necessary you just you just can't avoid it and it's the best thing for you but if it's if it's not necessary then it's best not to get it and so this is something that can that can help you and has helped a lot of people so um I would just stay strong and stick with it and keep going and be positive about it and understand this is not going to happen you know is not going to change over that The Closer you are to just red fatty red meat and water as you can get the better your results you're going to be the longer you do it the better your results are going to be so just keep it up and you'll be fine"

    "body": "Oscar says thanks stock also did beef butter for four weeks couldn't go longer due to fatigue uh even though I had plenty of fat had awful diarrhea too how to balance it while simultaneously needing fat for energy that's a good question so the thing is is that you do want enough fat sometimes you can get you know bit weird changes with your stools from from the turnover of your microbiome as you can get you know diarrhea weird sort of things with that as bacteria sort of dying off and and other ones are replacing it and you still need fat and so I would still just eat the amount of fat that feels comfortable for you and that gives you the right amount of energy um a lot more fat than your body can absorb is going to get excreted you just can't absorb it and so that can obviously cause stools and things like that um you know four weeks is is a good amount of time for the microbiome to sort of change over so you can you can try you know sort of pulling back on it and see how you feel and see if that changes your stools also remember that there are other things and this is this is only advised for people only eating meat only drinking water nothing else goes in into their mouth and down their their stomach right so things like coffee tea artificial sweeteners like you Stevia monk root sugar even um and everything else um supplements such as magnesium medications many medications but specifically things like meformin which is used for diabetes all of these things can cause diarrhea they don't normally cause it as much when you're eating a whole bunch of fiber because it just clogs up your pipes you know the fiber just gets there a whole bunch of bulk that you have to sort of move through maybe that's actually helpful in that situation because it keeps things moving doesn't get all cramped up but if you're not eating fiber then it just shoots through you so it's much more much more effective as a laxative when you're when you're not eating fiber when you're only eating fatty meat so think about those things as well if you have any of those in your diets come out and then start adjusting your fat if you're eating so little fat that your body starts getting actually so constipated that you actually get pseudo obstruction and liquid stools are the one thing they can't push it down more they just float around it and squirt around it you'll get liquid diarrhea and every now and then you'll get a hard Rocky Boulder that is very hard to pass and then you get more liquid diarrhea if that happens that means you're so you're so con you're so constipated you're you're basically taking such a low amount of fat that you're very very constipated and you need to dramatically increase the amount of fat that you're eating so that's what I would do um you know it's not you're not sick there's not a problem it's just inconvenient when you have this sort of thing some of it can be die off and other times it's just the fat or or these little supplements and coffee I only have one coffee a day okay it's enough and so people say well I've I've always had that I've actually cut down the coffee right but you also cut out other things that are going to block you up more like f so I would just uh try to get cut out everything that you can cut out and then play with the fat content and you know fat that you're eating to see to see how that affects things and then otherwise it's just a bit of time to let the microbiome change over but four weeks is usually enough and so that doesn't if that doesn't settle down on its own and I would I would address t he other things as well"

    "body": "Abel says hi Dr chaffy I've been eating zero grain 100% grass-fed RI eyes for two weeks fat caps are hard to chew and rubbery is there a prep or is the me too young trying to up fat is butter okay to Double Down Butter's fine for most people especially grass-fed butter some people have a bit of an issue with it usually with autoimmune issues but then again a lot of people with autoimmune issues do just fine with with butter as well just sort of a bit of a self-experiment to see if that's fine with you yeah you know the thing with you know 100% grass-fed tows is that they don't have as much marbling and they can be a bit more chewy as well um it's a good solution for this I mean usually RI eyes are pretty pretty good so yeah could be have to do with the the age of the cow I mean some people think that the older the cow the more tough it is I didn't find that at all I got a 10-year-old cow I thought it was amazing gristle was tough that was like some of this stuff was like tendons would go through it was like a chunk of whalebone or something like I didn't know what that was coming from but you know what it was really easy just to pluck that right out and then you didn't need to worry about it so I mean some people tenderize it you know you just get like those little spiky press things that it can s sort pop through there and cut up the the fibrous tissue and that can make it a bit more tender um and then you can also I mean you just tenderize me you sort of smash it with a tenderizing hammer and just beat the hell out of it and that sort of breaks up those those fibers another thing that people do is you cut diagonally across the grains and so if you have you you have a steak and the grains are that long because they're up and down well that's you're chewing on that and you're trying to break that up with your teeth whereas if you cut it diagonally now it's half right you're just dealing with half the amount of fiber and actually makes it easier to chew easier to break up easier to swallow so those are a couple tricks do sort of the little puncture sort of tenderizing or you can do the you know cutting diagonally or both do both to those so uh and yes you can you can absolutely add butter you know the the thing with grass-fed and finish is that they don't have as much intramuscular fat that which is good I mean that's pathological it's called myosteatosis so that marbling is something we see in humans as well when you look at at MRIs that there is that fat in the muscles and that's pathological that should not be there and so you know that means that you know shouldn't be there in a cow either necessarily some some breeds actually have a bit more marbling than others but if it's not if it doesn't have it naturally on grass then it you know it's it's pathologic and but that means that there's aren't isn't a lot of fat in the meat itself usually it's only outside like a subcutaneous fat in between the muscle bodies and that's what the The Butchers always trim off because that's the you know that's the fashion at the moment that's the market because you want all the fat taken away don't let them do that you talk your busher say I want all the fat I don't want you to trim the fat off of that it's really important especially with the grass-fed stuff I mean that's that's the big reason to get grass-fed beef is you want the fat you want the grass-fed fat because that's where you're going to get more Omega-3s you're going to get a DHA and EPA and and the other you know fat soluble vitamins that are really really good for you they really come with with grass-fed grain finish grain fed isn't great you're you're going to lose a lot of those nutrients because they get the nutrients from the food as well and those nutrients aren't in grains that's why you shouldn't eat gr and you shouldn't eat um cows that don't have the correct nutrients in them so you want the fat and so you ask them basically give me all the fat if you get like a side of beef or a quarter cow or a whole cow tell them I don't want you to throw away any fat leave on as much fat on the roast and the steaks as you can and then anything you do trim off just put that in the ground beef I want all I want all of the fat and um that'll be much better for you so yes you can add grass-fed butter but you can also tell them don't trim the fat off or and and give me the grass-fed fat trimming can't that's a really g ood option too"

    "body": "how to lower ketones if too high on Carnivore I I don't actually know that that's a thing you know if you go into some State keto acidosis and you don't have any insulin then your keton will get extraordinarily High and um and your glucose will also get extraordinarily high and you'll start getting dehydrated because you're just peeing like crazy because your body is just losing so much water because you're peing out all this glucose that's you know when you when you go to a hospital at that point you know the treatment is not to hey let's lower these ketones it's hydrate the hell out of the person and give them insulin right um you're not going to get to that state if you have insulin you're just not so I wouldn't worry about that it's you're you're not going to get into a state of Keto acidosis just by doing a carnivore diet um first and foremost because this is just how we're designed to eat any way even even type one diabetics back in the 1800s the the treatment for that before we had insulin was putting them on a ketogenic diet or even just fasting that was that was the only thing that could prolong life at the time they they sort of all died any way but that was the only thing that would prolong life and so very serious very very serious ious issue obviously um you know if it's if it's early enough and you catch it early enough there there's some who think that you may be able to stop the autoimmune process and you might actually salvage some of the pancreas the BET eyelet cells in the pancreas that make insulin and and then you sort of weather it and get through it but you'd have to get on onto a ketogenic diet right away really carb diet right away fasting right away and and then it's roll roll of the dice as well so I don't think you're going to get to a point with ketones if you have insulin that you need to lower your ketones if you get to a point where you're getting sort of Keto acidosis you're thinking you have uh type one you're maybe developing type one diabetes you need to get to a hospital you need to get on fluids and you need to get um insulin that's pretty much it so other than that you're not going to get ketones High to to a point of harming you that I would say and also the longer you go on a carnivore die ketogenic die your body actually gets more efficient at using ketones and it's starts making the appropriate amount of ketones and you start using them more efficiently so your Ketone levels actually actually lower so people are long-term ketosis the Inuits say wow their Ketone levels are so low they're not in ketosis where they getting their carbs from where are they getting their ketones from making it they're just using it right away and so you know they're still in that metabolic state which is the important thing one thing isn't necessarily massively elevated ketones is being in the metabolic state with low insulin where you can make blood sugar carbohydrates Clin and ketones and thousand other internal workings of your biochemistry that that are that are opened up and brought about just by being in a state of ketosis right regardless of how massively elevated your ketones are or are not so I wouldn't worry too much about that the longer you go with this your ketones will likely just come down to pretty pretty low constant level that's fine you're it's the metabolic state that we're after not necessarily massively elevated ketones if you have cancer and you're tracking your gki your glucose Ketone index as a product your ketones as a product of your uh glucose that's different but for everybody else you don't need to worry about that"

    "body": "Member says strict line diet saved my life that's really good to hear I haven't really heard you talk about bone broth I drank super high fat bone broth I still have some dry skin on the face and issues with that could that be the problem potentially it depends on are you making it yourself or you getting from the store and it's just you're looking at the ingredients it's like well looks like it's just bone broth you stock and salt or something like that maybe there's something in there that you're reacting to who knows um if you're making it yourself you know maybe not you know some dry skin rashes you know those sorts of things maybe things something that you're reacting to um but it could also be different products that you're using are you using soaps on your face you washing your face are you are you putting Tallow back on are you using other sorts of products that might be interfering and and causing issues as well um easy way to check is just cut out bone broth for a couple weeks see how it affects your skin it's um some people may react strangely to bone broth other people won't I've never heard of people reacting negatively to bone broth if they make it themselves and it's just bones and meat but if you are you are and so it's really easy to test you just you know cut it out for a couple weeks and then and then that's it and you just keep going and you see uh how it affects you so that's what I would do just cut it off for two to four weeks you know 30 days is a good measure you just cut it out for 30 days and see how your Skin's doing and you can add it back in if you if you think everything's fine if it flares up it's like okay well maybe maybe I just cut up the B problem and and dry skin in general can be from products that you're putting on your skin often and also not getting enough fat in general saying fatty bone broth but is everything else you're eating that to as well and then hydration you know just so try to address all those things and um and then try if that doesn't address it you eliminate it out for two weeks or a month and see how you go"

    "body": "Member says how best to approach carnivore with symptomatic gall stones I don't want to lose gallbladder well you know sometimes you know the horse can Bolt from the barn and it's sort of too late you know you have to just sort of deal with that um I would not suggest avoiding a carnivore diet I would not suggest avoiding fat because if you avoid fat then that's just going to stay static and you're going to build up more and more bile it's going to get more and more concentrated those stones are going to grow and then you will have a problem you know they're they're too big to pass normally or to break down on their own that's it that's surgery time and one of those may get stuck you may have major problems so there are people that have symptomatic gall stones and go on a carnivore diet and it alleviates their symptoms and they have no problems and I ask you have you gotten a scan since then have the has it cleared the gall stones they all say like never cared to because my symptoms are gone why why do I need to check it yeah it really is academic at that point you know like I was saying you know earlier like if it if it helps your arthritis and you don't need a Jo replacement like do you need to scan it to see that you still have arthritis like probably do just you're not having the symptoms it doesn't matter one way or the other because you're not treating the scan you're treating this the problem you know the problem is in that case with with arthritis pain and so if you're not having problems with the G not getting pain you're not getting instructed doesn't matter if they're still there I would be interested in that because I want to know I want to know what this does I would I would imagine that it it does make them go away you know either if they're small enough that they can pass out they can just sort of be expressed out when a gallbladder squeezes and expresses out B you can absorb fat that some of those little Stones go with it and you eventually just all these little suers out of there or maybe they're just you know less lower concentrated bile solution they just start to dissolve into that solution that would be great but it's hard to tell we don't really know I would I would still eat this way if you are eating fat you're at Le G to be moving that bile moving that b and you might be passing these things if they're big enough and they get stuck somewhere you you're going to need you're going to need a procedure if you get stuck in the common bile duct there's called ercp where they go snake a you know camera down your throat snake up there and try to SN snatch that that stone out of there and that's really important you mean you have to you have to unblock that tube there a lot of tubes in the body and one of the major jobs that doctors have is just like a like any good plumber just keeping those tubes unblocked and that's what um that's actually what a professor of anatomy Dr Thomas frell said in um in medical school is that is that doctors basically body is a system of tubes and the doctor's job is just to keep those tubes moving and unblock them when they get blocked and so he said that we're like plumbers who get paid less just don't get paid as much and um so that's same idea so you just you get that to blocked you need it unblocked and so hopefully that doesn't happen but if you already have gall stones you may have sort of caught it a bit too late but I think that not eating carnal not eating fat you're just now you're you're delaying the inevitable at that point because you're just you're if you're not eating fat the bottle's going to stay there it gets squeezed out if you eat fat it's designed to absorb fat and so the worst thing you can do is just not eat fat because just stays there stays there stays there and just turns into brick it just starts turning into it just gets more and more concentrated more and more concentrated just turns into more Stones so you're going to get more Stones if you don't eat fat so Catch 22 you know if you don't eat fat this is going to get worse if you do eat fat this is going to squirt these things out one of those stones might get stuck but the longer you wait the more likely that is so that's what I would suggest but I would be very cognizant of this because some could get stuck and you may need to get you know to to get into the to the doctor straight away because that that can be a problem so you may not be able to avoid this if you do lose your gallbladder in the end you can still do carnivore liver is still making bile just as not going to be stored in the gallbladder it's going to drip out constantly so you just need to eat the same amount of fatty meat you just need to split it up over the day because you're you're going to have to just sort of catch the bile as it's coming out of your of your liver and into your intestine a lot of people form what called a pseudo gallbladder eventually and this is an outpouching a common bot duct which works just like a gallbladder and so that can still you know act the same way so you can go back eating a big fatty meal and not having your diarrhea as well so good luck with that hopefully you know you just you just do it and it and it never causes your problem again that's ideal"

    "body": "Member says steroid hormone binding globulin and lowered free testosterone I've been seeing more and more on this as it relates to a carnivore diet I feel great so far but the prospect of lower testosterone is terrifying any help I've literally never seen that I've never seen that um I know people talk about it I've I've never seen in practice haven't seen it myself certainly I haven't seen any of my patients and this I'm in a practice that we check these hormones all the time and so we check them before and we say hey these are the lifestyle recommendations that and diet that I would recommend and we try to get you on the plan and if they go for it great if they don't we need find something that will work for them and the ones that are able to do this or even just just Chang you know I had a kid he was you know he his doctors was basically thinking he had primary testicular failure because he was 20 and his testosterone was way way way low I mean just ridiculously low and um know even for their scale which is way too low you know the the normal reference range was way way lower than that and you know what two months on a carnivore diet six weeks two months and and he wasn't even in his mom was like telling me that he wasn't he was like he's not really staying on this like eating more meat and that's great but he eats other stuff too he's not really sticking to it very well and all that sort of stuff and he came in said the same thing but he was even a lot more meat and he just wasn't wasn't wasn't as strict as as maybe he could have been and yet his testosterone still doubled in that time so I've never seen that you know there's a lot of lot of biochemical physiological reasons why that shouldn't happen you know when you get rid of carbohydrates and Insulin your testosterone should go up ferment actually comes down women estrogen goes up and growth hormone goes up in both cortisol goes down in both so um if it's elevated you know obviously if people have metabolic syndrome that can that can actually suppress your cortisol and that can actually come up slightly if people oh my gosh cortisol is going up this is a stress State that's this is your primary State the insulin driven State that's a stress State you are definitely stressing your body there that's that's not what your body is accustomed to is designed for so I've never seen that uh I have seen people's total testosterone go up pre testosterone go up and the steroid hormone binding globuline can sort of we and down for various reasons I've certainly seen it go the other way where someone's total testosterone went up a bit but their steroid hom biing globulin went down significantly and their free testosterone you know goes up massively so i' I've really just not seen that you know there's some people that talk about oh my gosh your testosterone goes down it's like okay well you know they're talking about in themselves and it's like okay well you're one person and is that the only thing that's going on and also what else are you doing you know a lot of these people were eating the ones that I've seen speak about it were the ones that you just but load of liver and organs and things like that well too much of a good thing is a bad thing and too much vitamin A can disrupt your hormones such as your thyroid that's another that's another common one gets maligned is that oh your thyroids got box exactly the opposite I see exactly the opposite in practice I see thyroid function improved dramatically people hashimotos disease Graves disease that actually puts these things into remission quite often and so that's H it's just exactly the opposite of what I see in in real world cases and the know vitamin A you know just too much vitamin A actually suppresses thyroid stimulating hormone so that that's a known consequence of having too much vitamin A and you don't need massively elevated amounts you just need a bit more than your body needs and that just starts to you know start starts putting stress on the system so I have I have yet to see that I doubt I'll ever see that there are other things to stress sleep these things can affect your testosterone most certainly and and the other thing too is that depending on when you your testosterone levels and how you take them you'll get dramatically different results your testosterone boom you get a big dose of that first thing in the morning and then it starts coming down over the day but it's doing its thing it's it's giving the signals that it needs it's turning on the genes that it needs it's stimulating the protein synthesis that it's designed to do and then it levels just go down but the effects of the testosterone are long lasting so you get it tested first thing in the morning it'll be one thing you get it checked from the late morning it'll be lower get checked in the afternoon it'll be a lot lower you get it checked in the evening even lower so it depends on when you're doing that if you have sex if you exercise intently if you are stressed out and get Contract you freak out at somebody who just cut you off you will affect your testosterone levels so even just hydration World matter and uh fasting can even matter how long you fasting all these sorts of things that could affect this so you need to take things consistently first thing in the morning between 8 and 9:00 a.m. fasting from 9:00 p.m. the night before only water after that at least two 8 oun glasses of water an hour or two before you take blood test no more than four glasses of of water at 8 ounces in the morning don't take any pills supplements don't take anything with biotin that's B vitamin and that can disrupt many tests and um you so don't take those for a few days before you you take any blood test really because you it can affect a lot of things and uh you know don't smoke or have coffee or anything like that just just just wait until after you get the blood test done and no sex or exercise the morning of or the day before and just be very sedentary and relaxed for a few days try to get proper sleep and uh this all matters this all makes a big difference and so um you know when people do this in a consistent manner I only see for for men I only see their testosterone going up I see men in their 60s and 70s come off of testosterone replacement therapy because they don't need it anymore and they feel amazing their levels are going too high so you you take them off of that and all of a sudden they actually have a rebounding effect because now their bodies are making the stuff and you've actually rested the organ for a while and actually can make testosterone a little better now and people have this big jump in their testosterone after coming off you know testosterone replacement therapy obviously there's going to be a bit of a dip at first but then your body rebound is able to make make a much better have a much better sort of physiological response so um that's a rumor that's running around I've literally never seen that in my life I've certainly never experienced it you know you see a lot of people in their 20s 30s 40s 50s you know athletes that I work with you know have literally doubled their testosterone as an elite world class athlete and they double their testosterone on top of that I mean imagine what that does to performance to the point that they're getting drug tested because they're like your testosterone just shouldn't jump like that it's like okay well it did because of this you know radical diet change so no I I don't see that and I wouldn't worry about that in fact you'll get the opposite and he does and you know look at Sean Baker guy's jacked and he's you know breaking World Records you know left right and center and he you know he put out his testosterone levels and they were they were fine I me they're not like you know atrociously High you know like a teenager or something like that but he's not a teenager and uh he's he's jacked he's getting everything done he's he's you working out like a boss he's developing muscle he's just getting more and more muscular the more he works out you know what's the problem he's clearly not testosterone deficient and also you get more efficient at using testosterone because your testosterone receptors go up so you don't need as much testosterone even when your testosterone receptors go up because you get you get the more effect when you have more receptors so um we get more of an effect with testosterone receptors being up and so even with less testosterone you may have this a similar effect if you have more receptors and less testosterone you can still get the same physiological effect so there's a lot that goes into this but um that's another thing really just uh just eat meat drink water have some organs every now and then but just don't go crazy just don't don't have too much of these things and um and then work out lift weights and then take your your blood tests in a reasonable manner at the same time consistent Manner and and you'll be fine"

    "body": "good day doc I'm sure it's been talked to death but after reading outlived by Dr AA he mentions the danger of Appo and how the L LDL isn't dangerous but how the carriers cause plaque I mean I don't know why he's saying that because there is there saying cause because there are no causitive studies there none there are no studies to show causation between apple b or any other factor in cholesterol and atherosclerosis so um Apple also how do you measure this you're measuring Apple so you Apple 100 molecule on L um can be damaged through glycation so that's really the problem there isn't it the glycation you have the glucose molecules physically fusing to LDL and knocks off that Appo b00 can't be recognized by the liver and now it's just getting running around and get sucked up by these macrophases but they scavenge your receptors on your macrophases big and those those are called foam cells so that's releasing apple b00 or termed apple b and so that's that's free Apple B in your in your serum but the problem is is that you can't that test doesn't actually distinguish between appleb that's free floating and damaged and the ones that's just on these health healthy carrier molecules so what it which is right and also is it the apple b that's causing the problem is it that free Apple B that's causing the problem or the sdldl that's causing the problem um this is sort of a damaged glycation end product if you will is that causing the problem or is it the glycation that's causing that to get elevated causing other problems right because even sdldl only has a weak association with heart disease it's like 70% increased risk if you have high SD LDL which you shouldn't you should not have that if you're eating a normal diet if you're eating a carnivore diet you won't have unless you're very highly stressed not getting good sleep things like that there are other factors but that's a major one and so metabolic syndrome is 600% increased risk so that's a much bigger risk right and one of the factors for metabolic for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is low HDL and high triglycerides well you get the opposite of that on a carnivore diet on high high fat carnivore diet right so that's actually improving your metabolic function right and you actually improve your St your s will go down as well and then diabetes is is a th% increased risk Association right that's up there with smoking and so the cholesterol part of that is actually very weak Association and so it's a much stronger Association much stronger relative risk as it as these things can be Quantified because you can't really quantify risk without experimental data which we just don't have this is all associative studies which he knows I mean he knows I know he knows you know but I've seen him talk about like well if you understand statistics and Mathematics and you know that LDL is causative to atherosclerosis it's like no no if you understand statistics and Mathematics you know that that's not the case because you can only show causation with certain studies with experimental trials and then you know how how welld designed was the study how you know how closely can we extrapolate this to the real you know general population you know because experiments are not real life right so they they may not actually be uh able you may not be able to extrapolate you know much out of them and so uh I would watch a video by Dr Paul Mason uh who's buddy of mine man's brilliant a guy just he he only works four days a week because he take he wants to spend an entire day reading studies you know this guy is like you will not find anyone else more well versed in the literature than this guy it's just amazing um how how interested he is fascinated he is you know by this whole you know subject of medicine and human health and Physiology like he's just f fated by it he just he just wants to learn as much as he can he's just very interested so watch that is a Quick Clip it's like less than five minutes on Apple B and it just tells you how basically that's a pretty useless uh marker you because you don't know what you're getting you don't know if it's the the free floating damaged epob that's been torn off the LDL or if it's the LDL on the on the healthy molecules that's not going to cause a problem so um I watch that again cholesterol was never the problem it was a scapegoat by the sugar companies why are we still banging this drum why are we still beating this dead horse this has been proven conclusively with their own data their own internal memos showing hey we're gonna pay these people off to say that cholesterol caused heart disease because it's probably sugar and people are on to us so we need to we need to throw the scent off the trip this is this has been long recorded you know this is not a this is not a a debate this is this is a matter of record they did that that happened and so you have to just throw it all out cholesterol was never the problem their own study showed a reverse inverse association between cholesterol LDL cholesterol and and total cholesterol and um cardiovascular disease and risk so what are we doing here like there's no association there's actually an inverse Association in in many trials including randomized control trials where they they give people saturated vegetable oils and replacing out the saturated fats to lower the LDL cholesterol and see what happens and yes indeed you know they lowered saturated fat and they lowered LDL cholesterol and what happened more people died of heart attacks and strokes so bad outcome you know so that's not what I want to do I don't want to lower my LDL I want to leave it just the hell alone and so it can do what it's supposed to do uh it's a molecule that's that's important for your body and it's there for a reason and so I'll just let it be as long as you're not damaging it and getting the consequence of that damage to other parts of your body you'll be fine"

    "body": "Member says uh carnivore is protective against many cancers is it protective against melanoma and other skin cancers potentially I mean there there are more well I mean the studies are in ketogenic diets you we haven't had studies in carnivore diets except for population statistics on carnivorous populations of humans such as the innu who had extraordinarily low cancer rates if any right so Professor V Homer stefanson of Harvard uh lived with the Inuit for over a decade about 12 years learn their language learn their culture and um and there in the early 1900s and and he wrote a book called St of the land saying hey we should all be eating like this we should all be eating meat this is the healthiest way to go this is what we're designed for and also looking at um other things we wrote other books and one of them um if I if I get the name slightly wrong I apologize but it was it was something to the effect of is cancer a disease of civilization or I think it's he was asking is disease a cancer civilization because you just don't see cancers in these populations oh well that's because they die when they're 30 no they don't that's stupid that's an average life expectancy from birth that does not tell you how long people live if they died of old age right so of course there were people that were older a lot older in fact in the in your a tradition if you got old to the point that you wore out your teeth first of all they didn't have dentists they didn't get cavities they just they actually they're chewing on on leather and skins and things like that to sort of you know get them usable as leathers and blankets and things and um we're not rodents so we don't regrow our teeth you're you're going to wear these down eventually so they get to the point they wear down their teeth they can't even chew their leather it's just like okay I'm not pulling my weight here I can't even eat and so I'm just gonna I'm just going to walk outside and let polar bears have mean that's that's that's a tradition in the in uh population when you're especially in the extremes of the north you know when you you just can't you cannot have dead weight hanging around and so what does that mean that means people are not dying in their 30s that means they're they're living extraordinarily long times and they're either being killed by something because INF mortality rates when you're deep in the tundra without a hospital or modern medicine it's High funny turns out that uh that mortality tends to be high in those conditions and uh but they aren't actually dying of old age they're they're killing themselves right so um you no so that's not the case so you know we just don't see this stuff and and as the 20th century progress and the in population became more involved in Western society and eating Western food their cancer rates just slowly but surely started increasing and increasing and increasing and so that's something that that you see and so from that that sort of information you know you can get you can get some decent information now um as far as you know melanoma and other skin cancers I don't know specifically I don't know any specific studies that go into that there are studies with certainly ketogenic diet ketogenic met therapy helping a lot of cancers and if you understand cancer biology and how they're fed with sugar that's you know something good to know about and also being in ketosis is going to help protect your mitochondria keep them healthy and safe and Hallmark of cancer is that they have damaged unhealthy mitochondria and so if you're keeping them healthy the whole time and they're turning over the old ones and replacing them out uh when they need to be replaced then you're probably not going to get into a situation and get cancer at all also remember that as sun exposure has gone down over the 20th century skin Cancers and melanomas have gone up so obviously it's not one toone sun exposure there's something else going on there and there are people there are traditional Muslims in in the Middle East they're where you know the traditional garb there they are not exposing themselves to the sun they're getting uh they're getting melanomas on their on their private areas that are likely never seeing the light of day let alone direct sunlight and so what's happening there we we people with melanomas metastases in their brain and we can't find a primary anywhere on their skin which well they have to have it obviously melanoma comes from melanin in the skin and then it goes somewhere else well maybe and maybe it's just so small that you can't find it but it is interesting that that um I've seen a number of people present their first sign of melanoma is a headful of tors and you know you can't find a primary so it's interesting but it's certainly not directly one to one with the sun it's actually inversely related to that and so there's probably a lot of other things going on we're EA a lot of things that are damaging to our mitochondria dam damaging to us cause cancer I mean that's why I stopped eating plants 23 years ago as my cancer biology professor at one of the top institutions in America certainly for uh biology and medical Sciences it's the number one rated medical school in the country University of Washington in Seattle and it's it's up there tied with John's Hopkins or or above John's Hopkins each and every year um for training for I think it's for training for primary carees how they they market and then um and then research har it's number one for research but university of Washington is like number six for research or at least it was when I was when I was um um back in the 2000s like 2010 or so that was last time I sort of checked top institution and my cancer biology Professor told me Point Blank that you know plants are toxic they have all these poisons in there they are not trying to be eaten they will kill you if they have to and and a lot of these toxins are carcinogenic and that's why I stopped I stopped eating them so you're gonna get rid of a lot of things that could be potentially harmful and you are going to just let your body work normally animals in the wild really don't get cancer animals in the zoo being fed their natural diet don't let  trick you and say oh look at this study it shows that you know these people or these animals get you know different illnesses and Cancers EXT extraordinarily low rates and also they don't control for the fact of what they're being fed are they being fed oh well presumably no F presumably that's that's and you and you know it you know and um you know so so you're just trying to people um if it doesn't say that then it's not controlled for that and you don't know what they're being fed and so obviously they're being fed something else right so you can't but otherwise animals just don't get it the rates of cancer dogs and cats going up and other sort of human diseases is going up well this is because we're aggressively breeding these things if you understand population genetics you Harvey wienberg equation you know that that can't happen um not like that not in that short amount of time but also why would just breeding pure breed like a golden retriever over and over and over again all of a sudden start getting non-communicable chronic diseases like diabetes heart disease cancer autoimmune disease the exact same things that we're that we're getting are we getting these because we're intensively in breeding no you get genetically recessive double recessive um genetic problems that's what you get so is diabetes a double recessive genetic issue is autoimmunity is heart disease is cancer no so they're getting exposed we're getting exposed to something in our environment that's precipitating these things and now they're getting exposed to these things and we're that's that's that's just from this intensive breeding program nonsense that would mean that it would be for us too it's the same diseases right so um yeah so that's sort of a lot more needed for that question but ca ncer is a big subject"

starting keep so ketovore for four years mostly eating meat cholesterol 399 LDL 294 triglycerides 154 HDL 51 liver scan today show mild fatty liver 67 year old female healthy weight well you know if you if you keep going just carnivore and you eliminate out all these other sorts of things your fatty liver should should improve especially with you know get rid of carbs sugar alcohol these sorts of things seed oils potentially um Can can cause issue as well um some people there's you know recent sort of video talking about how um saturated fat and overfeeding test that saturated fat can be as bad as other things you know as far as causing um fatty liver disease and say with fruit and other things there's similar sort of effects of fatty liver disease and overfeeding okay well why are you overfeeding how about how about when you're not overfeeding how about you're just eating normal amounts and not stuffing your face you know what happens then you know probably a different story very helpful study um but you also need to realize that these These are snapshots in time you know and in order to get a vector and a graph of what's actually happening in your health and to your your markers you need need multiple data points so um I don't know what your Bloods were before they were probably were worse than that you probably would have had more fatty liver you probably would have had higher triglycerides lower HDL and so you know that's something that you you is worth knowing and so you know check these again a couple months see how they go try to clean up your tire really just go red meat and water fatty red meat and water eat until it stops tasting good start exercising try to do anerobic exercise try to do go on to a stationary bike and try to do pedal as hard as you can like a bike Sprint for 30 seconds rest get full rest catch your breath do it again do that 10 times three days a week press resistance exercises failure right push-ups on your knees or with light bands or or whatever is suitable for you body weight squats just standing up out of a chair sitting down standing up sitting down until you just really can't go anymore and then sit down breath catch your breath get on with your day do that three days a week whatever you can do whatever whatever um point that you are at just push yourself and don't hurt yourself you know within reason and um you'll see improvements you will absolutely see improvements of that and you'll see improvements regardless of what your blood say you you'll just feel thousand times better so that's what I would do I would just cut out everything just go red meat and water high fat eat as much as you as you feel comfortable eating as much as tastes good to you and uh start those exercises and I think you'll be I think you'll be fine um you know as The Zeta you know it's not something that I that I really um prescribe it's not really something that that I I would use I don't think you know this is something that's used for um you know cholesterol so it's I like it's um absorption but again I you know this is not this is not a drug that I ever use and and so I don't know all that much about it but I don't I don't think that cholesterol is the problem that we' we've been told that it was and I there's hard evidence for that we actually know that the people coming out with these studies originally were full of crap and they were being paid off and so I just I don't I don't see why we need to lower our cholesterol if cholesterol was never a problem so I I don't personally okay what is the best place to buy meat uh in or around person Western Australia um it depends you know if you want to just go grass-fed and finish or are different specialty butchers you can go to um and there's place called beef shed which is actually great they do bulk and they have a lot of grass-fed and finish as well they just have normal stuff too but it's actually cheap and so I like I like buying in bulk and then cutting up into steaks and things like that myself and they'll cut them for you there too uh they'll cut everything for free which is great and so um that's a good one Costco's great too I do a lot of my shopping at Costco even spudshed spudshed has a lot of good deals on meat and then sometimes you can get a whole like you know New York strip Mo or BH house in Australia um but it's and um you have that whole loin it's like $10 a kilo so it's like that's just dirt cheap and so um that that's a good place to do I think Costco is really good too but they they really like grass bed finish stuff as well but those are the places that that that I would go and those can be very good and and meets he's called like the secret butcher up in Mal something like that um he's a nice guy and he's very carnivore friendly and he's just very friendly he's a nice guy and so I I used to go to him for a while I used to get like specialy ground ground beef so I get like very fatty ground beef he put in sort of one kilo um vacuum steel things I get like five kilos at a time or something like that that's I think that was like the minimum and so those are all great great places to go"

    "body": "Member says been on keto one month carnivore for three days feel good sometimes tired Ketone levels 8 to 16 how to lower them anything else drinking more water I don't think you necessarily need to lower your ketones just being ketosis longer term um will eventually bring that down your body will just get more used to it well it's a matter of of of being fat adapted keto adapted your body gonna start running ketones more you're GNA get more efficient at running on ketones and make sure you're making these ketones and your body's actually using them and so then then that'll come down make sure you're eating enough make sure you're eating enough fat make sure you're drinking enough water and then just keep your body T three days is very early on very early days you know give it a good two weeks or a month before you start um you know before you start seeing seeing more dramatic sort of improvements so I don't think you don't need to I've never checked my ketones I don't think you need to check your ketones unless you have cancer and you need to monitor your gki you there might be a few other isolated reasons to do so but by and large you really don't need to and so I would just I would just eat meat drink water be happy and just enjoy your life and not worry too much about the the micro details"

    "body": "Member says puby and I ate not 100% or not 100% carnivore but have been pretty good that's good have we have both experienced heavy C help generally water generally dehydration you just need to drink a lot more water sometimes it could be you know electrolytes like magnesium most people take a lot of magnesium and they take um they take electrolytes you know like the different supplements don't take any electrolytes that have artificial sweeteners or or sweetener or flavorings they're just they're not good for you don't put them in there doesn't matter if they have carbs or not they're chemicals we're a chemical Factory and you're putting chemicals in your body they're going to have chemical reactions with your body and so that's not what you want if it didn't exist and we weren't eating it 50,000 years ago during an ice age I probably wouldn't eat it now meat that's what we're eating that's what we should eat now um cramping like so so sometimes take these you know supplements and things and electrolytes and they'll still get cramping those clearly not the electrolytes then is it it's almost always dehydration so um whatever amount of water you're drinking drink more and if if you're not finding that's improving things you can try some electrolyte supplements as well and see if that help it's almost always dehydration and you know when you're when you're first starting out um you know changing things around um you can you get fluid balance differences you can also get electrolyte balance differences but you get fluid balance differences as well so you know you do need to get enough water and if you're getting cramping especially like you know nighttime late cramping almost always uh dehydration"

    "body": "Member says uh hey Doc I know it's uh lose lose but what's more harmful out of loads of carbs and sugar for the artificial ingredients in keto type bars uh that are low car love your work do from New Zealand um that's I haven't been to New Zealand since I was 18 loved it absolutely loved it toured around both islands with the the US Junior National Rugby team and just absolutely loved it we were the first we played six game well yeah six games all over the island all over both islands and we ended up in Auckland played at Eden Park which is the all black Stadium there and uh in the Blues we saw Jonah Romo um and the All Blacks play against the Lions when they tour down there and uh we got to meet got to go like a blues practice and meet jono and some the other guys after for practice just the largest human being I've ever met in my life such a nice guy his Cates were like it was like this guy's CS were thicker than my waist you know it's just like she was like I'm I've never seen a larger human being than this and it's just a just a monster and I just couldn't be couldn't have been nicer just such a nice guy such a shame that that man passed away but fantastic fantastic experience love New Zealand um it's hard to say you know I mean one of the one of the good things at least with with the with getting rid of carbs and sugars at least you're in the molic state that you're supposed to be in right I think that I think that's very important this is how harmful carbohydrates are they they fundamentally disrupt and derange your metabolic system right so they put you into entire different entirely different biochemical State that's that's a that's a massive and so if you're EA some of these artificial sweeteners which are not good you know you might at least be in that metabolic state which I think is good so you know and as we know that high insulin levels and high blood sugar levels and being outside of this proper metabolic State causes all lot of metabolic problem I think it is very important to avoid carbon sugar so if you had to I would I would probably side on the artificial sweeteners ver instead of the carbs and sugar but I mean like said it's a lose lose I think they're both awful and you know I mean we don't have much information like oh there's this new one out a r oh that's great you have to keep putting new ones out because the old ones keep getting shown bloody toxic they are and um you I don't want something that's new I want something that's 50,000 years old and has never caused a problem I don't want something that's brand new because you don't have any data you don't have long-term information we don't know we don't know how awful these things are and so could be that they're way way more awful than cars and Sh we don't really know um don't have any data they're new there is a study that I became aware of with stevia equivalent of one diet soda can in mice so equivalent one dioda can for us down to very small can for mice um of stevia was had such a big impact on them that they actually decreased their fertility rate by 55% so we went from 100% the control group had 100% fertility rate and it dropped down to 45% fertility rate in the group it was given just one one equivalent uh portion of stevia a day so that's an animal model you don't know how that translates to humans but it's not good it seems to at least have the potential to disrupt our hormones as well and our fertility what else is it doing so I I don't think it's very good either way again we're not combustion engines and so it doesn't matter about how much heat energy is is produced when when you burn something which is what a calorie is it matter it's a chemical it has chemical reactions in our body Stevia rol you know xylol sorbitol these are all chemicals that are going to have a chemical reaction in our body that is likely going to be negative so I would I would avoid that but if I had to choose um I would still want to be in the biochemical state that we're designed to be in hope that helps and I hope you avoid both regardless"

    "body": "Member says um can you comment on optimizing sleep on a carnivore diet I struggle and no longer want to use Herbal tees like Camile no thanks or supplement s yeah what I think those it's good to avoid um optimizing your sleep optimizing your sleep um you know routine is very important so turning off the lights an hour before you want to be asleep um using blue blocking blue light blocking glasses can be very helpful get away from screens get away from phones get away from computers get away from televisions at least one hour before you want to be asleep that's very important make sure you Le this pitch black want to be a cave even just the light from your phone charging can be enough to disturb your sleep or make you not go to sleep in the first place put on a sleep mask that's just blackout is going to be um very very dark so you want to optimize your sleep routine and start going to sleep at the same time every night uh you can try things like melatonin which is you know a natural hormone that that we make and is actually very important um antioxidant in our brain and so it can help it can help you get to sleep stay asleep and get better rest sleep is not like a you know medication that's going to leave you all groggy and horrible the next day um but if you want to avoid that do all those other things melatonin only works if the lights are off e whether that's melatonin that you take or melatonin that you make it will only work if the lights are off and so even just turning on your lights uh when you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night if you have to wake up to go pee or something that's enough light exposure to drive out all the Melatonin from your brain so you really need to be careful about this it's it's very sensitive to that and yeah that's it and good luck with that hopefully hopefully that helps"

    "body": "Member says I have Gilbert Syndrome it's carnivore safe for me I have been on Carnivore for three weeks and feel great made this change in diet because I have all issues um yeah I think I think we sort of addressed that um before sometimes it just takes me a while to get to these so people redo the questions that's understandable but uh yeah Bruce I I I I don't think there's any problem with um Gilbert Syndrome and carnivore's plenty of people that I know that have Gilbert Syndrome and do carnivore just fine and um so that's not an issue and the main issue is that you feel great which is good so keep going with that and a strict red meat and water is possible for autoimmunity and uh you'll do you'll do as well as you can and hopefully you've already started seeing a lot of benefits and continue to see more and more okay um I'm going to do two more guys and then and then I've got to run vso thank you very much for the chat hi doc I think I'm having gallbladder issues B sludge Etc any advised carnivore for a week now thank you for all you do um well if you have bile Sledge I mean that would that would have been built up over a very long time and you can certainly get problems from that I would imagine that a corn diet will continue to help that if you have pre if you have sort of stones or sludge in there now you're eating more fat you're going to start squeezing your gallbladder to start pushing out bile which is the entire purpose of the gallbladder that what it's there for and so if you're having all this junk in there and squeezing that can cause discomfort so as long as that's just that and you know discomfort and not anything more you're not g jaundice you're not getting you know extraordinary you know Exquisite pain or fevers or anything else like that they would be quite concerning it can just be that this is just a bit uncomfortable hopefully that passes hopefully if it's just sludge it'll just s work that junk out of there dissolve it a bit work it out just smush it out if it if it can and so they just clears it up and so that that would be my guess is what's happening is it just sort of smooshes this out actually gets that bile sludge out of there if there are stones in there and those stones are big enough to get stuck there could be a problem that you would need a surgical intervention for least a procedure you know down the throat up the tubes snake that stone out of there um so be mindful of that you know if you have these pre-existing issues you know you need to be um you need to be you know careful about that you need to sort of you start having like a lot of pain and you start getting like yellowing to the the whites of your eyes that could be that you have a blockage and violence is backing up and you're getting um jaist Andy skin yellow sare up that might be a problem you get checked out especially a lot of pain and so hopefully this just clears and passes but if there's a stone that's big enough and gets caught then you you be in a in a situation that you need to get help with if you don't do it and you don't eat fat then it's just going to get worse it's just going to build up more sludge and more B more cholesterol stones or whatever it's not all cholesterol it's just bit Bales made with cholesterol that's why they say oh you have too much cholesterol it's just all getting stuffed in there like bile is made with cholesterol right so of course there's going to be cholesterol in there it's not because you're eating too much cholesterol it's because vile is made out with cholesterol and so you're going to get these stones in there and you don't eat fat you're just going to build up more and more of that stuff because it's just going to concentrate and and crystallize right like any hyperconcentrated solution to rest it forms stones and precipitate so that's what F sludge is that's all stones are in my opinion and so if you're if you are not clearing that out it's just going to get worse and so hopefully you're not past the point of return where you can just clear this stuff out and then smooth sailing from there but if you're not and be aware of what the warning signs are in case you need to go get help any you know and when when in doubt you know seek help just get it checked out if you sit there for four hours and it turns out to be nothing great it's better than surgery anyway so but at least you didn't uh leave a problem that should have been addressed okay this is going to be be the last one guys thank you so much um for coming on so last question is from Casey aote or aote carnivore for one year plus only beef and some raw milk or kefir still have greasy stools or diarrhea Dairy seems to help but also cause some inflammation allergic ritis thoughts thanks uh well yeah for some for some reason um milk and cause or just dairy in general can can sort of exacerbate constipation which is interesting you know people that that sort of drink more milk or have a lot of cheese and things like that even when they're eating you know meat uh they can get quite constipated I think it's probably because they're not getting enough of fat ratio and there's something else that's that's slowing things down as well there's there's a mild opiate in milk as well it probably gets the cow baby calf you wanting more and more and more and or the baby enamel wanting more and more and more and so you this can slow blow down the peristalsis of your gut as well and if you're not getting enough fat you know if you have enough fat then it's it's fine it's not going to be an issue however slow it goes but it um it can be a problem if you're not getting enough fat and so if you're eating sort of drinking some milk or some cheese which has fat in it but it's not necessarily as fatty as as like steak or or meat U then it can be a problem so after a year on Carnivore if if you are not drinking coffee not drinking tea not taking any artificial sweeteners or non- sugar sweeteners not taking any supplement such as magnesium not taking any medication such as metformin and you're only eating meat and water then it could be that you're just not absorbing all the fat that you're eating just just pull it back if you're getting intermixed if you're intermixing that with hard dry Rocky stools and that can be that you're so you're so so um constipated that you actually get what's called overflow diarrhea and the treatment for that is a lot fat and then things start start moving uh much much better um so if you're if it's just loose stools though greasy loose stools just just you know pull back on on the on meat that you're eating you know maybe you know drop the raw milk in the keeper for a while and and just see how it goes and just just pull back a bit on the on the on the meat you know I talked to some people and they sort are in this sort of situation and and I'm trying to figure this out by a you know from a carnivore solution and then I find out months later that they're taking you know a bunch of energy drinks with artificial sweeteners this just like why didn't you tell me you were thinking that it's oh no I'm only me I'm only me and they just are not thinking that you know anything they put into their body counts and including these you know diet energy drinks with a bunch of artificial sweeteners which are laxative and then all of a sudden they're oh yeah I think that might have might have been it it's like yeah I think I think that might have been it and then they stop it and it goes away so if you're doing anything else putting anything in your body besides meat and water stop it and uh then see how you go and then adjust the fat from there and then you know how much your body wants and then you you add back in things and they start giving you diarrhea or whatever you at least know it's not the fat you just know that it's that other thing and so that's what I would try okay"
