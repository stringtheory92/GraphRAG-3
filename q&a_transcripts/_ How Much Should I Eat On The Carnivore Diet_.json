    "transcript": "so uh Ellie says uh when you can't or don't eat um but you're hungry how long would it be before your body thinks um it's a famine and slows down the metabolism thanks again um it it would take a while you know if you if you've been you know just eating consistently um you know your body's going to and you miss a meal I mean that that's pretty that's pretty common for animals to miss a meal in in the wild and so um um you know so that we're well used to that it's it's going to be the prolonged you know you know day after day after day after day of of getting less than your body requires that your your body's going to say like oh okay we need to shut this down you if you look at like the Minnesota starvation studies um by our good friend the uh evil um the sort of the the the the mad scientist anel keys um they starved the hell out of these people to see what it' be like to if we everyone had to be on rationing or concentration camps and things like that and um and they lost you know a lot of weight at first but then it plateaued and then they didn't really lose much weight at all even though we're basically eating nothing um you know very very um very very small amounts of food so um you know it does it does take some time but then goes down slows down it stays down and then when you start eating again it it um you you will put on fat because your body's saying we need to store this we need to survive because maybe we got a cash of food now but doesn't mean we're out of the famine we're not necessarily getting consistent meals we're not necessarily going to get consistent meals and so it needs to needs to uh protect you so that you can survive I I don't promote fasting in people I have seen people that use a carnivore diet and um you know if they want to sort of help accelerate fat loss or when they're getting R for like a competition or something like that they may fast one day a week otherwise you're doing like sort of intermittent one meal a day and um but i' actually seen a lot of people that said that if they stretch that out to two days or do two days a week separated by a few days that actually can actually slow down weight loss and you start seeing that metabolism start coming down they start getting uh eating they eating less or actually losing less too and they might actually start going back the other way so just be mindful of that um you know if you if you skip a meal out of out of necessity you're just traveling and there's nothing good to eat I mean it's better to not eat than than eat something bad for you I think unless you're actually starving but none of us are uh and so you know skipping a meal or skipping a day of meals you know your body can handle that it's not going to cause too much of a problem and then you you'll sort of get back into the routine and your body will be fine you know even if you even if you fast for a few days for whatever reason you know someone's treating cancer or other sort of medical issue and they want to do a medical fast then you know great um you know do that but um uh your body will sort of recover you might put on a bit of fat and sort of stabilize and all that sort of stuff when you're when you have a Cancer and you're fasting you need refeeds like you don't want to lose too much weight um you want to you want to maintain healthy weight so um you know it takes a bit a bit of time but you know if you're you just skip a meal or a day or two you know you shouldn't you shouldn't do that and your body will recover and metabolism will go back up you know within a few days or a week anyway so it should be fine it's just those prolonged uh periods of of chronically undereating that that's the problem this is a chat from Ellie Melly thank you very much for saying hi says I'm I'm here just got on um yes my period pain went away so it's in refer reference to asked uh one of those last questions the period pain went away I also have the copper coil for contraception and it's meant uh to make period pain very bad um but don't get it all anymore yeah so that's actually a good point is that um those sorts of iuds are are typically make things much more painful and um and and more uncomfortable so it's uh uh you know if that's that's getting rid of that sort of increased pain then that's a really good sign as well um I'm going to see there's actually quite a lot of questions so this from Lena um thank you for the Super Chat best fat to protein percentage for fat loss and better sleep is that 8020 well it depends again like going back to what I said before it's uh getting enough so enough fat enough protein and that's going to stimulate your body to say hey we're not in a famine we'll just uh we'll just let this let this go um so I think that you just want to you for a lot of people that's 8020 but it's not about it's not about the ratio it's about just getting enough um so you know it's um just be mindful of that that um that it could be different for you but a lot of people yeah 8020 is is good or 7030 is also good you're aiming in between that and just make sure you're getting enough fat for your body and you're just eating until fatty meat stops tasting good and whatever that shakes out to be is is fine for you um okay so it's from Daniel um Selenas thank you for the Super Chat benefits of carnivore um on narcolepsy so that's a good question there are a couple people that have said they've actually recovered from narcolepsy which is pretty wild I've had um a couple of them on my podcast I'm pretty sure Rebecca heishman um had narcolepsy and that's actually recovered so you can check out that interview I'm pretty sure that she did and I've seen a couple other people too which is pretty wild um because my cousin had narcolepsy and so it's um it's not it's not fun it's not a fun fun condition to have and so I think you know he was able to treat that with medication uh that just makes it forces you to sleep and so because a lot of it's it's sort of insomnia you but your brain can't tell you you know sort of get tired it's almost like a superpower you just don't get tired and you just don't feel it so you just keep going going going until your body just goes no we're not doing this anymore and your brain just shuts off and you just pass out so it's uh it's it's sort of in extreme insomnia and so what taking these medications do is just forces you to go to sleep and then you um you at least get you can at least regulate that so you're not just going to go like nope too far and knock out right um so at least some people have improved that anyway and so hopefully that that uh is the case for you as well I was just going to say everyone there's actually a lot of super chats poured in uh as I was going through sort of last week's um but I do have some appointments this afternoon so maybe we'll just go ahead and stop the super chats now anyway and um and try to get through as many of these as we can as well so we don't have this spillover effect for for next time as well um Stacks thank for thanks for the Super Chat how do I know uh my protein to Fat ratio uh if I'm fat adapted and why don't I get symptoms of meat not tasting good no matter how much I eat I only get full I want to lean up do I reduce fat uh and eat lean no I don't think you need to reduce fat I I think that's actually detrimental um you know you want to get the majority of your energy from fat because when you start running on on protein it's it's not uh it's not good so um what you know the thing is is that it's that um if you're only eating meat and only drinking water then eventually it would stop tasting good if you're if you're sort of getting to the point where you sort of feel full but you still happy to eat it um if you're not eating anything else there's nothing else complicating it on any medications that could increase your your hunger and things like that you know sometimes you get full you know and and sometimes you get full because you're eating more lean sometimes eating more fat actually can increase the amount of of energy and and um nutrients that you're getting in and your body gets much more satiated much more quickly on a higher fat version of that and then maybe you just need to eat more than once maybe your body wants you to eat more than once a day and um that's fine too you know so I I get that where where I I just sort of eat until my body's just like yep no that's that's as much as we've got room for and um but it's not enough for for me for what I'm doing and so my body wants me to eat another time too so I end up eating more than once a day when that happens um so I I think you just listen to your body and if you need to eat more than once a day eat more than once a day I if anything I would increase the fat not reduce it um because if you're reducing the fat if you're eating more lean um you know it's not it's it's it's [Music] um um you know it's going to sort of change that actually not taste good but you're still hungry and your body's still telling you to eat and all that sort of stuff um you know you're sort of getting it it sort of the other way around but um you know you're not yeah you're saying that that why don't I get symptoms of meat not tasting good no matter how much I eat I just get full um you know I just it could just be that your body wants more nutrients and so you know you want to sort of eat more and um but if your body's getting physically full could be that could be that it's um that you're not getting all the the meat that that you want because it's not as you're not getting the right proportions of things you can also add in things that are more nutrient dense like a bit of liver kidney and heart and that has a lot of nutrients because your body's chasing nutrients it's not chasing calories so we get more nutrient DSE stuff typically that's more satiating as well so you can try all those little things but I just I would still eat what your body's asking you to eat uh Gunther SB thank you for the Super Chat I've never done a ketogenic diet I eat 80 to 90 grams of carbs per day can I start the lion diet with two to1 fat to protein ratio and grams cold turkey yeah you absolutely can a lot of people do probably easiest to do that because you you sort of strike while the iron's hot and you just sort of get into it if um you know there's some people that that like to transition um that's just more of a a personal preference sort of thing and you could do that 890 grams isn't all that much so you know dropping the rest of that probably would be fine uh I don't I don't see any problem with that there a lot of people that eat a lot more carbs than that a day and go cold turkey so um you should be fine you know and uh but if you feel better you know reducing it more slowly you know go ahead and do that a lot of people do it just cold turkey though and the you're just fine with it so good luck with that I'm glad you're going to give it a try uh Co D thank you for the Super Chat I've been carnivore for about four months now lately I've been having intermittent kidney pain a caffeine tablet once daily uh could this be causing it you never know possibly you always just try cutting it out drinking more water um it's hard to tell if it's kidney pain kidney pain you know it could just be pain sort of in that area sort of under your ribs could be muscular pain could be sort of you know you know ceral kritis sort of pain you know pain in your ribs pain in the in the in the cartilage or the joints with your ribs those sorts of things um hard to say is actually your kidneys if it is you try cutting out the caffeine you can try increasing water and see how you go um you know some people do get you know when they're clearing oxalates they can sort of build up kidney stones as your body sort of dumping this stuff out again more water try to get that stuff cleared so it's not building up and pooling and forming a stone and uh yeah so just more water less caffeine see how you go uh Mr anthrop thank you for the Super Chat mother uh mother has shotski's ring solid food painful and uh eating next to nothing for weeks doctor expanded esophagus today hoping for Relief thoughts on including meat at this stage meat uh smoothies okay you can definitely do um you know more pureed Meats than uh you know Pate sort of uh things or or Pate textured things uh yeah that's totally fine um eventually you know you want to be able to you know chew and swallow it's good for your your teeth and your face and all that sort of stuff but um no if if she's got a medical issue that makes it difficult to swallow then yes you know having having meat smoothies is perfectly fine um that you can if you can do that if you can I mean doesn't sound too appealing but hopefully you can make it in a way that um tastes good and um and gets her to get the the proper nutrients but yeah it's still a good idea to eat eat proper food um so someone said you know I was uh I was so interested to hear of your father's success on the carnivore diet with the diagnosis of Parkinson's but I haven't heard any more information from anyone else about it is he still doing well he is still doing well he was undereating for a number of years and I keep trying to sort of tell him like you have to eat more so he he lost sort of more weight than than he wanted to so now we're working on uh working on eating uh meat and I told you need to eat meat every day like it's your job you know you just have you have to eat enough meat you have to eat enough fat you know for his whole life he was just it was very controlled it was just like no I'm going to stop here I'm going to stop here no that's enough I can stop here that's not what we're doing here you need to get enough your body's telling you to get more you get more before when we were eating a bunch of crap you had to stop yourself because or else you would eat too much now that's not the case if you are stopping yourself prematurely you're not getting enough and so I I impressed that upon him um you know because of that and because he sort of lost a lot of weight and he's got a lot of back pain that sort of hurt his Mobility obviously you have a bit uh less Mobility with Parkinson's and so you know that superimposed onto things has made things a bit more difficult but he's you know he's working with PT and and doing some other things to try and help regain his strength and obviously eating a lot more meat to help him put on some healthy uh lean body mass is really really important for that um as far as a Parkinson is concerned he really hasn't progressed much you know uh with all with all these other things going on you know he's you know uh um you know he's not as spry as he was but you know he's not he's not as advanced as you would expect um at all I mean he really hasn't Advanced uh much in his Parkinson's um you know to uh especially to the degree that he's off medications he's off levadopa you know he's not doing those sorts of things and so and he's just really not progressing very much and it's been seven years at this point and he had early signs of this before that and uh but he's been carnivore for six years now um you know with a couple cheats here and there but they they've gotten more uh good about that recently as well so that's been great and so hopefully that'll help him more too but yeah no he's doing really well and you know normally you'd see this go a lot faster than that and um and then medication stop working levadopa stops working you to get surgeries and implants into your brain uh which is pretty wild surgery you know we've done several of those um couple dozens you know I've helped out with a few dozen of those and um they're pretty wild surgeries and so it's not something that you necessarily want to go go down but it does help and that can really someone has a really bad Tremor or other sorts of uh you know issues where they just really stiff and rigid or bad Tremor that can that can help right especially for Tremor I some these people have these really wild Tremors they just they can't do anything and so my dad is not not there you know he's a bit of a of a Tremor sometimes just a little bit um and otherwise really good so yeah doing very well could be doing better uh but we're working on those sorts of things as well thank you for asking hey everyone really happy to announce a new sponsor for the show and for everybody down in Australia Stockman Stakes who are delivering highquality grass-fed and finished pasture raised beef and other meats flash frozen and vacuum sealed to

kidneys and beef heart as well so use code chaffy today for free order of beef mints or another specialty gift along with your order at Stockman steaks.com com.au and I'll see you over there thanks guys WR thank you for the Super Chat 4 months carnivore and coffee God damn it um my heart is racing light-headed lungs muscles doing very simple housework tried uh Electro decreased coffee feel like passing out well I would tried Electro I'm not sure what that is electrocardiogram like an ECG maybe um probably good idea if you sort of get erasing heartbeat and all that sort of stuff just doing Simple Things it could be an underlying medical condition it would not be from carnivore coffee caffeine can do that you're decreasing coffee or have you tried eliminating coffee probably a good idea to do that um heart racing Li headed and um and those sorts of things uh you need to you can check other things you check your blood pressure blood pressure is low you can get those things people want medications for blood pressure and things like that sometimes that medication becomes too high and so they need to reduce that they don't realize that they don't realize are getting low blood pressure uh being laded and having your heart race that can be a sign of low blood pressure um you could be anemic there could be some sort of other reason why this is going on and your body needs to uh you know pump out uh more have a higher cardiac output in order to move the same amount of oxygen around your body and profuse your tissues so check things like your blood pressure your blood sugar and get your Bloods checked and check for anemia check for other sorts of things going on um because that's not typical that you know eating eating meat is not going to do that um so you know you want to make sure that there's there's not something else going on and um you know I mean easy really easy to just cut out the coffee too but that's still pretty atypical for people who drink coffee and do carnivore as well so I check those other things I drink more water I check your blood pressure check your blood sugar and check your Bloods for things like anemia talk to your doctor and see if um you're doing a further more detailed history and exam list it's some other other sorts of uh concerns they might be able to test for it's not from eating meat and it's certainly not from not eating poison ass plants um so look for other reasons it could very well be that you're on too much medication now and that you would need to work with your doctor to decrease that but do talk to your doctor don't just go around changing your medications without talking to your doctor first uh Isaac uh omanson thank you for the Super Chat uh how to start eating a carnivore diet focused mainly uh ground beef without getting food aversions almost immediately well some people really enjoy that you know it depends on how you cook it depends on how much fat is in it if you're getting much more higher fat content in the ground beef like 5050 6040 ground beef uh from your butcher special made tastes amazing it tastes way better than uh even the 7030 stuff certainly you know 80 85 90 937 sort of nonsense I mean that's just I mean you're just you're just cooking a brick it's disgusting it this does not taste very good and that sort of tells you your brain's just like no you need something else here you need fat um so that lean me is not that good also you cook ground beef well done doesn't taste all that appealing So you you're doing patties it's like medium rare to rare much better going to taste much better can be much more interesting and and um you can also if you're okay with dairy putting a bit of sour cream or yogurt or a slice of cheese on those patties that can potentially uh make it a bit more interesting as well but I think Dairy should be used very sparingly and only as a condiment and there are a lot of people that really just don't uh do well with it at all especially people with autoimmune diseases and if you're trying to lose weight good idea to avoid dairy in general it's a it's a classic weight loss stall on Carnivore uh is dairy so just be mindful of that you know cook it you know find a way to cook it that you enjoy get much fattier meat melt butter into it tastes a lot better with that okay um Dr uh uh tragedia um thank you says um great job doc we appreciate you oh thank you very much I appreciate that it's always nice to see uh you know other doctors that are coming to this and um and and find this up and say like yeah look at that that's actually this actually is uh it's something that's that's there I get um I get a lot of messages from doctors uh you know telling me you know um that they've been doing this themselves they use this with their patience and they they really find this really helpful and that um you know that the you know they they enjoy the videos and different things that I put out which is great um you know because every now and then you get some going like oh well you're not a real doctor or this that and the other or you're just in this with money whatever it's just like well I'm sorry but you know like other doctors and professors of medicine and you know nutrition and uh and biology and boty and all these sorts of things they're reaching out to me telling me that they agree with the things that I'm saying and that I'm that X Y and Z is is totally accurate and they really appreciate it so you know um sorry you're wrong and um you know so it's always good to see that I get far more of those than uh than the negative ones so that's always good to see and um you know because I don't I don't want to be wrong and it's it's nice to test this against other people and see what other people think and you know if other people are in this field and have um you know of a medical background or a scientific background and they're seeing this and going yeah that's that's dead true and here's something that adds to it you know that's always uh that's always helpful to know that uh that you're you're on the right track so that's good like you do with people that have been eating a bunch of carbs and have this massively elevated insulin and then that sort of changes up but um you know you don't you don't necessarily need to Salt you know if he he likes a bit of salt probably not that big of a deal but uh no I don't think you necessarily need to need to so uh the meat that you Pate for and if um you just enjoys it and likes it"
