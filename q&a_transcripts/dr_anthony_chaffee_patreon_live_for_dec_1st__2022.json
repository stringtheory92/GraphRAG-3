    "transcript": "frame rate than the camera so uh hey everyone just have my lovely assistant Eleanor with me today just trying to figure this out I think like the light's screwing up the the film or the um the camera so it's making a little sort of wavy thing in the background so I guess we'll just try to ignore that sort it out another time all right well thanks everyone uh for coming on and thanks for people who submitted the questions sorry we can get to all the questions uh last Sunday but we can uh go go through them now and um and maybe actually see Olivia says hi um okay Olivia you're now a moderator so uh figured out how to do that hopefully that works um so if you put in if you put in questions if you have like more questions you put them in the chat and then after you go through the ones have been submitted from email we can uh hit those as well if we can uh great I hope everyone is doing really well um question from Wendy um this is Tony 13 uh the one with seizures whose neurologist you don't like yes I definitely don't like him uh has begun sleeping for 12 to 15 hours a night after switching him to carnivore in September is this something I should be concerned about seizure free since October 5th had fruit at that time um no I don't think there's I mean that's a lot you know and so it may be that he's just um you know catching up on sleep and just pretty wiped out from it all so I'd see just you know if it normalizes um I would also think about what medications he's on if any um this you know seizure medications can make you very very drowsy and he might be that he's just a bit more sensitive to those now um uh since since going on sort of full carnivore you you can you can be quite a lot more sensitive and um so that might be contributing as well so I just see I mean if this is going on for like weeks then like yeah there's there's something going on and and probably whatever medications he's on that carnivore's not gonna make you sleep but pathological amount of time um the other question is you know how he's doing otherwise is if he's otherwise well and fit healthy and when he gets up you can route you know he's easily rousable you wake up and and interact normally he's not super drowsy and tired and falling asleep at inappropriate times that could be a sign of something else going on that you probably need like some Imaging done just get a scan um but it is more likely to do with something like his medications if there was a medication change or if there was um or if he's become just more sensitive to the medications he's on so I would think about all those things and then just see if this sort of works itself out and um and uh and if it doesn't then you know maybe go talk to his his uh you know GP and uh you know see if there's there's something else going on his primary care physician PCP GP over here PCP over there okay but yeah it could just be be normal could just be that um you know he's he's just pretty wiped out from a lot of things so just I would just see if it if it settles down and then take it from there Madeline asks or says I've heard Dr Elizabeth bright talk about that some people get tired Going carnivore because the body starts to heal when it's finally getting all the nutrients in and the healing process is hard work so therefore the energy goes down for a little while what are your thoughts on that maybe you know I mean it's certainly a theory that describes the observed phenomena in some people but not everyone gets tired I didn't get tired I got I got uh supercharged and a lot of people do as well their energy levels go up you know one that certainly could be something to do with that your body's you know dedicating you know more energy and resources to Healing your body um but you know another thing is that some people just take a little time to get you know keto adapted and not that there they take a while to get into ketosis that that only takes about 24 hours but it you know once you're running on ketones and you're running on your your blood blood sugar it you're not as efficient at running on ketones and so your body just sort of the mechanics of your biochemistry in your body and your metabolism start you know just take a bit of time to sort of catch up and but that happens that comes in about you know sort of two to three weeks at most um you know Professor Tim Knox you know in the work that he's done looking at that uh quite extensively found that um really it everyone will be keto adapted within uh 21 days so three weeks so that could be a contributing factor as well I think it is in a lot of people's cases quite often when people aren't getting um enough energy they're quite often not eating enough or they're not eating enough fat and so once they increase that up they feel great and so that's another thing too so there could be a lot of things going on or a lot of things could be causing the same problem I should say okay um Matthew uh asks I've been eating carnivore for about a year and I seem to be feeling worse now oh that's not good my weight has stayed a constant 187 pounds six foot three uh uh but I've gotten leaner uh waist height uh hip uh waist hip um below which is you know obviously talks about the sort of the ratios he has so he's in um sort of healthy levels and now they've yeah and now they've just sort of changed a bit um I never portion control uh eat more than 1.5 uh to two kilos of meat and eggs a day eat once or twice a day and over the over the year average about two or less meals a day adjusting fat macros to Nothing Even though even going as high as 3.5 to 1 fat over protein by weight that's a lot um eight to one or so by Kelly yeah that's a lot a lot uh for a few days and I had no flare-ups or symptoms indicating immune problems or other illnesses I have a hard time eating enough to be fully satiated but even when I stop way short of that I don't feel the need to eat again before many hours or the next day do you think I should get blood work done if so what well it depends um you know I don't know exactly what um you're saying that you don't feel as good you feel worse um but I don't know exactly what your symptoms are maybe I don't know if you're in the chat but if you are then you know just you know maybe pop it in or just or just message me privately if you don't really want to get into it um that's fine so yeah it really depends on what your symptoms are as as far as what sort of blood work to get if any um it also you know is is a question like did you want to gain weight did you want to lose weight I mean you've gotten leaner so you know you've replaced you know fat with muscle which is good um and so you know it's um you know it's those are those are positive steps as well so it really depends on how you're feeling and if you're not feeling well you know you're not going to feel like you you need to eat because your hunger signals are are different and so yeah that's why you have to sort of go by taste um and so you know you do want to go until you're fully satiated you know a lot of people will under eat and they won't feel very good because of that I don't think you need to go as high as you know 3.1 to one fat or you know eight to one by calories that's a that's a lot I mean if that's what your body's telling you to do and you're feeling good doing that and you're not getting you know violent diarrhea then you know by all means go for it but um you know you might you probably don't need all that um and and you do need enough protein so you need enough fat and you need enough protein usually enough fat and protein shakes out to be about 70 30 80 20 sort of thing but it's different for different people but you need enough protein you need enough fat and you need more fat than Protein that's just sort of how that breaks down um but yeah so if you if you wanna message me uh privately and tell me your symptoms I can I can give you an idea of what sort of things to test for another question from Matthew is given that we have been exposed to chemicals heavy metals smoke fumes alcohol Plastics and pollutants and that we have eaten plants damn plants food additives preservatives dyes trans fats vegetable oils etc for the last several centuries can we really say that we are the same humans as we were 20 000 years ago or two million years ago does swapping the molecules we are supposed to supposed to be made of for molecules we're not supposed to be made of in great amounts and across Generations change our physiology in ways that would make our bodies function differently to our ancestors some of us like me seem to have trouble with carnivore despite trying many things we haven't tried all the variations that carnivore offers sure and personally I'm I'll keep trying to figure it out but could it be that our bodies are so messed up that a true proper human diet can't do its job as well as it should for some of us you know anything's possible but it's very unlikely you know it takes a long long time for uh you know a species to change in that dramatic dramatic of a degree and and you know when you're looking at population genetics it's it's damn near impossible to do that to any any significant degree and to change the number of you know alleles and genes in a population without like a like a genocide or like some sort of mass extinction or you know massive um immigration from you know some other some other area with very different genes um so as far as exposing ourselves to nasty things that can certainly change you um you know I sent out um I'll you know I might post it on the on the patreon group as well it was very interesting uh video that was talking about it's called pottinger's cat and this guy uh Dr pottinger was just doing these experiments with cats and he just sort of you know who's using them for other things but then he found that the cats that he was feeding cooked meat to just meat this was back in the I think I don't know 30s 40s just cooking or maybe in 20s anyway a long time ago I was just giving them cooked meat he found that they just weren't as healthy and they weren't doing as well and they weren't you know surviving some of the the sort of experiments that they were doing they were doing surgery on their their adrenal glands to test you know for you know how that affected tuberculosis and he found that the ones that were getting these adrenal ectomy that were eating the cooked meat they weren't surviving they weren't surviving surgery but you know there wasn't anything wrong with the surgery the surgery had gone fine and so but he found that they had some cats that were just eating raw meat um because it just basically didn't have the capacity to sort of cook for all the cats and so someone were getting raw meat those ones did fine none of them had a problem they all survived the surgery without an issue and so he started saying like Okay just you know cooking take out some of these vital nutrients and and and you know change the game somehow so we started doing these these experiments and had these cats and these these pens and just raise multiple generations of them and just you know someone just raised on raw meat others were just raised on on um cooked meat and they and they kept them in house right so the you know the raw meat cats all bred with each other the cooked meat cats all bred with each other and they found that in the second generation there were even more sick in the cooked meat generation uh in the cooked meat group and they had got condensed milk and pasteurized milk and raw milk they found same things and like condensed milk like sweet milk was like way worse or evaporated sort of things yeah the condensed sweetened milk is like super bad for these cats and they found that they just they just weren't doing well and they and they looked at their skeletons they looked at their bone structure their um mineral uh uh content and they found that the bones in the raw meat cat were like 14 super healthy big you know fully formed skulls and jaws and everything like that and and brains and the second Generations were like a you know two kilo cats and um you know early on and then the other ones were like 1600 grams and um and their bone structure was different their their skulls weren't developed as fully their brains weren't as big their zygomatic Arch the cheekbones weren't fully developed and formed in just the second generation and then they found third Generations were even worse oh and the mineral and the mineralization was way lower in those uh cats that had um cooked meat uh it was only like seven percent as opposed to like 14 and then the third generation their mineral bone mineral density was even worse so it was like three percent and they said that the the bones of the skull were actually like sort of like almost spongy like foam rubber and they had all these like fractures and broken bones and things like that and these cats were not doing well they weren't as interested in mating they weren't very um you know there were there weren't Mary you know they just weren't healthy and they found that after three generations they were sterile they couldn't even they couldn't even uh procreate the ones that did um had still stillbirths so you know it makes a big difference and so if you're yeah you're eating the wrong thing generationally yeah they're gonna have some knock-on effects they're going to have some you know it's going to add up and and they found that it didn't just take one generation to reverse that when they started feeding those you know sick cats they're sort of two three generations down raw meat they got healthier but their offspring didn't just go back to normal it took four generations before they got back to where they where the you know raw meat cats were all the time so it makes a big big difference you know what you're eating um does that mean that you're going to be better off eating you know the cooked meat and the condensed milk no absolutely not it just means that you know it um uh you know it just means that you know we're sort of behind the eight ball were sort of the you know multi-generational cats not eating the right thing but you know it's still a good idea to eat the right thing so I think that um it really matters you know what's going on and and why you're not feeling well I think there are different reasons people can you know not feel great on a carnivore diet and there could be a couple things you know they're just sort of missing out maybe they just don't process things as well maybe they just have a different vitamin um you know demand and it could be that just the food that they're eating for whatever reason just isn't quite having the uh the nutrient complement that they need could be because of the soil in that area that those cattle were raised on could be the feed that they were given and so forth but you know there's a lot of different things that could be happening and so um again just just message me and tell me what's going on and we'll we'll troubleshoot and we'll figure it out foreign Jesse asks does fermentation help to reduce the harm from plant toxins if so how much ancestral people all over the world seem to have fermented foods like sauerkraut kimchi to make them safer to eat does this actually make them safer or would these Foods still harm the body over time they would still harm the body over time they still they aren't perfect but yeah they're better and and they also make those nutrients more bioavailable as well so that that's a big thing these these processes that we put these plants through um you know my my always my favorite go-to example after speaking with Dr Bill Schindler is niche tamilization of corn and you know that's a process that the mesoamericans who first cultivated corn uh used that they would like soak it in lie you know like a you know a strong base and um for like 24 hours they maybe do a couple other things I don't know the exact process but that would extract more the nutrients and and get rid of some of the the you know harmful aspects and and most importantly it would make more nutrients available because you know nutrients and plants are bound up in different ways that we don't have we don't have the hardware and the enzymes to break down we just don't and they come with other things like phytates uh that will or fit acid which will bind to minerals like you know magnesium or calcium and they will permanently bind to that we cannot break that Bond where other animals can and they because they've adapted to that so they can break down these complex bonds that the plant uses to sort of hide its nutrients so that it's not beneficial for an animal to eat it right so if the animal is able to get nutrients out of somewhere else you know those animals just happen to eat that other thing those animals are the ones that are going to be successful and survive and you know the ones that are sort of surviving on that planet are basically going to lose out and they're going to die out um so yeah so you can reduce some of the poisons but you're still not going to get rid of all the poison and you know like like lectins a lot of lectins are heat sensitive but not all of them and they're not all you know 100 heat heat uh sensitive so it's not like you you just cook lactation all the lectins go away no that's not the case you know they'll still be in there and um and also I mean what a silly thing you know we had to we had to chemically alter something to make it just palatable and just you know not fatal then clearly we did not evolve on that because if we did we would have the hardware and we'd have the ability to break that down naturally right um but yeah so fermentation can help those those processes can help but they're not perfect and they're not going to give you as much nutrition as as meat will so if you're in if you're in a bind um you know it's a good option but that is exactly why you know all these different civilizations have these examples you know like you know people talk about soy and how great it is and how the Chinese eat so much of it first of all they're short as hell on average they're like five six on average men adult men five six and um and and you're not so healthy but another thing is is no they don't actually eat a whole bunch of soy they don't need raw they eat fermented soy they have that process too and it's basically they use it well traditionally they would use it to um you know in case of like starvation they didn't have enough uh to eat they would they would turn to the soy that was sort of like a backup plan but it was fermented as well so um but yeah but either way meat's still going to be the best but if you have to you know that that's the way to do it if you're going to if you have to eat plants then yes you know making it as safe as possible is the way to go uh Laura asks primary schools in Australia have something called Crunch and sip where kids must consume either piece of fruit or vegetable every day this is compulsory uh can you suggest a type of fruit or vegetable that will be the least harmful or are they all pretty much as bad as each other um they're you know no they're they're not all as bad as one another I think off the top of my head I think a tree ripened avocado is probably going to be your best bet not that avocados are perfect lettuce you may get away with lettuce um you know I don't know but uh um you know like an avocado you know fruit in general will be more have more defense chemicals if they're unripe and the seed's not ready and when they ripe it in the Box there's at least studies with tomatoes that I've seen that show that they don't actually get rid of all the salinity and defense chemicals that are in there so that's why that's why I like Vine ripened tomatoes taste very different to just you know mushy gross um box ripened tomatoes so same would be true for for avocados and any other fruit and so it's I don't know for a fact that they'll you know uh that they'll get rid of it um less if if they're box ripened but it seems to be a theme and um so we can get it sort of you know ripened on the vine sort of avocados maybe that would be the least least offensive um but also I mean like who the hell are they to tell you what to feed your kid your feet your kid has to eat fruit has to eat vegetables that is none of their damn business you know it's just it just isn't and um you know it really bothers me how intrusive um schools are getting nowadays and just just you know governments in general it's just mind your damn business beef jerky or something like that and just say that it's dried fruit yeah just say that yeah maybe do that just say you have a bunch of dried fruit dried um you know apricot things just have little chunks of you know dried beef or something like that and um yeah yeah dried watermelon dried dried whatever uh papaya something like that you know but um yeah that's really absurd that they that they would force that I'm sure that's not all the schools um maybe it is I mean in the school district you're in but I think that's just that's just ridiculous that they do that today that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] honestly Yeah well yeah they're lucky that I don't have kids right now I just thought I'd just be the most like I would be at every PTA meeting just causing trouble and I was just like it would yeah and I'd probably run for school counsel and just be like this is garbage and um but yeah yeah they would not they wouldn't well yeah they won't like the side of me I think if this keeps up um Steve asks I am one week post surgery and of a full thickness tear of supraspinatus standard decompression with a subacromial bursectomy and the long head of the biceps tendon was debrided I am 50 years old um male and have been on Carnivore diet for two years eating beef eggs butter and salt and drinking coffee though and could you have any other diet tips for Recovery or do you have any other diet tips for Recovery well you know I mean you could you could optimize things by just you know dropping the coffee that will reduce inflammation and you'll be less sore and feel a bit better that way um and um you know and just to just keep doing what you're doing I mean a carnivore diet is exactly what you want you know to heal from uh any surgery or any injury you know just making sure you get enough and just making sure you get enough rest and do you do your physio do your exercises those are so important the more those you do without obviously hurting yourself or injuring yourself uh the better you're going to recover and and the you know the the work you put in now pays dividends for the rest of your life because if you rehab this properly it will be strong and it will it will serve you well if you don't do it as well it's going to be weak and it's going to be a struggle to strengthen that up and keep it strong for the rest of your life and so put in the work now do push yourself just don't hurt yourself and um you know and good luck with it but yeah just just you know meat and water is the way to go I would drop the coffee but I already have so I'm biased um just in the comments Madeline asked going back to the uh tired thing you know can it also be the intestines can't absorb nutrients and therefore you get tired um sure early on but that that will that'll sort itself out in a couple days because you know if you haven't haven't been eating a lot of meat like if you came from like a vegan diet or something like that um you won't you just your body's not gonna be making all the the proteases and light bases that that you need to break these things down because you're not eating any of that stuff and your body's good is efficient just like when you stop eating carbohydrates your body stops pre-loading your pancreas and your beta islet cells with insulin and so when you start eating carbs again there's a there's a bit of a lag and they go oh my god oh you know your your insulin resistant by not eating carbs like how exactly would that happen like I mean you you name the mechanism buddy not having carbohydrates not having insulin around that makes you insulin insensitive that gives you a tolerance towards insulin really think about that so uh and of course it's wrong because you know you eat cars for a few days and all of a sudden you're back making insulin in in the uh and pre-loading insulin and getting it ready for you in anticipation of eating um carbs same thing with your with the red the the rest of the enzymes uh and molecules your pancreas makes to help with digestion so maybe in the first couple days you know maybe you get some something like oh I don't really feel as good and this and the other sure maybe half of it's going to be mental you're just been telling yourself your entire life that meets bad for you and it shouldn't be something that you eat and it makes you sick um but also that you know you may uh just have a bit more time difficult time uh digesting that but it'll it'll sort itself out in a couple days um the keto adaption for me I didn't have any of it I just got better right away but you know some people do take a little longer so all of those things can be contributory yeah um and Ray asks I'm going to be traveling soon to several conferences last time I ended up eating whatever was available which wasn't too bad for keto one of the conferences I one of the conferences I am worried I will have vegan catering as that's what happened last year gross any advice on Surviving two weeks around about two weeks that's a big old conference um that sucks well I think just you just got to eat on your own man you know it's um yeah you don't want to eat that nonsense just you know just just eat before you go and just eat on your own just have have your own food and then just don't don't partake in The Catered you know the catered food you know um you know if there's nothing if there's nothing that I want to eat I don't just eat because I have to eat I don't have to eat you know like I you know you know I've traveled you know on planes and you know 36 hours um you know travel time flight time when they really weren't serving anything that I could eat literally like a pad of butter and and one slice of of lunch meat in this big old bread roll so I ate the one slice of lunch meat and the and the piece of butter and that was it so for 36 hours and yours oh this was another one I was talking about too yeah but yeah but anytime I'm traveling like you know on the plane or something like that like there's there's almost never anything that that I can eat so I just don't two weeks is longer obviously you're gonna have to eat somewhere but you don't have to you could go two weeks unless you're extremely thin or emaciated uh but you know even slender people will have a couple weeks worth of fat available to them without without too much problem think about it this way you know like a like a kilo of fat that sort of provides you roughly 3 500 calories um you know if you're 200 pounds and you're 10 body fat that's you know 20 pounds of you know um was it a pound anyway so you've got you've got tens and tens and tens of thousands of calories uh available to you you've got 20 pounds of fat as a ton right so you know you've got days and weeks of fat available to you before you even start touching into your uh you know your muscles and your protein Stores um I don't recommend that but you know I'm just saying that you do have that capacity so I would just yeah I would just eat on your own time and just you know ignore what they have at the conference really that's what I do uh um great well that's the the questions for that have been submitted and if anyone else has questions I don't know if um Olivia if you've seen a couple questions that have popped up you can let me know um and Paul says have you checked Dr solidino's video on fructose he cites several studies showing that fruit and natural raw honey doesn't seem to have the same effect as added fructose does what's your take on that I haven't seen those studies uh I don't believe them for two seconds um but you know there were actually studies that just came out recently that showed um uh oh gosh what exactly was it so it was in people that already had like metabolic syndrome they already had fatty liver and they had two groups it was like randomized controlled uh for that and they had people that like they were limited to like two pieces of fruit a day and and they control for everything else as well and they had other group could like eat like you know four pieces of fruit or more fruit or whatever that they wanted and they found that those people in in the more fruit group uh actually worsened their metabolic syndrome who worsen their fatty liver disease so what the hell is that um you know that that's showing something but you know a lot of these a lot of these these studies aren't great you know and um so you can get a study that that sort of concludes anything um and you know but you have to sort of you have to sort of understand like you know all the different limitations of it you know there's going to be a ton of different confounders as well and you know he's arguing that like in The Matrix of the honey and the fruit that for some reason you know fructose doesn't behave as fructose chemically in your body I don't think he has any evidence of that I don't I don't you know um I don't think he says any sort of just you know explanation of a mechanism on how that could possibly be um so yeah and there's and there's also studies that show exactly the opposite so I think you have to just go to go to First principles and just say like okay you know we know what fructose does in the body we have clear biochemistry on it and it feels oh well that's mechanistic I'm like dude it's in a damn biochemistry textbook like it's just like this is just what happens you have like the Krebs cycle you know and the TCA cycle like well this is how ATB well I don't know I mean that's just mechanistic but yeah okay but you know don't be stupid you know like this this is this is an actual biochemical process and you put that chemical in your body and that's how it works um you know it's um it's a bit silly and um so I think that um I think that you know sugar is sugar is sugar and um you know maybe there's something in Fruit well certainly it's fiber and fruit and that actually slows your absorption of fructose you're not going to get as much of that that's true you know that's why that's why lustig says that it's okay to eat fruit because of the fiber but fiber is a problem in and of itself there are other defense chemicals in Fruit as well and also some fructose is going to get in you know it's just not going to be as much so you know depending on how you how much you eat you're still going to get some so anyway I I don't um I don't like this stuff anyway you guys know me and um so Mike asked what is my take on the liver King steroid use Revelation um just that it really wasn't that much of a revelation like I don't think any of us really took that seriously that he was he was you know natural um obviously um you know obviously you know people can get accused of you I get accused of doing steroids every damn day but you know um you know sometimes you're just kind of like okay you know like that's that's I'm pretty sure also you got to look at this you know you you can often see you can often spot some of these signs of of different sorts of of chemicals that are being used growth hormone is called growth home for a reason it makes your body grow and your organs can actually grow and they can hypertrophy and and that's permanent and so your abdominal organs will actually grow and that's why you get that sort of rounded belly like it's still rip like you still got you know corded um you know six pack and 12-pack or whatever but it sort of bulges out a bit look at like garanda and serge nubrey very slender ways very abdomens you know they weren't using that stuff they were just yoked on their own and they were actually living you know by the you know the nine tenants and principles or whatever that that uh liver King sort of uses um and his spouses they were just eating very healthy and just eating a ton of meat and just and living to our biological past and that's actually what garanda wrote about you know he said that like what do you think about this diet or that guy he's like I I've never I haven't read anything by any diet Guru or any diet expert who's been alive for the last you know who's been alive within the last 50 000 years I look back at what we were eating you know before all this you know what what are we adapted to eat what are we supposed to be eating biologically it's like that's what I looked at and um and he got you know and he was absolutely ripped so I think that it really wasn't a surprise to me it was just like I mean I just thought it was a very um you know I just I just thought it was a bit of a force you know that anyone could sort of believe that I didn't really care one way or the other like obviously you did but you know he he's a you know he's a bit of a gimmick you know he came out hard he had a big press team to make him uh you know have his his social media blow up which is great it was good marketing you know and he wanted and and it and it you know really helped his his brand you know good that's great um but I mean it was always a bit of a gimmick you know he did really over the top sort of things very funny goofy sort of things that you know it was just sort of you know just him playing around and so and that's fine but I mean you know it um it certainly didn't surprise me when that came out it surprised me that other people were surprised I didn't think that that was something that we were taking seriously um the problem I think really comes down to the fact that you know as Olivia pointed out that people are talking about like well this guy's like representative of this you know Primal Carnival movement which he absolutely is not I mean he's got a lot of people following him but you know that's a problem because you know they take that seriously but you know you know people are saying that like well you know should I even be doing Carnival anymore is it all just a farce is it all just a hoax you know these guys actually you know in good shape are they actually in good health or is it just they're just trying to sell something well first of all you know Dr Baker and I we're not selling anything you know we're just you know trying to get this information out there uh we don't have a liver supplement company um you know and that's something we work together but I'm just saying that the two of us um are two examples of that that you know we don't we're not selling stuff you know nutrition with Judy she's not selling stuff you know Lily Kane she's not selling stuff you know all these people they're not they're not selling things you know uh you know Mike matzel like that guy's genuine he's a genuine dude who genuinely cares about people uh getting healthier you know so so there are people out here that actually care and are actually living the way that they espouse and are having huge benefits from it and you can do that in a number of different ways and we all have our opinions on what what the best way is um but I think that is yeah that's pretty harmful in doing that because now you know like Baker and I get accused of doing steroids all the time you know and the funniest thing is is that like Baker works out like a horse all day and like I I sort of go in like you know waves of like working out really hard and you know getting a lot of gains from that and then just just because of the way I eat I just sort of maintain that I just sort of Coast on it for a while uh and then just you know life gets on top of me but you know a lot of the times in like the the pictures that people say like they're like oh yeah these clearly on steroids you can tell by you know his shoulders and this that I'm like it's funny because like in those pictures they're talking about I got I just been in lockdown and quarantined for a month and like had not worked out at all it's like okay like that's um it's just funny that those oh clearly he's just doing steroids and like I'm not even working out you know it's like what the hell are you talking about um but I think that's a big problem because you're now you know he's gonna he he goes down and obviously shows very clearly that he was um you know using these uh I mean like a blood load of of testosterone of steroids and he had a big big stack and just had a ton of growth hormone which is why that guts there right and um not like a gut gut but like you know just that sort of bulging out that comes from from the organs sort of pressing out and um you know that's going to cause that well that can cause health issues um as well beyond that but you know once he does that like everyone is just going to be like oh all those it's going to be very easy to dismiss you know because they're just going to say well anybody who's in good shape it's not because they're they're eating that way it's because they're on steroids and of course that's not the case you know I mean if this was someone who was very clearly on steroids and um you know for whatever reason he just wanted to say that he wasn't fine but um you know it did come out and that's fine but you know hopefully that doesn't you know sort of um you know paint everyone with a bad uh you know a bad tint because you know first of all no one was involved with him except the people who were you know like um you know like saladino was I don't I have no idea if he knew or not but obviously they were you know they've partnered in business and together and things like that so you know like I've never met the guy I've never spoken to the guy I've never had dealings with the guy now they're his Baker neither has I have a lot of people you know so hopefully people understand that and understand that these are two very separate things and this guy is in no way you know a carnivore in the first place to do drinks maple syrup you know like what the hell is that you know and like so you know it's not it's not um you know it's not he he really wasn't part of this anyway you know he was saying eat more meat you know you know sleep try to be healthy extra life yeah all good things I mean like stuff that you know anyone can tell you um but you know he was not carnivore he was absolutely not I mean good for him for promoting me you know I'm all for that but you know he was not carnivore plain and simple um okay so a question from Paul how often is potassium the cause of electrolyte imbalance increased sodium and magnesium but I'm still having heart palpitations don't have symptoms of potassium deficiency uh well look it depends you know a lot of people depends on what you mean by heart palpitations a lot of people will talk about heart palpitations because they're having a very strong noticeable beat but it's regular it's it's not fast or slow and it's not uh you know changing Pace or skipping beats and things like that so that's not our palpitations that's just a strong beat and that's normal that that's actually just the sign of your heart actually getting stronger and it will it'll that'll settle down um when you get problems with potassium being off you get serious arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation where your your heart will flutter and go so fast that it'll actually like you you won't be able to feel all the Beats because they're just so thready and quick and so you can you can actually have your heart going 160 180 beats per minute because it's just flying right and that's that's actually dangerous you can you know cause some serious problems from that um and then you know if you're if you're getting that sort of arrhythmia you can get worse arrhythmias and you can go into you know uh ventricular um fibrillation and your heart just stops that's an arrest right and so you got to be you know mindful of that you know it's so unlikely that you've got a potassium deficiency uh or even a magnesium deficiency if you're on Carnivore and if you've been on Carnivore for a while um but you can just check just check your just check your Bloods and get an EKG or an ECG if you're in a in a you know a commonwealth country so they call them there um so just get it checked out you know if you're worried about these things if it's if it's just a normal rhythm beat if it's a normal pace but it's just loud and noticeable don't worry about it if it's abnormal if it's doing a you know an irregular beat and you're skipping beats and dropping beats and and adding beats and things like that then you need to get that checked out you need to get that looked at uh on on you know tracing the cardiac tracing like an EKG or ECG um and you can just get your electrolytes checked I I would bet that they're probably fine and if your potassium is a bit low then you know you just need to add in a bit of potassium salts maybe get yourself back up to where you need to be um but it's it's super uncommon I honestly have not seen people be um have their potassium be off on a carnivore diet I've yet to see that you know people will supplement all these things and they'll say like oh it helped me but they never do their bloods they never say yeah I had a potassium deficiency and then I added these things in and then I felt better I have yet to see that maybe I'm sure it's happened maybe but I haven't seen it and it's you know and it'd be very uncommon your body is very good at uh regulating your potassium so um yeah so if you're worried about it just get it checked check your electrolytes I see where you're at um and Mike makes a point honey gets Main Line because it's no fiber absolutely right and it has way more fructose than even uh high fructose corn syrup and then people do like the agave syrup and they're like oh it's even better it's so natural like okay yeah or sticks natural but also Agave has even more fructose than honey it's like it's like something like it's like 65 70 fructose it's crazy and so that's really bad high fructose corn syrup is 55 right so um yeah so it's way worse uh other question from Natalie can you go back over eating raw versus cooked meat for humans not sure I'm up to eating raw just yet but I'm only four months in I don't think there's any real problem eating cooked meat for people maybe just you know less cooked you know the more more is what I do I I prefer eating less cooked meat maybe sear the outside and have it mostly raw in the middle or maybe just a bit warmed um like a medium rare like a rare side of a medium rare um you know I I don't I don't know of any like good data showing that you know you lose out on a lot of you know very vital nutrients and meat even you know cooking me can actually make some of these things you know more available make the proteins you know a bit in nature so that you can actually absorb them easier that's true we do know that um that's you know there are a lot of people that you know think that raw meat is just they feel so much better on it maybe I've eaten raw meat I've eaten cooked meat I've never really noticed the difference between the two but you know there could be you know sqos Inuits they they just eat basically raw meat the whole time A lot of people do especially up north you know with no firewood or anything like that um but also at the same time we've been cooking for literally hundreds of thousands if not over a million years um so I think I think we're probably adapted at this point to to cook our meat and uh and that we we should be okay you know cats are very um you know they're more obvious obligate carnivores than like dogs and wolves right they they they really have to have the nutrients that are that are in in raw meat they just have to have it and like they really eat almost any plant will cause them serious harm so I think that I think we're probably fine I don't I don't know I don't have any good reason to say otherwise anyway oh my goodness just skipped a whole bunch of this stuff um so yeah just Serena was saying uh what I hate about the liver King is that is that people will question everything he says now because he's dishonest and people who need this way of eating may not believe him about it sad yeah well and that's a problem you know like everything's going to get thrown away you know they'll throw out the baby with the bath water and hopefully that doesn't happen and so I think it's good that Dr Baker sort of came out and just said yeah this is this is what that was but you know that was a thing like I just I always I I was never you know of the mind that people were taking this guy seriously and people that thought that this was like the way to do things and if this was anything else besides just him having fun and just being a bit of a gimmick to sell his liver bills I never thought this was anything else so you know hopefully most people you know just took that took that the right way as well um yeah so you see and um let me see so I guess let's see okay um okay just trying to look through here see if there's any any other sort of questions but looks like things are pretty pretty stable um yeah I didn't see uh solidino's discussion on that um I should probably take a look and just sort of out of curiosity I guess but you know I mean the if he didn't know I think that that's pretty remarkable you know um you know because I mean the guy was the guy was injecting you know multiple things multiple times a day and you know if you're if you're you know good friends with someone and you're like staying at each other's houses and you know doing doing things together like you you would probably find out and like you know and he suspected he says I think he damn well knew you know like I just that's my suspicion like I don't know but like you just you know I mean I think it's I think it's um you know it's it's also it's just you know wasn't any of his business to go and you know talk about you know he's friends with the guy he's business you know in business with him um so obviously he's um you know you know it doesn't doesn't really make sense for him to go around saying like oh I bet he's on steroids you know whether he thinks that or not it's not really going to suit his purposes um but but yeah yeah exactly it's money like I mean it's you know he's got a vested interest in in this going well as well um how do I feel about not making it through November I just fine I hated that mustache it's just awful it's just you know it's um it's a funny cause um you know it's a funny thing to do for for a good cause but um I guess that's the fun of it um yeah I saw that Nina stopped by with a good book club that that's really awesome that was really nice of her to stop by I wish I was able to to come by with you guys as well um but um I I was not unfortunately um doing a lot of on calls I'm on call like every other weekend now which is just ridiculous so I'm like working like 60 hours straight every other weekend and that's just because I'm being punished for for going to uh Costa Rica to do this um reversed show and because I'm you know I'm you know taking more time off at other people I'm doing way more on call than other people as well and in a shorter period of time because of the time I'm taking off as well so but it's all right it's it's fine you have to you know you have to make up for things for other people covering for you but um but yeah that would be great that was great that Nina could stop by she's she's awesome I really enjoyed talking to her she's such a nice person and just and just such a pleasure to talk to um and uh so that was great that she was able to stop by um and any insights from Jordan Peterson yeah Jordan Peterson's in Perth so he's actually doing another talk tonight he's actually doing it right now um I would have I would have liked to actually seen it again I I have a feeling that he actually talks about different things every day on every on every little thing so that the shows are different um and just different things come up but it's actually cool so I was I was front and center I was front row uh in the center and so he was up there and he like talks to you which is really cool so he'll get up and he'll like point at you and be like so you see this and he'll make the point to you and then he'll go and keep talking and then he'll make another point to someone else and so he he keeps picking someone out of the audience and he speaks directly to them looks dead in the eye and talks directly to them it's actually it's quite engaging and it's quite it's quite a good technique I think and um but there was a lot of insights I really wish that I had a recording of it because the guy just went on this you know amazing you know spiel about you know going from you know interpersonal connections and you know just you know just working on a pig that he was talking about one of the rules in particular was you know pick something and and work and give it all you have work really hard at it give it all you have and see what happens right he was talking about that he was talking about you know why this makes a difference and all that sort of stuff he was going back to Niche and and all these different um you know historical examples and it was it was a really really really good um but a lot of depth a lot of of content that um would you you would benefit by hearing multiple times you know because it's coming at you quick pretty fast and um and he is um you know he's he's got the sort of stream of Consciousness sort of thing that he's just it's just going and going and going Angela's like wow this is this is pretty incredible so it's really it was really a pleasure uh to go listen to that and I had sort of a VIP afterwards so everyone sort of lined up and you know took pictures with him and showcase and things like that he's a really really nice guy like really went out his way every single person came up he's like hey how are you doing it's great to meet you what's your name that's really nice all that stuff you know I you know really wanted to sort of you know say like oh hey actually you know you know I've I've um you know uh obviously you want you want to say how much you appreciate him and how much you appreciate it you know the the things that he said and things that he's done um you know I think you know obviously he's like hearing that as well because it helps keep him you know motivated and um and uh you know I wanted to sort of say like oh actually you know I'm going to be you know on your daughter Michaela and Michaela's show um you know talking about carnivore stuff for her five-year carniversary and just sort of you know get that connection and things like that but um you know I just didn't feel like I didn't feel it was you know right to sort of Ambush him sort of as we're like taking a picture a lot of people were sort of doing that trying to do that and they were saying explicitly like don't do that don't like try to talk to him about 130 people trying to do this so you know keep it brief you know have you know have respect for people behind you so I didn't I didn't Ambush him like that I didn't want to I didn't want to sort of um do that but um that would have been really nice I really really enjoyed meeting him he's one of those he's one of those people that you would just absolutely love to like know on a personal basis and just be able to like just hang out and talk to about you know real things and um because the man really has just a depth of understanding and insight into so many things that it just you know you it would just be an absolute joy to talk to him um and now he says he and Michaela are the reason I started this way of eating a lot of politics and I'm right behind or right-minded I came across Jordan years ago and adore him they're amazing humans they really are um and yeah and Michaela's story is is really really really um yeah inspiring as Mike says and so is Jordan's you know dealing with his health issues that he doesn't really talk about when he had him and as well as um you know depression and anxiety and it really helped it really really helped him and so that's that's uh it was really great to see you know good things happening to good people and um and yeah I I started following him really early on like I saw one of the earliest sort of hit piece videos that when he was came out and spoke out against Bill c-16 in Canada you know compelling speech forcing you to say uh someone's preferred gender um and uh and not even protecting this but just forcing you and he was saying hey that's not safe like this isn't a good road to go down compelling speeches is actually where you know the Nazis came from this is where the you know the Communist dictatorships this is this is how they started and this isn't a good this isn't a good road to go down he was making you know compelling argument and people like oh you're transphobic homophobic you horrible person they tried to get him fired from his tenured position which is you know good thing that he had a 10-year position he could actually speak out without you know fear of losing his job but um you know I saw I saw them try to like do this uh we got you sort of um uh video on him and he just you just took it all and he weathered and he ran it right back at him they just did not know who they were dealing with and I watched him I was like this guy's this guy knows what he's talking about and he's doing really well and so that's what I started looking into him more and um and I was quite impressed by him and one of the early things that you know I saw him saying things and coming to conclusions and actually even using similar vernacular of Thomas Sowell and he could come to similar conclusions I was just like has this guy red Soul like I mean this guy is this guy is really you know talking about like some very deep insightful things um in the way Soul does and it turned out no he hadn't he had not read him and so I was even more impressed because and then he I think later he did start reading Thomas Sowell um you know after he started probably hanging out with um uh uh Ben Shapiro Moore but um but that even impressed me even more because he he had come to you know the same conclusions or similar conclusions about certain things uh as not everything obviously he's not an economist so he didn't necessarily come to all those conclusions but certain things about you know just society and and politics and things like that he he came onto just from the angle of Clinical Psychology and history you know knew a lot about the history and obviously sold it as well and so I was actually quite impressed by that as well I was like wow this guy's this guy's a level of thinker like like Soul which is no small compliment uh especially for me um and now it says yeah the biblical series on YouTube is amazing I you know I've really wanted to see that you know I'm not like a Biblical scholar but I you know I know a few things it'd be really interesting to see um see that on it just just out of Interest yeah that's really cool um all right well thank you everyone um that's been it's about 10 o'clock if anyone has any burning questions um you know we can pop them through but otherwise we can we can sort of wrap it up here um so Mike says please uh pass along to Elle it was great to see her yeah absolutely will and um hopefully hopefully she sort of liked hanging out it was nice to to have the company um and yeah okay and yeah and uh and if you guys haven't signed up for Discord uh do you know it's a really good thriving Community everyone's being really active and and great on it and so that's that's hopefully um something we can just continue to grow and people can continue to get a lot out of and uh in the book club as well um you know doing the brain energy book uh by uh by uh Dr Palmer from Harvard uh very interesting and it goes exactly in line with everything that we've been we've been learning and talking about which is that makes a big difference and a change in metabolism and if your metabolism changes your biochemistry changes and everything changes and so a lot of these these ills such as major depression or even schizophrenia are being found to be more of a problem with the mitochondria again so it just keeps coming back to the mitochondria you know everyone you know we knew this with Otto Warburg he was showing at the mitochondria play have a huge role in uh in our in our overall health that cellular Level Health that that subcellular Level Health played a huge role in our overall health and and he was showing this very well and he had he had 30 years of Nobel Prize caliber research you know that came out and more really and um and then you know Watson and Crick came out with DNA and they're like this is it this is a road map to everything that's it can't be anything else this runs everything it's like not so fast obviously very important your DNA is very important um but it's not actually what you know runs in the the you know the the day in day out um you know functions of your of your cell your mitochondria are really important for that and so your your overall you know you know meta interactions with all your cells are really come down to uh the mitochondria um not so much the DNA so yeah so we're getting back to that and um and this is just another piece of that puzzle you know showing the bigger picture of how we're supposed to eat how we're supposed to live and why that matters and how things break apart when you don't so great all right guys so I think that's good good place to wrap and um thank you very much everybody for coming on thank you very much for everyone uh submitting um questions and uh this will go up on uh YouTube and um same link will work for it and I will right now because I'm thinking about it upload the zoom from Sunday because I'm very sorry that's been um uh on my list of things to do and just didn't do it so I'm very sorry about that um oh Mike says can I do a video with another expert on mitochondria please on mitochondria specifically yeah probably I mean you know uh C free Thomas C freed you know we went into a lot of things on the mitochondria and actually I just did a I did a podcast with uh Professor Laszlo borosh who is a professor of pediatrics at UCLA Medical School and he did like just a ton of research that was his main thing he ran a lab there and um and so he went into a lot of of the mitochondria and how that really mattered in the cellular function and and the uh the entire tissue and animal level um and he went all the way down to the subatomic um sub-molecular level I should say of um deuterium and how actually too much deuterium actually bungs up your mitochondria and then bunging up your mitochondria and then have all these knock-on effects and problems and so that will uh that will come out in the next sort of week or two I'm gonna I'm gonna publish that so that's that's more stuff on there but yeah maybe I could see if someone who's really just you know in-depth knowledgeable about about the monocot I mean Laszlo was knew his stuff I mean dude teaches biochemistry and things like that at uh you know UCLA and molecular biology and all that stuff and now he teaches uh uh what does he calls it deuteronomics or something like that like the science of deuterium and how that that affects our health and he does a funny story too because he was quite skeptical about deuterium at first and he just thought it was absolute hogwash and then they sort of convinced them to do these tests and he's like well if you're gonna if you want me to do these tests it costs money so you know it would be twenty five thousand dollars per cell Line This is like 20 30 years ago and they were like yep there you go here's 75 grand we'll do three cell lines he's like oh okay these guys are serious and then he actually ran the studies and the tests that they wanted for him and he was just like oh my God these guys are right you know and he just like showed it and proved it he's like Jesus like okay right and then he started really looking into it from there so it's very interesting uh but yeah that'll come out too and um yeah great all right guys well thank you very much for joining and um we'll see you next time a lot have a good day"
