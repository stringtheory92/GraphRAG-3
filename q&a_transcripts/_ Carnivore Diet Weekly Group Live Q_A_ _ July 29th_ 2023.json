receptor so I might uh thank you very much for sending that uh that super chat through Joe but I think maybe uh that's a question that um maybe Dr chafee is gonna be better better suited to answering so we'll keep that until he joins us so but for um for everyone if you've got questions please put a big cue in front of your question and uh we will uh we will get to your questions uh in turn uh don't see it's not directly adjust address safety at the moment so uh please uh you know if you've got him and uh so Larry how's uh how's your week been as far as eating what have you been up to with diet wise uh it's been great I mean you know everybody following our Channel knows for a long time uh Cass and I my wife were eating one meal a day but uh we really made the effort this month to get in two meals a day eat more fat and it's been going good and I'll tell you um before the show started we were talking about uh you know deviled eggs that uh a recipe Sean's wife had made uh using butter and uh Cassie's been using that recipe tweaked it a little bit and we've been eating a ton of eggs which is uh very unusual for us so doing real good getting those two meals in a day usually eat around anywhere from 11 to 1 p.m and then we'll have dinner you know anywhere between five and seven and then that's it so um feeling really good the best I've felt in months actually so we're about you Sean what you eating man I'm eating all dude I have been eating like crazy for the last probably a week and a half two weeks like I I went from eating two times a day to the left like I said about the last two weeks I have been starving at night for some reason so I started uh just adding more food and I had uh about let's see two burger patties and four eggs about five o'clock this afternoon which I that's my third meal of the day I had a rib eye for lunch with uh three Pats of butter and eggs like I normally do in the mornings for whatever reason my body's telling me to eat and it it doesn't have to tell me very many times for me to to listen I just I go have it so um you know I I still don't eat real close to bedtime I still don't eat close to whenever I get up you know as far as that's concerned but it you know for whatever reason you know I guess I'm getting to a side we've talked about this you know getting to a size to where my body needs some fuel to run on and and it's telling me it's letting me know for sure um as far as the piano behind me I wish I could I did take piano for five years I I can read music somewhat still um but you know it's been it's been quite a while nice so um we have got uh we've got another question here for you Sean uh Sean how did you get rid of the flabby skin what I had gotten rid of I imagine it was probably benefited mostly by you know the intermittent fasting is basically all that I've done I haven't you know I've worked out as far as walking uh but as far as weight lifting anything like that I haven't I haven't done that I do still have some flabby skin I still have some excess skin um under my arms and in my belly on the insides of my legs right here is the worst I feel like you know April like it's turkey season sometimes but um you know at the end of the day you know I I'm gonna try some maybe some extended fasting coming up unless I'm hungry like I am now you know like I have been being I'd rather deal with the access skin than than uh my body yelling at me to go eat but um I do want to incorporate some some workout weight lifting wise and maybe try some extended fasting because you know I just I don't have the funds to go have surgery I I don't it's not not bad enough for me to go through to those links to try to fix an issue that's a non-issue for me and it really wasn't that bad at all so um that's just kind of where I'm at with that nice um okay Craig is asking where is Kip so um with us this week he had some other commitments already some Pro commitments uh on Friday so uh he's not here uh this week but he will be back next week okay uh and Dr chafee hello how are you doing hey hey good how are you sorry sorry I'm running late guys what's up man doing all right tonight yeah man how are you I can't complain yeah it's all good nice so um okay let's have a look uh Pizza sorry I can't pronounce it Peter Pan for someone who is thinking about starting carnivore is it better to start with Keto uh what do you think as far as we go we did start with the ketogenic diet and uh it just it ended up we did good on it we we felt really good um we just couldn't stick to it and we you know eventually transitioned into carnivore we found it much much easier as far as uh you know preparing your food not tracking anything um but I say coming from the standard American diet you know there's nothing wrong with starting keto I mean I've told many of my friends that you know and uh go from there you know Sean yeah like so I will preface this with like if I begged my mom to get on keto because I wanted her to start into a ketogenic way of eating and I you know she was so used to eating just salads and low protein low-fat stuff like that so like I don't think it's wrong to start with keto however I feel like if you can go all the way with it you're going to get the best benefit because as long as you're putting carbohydrates and sugar into me I guess I should say as long as I in my mind I thought if I can't keep putting sugar and stuff into my system it's going to keep that urge and those Cravings alive and as long as you're having those Cravings you're going to be tempted to pull back so like in my brain whenever I started carnivore and then went be beef butter bacon and eggs I needed to go a step further than what I thought I might actually need if that makes any sense that's how I was thinking about it when it actually happened and doing the challenge um but I've seen over the last year or a little over a year talking with people in the group and and talking with people in the community and and experienced as well that when you take out the sugar the carbohydrates The Temptations your urges for those foods are gonna go away and your taste is going to change to a point to where you're not drawn away by by that taste and stuff I don't how it works it is what it is I don't know um but you're not you're not putting just a little bit in all the time if that if that makes any sense you maybe one of you guys can say it more clearly than than I have done so far but um I would just go you can if that means start with keto then move in the carnivore I would try get it all out of your system um and see what is going to work for you and where you land at but uh Dr chavy yeah I I well I guess it depends on on you know where your head's at you know if you think that you really just want to go carnivore or full-on then you just do it you know I think that's probably the best way to go it's like if you're smoking and drinking you think okay I'm going to quit smoking and drinking great you know if you can just yeah but you know I don't want to do both of those maybe you know I need the crotch of cigarettes to get me through you know getting off the alcohol or whatever you know you can do it you can do it a step at a time when people aren't just like yeah I'm gonna do this I'm going to get get straight on that as as far as a carnivore diet and they say well what can I do what should be the first thing that I take off I always say you know go you know doing keto basically you know get rid of the sugar get rid of the carbs get into the metabolic state that we're supposed to be in in the first place and then have a plan from there to to to go off successively more and more and more you know like okay stop all carbs today next week's new uh you know stop and in nowhere in my estimation should like seed oils and cooking oils ever exist so that's like an automatic office as well and then you know and then stepwise progression from there and then have a date on this day mark it on the calendar I'm cutting out you know carbs and all these sorts of things all you know the next week I'm cutting out these things these things these things and then on this date that's that's it that's when everything's gone if you wanted to do it in a stepwise progression but when people ask me you know well you know what would be the first things actually cut out I always say you know carbs and sugar and just eat more meat if you can do that you cut out the processed foods you cut out the seed oils you cut out the carbs and sugar alcohol as well if you can and just increase the amount of fat in meat you're eating you're going to make massive improvements in your health and um and so I think that that it just depends on on where people are at but if if you have it in your head that you want to do a carnivore diet um I think it's it's great to just go right into it if you are the type of person that would do well with that some people need to do more stepwise progression and that's fine I I do want to throw this in here too but just because I I actually wrote this down out of the book that I've been reading this month and you know and some of you guys may be familiar with atomic habits but um I just started reading it I know it's not a new book but um he actually says Cravings are what drives habits a craving isn't for uh the craving isn't for the habit but for the change in the state that the Habit brings like no one craves a cigarette but you crave the relief that provides you you know you're not motivated by brushing your teeth but by the feeling of a clean mouth you don't want to turn on the TV you want to be entertained every craving is linked to a desire to change your your state and bring it about and as long as you're you know you're driven by those cravings for what is coming on the other side of it and you know I found that anytime I have something that you know is has sugar in it it makes me want things that I don't normally want not physically but mentally it messes with me so I think if you want to eliminate those crabies you want to eliminate the the the um the the habit of of falling into those foods and stuff like that you really do just have to cut it out yeah nice yeah okay so um Dr chafee have uh had a super chat here that I was saving for when you came in um Joe is asking wife has invasive invasive lobular estrogen progesterone receptor positive breast cancer lumpectomy five days of radiation next hormone blockers will keto affect hormone blockers and are HB is bad um well everything comes with with you know added effects you know the people people say side effects but as um a doctor rightly pointed out one time uh that I liked he said that you know you know drugs don't have side effects they have effects and some of them you want some of them you don't right and so that's that's the same uh here so you know in in this context you know are those effects on the balance better or worse you know if that and and generally I would say um you know that would be up to to her doctor to make that decision that that's looks like what they've they've uh decided so I wouldn't uh I wouldn't speak against that um keto is not going to damage hormone blockers it shouldn't mess up mess with anything uh in a negative sense it should uh actually give a positive result especially with chemo and radiation because there were two studies one in 2019 one in 2020 uh looking at ketogenic diets and chemo and radiation they found that in both cases that being on a ketogenic diet being in ketosis for a large period of time actually made the cancer cells more sensitive to the chemo and radiation so they killed more cancer cells right more bang for your buck and it protected your healthy cells more right so you didn't get as much damage your wife isn't going to be as hurt and damaged by the chemo and radiation and the cancers will get get hit even harder so um you know and there are a number of different cancers that have actually shown extraordinarily good uh um you know of efficacy with a ketogenic metabolic therapy by starving the body of added sugars and carbohydrates which the cancer feeds on uh one of those is triple negative breast cancer that was a specific study that was very it was very uh aggressive breast cancer that you know showed very good results you know other other cancers have shown very good results as well breast cancers and others included so you know I do think that this is something that's going to be positive there is literature to support it and and studies and and scientific data that's already been collated for this specific type of cancer as well and uh either way it's not going to damage her it's not going to um mess with her hormone blockers or it shouldn't I don't I don't know of any reason why it would and you know and it will help protect her and sensitize the cancer to the chemo and radiation so I think all in all this is a very good idea to uh to address these sorts of things nutritionally because the thing is you know some doctors will say actually in fact a lot of dogs will say diet doesn't matter eat whatever you want smoke and drink and blah blah of course that's wrong that's insane um and they they would know that if you ask me okay so she can smoke she can drink she can do drugs oh well I I don't know about that yeah okay so don't say something unless you've actually thought it thought it through but a lot of them will say no no doubt doesn't matter it doesn't change anything it absolutely does and you and I think it's very defeatist you know they're telling somebody that they have no control over their lives you know for the the next few years you know it's just like it's you're at the whim of the universe and the and the oncologist and that's it it's the oncologist fighting nature and that's not the case you know you have you have so much control over your own body and your destiny on this one and so you know don't don't forget that you know diet makes a big difference you being as healthy as you possibly can be will give you the best chance of survival period you know and in any circumstance right and especially when you're talking about cancer you're getting getting hit with chemo and radiation and you're dealing with this you know very nasty nasty uh disease you know your body needs to be really strong your immune system needs to be really strong ketogenic diet improves the immune system full stop and it also helps get rid of visceral fat so does exercise like sprinting and weight lifting may be difficult to do when you're going through chemo but getting rid of visceral fat has a direct benefit on cancer survival right there's a study and we've known this for a while that your natural killer T cells nkt cells uh or your or your front line Fighters against cancer right and we've known for a while that people that are that are more overweight have just linearly less nkt cells in their system right so they have they have less of an immune system available specifically to fight cancer okay the um Trinity College in Dublin Ireland um who I play rugby for played rug before they uh just came out with a study this year showing why that is they found that visceral fat cells are metabolically active we know this um so unlike other fat cells of visceral fat cells the fat around your abdominal organs they actually have receptors that will bind in natural killer T cells and pull them into the fat cells and the visceral fat cells and so that's what's actually pulling them out of your circulations because they're all sequestered and tied up in in your fat cells in your in your visceral fat so getting rid of that visceral fat frees up those nkt cells so they found that there's a direct relationship the more visceral fat you have the less natural killer T cells you have the higher your race of cancer the worser outcomes of cancer the higher the death rates the mortality rate of cancers are the more visceral fat you have so her diet if it does nothing else if it doesn't actually starve it Otto Warburg Nobel Prize winner was just completely full of it and it doesn't actually feed cancers and Cancers don't actually need 400 times the amount of glucose to to run and process as every other cells which we know from pet scans you get a pet scan you give them glucose and it lights up areas that suck in a lot of glucose which is cancer and your brain and um you know so even if that's wrong even if that had nothing to do with it you know oncologist doesn't have anything to do with it we know it helps with chemo radiation and we know that it it gets rid of visceral fat right those are two things that are going to massively increase her her chances of survival and uh and and not be so damaged by the treatment so I think this is something I feel very strongly about obviously that's what I've gone on for 10 minutes but I do think it's really really important for people to know about amen thank you very much okay so um let me just go down here and uh have a look at true Health super super chat thank you very much true Health uh true health is asking about omega-3 concerns hates fish and no grass-fed beef um is omega-3 a concern um would you like to comment on that um yeah so fish has a lot of Omega-3s that's true um grass-fed beef has has plenty of Omega-3s grain finished beef can still have omega-3s but less so and it depends on how long they've been going so there are some studies that that look at the length of you know feeding in a feed lot uh and and the amount of Omega-3s or omega-6s and after about three months you you sort of lose all the Omega-3s and it's just omega-6s at that point so you know yeah I mean it's probably a bit of a concern you know if you're if you're only doing grain finish Omega-3s are very important I mean you do you do need these things they're they're very good for you especially for your brain and so you could try taking a supplement the problem is is that the official supplements have largely been shown to be pretty poor quality and they can be quite rancid and be pro-inflammatory and things like that may not have the omega-3 uh fatty acids intact and intact form so um it's actually unfortunate quite a quite a high um you know percentage of the fish oils have been found to be pretty poor quality um so you know I think that that what you should do is just try to you know sort of think of these things as just you know you know taking your medicine and a bit of a supplement you know just have a bit of fish sometimes have some sardines sometimes a bit of cod liver you know you can get some cod liver that's gonna have you know in its oil it's gonna have a ton of Omega-3s and um you know if you can't get grass-fed I mean I don't get much grass finished beef either but every now and then I'll try to get some cod liver with it with its oil or have some sardines and um you know things like that so just adding in you know a bit of organs or or a bit of fish and things like that every now and then you know it doesn't have to be every day but uh you know I would I would be conscious of that and try to add it in um you know every now and then anyway and for kids especially you should probably make sure that they've got a good omega-3 um you know a supply of Omega-3 and DHA and EPA and things like that because that's that's a major major major major building block for the brain that's like 70 of the physical structure of your brain is is fat right fat cholesterol about 20 of that fat is DHA right so that that's a big portion of your brain and so you need that coming in because we don't really make it too well we do make it a little bit we don't we don't make it uh to the extent that we need so something something to be thought of but yeah you know when we were just eating mammoths we didn't need any fish you know they had Omega-3s you know horses and cows and all these sorts of things eating their natural food definitely had Omega-3s but um we don't live in that world anymore so you have to sort of think about these things and sort of add in add in a bit from other sources thank you and we've got a super chat from Kip just wanted to say thanks the time you'll take to make content is much appreciated thank you very much uh and veggie uh is asking I've had low potassium in the past do I need to worry about that on Carnival went from vegan to carnivore one and a half months ago Sean you got any thoughts on uh potassium yeah so I would definitely eat eat eat meat but I would I even I take electrolyte supplements you know that's probably the only thing that I do add in regularly um you know I use keto Chow I've actually tried the uh the element um uh so I I do supplement with those that's usually the only things that I really add in um get the magnesium potassium and and sodium if I need it if I CR have cramps really bad or something you know I'll add it in for that day but there have been plenty of days where I didn't so um haven't had an issue with my potassium being out of whack whenever I have my blood work done um but it's definitely something that you you should you should watch and I mean you know I don't think necessarily you have to you know track everything but I think it's a good idea that if you're going to worry about it go get your blood work done and figure out where your numbers are and keep an eye on it because you know stressing out and stressing your body out when you can have the clear answers and know kind of sort of what you where your body's at and how it's responding and and what you can do to change some of that stuff that's going to put your mind at ease and it's going to help your journey a lot better and you're gonna you're gonna be able to ask and find the answers to questions that's gonna this is definitely going to help you so um sure yeah I would keep an eye on your potassium and and add the electrolytes layer you got anything brother uh yeah I I would add I'd agree with Sean like if you're stressed out about it definitely go get your blood work done uh we were kind of casting I kind of had a rebel attitude but we started it's like let's just start eating this diet and see how it makes us feel and it wasn't long you know a couple weeks before we started getting severe leg cramps headaches and so we started supplementing uh with electrolytes but uh we've never really worried about you know are we going to be deficient in this and deficient in that and that came from a lot of time you know watching uh people on YouTube you know Dr Barry Dr Chaffey Laura Spath and these testimonies of you know you really you're going to get everything you need from the food and uh you know if if some symptom came up where we weren't feeling good then we would address it but like the Omega-3s I I I've never really worried about that you know I mean uh am I right Dr chafee and that beef liver has Omega-3s yeah I mean we have that a couple times a week but other than that you know maybe fish every once in a while but we always just listen to our body and really um you know there's a lot of information out there people have already eaten the diet um so but if you are one of those people that stress on it Sean Sean is great advice go get your blood work done and see what's up Dr Shader uh yeah well I I would agree that um you know if you've had low potassium in the past you know there might be an underlying reason why that is low potassium is extraordinarily rare it was like diagnosed on on blood tests is very very rare obviously it happens you know we know about it but um it's usually people that are that are quite sick in the hospital you know they can get this um but you know if that's something that you've had before you need to be aware of that you could have some sort of underlying issue or could have been a product of of being vegan and having having a sort of A disruption in in your electrolytes from that but certainly do keep track of it you want it you want to test these things you know converting from keto or or from from eating carbs and things like that into any sort of ketogenic diet you can get a disruption of your electrolytes which usually normalizes after a while and so it's it's rare that people need to take supplements ongoing you're sort of 1.5 months in so six weeks on most people are sort of out of that window at that point so if you haven't had any issues at this point it's you know it's likely that you won't have any in the future but it's easy to check you know and and especially if you get um A disruption in your Rhythm or rate of your heartbeat right so because one of the things that low potassium can do is Can it can put you into atrial fibrillation or give you any some sort of other uh arrhythmia in your heart and that's that's not good you know so if you're if you're noticing a very rapid heartbeat or it's really irregular then then you need to go get get checked out and you need to go to your doctor asap basically go to like an urgent care or an ER or something like that um because if your potassium is too low and you're getting that crazy super fast heartbeat you know that that can be a Prelude to getting a more serious arrhythmia as well and that could that can be life-threatening if it gets if it gets really really low so if you've had a problem with that in the past and you know it's anything like that then probably take some potassium and then go and get checked out get an EKG ECG depending on on the part of the world that you're in but if you're feeling perfectly fine you know you get you get a Well Baby check and get your blood's chested and your potassium is fine and you feel fine you know you can continue on like that it's easy enough to take a potassium supplement or you know element to you or the you know the keto Chow I just wouldn't do it anything with sweeteners or artificial sweeteners or anything like artificial flavors or anything like that if you do um but you can just do that and cover your bases and at some point you can just try coming off of them and and checking and see how you go but that's what I would do hmm nice thank you so um guys we're about half an hour into this we've got 510 people live across all four channels um and you can help us to get more people into uh the stream the uh simply clicking the like button so if you haven't click the like button on whichever Channel you're watching on now please do so and that will tell YouTube to go and find more people to bring in thank you very much okay so uh bro brain games is asking what kind of progress can you expect if you cut sugar carbs but you still eat snack throughout the day can one be productive if eating throughout the day uh Larry do you have any thoughts on this one yeah my my first 60 days on the carnivore diets I had an eating window and it was about seven hours and you know I I would have a snack I'd have a little pile of bacon if if I got hungry um now I don't snack much at all but when I first started that's a lot of ways to lose in in 60 days you know and sometimes I'd have two snacks I did cut out the cheese at the time well I know actually I had I had two ounces once a week my first 60 days so because in previous attempts I was consuming a lot of cheese and uh in the same amount of time I'd only lost 25 pounds uh in 60 days just cutting out that cheese though I lost 50 pounds when I really committed so but yeah that's uh snacking it's not a big deal now but you know I I enjoyed a snack here and there as long as it was me you know when I first started so I don't see a problem with that from from my experience Sean yeah so um I just don't think that I don't know you you kind of have to figure it out what's going to work for you but I when I started eating like this I heard Dr Barry explain and and I found it to be extremely beneficial for me that whenever you're hungry if you want to break your addiction to food eat until you're full whenever you get full on fat and protein you're not going to want to snack you're not going to want any more you know and then you don't eat until you're hungry again we're not grazers we're eaters you know you go out you kill animal you get full you you know um so I I would I you're not gonna spike your sugar uh eating meat as much as you would eating the standard American diet I do know that your sugar is not going to fluctuate and it's not going to dip and drop um it will go up whenever you eat anything um so you don't want to just continuously be raising raising that you know that number your blood sugar up up all the time constantly all day long you know you just eat one time eat till you're full and then eat again whenever you get hungry again and you're gonna find it and well I found that you know the more time that went on the less hungry I was and you know it wasn't something everybody always asked did you did you fast no I didn't fast I intermittent fast but it was a natural thing I was getting full on the fat and protein and I just didn't want anything else and then when my body said hey you're hungry I went had more you know it seems so simple because it really is you know um I I'm coming back at you that it was more of a habit you know snacking was more of a habit I'm sure a lot of us uh watching uh you know can relate to walking in and opening the refrigerator like a zombie and just like sitting there staring at it because you're so used to you know grabbing a snack and that eventually subsided and went away um but yeah a big I should I should have added that a big part of the snacking was just a habit you know and eventually poof it was gone well yeah that's what I was trying to break you know I agree with you 100 I'm not saying you know oh you go from having the Habit to tomorrow you wake up and for some people they can do that for some people they can't you know it's a process but in my brain whenever I finally got a hold of this thing that's exactly what I was trying to break was my addiction to food and I was trying to make food fuel not emotion you know if that makes sense to separate the two hmm um yeah Dr David do you have any thoughts in this yeah yeah you know it it's a very common thing that people that people ask you know it's just like well what do I snack on this and the other you know I point out exactly you know as um everyone was saying that um you know while that that's a sort of a natural sort of habit to sort of have you know when you're eating you know full meals and things like that you you really don't want to to snack as much um and you point that out and you just eat until you're full and then you know fatty meat you tend to not really want to you tend to eat once a day twice a day something like that you don't really feel like snacking in between that if you did want to snack between that sometimes if you if you are feeling snack you feel like I kind of want to snack on something it might be that you're hungry and you just need to eat right so you just sort of eat enough you don't just sort of snack on something actually eat you know make a steak make some hamburger patties or some eggs or something like that and eat until it stops tasting good and you'll probably squash that out but in general it's not the frequency and eating that's the problem it's it's what we're eating in that in those times it is the problem you're eating garbage you know oh I kind of want to eat something so you'll just you'll settle for anything there's a vending machine there's a you know McDonald's or whatever you're like okay well I'll just grab something and whatever because you know I have to eat and I'll die if I don't eat every two hours or something like that so it's imperative that I you know just eat whatever floor chocolate I find you know so um you know it's uh uh you know so it's more about what you're eating rather than you know if you're eating you know 13 times a day uh you'll tend to eat less you know as um you know as Sean was saying you know he he sort of intermittent fast but it's not that that you know he's intermittent fasting me out of choice you know he said I'm only gonna eat during this window it's just he didn't want to and that's what I do as well so I tend to do one meal a day but that's because that's when I'm hungry I eat once a day and I'm good you know for the whole next day for like 24 hours if I'm working out a lot and pushing myself you know I might I might do that twice in a day but I'm not doing an eating window I'm not doing that because oh I have to sort of eat during this sort of blah blah blah it's just because that's when I'm hungry and when I'm hungry I eat until I'm full and then I get on with my life well I used to it I always oh sorry I was just gonna say I always tell people on the channel that uh you know whenever you go to the gas station to put gas in your car it doesn't matter if it's the BP or the shell or the Exxon or the whatever gas station is as long as it puts fuel in your car and can get you to work in the morning it works right so like whatever your body wants fuel you put the correct fuel in it to make it run optimally and efficiently and then you don't have to fill up until you you know you need more energy so that's just kind of you know we if we put you know 73 octane in there it's not going to work as good as if we put 93 or 101 octane you know give it give it that that ruminant me my friend nice Okay so uh Gossage thank you very much for the Super Chat uh you didn't have a question um if you if you do have a question please uh please punch it in and we'll uh we'll jump on it oh yes you do here we go Dr Jaffe you mentioned the type 1 diabetics on Carnivore can use only basil insulin how I'm a type one and have been doing strict Carnival for two years I always have to cover protein with bolus insulin well that's well look everyone's going to have a have a bit of a different response to these sorts of things but the vast majority well literally every type 1 diabetic that I've ever spoken to apart from yourself has been able to Pare down their their insulin to like a basal dose of long-acting insulin and they just sort of and they don't need to take uh fast acting uh bolus for um you know for meal times uh so that you know that that's interesting I mean you've been on this for for two years I don't know if there's anything else in in your system or anything else you bring in artificial sweeteners or dairy or anything like that that could mess with that but if you're only doing fatty meat and water and absolutely nothing else then well and there are even different sort of lectins and things like that you know if you are including you know some you know vegetables and and or seeds or anything like that that can uh disrupt uh insulin and Insulin receptors and things like that as well so that's something to to think about but if you're only doing fatty meat and water exclusively and nothing else you don't have other sort of medications that might that might interfere as well um that's what I've seen is that type 1 diabetics they only need that background level of insulin and that just sort of keeps them here and then the slight variations that they have their body keeps that actually pretty tightly controlled so hopefully um you know if well I don't know if it you know how how tight you are onto that just meat and water um but if you're not then I would I would definitely go to that and uh and give that a try see how you go you'd be surprised how very small amounts of things can actually have very big effects that's why I always say like the last five percent of going completely meat and water has about 95 of the benefit because it there's these tiny little things that can really throw off your system and in ways that we just we really don't think well it's just it's just a little bit of this and the other it does make a big difference especially for some people that that have specific medical conditions it can it can have a huge effect so so if you're not doing that I would do that just meat in water and see how you go if you have been doing just meat and water you know that that's interesting hopefully this is something that you know can settle down over time and you'll just need lessons hopefully you have you're using less and less and less insulin I would imagine that you are and you know it may be that your body just sort of reacts like that if you're eating protein are you eating enough fat with that protein you know or is it is it sort of being a bit too of too much of a um of a of a hit with just the protein so sometimes if you if you're eating too lean maybe that can be a bit of an issue and if you if you have it's not that big of a deal to take a bolus of fast acting insulin first of all but second of all if you you know don't like that you know you just you can try spacing out the uh you know the meals and see if that gives a smaller effect on your on your blood sugar to where you wouldn't necessarily need to use insulin nice thank you okay so uh we have another Super sticker from freedom on Carnival thank you very much freedom on Carnival very kind of you okay and colors is asking I'm sure you fellas are surrounded by those still Afflicted with metabolic illnesses do any of you feel guilty that you're succeeding While others remain on their downward trajectory uh Sean do you want to address this one I was I was trying to process it for a second um honestly no I don't I don't feel guilty I feel guilty that you know I wish I could do it for him I mean honestly um I spend a lot of time even more time now than ever trying to get the message out to try to explain what I do I've taught them you know even when I'm not on camera not on YouTube I spend a lot of time talking texts and messaging chatting you know trying to trying to you know share that message of how I did it and how it worked for me I mean obviously I'm not trying to suggest it if you do if you eat the exact same meals every single day that I ate every single day that you're gonna see the same thing but I mean honestly your body is gonna achieve what it can achieve if you follow eating beef butter bacon and eggs eat carnivore eat keto you know whatever it is that you you're trying and move into be being as strict as you can I mean that I feel like that's how you're going to see the best results and so yeah I mean I'm I'm doing all I can do you know personally at the given moment so no I don't feel guilty um I'm I'm excited because I spent 20 years of failing to get to where I am today you know so um no I just I I also want to relay that you don't have to keep failing or making mistakes just because you made one you know there's a lot of people who fall there's a lot of people who fail I did for a long time and that's why I'm so passionate about getting on here once a week or you know six times a week the last couple weeks and trying to you know share that message and spread that message how I can you know so that other people can find their way out of there you don't have to continue living that way you know don't hold yourself Captain to that Larry you got anything brother uh yeah I just I don't feel guilty at all you know I mean I gained almost 100 pounds while I was on YouTube and I don't think anybody felt guilty for me you know it's like everybody's got their personal choices to make um you know like when I got sober um you know I I see people struggling with alcohol and I've been sober eight years and I have a lot of empathy for them and it's the same way with the people struggling with their weight you just want to grab them and shake them and say you know just try the carnivore diet for 60 days and like Sean and really everybody on this panel you know our our lives have a big part of our lives are dedicated to helping people um so I I you know we feel bad when people don't get it and they're not get finding progress but really that's just because you know there I really haven't seen anybody not have a good progress with a carnivore diet who are obese and have a lot of a way to lose you stick to the diet you're going to lose weight now you know there's some nuances there you're gonna you know um maybe catch a stall like I did or try and figure out some things on your own but you know it just stick to the diet and uh 99 of people that I've dealt with have progress but as far as being and guilty uh not at all because I see so many success stories and all of us have helped a lot of people so that's pretty cool Dr Chaffey uh yeah so so same idea I mean I I don't feel guilty per se but I do feel bad you know and that's why I I do this I I seen how much this has benefited my life and benefited you know the lives of my family and my patients and it's this is something I feel that is very very important that that people have so much more control over their lives and their health and they realize they're not at the whim of of doctors and and pharmaceutical companies and things like that they actually can just be healthy even if they're very unhealthy and have a lot of medical issues the the large majority of those issues stem directly from eating things that are not biologically designed to go in our body and when you just get away from that they go away and uh and that's what I've seen and so that's why I'm very passionate about this and that's why I've you know started doing this and detracting from my my actual career to do this in order to uh to try to get that out there so you know I I see people with minimum molecules I walk around you know in the malls and and you know stores in the hospital all the time I see people and it's just like it's just it's just there to me now I can I can almost see people's diets just on their their body you know it's just like that one's a vegan you know that one's you know just a lot of carbs that was a lot of I think so you know it's it's um it's something that uh you know I don't think you should feel uh guilty that that you are doing something and that you are healthy you know I mean you can see people that have you know been born with something or being an accent you feel oh my God I feel really bad for them um but you you know if someone's in an accident they lose their legs you shouldn't feel guilty that you have them it's just you should be real you know you can feel sympathy for them they probably don't want your your pity you know and uh would be pretty upset if you tried to give it to them but you know it's um it's just a matter of you know uh you know you don't have to feel guilty for for doing something that that provides you good health right but you should try to try to educate people and bring this to other people and let them know what you did you know and let's just say hey this is what I did anybody else can do it I'm not selling a product you don't have to like do my course and my you know six minute abs sort of app or whatever it's just like this is what I did you know you can try to and that's and that's what we're trying to do here too and I think that that's you know when someone's not when someone's just telling you hey this is how I did it this is how I succeeded and they're not trying to sell it as part of you know a package or a course or something like that um you know I think that's probably more a it's more sincere but B it's probably more believable you say hey look hey guys I this worked for me why don't you try it you guys can do it you know it's just it's free just go for it some people think that you know if it if it doesn't cost anything it's not worth anything but a lot of people are just giant trying to let people know uh what worked for them so that others can can take that um and try it as well but but it's up to it's up to the individual to try that and if someone's you know doesn't know about it yet well you can try and educate them and if they don't want to do that well then that's on them you know and I'm certainly not going to feel guilty um you know if someone doesn't want to do this and doesn't want to try it it's like okay well that's that's your choice you know I feel I still feel bad for them I still wish that they would do it but it is their choice and I can't really do much more than that hmm yeah I I just like to make a follow-up comment on this as well and it's related to something that Larry said um regarding the alcohol like I I feel bad for people feel guilty and it's exactly the same as with alcohol you know like I'm I'm 13 months and I don't feel guilty when I see someone else rolling around on the ground and unable to stand up because I've had too much to drink I feel bad for them and I feel bad that they're going to have a horrible hangover tomorrow morning but I that I don't feel guilty um and uh yeah so I think there's there's kind of a difference between feeling bad and feeling guilty um okay so uh what running tab 12 is asking what about Meats like salami Etc not too bad Larry how do you feel about uh Meats like that um yeah if they're around I might nibble on them uh during the holidays we had some salami uh when we go on vacation we might take some uh something like that but uh we we don't have that stuff around the house um so at a special occasion that's about it Sean yeah I haven't honestly eaten very much if I was in a pinch and like there was no no cows in the field somewhere or butcher shops within you know driving distance or walking distance for that matter like yeah I mean like honestly it's not the worst that you can have but obviously if if that's what you can afford to eat that that's way better than a lot of the Box stuff and sugar-filled stuff a lot of those things you got to be careful of the the fillers and the Packers and and the additives that they put in those things um you know if you can get it you know fresh stuff um it is what it is but you know I just think that you know the the the I'm just I'm just a state guy honestly I mean I I'm I'm personally not gonna choose anything over a state these days except for maybe some eggs to go with the steak you know um everyone you know but um I think that if that's what you know what gets you through and that's sustainable for you then you know you could definitely do worse but I [\u00a0__\u00a0] you could probably get more nutrition and get better stuff from from uh you know fatty ruined meat you guys uh Chaffey you got anything on that one uh yeah so I mean yeah it's not it's not it's not as bad as just eating a whole bunch of plants you know like processed Meats it's it's just what do they process with they they it's not it's not more meat right they add in they had in Plants adding seasonings that and sugar that and artificial ingredients so that that's what's bad is those additives so you can look at the ingredients list and you can see you know what what is being added to it there's a whole bunch of stuff it's a lot really spicy in this and that's probably gonna have a lot more you know crap in it that you don't want um so you can look at it that way um I still have salami every now and then but I I make sure that it's the you know it has as few spices and Seasonings and sugar and things added to it as possible I strictly avoid you know anything just red you know you know that's going to have a bunch of like peppers and all that other sort of stuff in it so I don't want any of that um even though it might taste nice I know that it's not going to make me feel my best so I avoid that also you know I mean bologna is one thing I mean that's cheaper obviously spam things like that salami is pretty expensive so you know if like you're you know if you're you're going for salami it's probably more for a treat and an exception is something that that sort of uh you know nice to have and and that and that's fine but just you know make sure that it's not bringing in too much nasty stuff I certainly wouldn't have it every day or certainly not in large large quantities um and it is it is generally more expensive anyway so I would I would stick mostly to the whole meats you know just a cut of beef or chicken or fish or pork or lamb that you cook yourself and you prepare yourself that's always going to be cheaper that's nearly always going to be more nutritious and so that that's what I would mainly focus on if you want some salami every now and then just try to make sure it doesn't have a whole bunch of garbage in it and but it's certainly going to be better than the alternative but for optimal results you know stick to the whole Meats yeah what do you think Dave yeah I I avoid them just uh just because it's hard to get anything without lots of preservatives lots of sugars and all that kind of stuff and so yeah stay away as far as I'm concerned um hey Corey and issama thank you for the five Canadian dollars thank you very much and uh also we've got uh Cool Tech dreamer two dollars Super Chat thank you very much thank you all for what you do for the community BBE nice thank you very much okay so let's uh let's go with another question here mama bear Lynette do any of you make coffee in a French press I cannot seem to get it right but I really want to uh I don't uh Sean how about you I do not actually I've never used a French press I've used the coffee maker that's about as about as high tech as I got so I don't thank you Larry Larry uh yeah Mama Bear and she actually asked this on one of our videos today and uh Cassie's thinking about just doing a how to work a French press video for you mama bear so look look for that um it's if you are familiar with the French Press um if you're a coffee drinker it really drops the acidity down it's a really smooth cup of coffee um which makes consuming it black without the cream or um half and half much easier so keep an eye out for that Mama Bear it's good to see you Dr Chaffey you don't you're not drinking that coffee right laundry and coffee one one thing um that people should be aware of is when you do a French press that you you actually extract uh it's called uh what's it called rancid oils from the from the Coffee Bean and I think it's over 160 degrees Fahrenheit or something like that that that's when that's when they come out it's around there anyway 160 180 whatever anyway you know well under boiling and uh that will bring out those rancid oils and those those have uh deleterious effect on your blood pressure so it can actually Spike blood pressure so that's where like cold brew coffee comes in because it's it's too low of a temperature to pull out those those fats and melt them out of the of the seed but also filter coffee filter coffee tends to filter out and take out those oils um so it's just something to think about you know I you know I I agree that you know the French Press you know probably tastes better and it's nicer but that's something to think about especially if someone who has blood pressure issues you should you should definitely um think about that I was actually speaking to someone the other day and they were sort of had they started having blood pressure issues out of nowhere and that was one of the things it was just like okay are you doing this you know are you having espressos having french press sort of thing so that's something that you you want to think about um as well so if you're having sort of blood pressure issues you'll probably need to go to filter or just get rid of it and the the thing too with um with with the cream and stuff like that I think that's probably the only redeeming you know part of like a coffee is is the is the cream uh or the milk because you know at least that's at least that's animal fats and things like that that are that are going to be good for you so uh obviously you don't want to add sugar but but the cream part uh you know probably the best part of that whole equation I'm addicted Dr chafee yeah yeah that's one of the things that like so many people like they go carnivore but they're like you're not touching my coffee okay you just get them we tried the lion diet last last month and I made it three days brother without coffee yeah I woke up with a headache that you wouldn't believe yeah well you know one thing you can do three days in yeah sorry well you know uh show those headaches those are real you know I mean those those can be really bad but you know what you can do is you can you can just take uh like small dose of like a caffeine pill right you can get some no-do's cut them up in half or quarters and you get that headache you just take one of those that'll be enough to get rid of the headache but it's a lot less caffeine than your than you're normally having and it keeps you away from from the coffee right and so if you want the caffeine a to wake you up or B to Stave off the withdrawal headaches you know then then you can take a caffeine you can just take caffeine you can you can buy that it's actually a lot cheaper you can get on Amazon you can get 200 pills uh for eight bucks right so that's like two Starbucks right two cheap Starbucks and and um and then and you don't get all the other things right so you're getting the caffeine which is what you want but you're not getting 150 000 other chemicals that are in coffee right so 150 000 chemicals in coffee okay so we we just want the one just the caffeine and uh but you can get that in a pill and it's much cheaper as well and if you're if you are trying to come off of it and wean yourself off of it that's a good way of getting through the withdrawals and then you're taking far less and the next day maybe you have a headache but it's going to be less and it's going to be less it's going to be less and you're taking less and so you can actually wean yourself off of it uh that way as well and that's something that people have uh had some success with well when when I attempted again like torturing myself and giving up coffee then I'll think about it thank you well you know last week when Cassie was on with you guys and you guys were in The Green Room she's like a lot of what Dr chafee said you were like planting the seeds in her head she's talking about giving up coffee so yeah yeah you know it it's like if you if you're if you're just eating meat and you're drinking coffee as well I mean I mean you're doing so much better than than you would before but you know I've I definitely notice a difference like I don't drink coffee not because you know someone you know said oh you probably should I just I don't want it like when I drink coffee I feel markedly worse and so it's just like that's that's not that's not uh something that I want you know I cut it out for five months and then added it back like a dummy yeah that's a lot yeah five months and then I added it back and like honestly I swear I drink coffee and have less energy now like I had more energy when I didn't drink coffee it's so crazy but I love the taste of coffee I'm addicted I'm something wrong with my head I don't know it's so bitter you know I mean it's objectively bad right you know it's like you we like um but people get used to it as an acquired taste just like whiskey and things like that but it actually doesn't taste good like a Coke you know or a steak where it's just like wow that's that's delicious you know it's uh it tastes bad but then we like see these like varying degrees of bad like like alcohol or beer you know beer and wine things like that you know the kid at first Jesus God what is that you know then you're going like oh wine tasting tour or like a like a whiskey you know tour experience or something like that you're trying this one on this one this has this different nose and this different thing now you're like thinking about it when you think about this wretched flavor difference like oh and that's what they were going for they were going for that that horrible taste and like this is why and this is what it and for some damn reason you can you can taste that stuff now and you start to appreciate it more it's weird I think it's just it's brainwashing but it's like but I noticed it as well yeah I couldn't stand I always wanted to like Scotch you know but I never did and then I did like a scotch tasting thing like in Scotland and all of a sudden it was just like in my head I could taste these different notes and do these things all of a sudden I liked whiskey the same thing with beers and and wines and things like that so it's it's weird how that can get in your head when you start thinking about you know the different types of awful that these things taste and now for some reason you like them maybe in comparison to other things that are just way worse you know you're like in high school for those who those of us who drank in high school you know you can't afford mushroom access so much and you're getting this vodka that tastes like you know nail polish remover actually tasted like mail I was like looking at I kept looking at the bottle I was like is this nail polish remover this is horrible and uh and is and you're just you're just trying to do that because you want to get the effect and then all of a sudden you get to get to college and get some smearing off you're like oh my God this is amazing it's so good you know it's still alive oh my God dudes Jesus I think I'm Greg Mad Dog I think twice those are two those are two very bad experiences those are two very bad days yeah not good stuff yeah it's like I mean the stuff this is like toxic glowing green it looks like the mutagen from like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles you know like people group and stuff end well you mean the more green the more because it's not oh my goodness yeah it's more greeny goodness yeah oh yeah oh you can really taste the green this is good [Laughter] so uh I'd like to see if uh has sent through a super chat um Alex if you've got a question please uh please put it in we're happy to answer your question thank you very much for that super chat um cat lady has sent uh a super uh Super Chat this one was actually directed to you Dr chafee um in a previous question I have a friend with trigeminal neuralgia would the carnivore diet help with this paint uh it very much depends on on the cause of the trigeminal neuralgia there are different causes you can actually get aberrant vessels in your brain that actually move and [\u00a0__\u00a0] because you're just getting this pulse and pressure you can actually move the vessels they can actually move so you know in your arm they're pretty stuck you have a lot of thick tissue that's just sort of holding all that together in your brain it's it's not the same you know certain ones are are stuck in tissue and they're probably not moving anywhere some are more on the surface and they just have sort of loose connective tissue it's called the arachnoid uh Durham or the rachmoid matter that's sort of holding that together and uh and it's just it can sort of move a bit you know and so these things can move and all of a sudden you can get this vessel that's sort of pressing up against your trigeminal nerve and then every time it pulses and beats it's just smacks on that nerve and so just like you know you're on your funny bone your ulnar nerve there you smack that your whole arm goes numb that's basically having a blood vessels just tap it tap it tap it tap it tap it just constantly with every every beat so if that's the cause probably not probably you might need a surgical Intervention which is something you sort of make a decision there take a little bit of bone out work your way down and put a piece of Teflon in between those vessels and the nerve there are other ones that are just sort of from from different reasons sometimes you do uh like a like an ablation or Orizon where you sort of stick a needle in and sort of nuke the the trigeminal nerves as they're coming out so it depends on the cause but it will definitely reduce the inflammation and experience of that pain in general right so when people have pain neurological pain or physical pain or arthritic pain all these sorts of things that that ex that damage or that you know aberrant um Anatomy that is that is going to you know uh be a problem right but when you have a lot of inflammation in your body your experience and expression of pain the amount of pain signal that goes up that nerve is increased so your experience of the same injury or the same issue like arthritis is going to be worse right and so that can certainly be the case in neurological issues as well so when people have you know nerve compressions and things like that and they go on to a ketogenic carnivore diet a lot of them can actually experience less pain it's not going to free up the compression but they can experience less uh symptoms as a result of that other people that have had surgery decompressed uh their their back or their nerves or whatever but the nerve has been damaged in such a way just from years of compression that the pain doesn't actually go away and we tell hey look we don't have any anything we can do for you anymore unfortunately the nerve just has to heal or or it won't um I have seen people go on a carnivore diet and and that you know sort of does the trick and that people had suffering with fibromyalgia which is just sort of you know sort of a non-specific pain disorder or it's usually a diagnosis of exclusion where people basically you know half you know doctors you speak to think it's it's made up you know this is just in their head or they're just drug seeking or they're just you know uh just being a bit of a whiner you know but I've I've seen people extremely uh afflicted by this and what I think is most telling is that when people have had fibromyalgia and sciatica pain all these sorts of things that they're being treated with with opiates and other sorts of painkillers for over a decade and then all of a sudden you know they they go on a carnivore diet and they said within a month they were able to come off they said they for the first time in 12 years they were off opiates and all other painkillers and they were just so happy about it so that's obviously not drug seeking Behavior that's obviously not someone who who wants to get high and is pretending to be in pain that's someone who is in pain and is trying to survive and they're like oh thank God I can get off those things so after 12 years of that stuff they were able to get off and I had a number of people tell me about that so I did a I did a video on my YouTube channel about you know um you know pain and fibromyalgia and where I sort of spoke about this look at the comments the comment said there are hundreds of people who have all had the same experience where they had some sort of serious neurological pain fibromyalgia sciatica you know radiculopathy trigeminal neuralgia you know and they said that like nothing worked this finally worked and they're so happy so it's it's pretty incredible it does depend on the Cause right but I think overall it will probably reduce symptoms at least and so and it's going to improve their their life in a number of different ways anyway but you know they need to see they need to see a neurologist a neurosurgeon really a neurosurgeon um and to you know get an MRI and to see uh you know what's what's precipitating their trigeminal neuralgia but you know it's one of those things in neurosurgery that you can actually fix which is great you can't fix a lot of things you know unfortunately uh this is you know a neurosurgeon I worked with when I was a medical student love trigeminal neurologists because he he said that that was something he could actually fix you know he said that 60 of his patients would be dead within two years right he's dealing with brain cancer very aggressive brain cancers you know by and large he said that but trigeminal neuralgia is something that I can fix he's like I love trigeminal neuralgia you know that's something you can you can give someone back their life you can fix the problem whereas a lot of other people you can't unfortunately so it's important to go and see somebody uh qualified that can sort of give them a proper diagnosis but at the same time you can always start a carnivore diet and see how that helps is going to help in a thousand other ways anyway and I would I would uh expect and be very optimistic that it will improve their symptoms and that it that the pain won't be as bad that's what I would expect to see because I've seen that happen before but again it depends on what's causing it nice thank you now uh we've just got a super check come through again see um my four-year-old was diagnosed last year with cardiomyopathy he didn't have it prior because we took him to the cardiologist when he was two can Carnival reverse covert induced cardiomyopathy Dr JP I don't know I mean we don't we don't really have data on that but it is true that you know just like with cancer and any sort of other issue that if you're giving your body you know the right tools and the right materials to optimize their health and excluding out all those other things that are going to disrupt the immune system disrupt your normal workings increase inflammation and so on that that's that's going to you know be a problem so your body can heal from a lot of things I I don't know if they can heal from this we don't really have data on it because it's it's uh it's brand new and we certainly don't have carnivore data on it we don't even have keto data on it but it will improve your immune system it will improve things overall you'll eliminate out things that are bad for his body and you'll give him everything his body needs to be as healthy and successful as possible to be and so if it's possible for his body to naturally heal this eventually which your body can heal a lot of things if you just sort of get out of its way um you know he's gonna I I believe that he'll have his best shot doing that on a biologically appropriate High fattening based diet thank you Okay so we've got another Super Chat here just uh okay so um a koreanism has in Canada carnivore with protein in the urine yes um I think wouldn't wouldn't carnivore producing a protein in your urine because you're not consuming everything else that's causing the increased damage of the kidney yeah yeah most likely you know I mean so people have different reasons for having protein in their urine but you know if you have some sort of you know uh retinopathy where you're you're leaking proteins you shouldn't really get through into the urine protein that means there's some sort of you know damage and and the um you know glomerular sort of filtration system that uh you know so these big proteins proteins are generally too big to get through that um and so you know you wouldn't um you don't you don't normally see an appreciable amount or a detectable amount of protein in your urine but so something's happening there but more protein you know eating more protein has been shown to actually improve kidney function and a carnivore diet can certainly do that as well because hey you're getting more of the materials that you need to be healthy like protein like fat but also you're eliminating out exactly as as you said Dave that you're eliminating out different things that are implants that are that are directly nephrotoxic such as oxalates and other sorts of things right so things are that are going to do direct damage to your kidneys so I would expect that to improve but you know with with anybody in any situation any medical condition any genetic condition You're Still Human and as a human you still have uh you know the same optimal diet as every other human being on earth right every line with any medical condition still should eat what lions eat every elephant that has any sort of genetic dissimilarities or medical issues is still an elephant and should still eat what the other elephants are eating and so on right and and we're we're the same so there is something optimal for humans to eat just like there is something optimal for Lions to eat for blue whales to eat for orcas to eat for salmon to eat for hummingbird seed right there is something optimal for every species of animal okay we are the same species and so you know you just if you're doing that and I think it's a carnivore diet that's what I believe all the best evidence shows that we've been doing this for millions of years predominantly meat if not exclusively meat in certain areas at certain times then you know if that's what we've been doing for so many millions of years that is definitionally what we're designed to eat because we are we you know we were either designed this way as Homo sapiens or you know we've we've evolved this way and we've been exposed to this for millions of years that means that we are adapted to it you know it does take a long time to adapt to things millions of years is more than enough right so if we've been doing something for millions of years we are very well adapted to that right and then people saying like no no no we're more adapted to plants that we haven't eaten in two million years we just started eating last week okay well that's not the case you know why would you say that something we've been eating for two million years and by definition would be adapted to thoroughly would not be better for us than something we just added in than broccoli which doesn't exist in nature which you know corn that doesn't exist in nature mangoes that don't exist in nature in the form that we eat them you know so you know eating what you're biologically designed to eat will always be the right the right decision I can't I can't think of a single exception to that you know I'm there might be you know but you know just biologically it doesn't make sense you know because we're designed to eat a certain way and if you know if we had some sort of condition that went like oh my God meat's going to kill you that would have been that would have been worked out of the of the species a long time ago and maybe like a de novo you know genetic sort of uh uh change but you know I've I've never heard of one anyway certainly not anything that's that's described in any medical textbook that I've come across nice thank you uh Larry question for you looks like you have rosacea has it improved since uh CD yeah yeah it's actually improved a lot um a lot of this is my CPAP machine because my my mask right now is a little older so I gotta have it on really tight but my it's probably cleared up 50 percent uh from carnivore I remember when I quit drinking and it's been over eight years now um you know it's like a badge of Shame you know my face yeah I I thought it would never get better and um it did a little bit from quitting the alcohol but when I started eating really the ketogenic diet is when I started seeing it clear up and then with carnivore it did even more I have old pictures I've shown on the channel before where you know it's pretty bad but a couple other things that the carnivore diet has helped um as far as my alcoholism goes is uh neuropathy pretty bad in uh my four uh small toes on both feet and that has gotten about 50 better since being on the carnivore diet they used to tingle and I used to have a lot of pain associated with it not just the numbness but now it's they're they're still numb but I really don't have any discomfort from it anymore and that's been a huge Improvement which just you know quality of life is definitely improved you know it's not annoying me um one other thing is uh when I very first quit drinking I was having severe bouts of um vertigo so bad that I went and saw a doctor at I after I got out of rehab and I was in rehab almost six months and they they diagnosed me with Meniere's disease which I mean it was debilitating my it would hit me so hard I couldn't even drive a car and at the time I was driving for a living and I remember the doctor telling me yeah you know you might have to go on disability there's no cure for this and I was like waiting says it's hard to prove and I fell into a depression it was like if if anybody's dealt with vertigo it's just it's it just crushes your spirit because if you feel like there's nothing you can do um but it after I got sober it cleared up um thank God but I still had really bad tinnitus in one ear ringing in my ear and ever since carnivore that has gone completely away but it still ramps up every once in a while you know maybe for a day or two but I'll go you know one two months without no ringing no I haven't had vertigo in forever so uh if yeah if you're if you are drinking alcohol man break those chains give it up but yeah I still got a little bit of that you know that Badge of Shame so appreciate that too Brett thank you and just to say eight years that's awesome Lara yeah that's great thank you I'm proud of you guys man both y'all I mean in the same thing like I I relate to you guys on that on that regard you know both you guys come you know coming off of alcohol and getting getting Subway getting clean and that happened for me the day before my 18th birthday so um it's definitely something that every time someone asks me about alcohol you know you gotta obviously as with everything else you got to decide what's right for you for me alcohol has never added anything to my life it's only taken away and it's only you know for whatever reason with carnivore is it's like you you start working on one thing and you progressively make things so much better and alcohol is one of those things that I've only see it destroy people who get get caught up on it and I think that you'll find very quickly that the more of those things you start taking out of your life the better off you're gonna be down the road just add things to your life that builds you up to get you to your goals that help you uh you know um down the road rather than harm you or potentially could harm you so I'm proud of you guys and I love you guys man thanks brother cheers so um maybe uh Sean you want to take this question first how can you lose fat if you're eating fat shouldn't you eat lean meat and have your body use your body fat if you're overweight well I don't know but it works um so you know so every cell in your body needs fat and so I mean you know honestly you don't eating fat doesn't make you fat um eating fat adds energy add fuel to your body but I did add protein as well you know um so you know I don't even know I don't even know where to go with that one uh other than you know I did add a lot of fat and I've heard people say the same thing but you know for me it was my insulin in my um um blood sugar that that I was having issues with and whenever you continuously Spike those things whenever you you know your meta your your hunger signals and everything everything in your body's off you're not giving it the nutrients that you need and everything takes fat to all your hormones every blood you know your blood everything so it's not like you're just adding fat eating fat that's adding fat onto your body um so maybe take your or Larry somebody can explain that a little better than me but I just know that it does work JV yeah so you just you just have to remember that that fat is not just an energy source it's not just a calorie you know I think we should we should really try to drive that out of our head that all those calories and calories are are an insane way to measure uh you know the energy that we get from food or the nutrients we get from food calories or when you burn something in a in a bomb calorimeter in a lab and how much heat energy is expressed from that reaction right we're not combustion engines right so you that that might be useful when you're talking about you know you know you know high octane gas you know and the differences in in fuels because you're going to a combustion engine has no relation to what happens with us there are dozens of different carbohydrates they have unique chemical interactions with other molecules in your body that have hormonal interactions and and can express and and uh suppress uh various hormones different carbohydrates they're all carbohydrates they all have four grams of of uh of you know one gram um equals four kilocalories of of heat as expressed so that just must be what it is no these are these are complex organic molecules that have complex chemical reactions in your body same with all the dozens of amino acids and all the different fatty acids these are these are unique chemicals and they have unique chemical interactions in your body first of all you cannot you cannot use trans fats or uh you know for for energy at all you can't cut these things trim them burn them anything like that they just get stored and packed away in your your arteries and things like that and kill you right so there's no energy there from trans fats right and when you cook with seed oils they turn into trans fats you know at least partially and uh and those different seed oils and omega-6s you get an abundance of these things you have to just store it in your fat because you can't use it as energy right so these things are not just calories right we should get rid of that thought in our head so fat is an essential nutrient not only is it an essential nutrient it is a conglomeration of a number of essential nutrients essential fatty acids essential fat soluble vitamins right so you need these things you know it's not just it's not just enough to just get lean stuff oh that we don't want fat I have fat so I can use that fat no you don't have all the fat soluble all the necessary nutrients that are just sitting in your fat you know that's stored energy that's not necessarily stored nutrients bad soluble vitamins and and so on and and generally you're storing fat a lot of these things can be omega-6s your body's just sequestering out as people have greater adiposity they have a higher proportion of that adiposity as omega-6s right and so you can't use the those is energy you don't want all of that stuff right it's just you just you're sequestering it away to sort of get it out of the way right so you know you need you need fat because it's an essential nutrient and you generally eat around gram per gram a gram of of fat to a gram of protein right so that's about where you most people line up and then you know everyone's going to be a bit individual on their needs and demands um but it is true that your body will prioritize you know using the energy that's available from you know from uh breaking those Bonds in fat and making ketones and things like that from your your fat source and in fact when you just get away from carbohydrates you lower your insulin you change your hormonal workings of your body and you can now access your fat stores because High insulin blocks lipolysis so it blocks the cleavage of of your your fat tissue and and proteolysis blocks the cleavage of those of those molecules to then make into ATP and use for energy so you know you you're fixing your hormones first and foremost and you're letting your body work normally you're able to access your your body's fat stores but that doesn't mean that you don't need those nutrients those fat soluble nutrients that come with it you do and but you will find that your appetite isn't as great as it will be my when I got down to a stable body fat percentage my appetite literally doubled basically overnight it was like one day I was just eating sort of like just a fatty rib eye and it was like the next day I'm like nope I need to and it was just like two every day after that you know and it was just like it just hit and my body was just like yep that's it that we're not we're not tapping into the stores that's the rainy day fund you know now you've just got you've got to bring home the bacon you know we're not We're Not Gonna We're not gonna do it anymore and so you know that that's what I found and so your body will still prioritize you know energy usage from your fat stores you don't you don't have to mess with it your body knows what it's doing we we try to micromanage you know one of the most complex systems that exists in the universe right we have trillions of cells and those have tens of thousands of interactions with other cells at all times inside those trillions of cells you have trillions of molecules that have just that are having trillions of chemical interactions every millisecond right so trillions times trillions times trillions I mean this is just insanely complex you're never going to figure it out you're never going to micromanage that what you need to do is just give your body what it is asking for what it needs and just stay the hell out of its way you know Gophers don't try to micromanage their diet right squirrels don't either you know koalas don't pull out a calculator to figure out their macro right you don't have to right because nature is natural it just happens so if you're able to if you're just eating and you're eating like that fatty steak tastes good your body's saying eat the damn steak you know that's what it wants you to do oh no I I should reduce the amount of fat because X Y no you shouldn't you should listen to your body if you're if you're out of if you're staying out of your own way if you're not eating things that will disrupt your hormones disrupt your signaling pathway you know make your brain think something else is happening then is actually happening then you're gonna actually listen to your body and and that's so that's what I would do you know is just eat what you're supposed to eat fatty meat right don't eat anything else it's going to screw with your system right and after that you just eat this Society because you'll get negative feedback on on your taste right it tastes good at first because your body wants those nutrients but every time you you eat something every time you take a bite of that something it actually gets negative feedback it tastes less good and less good and less good and less good and eventually it doesn't taste good and sometimes the lean meat is going to taste amazing and fatty Illinois don't really want it you know just listen to that your body's telling you how much lean it wants how much fat it wants so you should just listen to that if you're limiting what what you're eating you know like yeah maybe you can you can starve yourself into into a smaller dress size but you know Works in concentration camps all the time right but that doesn't mean that that's good for you that doesn't mean that's the most optimal way to do it doesn't mean that you're improving your health and your metabolism in the way that that you could right because if you're if you're chronically limiting the amount of nutrients your body's getting your body thinks because your body's gonna hey I'm giving them the signal I'm saying hey bring it in they're not bringing it in so that means that it's not available and so okay we need to we need to shut this down we need to stop these biochemical processes we need to slow down our metabolism because we don't have the resources coming in necessary you know you're not just redlining your car until it blows up right you have to say okay no we need to slow this down and and that's what it's doing so you're going to slow down your metabolism you start eating something else again you start eating more and all of a sudden you're going to put on weight I don't like that you know and so you're going to you're going to have these problems this is why these yo-yo diets come in you starve yourself you CR you trash your metabolism then you go back eating just the same thing you're eating before maybe even cleaner than you were before and you put on more weight than you lost why the hell is that right well it's because you destroyed your your metabolism so you want to encourage your metabolism you want to show your metabolism in your body and your biochemistry like hey we've got an abundance of resources we have more than enough we have exact exactly what you're asking me for always giving you what you want always giving you what you want right we can ramp this this sucker up we can start healing things repairing things recycling things and using this energy to you know go and you know fight cheetahs and things like that so it's um it's the signals that you're giving your body are going to have a very very profound effect on your health and your weight loss and so that's something that I would keep in mind so again just fat is an essential nutrient it's something your body needs to have it's not just a calorie Source it's not that's just that word should be stricken from the Lexicon and it's not just a source of energy okay it is nutrition it is necessary and so just give your body what it needs it is hereby banished from us from his forth henceforth not hear the word my body's definitely telling me the two rib eye thing now I'll tell you that right now yeah by the time you start eating more no I'm scared of three I'll do it foreign for only seven days so far any ideas on where I can go out with a girlfriend to eat Lone Star um I've never been to launch I'm assuming that's a restaurant but uh most most places will have you know meat on on the menu um there are a couple steak houses that I've that I've been to um was like meat and wine Co they do they do pretty good steaks and um you know we went to the this place called Epicurean which is like a buffet at uh like the casino here it's called Crown casino and that's actually pretty good so as a buffet has a lot of different options but they have a lot of really good meat options especially on the weekend and uh like especially on the weekend they have amazing meat selections on the weekend so I I posted a couple pictures when I went there like on my Instagram just like the plate just piled with just every animal that nino sits you know come near that kitchen and and um and that's good you know it's really good but uh you know I tend to you know cook a lot you know and especially because you know at this point I mean I make Stakes better than than any restaurant I've been to one steak that came close was Rock pool and that's that's a restaurant here but I did I went to the one in Melbourne and uh that was great but that was like a 90 day dry age like super special crazy steak and that was that was just like yep that's that's as good as my steaks I make on a daily basis right and the ones that are like super special like whatever that mine would be still better than that right but that was the first one that I ever came across that was as good as the ones I make just like on a Tuesday you know and it was like 250 bucks it was like right it was like mine are more 20 bucks and uh you know for two and a half pounds you know and so it's it's um it's a big difference in in price but you know if if you want to go out and do something nice with your girlfriend there are places to go I mean there are plenty of steak houses you know I like the meat and wine Co there's another one that I'm forgetting um that's just in downtown Perth obviously Rock pool there's Epicurean there's that fire restaurant f-y-r-e um that's the guy John Mountain who's a really nice guy I've met him and I plan on going to um uh to his restaurant he does a lot of meat a lot of meat sort of stuff so obviously there's going to be sides and things like that you just you just order the meat main dish ask for it without the sauces and Seasonings and you and you say you don't need the sides you know thank you and um you know a lot of places a lot of steakhouses and things like that generally do the steak a la carte you know you have you have to order all the sides with it you only get the steak if you order the steak um John um in a bit of a of uh of a tiff with um uh some of the vegans down here there was a vegan that came to his restaurant and messaged him and he was actually very accommodating they had while I'm a vegan I want to come to your restaurant first of all it's a steakhouse right it's a meat restaurant you know I don't go to a vegan restaurant go oh you know I'm actually a carnivore can you accommodate me and uh Slaughter your uh lamb and bring it in you know it's just like it's like and he was just like oh okay I'll I'll figure something out who's gonna make a special dish just for her you know to accommodate her vegan things and that had salads and all that sort of stuff that she could have ordered but she he was just like you know look I'm I'm happy to make something special for you well on the night that she came in he was actually at a at a private engagement doing a private catering event and and I wasn't there and had just basically been so busy that he slipped his mind he forgot about it and um so she ordered a salad or whatever and then wrote a review and um you know it was just sort of like well this was disappointing that that this happened and he was just like we'll do that part I'm fully aboard you know I dropped the ball there um you know and I feel bad about that and like to make it up for her but but then she went on to say well this is just shows that he's just he's just a poor quality chef and he's just terrible he just can't accommodate blah blah he's like all right no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna accept that and so he's just like look you know this is this is a this is a meat based restaurant this is a steakhouse um no vegans vegans are not allowed vegans are now banned from the from the premises I will not be accepted and he had had it on the the Instagram page for the the the restaurant um and for people that they're in the area fire f-y-r-e it's just sort of Northern suburbs and um and Connolly I think the the areas and um and so it's just that it's just like you know for you know from henceforth you know no vegan shall be shall be allowed and uh for mental health reasons right [Laughter] obviously they thought they're talking about them but he's like no for my own mental health I just don't want to deal with this crap and uh and obviously I have the huge backlash that you would expect um you know from the vegan Community because the thing is too is that she was like a like an influencer or something like that but like the whole vegan crowd just went nuts and they all started going on like you know like review apps and Google reviews and all these sorts of things and they all they left no review but just one star review one star one star one star one star just to trash his reputation and his rating and things like that they'd never been there you know they're just trying to destroy his business which is really shitty and so he was just like nope not doing that and uh and so he's been he's had some run-ins with the vegan protesters coming in and like playing like you know screaming pig noises and things like that I was like oh my God I'm gonna get like the police in the wall this absolute just headache and Nightmare and uh yeah I really feel bad for the dude but at the same time you know a lot of people have sort of risen up like good for you you know we're all tired of this you know um this strong arm tactics from people you know you want to do what you want to do that's fine but you you don't get to you know bully other people um your way of thinking you know because we don't agree with you we don't agree that it's better for the planet we don't agree it's better for the animals you have to kill more animals to grow one kilo of of plant-based protein than animal-based protein you are killing more animals you are destroying the environment and uh that's not the nicer thing to do and so you don't get you don't get to force that on people and um but yeah so so people people stood up for him and and like his his uh get like tripled their business like basically overnight because they're like yep I like this guy like the cut of his jib I'm gonna go down there so you can try that as well so fire fire restaurant sorry Sean you were gonna say something oh no I was getting fired up I was like man if we buy the charge hail with a water pistol or something like yeah like so it's not good for the planet it's not good for the environment it's not good for me you know yeah I want for your kids for anybody you know I I'm a big Advocate like you figure out what's good for you you have to make that decision but you dang sure not gonna tell me what I gotta do you know so I don't know if I was going to just mention to him you know he didn't ask me a question if you want a date or take her out if you want to if you want to marry a grill at home [Laughter] well you know but it is true that you know some people like to yeah like to date you know and they like to you know go out and go on a special night out and you know not have to cook and things like that but you know just remember there's always meat on the menu you know and if you're you know so you can just order the meat dish you know and um and just and just go from there and if and if you go to a steakhouse you're done you know you just order a steak and it doesn't even need to be be an issue you know because normally steaks just come out just as the steaks you know they don't have a whole bunch of sides and you know if you don't eat the sides and you don't draw attention to it no one's going to pay attention to you either you eat the steak and go oh yeah I'm not full you know and uh and no one cares no one cares the end of the day the less you care about it the less attention you draw to it the less other people will pay attention to it and care about it you know it's it's the difference between someone just walking casually down the road and some sneaking like this I mean like what the hell is that guy doing you know and you're gonna notice that you know and uh and so if you just walk and you just you know that this is totally normal it's going to be totally normal I do this for five years in my early 20s it wasn't doing carnivore I was just like plants are toxic I'm not going to eat them and so I just stopped eating them I had no conversations with anybody at any time about it ever you know I don't remember a single time I actually spoke maybe just mentioned to my brother because I was living with him at the time my parents oh yeah you know you know don't eat these things had no conversations no conversations just like yeah this is what I'm doing and I just I just didn't talk about it I was just like no I'm not gonna eat that okay I'll eat that part whatever and because I was just eating the parts that I wanted to eat and just not say anything about it literally no one ever at any time said anything right and you know now that I'm more conscious about it you know then then it starts coming up in conversations more or especially when I was a bit more self-conscious about it when I would go out to restaurants and things like that or with people I felt I needed to sort of justify what I was doing because I I was doing something consciously now and it was it felt a bit weird and then again as soon as I stopped caring or paying attention to it really doesn't come up again So Christine thank you very much for the kind Super Chat um if you've got a question please punch it in um and uh Gemma thank you also and uh titanium Master thank you very much very kind of you all okay um and we've got another one here from Mac main doc thanks for your answer to we're doing Q a I'm trying to maintain carnivore and stay fit former special ops but it is insanely difficult to discipline oneself from carbs any words of motivation and encouragement thanks yeah well you're you're very welcome that's that's awesome that uh that you used to do do special ops and thank you for for your service to whatever country you served um it is hard to get away from carbs but just remember that uh you know like anything addictive uh there is an end of and there is a light at the end of the tunnel right so even even major drugs like cocaine and heroin people do get off them and you know after a couple weeks you know you that chemical addiction is is significantly improved and same thing with carbs and sugar and things like that I usually find it about two week Mark that people uh don't really have as much Cravings maybe they remember liking them oh that was good but they don't have the like I need to eat this sort of craving that that they may have had earlier on also remember that any sort of carb craving or anything like that uh could be your brain telling you that you're just hungry because your hunger signals are so different on a carnivore diet that uh sometimes your brain's just trying to scream at you in different sorts of ways and so if you're if your bread really smells good or you really hmm I really want to eat that bread or that pizza or that whatever ask yourself am I hungry do I need to eat something try eating meat and eggs fatty meat and eggs and eat until it stops tasting good if it tastes good that means yes you are hungry okay and that's what that was that craving that that expression of uh eat these carbs was your body telling you to eat right so eat eat food eat meat fatty meat and eggs and keep eating until they stop tasting good your carb Cravings will be ex you know severely diminished if not you know eradicated completely and then you just keep doing that and you just make sure you stay full you know Dr Baker said something you know people said how much should I eat and he said eat enough that you don't have carb and sugar Cravings right that's that's a pretty good rule of thumb if you're ever getting those Cravings you probably should eat a bit more it's not going to get rid of all of them necessarily early on but eventually it will and usually after about two weeks most people don't miss them and um you know and staying fit is is generally very easy you're just eating enough meat and working out which is something I'm sure you don't have a problem with on the on the exercise side of things and just eating enough meat so in order to maintain muscle mass put on muscle mass and and build lean lean muscle mass and things like that you just need to eat enough you need to work out and you also need to eat enough meat and by eating enough fatty meat to meet your body's demands for your Fitness and your exercise you're also going to suppress those carbs so just remember there's a light at the end of the tunnel it's usually about two weeks you make it to those two weeks you're usually in the clear after that and that if you're getting these Cravings before or after those two weeks think am I hungry I should eat something if you're getting those Cravings try eating fatty meat that generally suppresses it if you're eating enough fatty meat every day until you're full until it meets stop fatty meat stops tasting good that will generally suppress those carb Cravings a lot and so just remember okay you've done special ops you've gone through crazy sorts of you know uh trials and boot camps and all these sorts of things that lasted way more than two weeks right so you can do you can tough it out for two weeks I know you can right uh you know we've all done it right and we're not special ops right so I know that you can do this right so you just you just you know just balls your way through it and just be like right I'm gonna make it through two weeks that's my my mark there and and you and those are the tools to do it eat a lot of fatty meat and uh and and you know make sure that you're eating enough uh for your body and that should suppress that and by the time you get to the two weeks those should be extremely uh diminished if not gotten rid of entirely and after that it's just habit you're used to eating bread with your meal you're used to having a donut with your coffee you're used to you know eating the thing things that other people eat and it's just a matter of changing your habits and two weeks in on it is is a very good start but there's a that addiction should be pretty much gone at that point nice so super Jovi Thank you for the Super Chat and never finish an entire steak do you recommend throwing it in a blender and just drinking it Larry how do you how do you feel about blending your steak Ah that's a no-go for me uh when I when I got my dentures I actually thought about doing that um but I I ended up having to learn to eat again with Saltine crackers I had to go off carnivore for a couple weeks but uh yeah you know I but I really did consider trying that because Cassie and I had been back on Carnivore uh for about a month when actually so I could lower my blood pressure to get my teeth extracted you know that when I first went in for my appointment the dentist told me my blood pressure was so high that he wouldn't extract my teeth and so I had two options go get back on my lisinopril or get back on the carnivore diet and I chose the carnivore diet and you know my blood pressure normalized it took about six weeks and uh when I yeah that was pure eating beef you know because I was really stressed after a month on Carnivore I'm feeling awesome you know and here I got to get my teeth pulled and it was such a stressful time but finally after uh you know I just gave up I was eating potted meat for those of you who don't know what that is it's like uh Vienna sausages but it's just it's nasty meat that can and I tried that for a couple days and I just I just couldn't do it so uh what about you Sean you ever Blended up a nice big fat rib eye honestly I I haven't uh I have not so but I ain't mad at you however you got to get it get it brother um well I I would just say that um you know if you can't finish the steak and your body's telling you to stop then you can just stop you don't have to force yourself to eat anymore um yeah exactly so you know and that's great that you are getting there you know and if you're losing weight you're losing fat and things like that you'll get to a point that you know your your hunger starts going up but I try to have leftovers right I I try to make more than I think I'm going to want so that I know that I'm saturating my body's desire to to take in fatty meat right so so I will you know if I am you know if it's a one steak day or two steak day you know I'll sort of make that you know if I get to the end of that going like God that was so good and like I kind of want a little bit more I go and make another one maybe I only eat a quarter of it maybe only eat half but I I eat until my body is is happy with me so if you're getting that already you know with the steaks that you're eating fine you know that's fine you know you put in the fridge you eat it next time it will taste good again even though it's cold you know and so you know when you're when you're hungry that will taste that will taste very good so um the blend of things cracked me up because I I've only seen a couple episodes of that show Shameless but that was actually something that was in that you guys know that where it's like this like degenerate dad is just like a you know alcoholic and you know you know drugs and just like passes out waste it on the floor and you know and sort of like um you know in a more impoverished area in uh Chicago I believe and so it's really about their kids and all these sorts of things and he's just he's just an absolute wastel but that was it he was like he was I had like liver failure from like alcoholism and I couldn't really eat and um and so they're like grab some like walk they had some like waffles and this and syrup you just starts like throwing it in the blender and they're oh no no you don't don't want to do that like pouring syrup in it and just pour some water oh no you don't want to don't oh no don't do that he's like like Blends it up and just starts drinking oh no no that's not yeah he's just doing that it's just like oh my God no I don't think you need to do that um I definitely don't think you need to force yourself uh to uh to eat anything right you know and so you know when I talk to people and they say like hey you know I don't I'm not really enjoying this it takes me two hours to finish a meal like I start I get halfway through and it tastes really good but then it stops tasting good and it's horrible and I have to force myself for two hours to finish it and I just point out to them that no actually you were finished two hours ago you know as soon as that started being a chore to eat you're done you shouldn't do that you don't need to force yourself uh it should be desirable it should be enjoyable and once it stops being enjoyable go do something else you know that's fine so uh yeah I don't think you need to need to power it down well and that's one of the things that I think has kind of helped me be successful as well is for even for months and months on top of months like when I cook steaks or eggs or whatever like I will take and grill five at a time and then I will have one two one and a half whatever I want throw the rest in the fridge so guess what I'm having tomorrow yeah it's already ready and then I I prepare eggs for you know five days at four at four or five days and so when it gets time for my first meal whenever that happens to be in the mornings you know I just go grab my eggs and butter and I eat I'm done like I know what I'm gonna have every single day it's there it's ready and when it doesn't sound good like you said I'm just not hungry that's it Dave what are your thoughts on that yeah um I I can't imagine blending um but yeah I I just stop eating when you're not hungry like I can feel it myself like the amount I eat for breakfast I only have that one meal a day and once I'm getting towards the end I can feel my body's literally telling me yeah you don't just stop now just cut it out just finish and yeah so just keep it for later or yeah just cook something fresh when you're hungry um yeah okay so Dr chafee as a woman I have seen videos saying that I need more carbs or around uh my time in the month is this true I don't I don't think so I mean I've certainly seen uh people people talk about that um I haven't I haven't gone through their you know their specific Arguments for that um but you know I just look at this you know again going to first principles I I've come to this all of this through first principles what are we biologically designed to do what would we have been doing in nature what our species have been doing for the vast majority of our existence right Homo sapiens been around for about 300 000 years right the last hundred years we've had all this processed food and crap like that I mean that's just it's a blink of an eye right so what have people been doing and even Agricultural Revolution right ten thousand well a lot of people are saying it's actually probably 8 000 years ago not even 10 000 years ago right so you're talking about a fraction of a percentage of the time that homo sapiens have been on Earth not even you know other human species that go back sort of two million years before that so what have we been doing then what were we doing in the ice ages what are the Inuits doing right now you know are they are they up in the in the Arctic Circle and then you know one week out of the month they just naturally just go like I need some chocolate you know and so they're just you know putting in some carbs and things like that to help their cycle uh no that I mean they don't have access to it right so and and what would be that what would the natural driver you know to say that no no no you know we're eating this meat we're eating what everyone else is eating but you know I need to go and like just dig for roots or tubers or something like that you know I mean like did that really happen did we get that sort of that sort of instinctual drive to eat something that that other people weren't eating does that happen to any other animal in the world at all even a single one not that I know of you know koalas eat what koalas eat whether they're you know uh just just you know Barren in estrus or we're pregnant or you know uh or nursing they eat what they eat right and same with lions same with whales same with all these sorts of things it's not just like oh no no I'm gonna go into estrus so I need this other thing that's not actually strictly you know to my biological design and and necessary for me so you know you can come up with a lot of different um reasons and rationales and say well you know this influences this and this and this that's all mechanistic right which is fine you want to have a mechanistic uh argument for what you're doing if you can't find a mechanism for what you're talking about you know it may be that you know there isn't one and so but if you're if you're looking at that say oh well but this influences this and this influences this and this and this and so therefore you should eat some carbs because this is going to help your progesterone levels and you're this that and the other but does that happen in real life you know are people that are going on a carnivore diet uh actually you know finding that they're having more difficulty getting pregnant uh no I'm actually they're improving their their fertility you know I mean this is this is why you know Dr Robert kiltz who has like the third largest fertility uh practice in America he uh he he tries to get people on a carnivore diet or at least a keto high fat meat based keto diet but he has vegetarians and and vegans and things like that that come to him as well he meets people where they're at but he you know he says this is the best way to do it eat animal fat you know eat uh eat meat get rid of the carbs get rid of all this other stuff right and so I've never heard him say that no no actually this is really important this actually improves fertility I've never heard him say that I've heard him say that actually you just want to eat eat meat as well and I think from a conceptual standpoint that that it's it's um you you just you're supposed to eat what's optimal for you and that's not gonna that's not gonna change you know based on your time of the month that doesn't that doesn't make sense to me because there will be you know the vast majority of our of our past has been in times when they didn't have a health coach getting on YouTube saying oh yeah this is how you want to micromanage your biochemistry throughout your cycle people just had to live they had to eat what was available to eat you know and so I just I just don't see that being a thing um and so you know a lot of these things you know there was a there was a a sort of a debate more of a discussion uh with uh Georgie dinkoff who's a really nice guy but he's going on you know Dr mccola and other sorts of podcasts talking about how actually you know long-term ketosis is actually bad it's counterproductive you raise your cortisol you can put on visceral fat you can actually gain weight and all these things and that's exactly the opposite of what you know clinicians like myself are seeing in practice when we have patients on a carnivore diet and then there were and it was like but there's these studies that can show that you could raise your cortisol could do these things it could do this other things okay there are other studies that show that you don't and that have a lot of other other sorts of things happening as well so you can you can get a study that'll say anything and so maybe there's a there's some sort of study that suggests that progesterone has improved in some fashion with uh you know carbohydrates but you know at the end of the day there's always going to be some there's that there are other studies that will probably say the opposite and so which ones you trust okay so maybe you don't you don't just look at those studies maybe you look at our biological design maybe you look at our our biological past were we able to do that right because if you're not able to be you know fertile maximize your fertility and your health and and you know procreate your species doesn't make it you know and so how would that work in the ice ages how does that work for the Inuits right now how that worked for the Nanette in the Arctic Circle in Siberia right now how does that work for all these other sorts of populations that only you know historically only eat meat Ethiopia you know and during the time of Herodotus and the Persian Empire you know the Herodotus Chronicle they said that they only ate boiled meat and they only you know would drink you know water and you know the milk of their cattle bit of carbs and lactose sure but you know this these are carnivorous populations throughout history the Inuits don't have milk they're not they're not milking seals and polar bears right they're just they're just eating meat and blubber right they have kids and they have kids in very very very extreme conditions and uh they're it's very hard to do and so infant mortality rates very high so you need to have a lot of kids right and so you know um yeah foreign it's fine to come up you know and have those theories and arguments and things like that I don't see it being a problem in people now and I and and we certainly haven't had that be an issue of any you know of any substance throughout our history when those cards were not available and what would have been the trigger the biological trigger to that I mean you know maybe I don't know maybe this is just an excuse for for you know some people to just go and eat chocolate before they're oh no no I need this you know the doctor told me to I've gotta I've got to have some chocolate and bon bons and things like that it's like this is good for my progesterone um you know I don't know but it's um but what would have been the trigger before that what would have been the trigger you know before we had someone telling us we needed to do that what would have been the trigger during you know uh Paleolithic Era where you know there weren't health coaches people were just living and surviving right and uh and you you killed a buffalo and you brought that back and you ate the Buffalo you know and and why would the women not eat the same thing as the men you know the females of every species eat the same things as the males of the species everywhere you go right the only difference being when mammals or infants their breath they're nursing but then when they weaned they start eating what the adults eat and then they eat that same thing for the rest of their lives right and so you know that's uh that's what we should be doing too I think if you're here today think a carnivore yeah so um guys we've we've been on for two hours now we've still got 568 people in the Stream so um I think we probably should be wrapping it up soon but just we've got a few super chats left so I was wondering if we could do like a lightning round with the final super chair okay but before we start the lightning round there's quite a funny one here that I wanted to show from homesick Buckeye says uh if a koala had my Costco card I bet there would a difference probably it's funny on that about koalas koalas um it may be just because of their design or what I think maybe because they evolved eating this highly toxic and narcotic plant that is eucalyptus is probably actually uh screwed with their brain development I I'm curious to see if you could feed them other sorts of leaves that wouldn't be toxic to them but also wouldn't be as have those same effects maybe there brains would develop differently because they actually don't have like a cortex so this is like the only sort of mammals that doubt so that's that's the part where you actually have conscious thoughts and things like that you know so it's like they have like um uh yeah so it's basically they the the very Primal brains and uh I maybe that's because of what they're eating but um but they're basically really stupid and so uh if you you know if they're in the tree eating eucalyptus they'll do that all day but if you just take eucalyptus leaves and put it on on the on in a pile in front of them they have no idea what the hell it is they won't eat it right it's like it's the yeah they're pretty [\u00a0__\u00a0] it's um uh but it's funny I've always sort of wondered that if it's if it's a brain development thing is that that's just you know their biological design or if it's just that they've they've sort of adapted into eating this highly toxic plant and they're surviving on that and they're doing well and they're being successful on that because no one's competing for resources and they can be pretty safe in those trees um but is that also like damaging them if they sort of ate other or you probably just feed them meat and they would actually do just fine because that's getting getting them what they need to eat and I wonder if that would change their brain development I I suspect it probably would I'm very suspicious about that but yeah that's that's funny or the Costco card yeah so um infj Tyrone asks what is everyone's take on keto testing I found out cheese and shrimp uh knocks me out okay Sean don't eat cheese and shrimp no I'd test the ketones but if your body's burning you know using ketones then you're probably not going to be eliminating a lot of them so testing becomes kind of here nor there at some point right Larry yeah we bought a a meter I don't know about six months ago or no during our fast February and uh why would you check it once in a while just for you know Giggles I as far as uh you know the the strips are expensive so I'm not going to sit there and test every day but most people will tell you there's really no need to just eat your meat and you know your body is wonderfully and beautifully designed it knows what to do so Dr chafee yeah uh yeah I know I agree I've never checked ketones if you are going to check ketones you should check the your blood ketones uh as opposed to the urine urines much less accurate so you check your Bloods but you know if you're just eating meat you know you should just let your body get on with that if you're if you're eating a lot of dairy and and not necessarily cheese but like milk and things like that that have carbs yeah that might that might you know raise your insulin you'll feel a bit tired people generally do and um your insulin's going up it's suppressing Ketone production and you know gluconeogenesis and so on your blood sugar and go down a bit you get a bit drowsy um but in general you know if you know if if things are knocking out and you're and you're feeling a bit drowsy or whatever then yeah just avoid those things you know it's not necessarily a product of your ketones though Inuits have very low Ketone they say oh well these aren't high enough to be in ketosis are they eating any carbs no are they making carbs and glycogen and blood sugar yes they're in ketosis all right I'm sorry this is the this is the biochemical State when you go into that if you're in a Fed State you can't do that when you're in a fasting ketogenic State then then you do do that right and they do that it's just their ketones aren't massively elevated so it really doesn't matter just eat uh just eat meat be happy eat the meat that makes you feel good if if shrimp and cheese are making you feel a bit drowsy or not your best you know just eat something else and and I wouldn't worry too much about the ketones unless you unless you have cancer and you're looking at your gki index your glucose Ketone index that's quite important to keep below two or under one it does seem to that people with with the as low as possible like under one if possible gki for as long as possible that they they can do better uh on cancer yeah Dave any thoughts do you check your ketones um I I did back here with started doing I I couldn't go um and I would say it's a mistake you know just uh measure your progress but say in the mirror are you happy with that are you happy with how you're feeling don't worry about stuff like Ketone testing unless there's some medical reason you need to do it um okay uh what's your take on these people who swear Carnival keto cause sleep disturbance and natural light issues that then reintroduce carbs for Relief Larry ah man if I reintroduce cars for Relief I'm in big trouble because then I'll feel like total hail so there's yeah I mean I had a little bit of insomnia when I first started the carnivore diet um but I I really narrowed that down to my consumption of coffee in the afternoons and once I eliminated that my insomnia issues uh went away so I don't see any reason to introduce carbs at all so Sean uh the Bible says this is like a dog going back to its own vomit isn't that what I just said yeah um you know I mean I have come across people that said that their sleeps get just sleep gets Disturbed with that I I found the exact opposite most people find the exact opposite talk to so many far more people tell me that their sleep has improved dramatically going on a carnivore diet then has been like oh I'm having trouble sleeping it's very very few people in the as a percentage that I've spoken to that have sleep disturbances as opposed to improvements um I was certainly one that improved dramatically I was always a terrible sleeper but now I sleep amazingly well and I don't need as much sleep I get much higher quality sleep as well um I think that you know a lot of these things are going to be individual but you know just like like Claire was saying like a lot of people still drink coffee it's going to affect you much much more on a carnivore diet I the two or three times I've had coffee or caffeine in the last I don't know six years or so I have had it like in the morning and then you had you know buzzed with energy for a few hours and feel like pretty crappy for the rest of the day but at two in the morning I can't sleep you know and I'm just going like what the hell is going on why the hell can't I go to sleep and it's really annoying and so and I've already had the crash I've already felt like crap the rest of the day and so I should be ready to go to sleep but no two in the morning I'm wide awake from that one coffee in the morning and uh and that's really annoying so you know if I don't a lot of people still do this in fact so many people still do it that that there's some detractors of carnivore diet that say oh well that you you have to drink coffee because you don't have fibers you can't move your your bowels you have to you have to drink coffee to force it out no they were already drinking coffee before that you dumb ass you know it was like they just continued to do it you know and if you eat enough that then you don't have any problems with constipation and so yeah um that's what I would say you know is you know what else these people doing are they having any sort of caffeine or this or that or the other um that could possibly do it you know there are some people that that do say that they say I need to have a bit of carb Sally Norton is one of them she's basically 100 carnivore but she she says she has to have a bit of carbs before she but at night to go to bed because again that thing you drink some milk you're going to suppress your ketones you're going to suppress making new blood sugar and liver glycogen and so insulin is going to go up for a bit that's going to suppress that your blood sugar is going to go up for a bit then it's going to go down for a bit and you're gonna go oh your brain doesn't have energy you go to sleep maybe that's what's going on I don't I don't know why the hell else it would but um but I think there's probably some other thing going on that's that's keeping people awake maybe coffee maybe caffeine something like that as far as electrolytes that was something you know we mentioned earlier some people do have a problem when they're when their insulin comes down because insulin has a role to play and the the reabsorption of electrolytes is your kidneys and so now these things are massively high and your body has to compensate by getting rid of more because it wants to keep this in balance and then all of a sudden your insulin goes back to normal because your body was compensating for a high in insulin when it goes back to normal you know that suddenly you know because it's been taking years to sort of slowly ramp up your your insulin more and more and more over you know on on the aggregate you know and now it comes down pretty suddenly maybe it takes a bit of time for your body to adjust to that and maybe you lose you spill out more electrolytes than you want to but how are they testing that are they testing are they getting blood samples blood tests or are they just sort of I feel like my electrolytes are low how would you know how do you know that's what's going on how do you know you're not just having you know withdrawals for something or just having a bad day you know cramps some people you can get cramps usually from low magnesium or in extreme cases like low calcium it's much more commonly uh just dehydration right so you know I know people that have taken a lot of electrolytes and still get all the cramps and still get all the low electrolyte symptoms that they were trying to trying to treat with that and obviously it's not the low electrolytes because they're taking electrolytes right so some people can get a bit of a disturbance in their electrolytes that can happen you know um especially when the insulin is normalizing generally it doesn't it's not long term generally your body will adjust to that you know you're going to take a bit of a bit of electrolytes I think I still think that's a lot better than completely tanking your metabolism and and changing your hormonal uh expression of insulin which affects nearly every other hormone in your body you know it's going to affect your testosterone your growth hormone your estrogen and it's going to cause high blood pressure erectile dysfunction um you know metabolic syndrome is going to cause all sorts of you know hell in your body um is that is that is that is that better than just taking a bit of electrolytes if you need them I don't think so and the vast majority of people don't need to do that and and if they do they only need to do it for a short period of time and again think about what else you're doing are you drinking coffee that'll strip your body of magnesium there you go you know you're going to hit two birds with one stone you're going to get shitty sleep you're getting electrolyte disturbances okay don't drink coffee and um you know and and often it's something simple like that that people just aren't actually doing just meat just water eating to completion and generally when people do that that gets rid of the vast majority of issues people have and drinking of water nice okay so uh Gemma wants to know how do you gain weight on carnivore Larry sure Larry you want to jump in how do you get him away I I've never attempted to gain weight I mean I've fluctuated a little bit on Carnivore but uh I have I have no idea uh eat eat a lot I don't know Sean what's up lift heavy things lift heavy things yeah lift heavy things eat protein eat fat and lift heavy things gaining weight right yeah so there's two ways to gain gain weight on a carnivore diet one is by stopping a carnivore diet and and then you'll gain weight by eating by eating the wrong things or you know adding a bunch of dairy artificial sweeteners these sorts of things will put on bad weight if you want to gain good weight lean muscle mass then exactly what Sean said you need to stimulate your body to grow by by lifting weights and doing sprints and and then giving your body enough nutrients if I'm working out all the time um I'll get leaner and stronger but I won't necessarily get bigger unless I'm eating enough and my appetite will go up and if I'm not able to meet that demand just be from time restrictions and things like that you know I'll put on a bit of weight I'll get in better shape but I won't I won't put on the same mass if I'm able to eat enough you often twice as much as of normally like four or five pounds of meat a day it's hard sometimes hard to do when you have a busy schedule um then you know if I'm able to do that I I put on weight very very easily um that's just my body other people will be different but lift weights you know uh do Sprints things like that that'll stimulate muscle growth right and then just eat until you're full eat until meat stops tasting good uh meet your body's demand and uh and it'll grow you'll be fine you were you were cutting out there Dr Chaffey on my end did you say you eat four to five pounds a day when I'm working out if I'm working out heavily yeah it'll all double normally like two pounds or so maybe a bit more than two pounds a day um and so if I'm that's just normal right right before that I was eating less than that right or maybe a pound or so maybe a pound and a half a day because I actually was working out a lot when I was when I was still cutting fat uh but then like the day that I hit down to like six percent body fat all of a sudden no you need to eat twice as much so I started being eating sort of like you know you know more more weight than that uh more uh more mistake than that after that and then if I'm if I'm just maintaining and just being sedentary it's usually about you know probably around two two plus pounds of me today just to maintain my body and uh and if I'm working out and lifting weights a lot and exercising then it it will easily double I'll basically eat sort of two times a day of two plus pounds in each sitting and uh and if I'm doing that I stack on muscle I mean it's absolutely crazy like I was at one point I was putting on uh about a pound or or more of of muscle every time I worked out it was absolutely insane like every time I just hopped on the scale like at the gym I'd be like a pound up a pound and a half up a pound up a pound up like on leg days you know I after leg days I'd go up like a pound and a half sometimes closer to two pounds nuts absolutely nuts but saying the same lean you know I wasn't putting on any fat and um and it's pretty crazy to watch that but I had I had to be very diligent and make sure that I got enough to eat you have to make sure you're getting enough to eat and I couldn't do that in one sitting I had to do that in two sittings and so um that that could be that can be a bit of a [\u00a0__\u00a0] for people but but yeah that's how you do it you know when covet ended and I was I was down to like I think 205 pounds super light for me very light for me and uh or maybe 210 or something like that yeah whatever and um and in any case you know when when the gyms open back up I'm like right screw this I'm I'm going back I'm going back on my like professional lifting schedule when I was when I was playing rugby and I was just like four days a week at least if not five or six and so it's just like I would get I didn't have time to do like a big three four hour workouts that I normally did but I would I at least got in there for an hour to 90 minutes 60 to 90 minutes minimum I just I just got in there and um and I made a point of doing that and I was able to do that consistently for about five weeks and then I just work out on top of me but in that in those five weeks I put on 25 pounds of lean muscle wow you're not supposed to be able to do that even with steroids you know this is usually not gonna be like lean body mass lean muscle mass in that time that you're going to get a lot of Waterway and other other sorts of crap as well there's just this is just stack on muscle now I had weighed a lot before I I think my heaviest you know with muscle was like you know 265 like very muscular not not all that much fat on me you know and then with with some fat extra on there I was probably like 273 275 still with a six pack you know but with a lot of extra weight and uh normally like my playing weight during the season was like a very lean 245. you know and um so going from being at 205 my body you know was very happy to to reverse that you know and so you know it's got up to like 2 30 very quickly you know and then 240 uh subsequently after that and that seems to be where my body likes to be if I'm able to sort of work out three four days a week and eat enough my body likes to be just around 240 and been pretty low body fat percentage um nice Okay so we've got a last Super Chat here which is Joe's frogs um 42 299 pounds in seven months that's awesome congratulations good job still have 84 pounds to go I have stalled completely for the past month good artificial sweeteners be the issue thanks doctor so uh Dr Chaffey do you wanna um yeah yeah 100 artificial sweeteners are a major stall that I see I see a lot of people you know they they sometimes even quit doing carnivore because they say well you know I just I needed to lose weight and that was something I was so desperate uh to achieve and so it's very important to them they did that and they weren't really getting that result and so they said okay I have to try something else which is it's fair enough you know if that's what's very important to you but you know I talked to them okay what exactly what else was happening I was like well you know it really sucked that that carnivore didn't work for me because you know I felt so much better I had so much better energy my skin got better my hair got better you know my my autoimmune issues you know I came off my medications my my autoimmune issues went into remission but you know I just stopped losing weight so I guess it didn't work for me I really wish it worked for me and me I was just like um it really sounds like it worked really well for you actually that it was doing a lot of things which is why I tell people focus on your health health first and foremost how do you feel with your energy like and all that sort of stuff um that's the most important thing the weight will come as a byproduct right the the weight is the smoke not the fire right you need to address the fire the smoke will clear on its own eventually okay and um so as and then I I sort of I would ask this lady and others who you know what exactly are you eating I always say what exactly are you eating oh just eating okay so no coffee no artificial sweeteners know this know that and all of a sudden you know all this stuff come starts coming out they're having keto Treats they're having monk fruit sugar they're having Dairy they're having this they're having that they're having other things so it's not just meat it's not just water right which is what which is what this is right what what what are the Inuits eating what were we eating during the ice ages meat water you know that's it right sometimes people so you know that's that's really what you want to do is just eat meat and water and um and uh so you want to cut all that stuff out so if you're especially if you're hitting a stall uh artificial sweeteners are not good they will trigger an insulin release they will trigger they can trigger a High um reactive hypoglycemia so you take this in your body says great there's sugar coming down here's some insulin and then there's no blood sugar but the insulin is out there and you get low blood sugar right and you also suppress your ketones and you can feel pretty crappy as well um so definitely get rid of that get rid of dairy a lot of people stall on Dairy for fat loss now also remember weight loss is not the same as fat loss right because when I'm eating a lot of meat and I'm working out I put on muscle very easily right and when I was was losing fat I was also gaining muscle so I lost 23 pounds in 10 days which is nuts but I didn't lose an ounce after that for like six months until I hurt my knee and I couldn't work out and I couldn't run and I couldn't do squats and then my muscle mass on my legs shrank and that's when I started losing weight right I was 243 for months and then I started going down like 220 I was 20 pounds of muscle in my legs and I was not happy about that right and so you know it was um you know it's you you can still lose that and put on muscle and your your weight will stay the same on the scale so it's about health first and foremost secondarily distant second is about body composition uh losing fat putting on muscle the scale doesn't get on that that list anywhere you know it can be a rough guide and can sort of help you and it's sort of fun to see like a video game like Sean lost you know 245 pounds in a year like that's awesome but you know what I guarantee you he lost more fat than that I guarantee you he lost more than 245 pounds of fat in that time you know because you would have put on muscle so if you look at body composition he probably lost more like 270 280 pounds of fat because you would have put on 20 30 pounds of muscle as well potentially or at least some right so there's going to be an offset there right and so you know you're you're you've got a lot of weight to lose so you're putting on muscle but you're also losing fat you're losing more fat than you than you're putting on muscle great maybe that's evening out now right and maybe you're you're just sort of tipping the balance you know on the other side with the artificial sweeteners and other sorts of things so what I would do is a focus on your health first and foremost B get down to just fatty meat and water get rid of everything else out of your system and then you know think about body composition next how are your clothes fitting how are you looking in the mirror and you want to get a dexa scan or something like that to get a get a more accurate example and then check it again in six months and you'll see that you are actually losing a lot of fat and putting on muscle and bone um and uh yeah that's what I would say anybody else have a have an idea um yeah I would have said the same thing that you said as far as the insulin uh response that's about it I think you covered it all adequate Larry Dave you guys yeah I I think he I think it now
