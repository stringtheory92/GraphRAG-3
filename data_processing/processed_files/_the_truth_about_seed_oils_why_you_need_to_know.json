        "body": "you know who do you trust well you know uh I trust biology and Physiology and um evolutionary biology and you know how much do we normally have in our body and our system not much less than 2% 1 to 2% Proctor and Gamble paid the American Heart Association $20 million in today's valuation to lie and say that it was better for your heart than than animal fats so it's just like I literally just don't believe a word that they say everything they say is uh you have to hold and with a lot of contempt in scrutiny because they've just been there's so many examples of them being paid off by different Industries like the sugar like Proctor and Gamble and then the sugar companies paid them to say to lie about things like the Framingham study and say that cholesterol increased cholesterol cause was associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease mortality and like no it actually showed the opposite of [Music] that your thoughts on polyunsaturated fatty acids Omega six is an inflammatory yeah I think that there's a lot of um evidence to that uh to that um uh those being pro-inflammatory and there's others going the other direction and you know who do you trust well you know uh I trust biology and Physiology and evolutionary biology and um you know how much do we normally have in our body and our system not much less than 2% 1 to 2% and the um Omega sixes that we we get from meat are things like arachadonic acid which yeah we do need but only in a small amount um we don't need linolic acid at all we only need linolic acid that's the plant version of omega-6's if we don't have enough arachadonic acid then we turn linolic acid into radonic acid but it's um you know you sneeze and and you mutate this stuff it's very unstable it can cause neuroinflammation and breakdown products and free radicals in the brain causing distress to the brain um Dr Georgia e talks about this she's a psychiatrist from Harvard and how omega-6 is linolic acid specifically is quite toxic uh to the brain causes neuroinflammation and and so for her field and in Psychiatry um she's she's very much against it and you know these polyunsaturated fats you know as we've increased these things and decreased animal fats and saturated fats um you know heart disease rates have gone up Alzheimer's has gone gone up cancers have gone up all these other things have gone up these are all associations but it's not going the other way animal fats goes the other way as we reduce animal fat consumption over the 20th century and into the 21st century heart disease rates and non-communicable chronic diseases cancers uh Strokes Alzheimer's autoimmunity they've all gone up right so that's that's an inverse relationship so we know it's not that we know it has nothing to do with meat fat and and animal fat I should say um how much of a role does omega-6's play in the polyunsaturated fats play I think probably a significant role but it all comes down to the the over overarching premise of we're eating things that don't belong in our body we're eating things that don't belong to our species and we're getting sick as a consequence and Omega 6 is a part of that you know you're eating these things out of proportion of what we would in nature what we've ever done in our biological past and we're getting harm that's all there is to it um Dr Chris Kenobi has written a whole book on this he thinks that that's the main driver of disease nowadays is is the Omega 6es and the polysaturated fatty acids you know these seed oils that were industrial lubricants you know like the Germans invented Crisco I believe in 1911 they use it to like lubricate their uots the submarines were going around in World War I and uh then they ended up selling the the recipe uh to Proctor and Gamble and then Proctor gam paid the American Heart Association $20 million in today's valuation to uh to lie and say that it was better for your heart than than animal fats so it's just like you know the this the aha I mean I literally just don't believe a word that they say everything they say is uh you have to hold and with a lot of contempt and scrutiny because they've just been there's so many examples of them being paid off by different Industries like the sugar like Proctor and Gamble and then the sugar companies um you know paid them to say to lie about things like the Framingham study and say that you know it said that um that uh uh cholesterol increased cholesterol cause was associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease mortality and was like no they actually showed the opposite of that you know so that's that's um uh you know just a completely corrupt organization from the GetGo and you shouldn't believe a damn word they say hey everyone really to announce a new sponsor for the show and for everybody down in Australia Stockman Stakes who are delivering high quality grass-fed and finished pasture raised beef and other meats flash frozen and vacuum sealed tood door something that I've been enjoying a lot of myself recently as well they also have a great range of specialty items such as high fat keto mints and carnivore beef and organs mints with liver kidneys and beef heart as well so use code chaffy today for free order of beef mints or another specialty gift along with your order at Stockman stakes. comom and I'll see you over there thanks guys there are also studies the only uh randomized control trials Interventional trials looking at LDL cholesterol polyunsaturated fats saturated fats and cardiovascular disease and mortality rates um there are three of them and they were all buried because they didn't give the the outcome that the authors wanted and and they admitted to that decades later when these got uncover um and they found that replacing um saturated fat with polyunsaturated fats in one case linolic acid which is Omega 6 from plants that this did indeed lower uh LDL cholesterol but ended up killing people a lot more people of from heart attacks and strokes from cardiovascular disease so what do you want is LDL just LDL just no nothing else just LDL causes heart disease right higher LDL causes heart disease okay well we lowered LDL and it lowered heart disease you know or sorry we lower we lowered LDL and it increased heart disease right so that's not the case we had higher LDL with less heart disease with less heart attacks with less Strokes right and so you lower LDL and heart disease goes up Strokes go up heart attacks go up okay I've seen some people say like well you know all that shows is that linolic acid is worse than LDL like okay well what do you want you know it's like you're saying that LDL causes heart disease okay so are you saying now that linolic acid causes heart disease as well okay well then then what you know when you when you're getting these polyunsaturated fats they come with a lot of linolic acid it's what the hell are you supposed to do right what are you supposed to eat that's natural first of all seed oils aren't natural we can't get those things naturally um and so you know what would we have been eating biologically that wouldn't kill us historically you know you got nothing you know and so you know this is um it's a bit of a force you know it's it's just a bit of a mess around you know there's there's nothing that that we're eating now that even existed 50,000 years ago besides meat just isn't right and so you know the idea that that um we have to eat all these things that didn't exist you know 100 years ago let alone 50,000 years ago um is a bit is a bit ridiculous you know just we've just been unhealthy and miserable and dying of cancers and heart disease you know this whole no you know nature is you know the natural state of all life is is healthy because unhealthy species as a species they don't last and in fact they don't exist in the first place because they come from species that were healthy and surviv and adapted to some situation and changed a bit and changed a bit and changed a bit so you know all life comes from those who survived all life so we have to be descending from people who were healthy and if we're eating a lot of meat and exclusively meat for a long time we must have been healthy doing that and so uh now we are getting very sick as a population and we are hurting ourselves and yes we're surviving but it's very clear that we're getting a lot worse and it's not going to go very well and fertility rates are going down um diseases are going up and so we're you know if we were doing that during an Ice Age good luck making it through an ice age uh you know fat sick and miserable like that it's not going to happen you know you just eat cereal for dinner like oh yeah it's great like you get the hell out of here yeah like you give a about people in their plight you just want to sell more goddamn cereal and um and it's this stuff is poison and you know it's poison you know it's making them sick and uh you don't care because you just you profit from all of that you can just tell he's just have this little you know snarky cocky grin on his face oh yeah we just eat cereal you know he's just had a face you want to punch you know and it's like"
