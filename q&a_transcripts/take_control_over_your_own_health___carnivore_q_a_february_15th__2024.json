    "transcript": "oh well only 9% of people are following the guidelines who gives a [\u00a0__\u00a0] thank God only 9% of people are following the guidelines because guidelines suck 9% of people in America are diabetic too do you think about that maybe those are the ones following the guidelines there are too many trillions of dollars at stake for them to to give up on this stuff easily like the Statin they're the most lucrative drug that's ever been put on the market you think that they're ever going to tell you that you don't require stattin out a chance in hell you're going to have to pry that out of their cold dead fingers you know that is always going to be there they are not going to give that up and so we have to make sure people understand that it is not necessary and it is likely causing more harm than good okay hello everyone thank you for joining today's the the YouTube live and Facebook live and Instagram live for uh February 15th in the US and the 16th here in Australia so thanks everyone for joining uh I know we've already sort of got a few uh super chats um that people put forward so thank you very much for that um and yeah and just thank you all just for joining it's always good to see everybody um if you could let me know in the chat where everyone's calling in from it's always great to see where where everyone's um yeah wher everyone's calling in from and and and how they're doing and everything like that so thank you everybody and first question off the rank is uh from RAR who says hello Dr chaffy could you explain the biological reason behind shedding of baby teeth thank you um that is that is an excellent question uh I have no idea it's not something that I've uh looked too too closely into um it's um you know I mean they're they're called milk teeth so it could be that that's just those teeth start coming in early on you're still nursing and you don't want to have you know teeth that are going to be too rough on on M to nurse but also if you think about it you know just thinking about it right now teeth don't grow right and so if you get your full adult teeth in when your head is really small it's like just that's not going to fit as you have to wait for your your face to grow more before you get your permanent teeth in are going to be the right size for your head so if you had just if you're just your baby teeth came in because you need teeth from early on because you're going to you're going to come off milk and you're going to need to start eating actual food and if you don't um if you don't have teeth you can't do that uh generally there's a lot of animals that don't have teeth but you know for the ones that do and so if you just kept your baby teeth and in an adult head they'd be very small and they'd be spaced out and it wouldn't be functional so those need to fall out and then bigger teeth in a more adult face would come in so that's my thought behind that I would expect that that's probably something to do with it but it's that's just me spitballing off the top of my head so I don't know know it's actually and but the thing is too like do we really know know some of these things uh maybe maybe not but um you know it's it's as good an explanation is any I guess uh Sunshine kiss Thank you for Super Chat Dr jaffy could iodine supplements cause high blood pressure um isn't better to eat leafy vegetables to get nutrients over chemical supplements thanks uh yeah well look it's um it depends it depends on the on the leafy green it depends on the nutrient um sort of the difference between between Pharmaceuticals and and uh uh you know plant medicine right so do you want to take an aspirin or do you want to chew on Willow work do you want to take digitalis or do you want to you know eat Fox Glove right because the thing is is that you you might get the you might get the a nutrient or a medicine from Plants but that's not the only thing that's coming with it so you get the bad with the good um you don't know the dose you don't know how much you're getting you don't know the conditions that it was growing in or how it was um you know with a soil quality and all these other sorts of things which are a factor in in the nutrient levels and all that sort of and then the toxic levels of these different sorts of plants um you know so I mean potentially but the thing is is that um if you want like a dedicated nutrient Source then you're missing out on iodine but everything else is okay it's not that end of the world to take some iodine I don't know of it causing high blood pressure I wouldn't expect it to iodine is it's fairly safe you know people in Japan uh eat a lot of seafood with a lot of iodine so they they're they're taking in their daily amount of iodine that is much higher than other people even take supplements you know so when we say like take x amount of iodine supplements they're just their diet is bringing in more than that okay so is that it's so it seems to be fairly safe to take um but no I agree you should it's ideal to get your nutrition from food but food is species specific and food for humans is meat and that's just what we're designed to eat so getting nutrients from leafy greens you can get nutrients from them they're about onethird of the nutrients that they had in the 1950s because we're destroying the soil we're destroying the Earth by growing these crops and just mass-producing crops year after year after year and not letting them go back to the land and not letting animals come back on it and refertilized and Revitalize the soil um and so you know that's not uh that's not as healthy as it could have been and it and it gets the bad things as well so you get the bad with the good you're not just getting you know iodine or or any of the other sort of nutrients you're getting a lot of other things with it you know it it would be ideal to get your iodine from meat if you're just eating meat and most people do you know I haven't had any problems with my iodine and I have I haven't specifically chased after cows that live on the coast I've just eaten what was available and that was fine for me if someone has a a deficiency in that because of the soil sample or how something was raised or grown or something like that you know take you know trying to change up where you get your food or your meat probably uh reasonable but if you need a dedicated supplement that's fine too you know unfortunately we're not eating wild animals anymore and you know More's the pity and you know not all the cattle are being raised in their regenerative fashion and when they are and they're just being fed grass they're much more healthy they have a much higher nutrient density and that's great and that's what should be preferred and if you have access to that you should support ranchers and Farmers that do that not everybody can but that's uh that's very beneficial so you know to answer your question you know isn't it better to get it from leafy greens I don't actually think so because the the leafy greens will have things that are harmful and you don't actually know how much nutrients you're getting and those nutrients might be bound up in ways that you can't access you don't have bioavailability and then they'll have antinutrients which will strip out and bind out other nutrients that you're trying to absorb and they'll have things that can be directly toxic that aren't going to be helpful for you at all and so I think it probably is safer just to take iodine as opposed to take getting that from a leafy green I think it's best to get it from meat but if you have to take if I had a choice between an ion supplement and leafy green I would definitely take the supplement thankfully I don't have that issue though I haven't had to take any iodine supplements personally other people may uh Daniel S thank you very much for the Super Chat uh Daniel says hi from Austria well hello can a chronic chronically gastritis esophagitis and sibo be healed by a carnivore diet they are always telling that you may not eat fats when having that issue um do you know patients who have healed uh yes I I've definitely seen that there are even case Series in the literature you small case series isn't the whole study it's just just reporting on several people that have had experience with these sorts of things um and uh one was well was sort of a smaller study like six people and uh with sibo and they uh put them on a car specifically a carnivore diet and five of them were able to go you know sort of longer than a month and um one only sort of went like two weeks or so on it and the ones that were able to go longer than a month if I'm remembering correctly they they all sort of had resolution of their sio and the one that only made it two weeks had significant Improvement so that's good uh gastritis a lot of people at least from from a a sophal reflux disease point of view are benefited by things like a carnivore diet um and just ketogenic diets in in in in general and those seem to be uh benefited by this and that that's in the literature as well esophagitis and so again chronic gastritis you know it depends on what's causing that it can be you know helped by you know reducing the damage and pressure of the on the stomach and increasing the defenses on the stomach but if you have gastritis and it's and it's there you know you might need some help from a doctor as well and um you know taking ppis and other sorts of things to try to calm things down so that your stomach will have a chance to heal so it may not just get rid of everything it does seem to help with gastrosoph reflux disease um esophagitis depends on the cause so a lot of these things depend on the cause sio I mean there's I mean literally zero evidence that any of those things get worsened by Fats I mean it's just that's just a blind accusation the a lot of the sibo bugs are ones that that feed on carbohydrates and fiber so why would eating fat be a problem for that it wouldn't and so you know no this that's just wild speculation on whoever on on the part of whoever said that so no I I don't think that that's that's something you're going to worsen by eating animal fats you eat a bunch of polyunsaturated seed oils God knows what's going to happen to you it's probably not going to be good though and so um it can potentially help with the first two depends on the cause of the esophagitis clearly depends on how bad your gastritis is and if you may need a little help from you know doctor with medications sibo uh with preliminary data seems to have helped individuals um and and you know apart from the that smaller Sixers study if you want to call that it's very small more of a case series um that uh that there are a lot of people that are doing this and have and have been healing their sio so uh yes potentially you could help all of those things it doesn't matter what causes all the caused all these things in the first place and you might need a bit of help because once you get you know sometimes the horse is out of the BN you know and you got to you've got to deal with that situation where it is and you might need a bit more help hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want a nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meet only products the more meet only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys s Bean thank you for the Super Chat I really appreciate it um I have a question here from uh the Instagram side of things do you recommend magnesium supplements uh only if people need them you know generally when people are on a long-term carnivore diet they don't need magnesium there are a lot of areas that magnesium has just been stripped out of the soil by this aggressive uh farming and so it's not it's not as plentiful or um there is just don't have as much anyway that's my understanding here in Australia is that the land is just a bit uh deficient in magnesium and so a lot of people in Australia for that or other reasons are ficient in magnesium and zinc and sometimes selenium and so if you're going to do a cornivore diet that will make up for that and the people that I see on a long-term carnivore diet end up being in good ranges good or to Optimal ranges of magnesium and zinc and selenium and so they may not need that but if you're if you're coming from a deficient State then it's it could be beneficial to just take a bit of a supplement and bump you up but eventually you'll get there and on a carnivore diet um you should be able to anyway especially if you're having you know a bit of organs and things like that because they're very they're very nutrient dense and that can help Co catch you up most people will be able to just maintain on or catch up and maintain on just muscle meat some people uh may have absorption issues they may have other sorts of Demands that they need just a bit more of these things and that's totally fine they can they can have a bit of a bit of these organs you know try to keep it in proportion to the animal though remember there's big buffalo there's one liver right so try try to keep that in proportion but you know the meat that we're eating isn't the same as the wild meat right the micronutrients that exist in store-bought meat uh are less than that of grass-fed finish or generally raised animals or wild animals most people do just fine on the store bought meat however it may be that some people need a bit a bit more and that's that's where organs come in because they're extremely nutrient dense you just want to keep it in proportion you don't want to get it out of proportion because some of these things especially the metals and the the the fat soluble vitamins they can cause a problem when they build up so long term you don't need a you generally don't need a magnesium supplement or any supplements on a carnivore diet that's sort of the whole point is that you don't you don't need to take supplements if you're eating your natural diet and so you know as you get closer and closer to that eating wild animals with a bit of organs here and there you really shouldn't need um any supplements unless you have a specific condition that you can't absorb like pernicious anemia you just aren't able to absorb B12 because youve had an autoimmune attack to your stomach and you can't make intrinsic factor that sort of thing um but no most people don't need to take any supplements uh except maybe early on if you're very deficient in these sorts of things taking a bit of supplements to just sort of catch you up quicker you know I'm not opposed to that um and I have recommended that to patients before but in general you don't need to um you will catch up you it'll just take longer if you don't supplement from a deficient state but you'll get there eventually um but if you're sort of feeling a bit rubbish that'll catch you up and then you just take that for couple months it can take especially with magnesium it can take a while for you to build up those levels and then you stop and you can just maintain that with a with a carnivore diet but but again that's just if you want to speed things along most people don't need to do that or you don't have to do that eventually you'll get there either way okay so question from Ari valkor um is it possible to heal or close up murmurs in the heart through carnivore I have recently been told that surgery is the only way to close the murmur thank you for all you provide well it just depends because there's different causes of murmurs a murmur is just when the valve doesn't close properly or open properly U there's just a problem with that opening closing prop process and so maybe it'll close but then it'll push in it won't hold you know hold the flood back the tide back and then it pushes back and get regurgitation or it doesn't open all the way it doesn't open like that so it just opens part way and say stenosis and and it it makes a turbulent flow as it's pushing through there so what a murmur is is just turbulence you're listening to sound of a bit of of turbulence through the valves either going forward or regurgitating back um and so that's those generally the most common kinds of murmur anyway and so it it depends you know if you have if you have a bad stenosis because you have whole bunch of builtup calcium and scarring and had infection or endocarditis or something like that that uh you know might not heal you know probably won't um I don't have any data on that I haven't um I haven't even looked up if like ketogenic diets or things like that have been improved have improved murmur but it would depend certainly depend on the type of murmur that that was being caused if it's if it's you know a regurgitation where the the valve is a bit loose and weak and it sort of you know doesn't stop the back flow you know it could be that this strengthens things up but you know it's just one of those things you sort of have to have to see for yourself I think that for a lot of the murmur it probably won't but you never know with some of these things it might get better I mean we're we're it's still early days on how many of these things can be helped and and you know the problem is all these different sorts of problems that we haven't really seen to much in the past that are just very common now and how much of these things are coming from our food supply probably the majority but certainly from our environment because 40 years ago they did not exist in the numbers that we're seeing now and uh and yes we did keep very accurate statistics and so people would say oh we just didn't notice it is dumb so um you know we're still waiting to see all the different things that this can improve so look it's not going to hurt you it not going to make your murmur worse by any stretch of the imagination it will make your health better in most regards and it could very well help this but it's sort of one of those things you have to sort of wait and see I don't have any actual data on that um many causes of murmur probably won't but it will make you much healthier in general and you know let's see what it does with the murmur Sabine um who had a Super Chat earlier thank you very much um says I eat uh beef butter bacon and eggs and have a lot of butter on the side uh still I'm constipated when I go number two it is rabbit style what should I do can't possibly eat more fat um have about one stick of butter a day um thank you in advance so that's that's what you got to do though it's um you know at at a certain point when you you eat a certain amount of fat you will get diarrhea right you won't be able to absorb it and it will come out in dramatic fashion because your body has a limited capacity to absorb fat and when you exceed that that excess fat just goes out in your stools and and that's what I believe keeps things soft um that seems to fit the observe phenomena anyway and so if you're getting constipated s like the rabbit pellets that means it's very constipated that means you're just absor absorbing every ounce of fat now if you're doing something like taking Ox bile which some people do I would recommend not doing that stopping that immediately because that's going to force you to absorb a lot more fat than your body actually wants to and so that's not what you want to do you want you want to absorb the amount of fat that your body wants you to absorb if you are not there yet or if you're not doing uh Ox bile or anything like that then it's just your body much more fat and so I know that it's I know that it's I know that it's um pretty wild that um that uh it's a lot more fat than you're used to it's a lot more fat than most people are used to but if you're constipated like that then by definition you're not eating enough fat your body's absorbing every ounce of fat that is coming in and and none is coming out and so your body's like yes all of this need this all of this and so even though it's a lot more fat than you've ever eaten your entire life I appreciate that but it's still not enough and so um just try to you know just add in a little bit more butter and everything like that the beef that you have just try to make it a bit more fattier Cuts if you can um eggs you could focus on the egg yolks as opposed to egg whites when you do egg yolks that's going to be a higher fat concentration so it's going to have have about two grams of fat for every one gram of protein whereas if it's with the egg white then it's a little more than one gram of protein to 1 gram of fat and so you know that's that's going to tip things tip things around and when you you cook you cook with butter and you put butter on your steaks and you eat fatty bacon and all that sort of stuff if you're having cheese or dairy that can be constipa as well and um even it can even slow down things from from the fat so even though and it can replace out U fat that you're eating as well and you feel full and you don't want to have anymore it's so be what people can can get um more more constipated by by adding in Dairy as well so if you're having any dairy I would cut that out I would try to increase the fat as well because eventually it will go soft and eventually eventually it'll go running and so you just want to get it to the soft side and not the runny side or at least the comfortable side um but yeah unfortunately that's that's pretty much what you do just try to eat more fat if you're not able to to get more fat at the moment and you have to just sort of work on that and build it up you can try taking a stool softener or something like that in the interim uh but eventually what you the solution is to eat more fat so good luck with that I'm sure you'll be able to get there it's just it is weird at first when you're eating a lot more fat than our bodies are are used to uh but you'll get there like you'll end up really appreciating the fat and enjoying it and feeling better when you have it so Adam thank you very much for the Super Chat Adam M down 110 pounds well that's awesome fantastic man I'm on blood pressure medication Los sartin and my readings at home have been around 110 111 112 with pulse usually in the low 60s or 50s what's a good range to bring uh what's good range to bring up uh getting off Med well I mean you can potentially do it now the thing is is that uh it depends on a lot of factors so you know it's important to work with your doctor um if you are getting Li headed ever especially when we're standing from sitting and you're just a little dizzy you know most people have at one point gotten a Head Rush when we stood up too fast and uh had to sort of hold onto the wall and give ourselves a second um if you're getting that uh regularly then that's that's a sign that your blood pressure medication is too strong and that you're you're dropping your blood pressure and your body is not able to really compensate for it as quickly as it should when you're standing from sitting or lying down so if you're getting that then that's certainly time to talk to your doctor about that if you're not and you just feel fine you could talk to your doctor about reducing the dose and seeing what happens um and just remember that when you come off medications you tend to have a rebounding effect your blood pressure will go up a bit higher than it would sort of otherwise um but then that settles down so just understand that it can it can sort of take take a little while before that sort of settles so it's like it's not just like the next day oh my God it's up to 140 150 back on the meds if it's up at like 180 200 back on the meds but um uh you know but that that's is uh unlikely to happen if you come off in a step stepwise progression with your doctor so um you know you could you could potentially start looking to wean off these things now if you uh not having dizzy spells if you are having those sort of dizzy lightheaded spells probably a good idea to talk to your doctor about that but just you know you know just talk to your doctor and see about it just say hey look my blood pressure is getting better I feel better you know is it you know can we try weaning off this stuff you know and see see what your doctor says um most of the time they'll they'll be happy to work with you and um you say hey I changed my diet I've lost weight you know do I need to be on these blood pressure medications I'd like to start coming off and hopefully they'll they'll be able to help you with that question from Lena thank you very much for the Super Chat is fat or protein more important I have trouble sleeping on Carnivore any tips also are fruit and honey still bad even though it's different sugar well the thing the problem is it's not different sugar it's exactly the same kind of sugar it's it's fructose and sucrose and actually Honey has quite a lot of fructose and so that that's the point I mean the idea is is that it's it is the same sugar it's just that it comes with other things that are beneficial but that's the same thing as as that's saying that spinach has you know these different vitamins and minerals and there are good things and so that offsets the bad things that are in there it doesn't you know it's not it's not um good enough to make up for the the stuff that's that's harmful in it in my opinion um so yeah I would I don't have anything to do with fruit and honey I have a video just called fruit and honey are not carnivore and I sort of go through all that um fruit you know it's you know the plant wants something to eat the fruit but it doesn't necessarily want you to eat the fruit it wants an animal that it's co-evolved with to eat the fruit and pass it seeds around but a lot of these fruits and berries coalt with birds and most most Fruit and Berry on Earth will kill you and if you get if you're out in the woods and you see these little bulbs and berries and things like that that you don't recognize bad idea to eat them because they will likely kill you and you know that was that was a traditional sort of thing when you're out in the woods you never eat red berries you just don't eat random red berries that you don't see because that that's a warning this is a red like don't eat me I'll kill you sort of thing or to attract birds and things like that so anyway it's um it's not a good idea to uh eat random fruit or berries and even though the plant wants something to eat it it doesn't want you to eat it so still the majority of fruit will kill you the C Bird eats about 1550 different types of fruit in the tropics oh these are tropical fruits so tropical fruits are all great no they're not every single one of those fruits will kill you every single one of those fruits will kill anything except the catary bird because if those seeds don't go through the gut of a C bird they don't turn into a plant they don't germinate and so if a c bird leaves that area those those plants die out so it has to be very attractive to C bird and very detrimental to anything else trying to eat it and so you know it is not the case that even the fruit that we eat even the sweet fruit don't have any toxins they do and they have a lot more toxins when they're not right because the seeds aren't ready yet the problem is we don't pick these things right if you you picked them ripe in your own yard you had a avocado tree or something like that it's going to be better than than what it would be if you buy it from the store but if you buy it from the store they pick these things green and the plant has to take out the toxins we've seen this in studies with tomatoes that you pick them green they don't actually detoxify not like they just break down in the fruit into harmless by byproducts right they they retain all of those it's the vine ripened ones that have less toxins in them because the plant is pulling out those toxins but if you pick it early when the seeds aren't ready that has still has all of its defenses intact good luck buying a fruit from the store that has not been picked green right because that's just how they travel I mean some of the some of these apples you you eat an apple today it's an apple that was picked a year ago and it was picked green you know so that's but it's it is the same kind of sugar it's fructose and glucose and not what you want you know you you get you have four grams of glucose throughout your entire bloodstream at any given time that's just a level teaspoon glucose one more gram up to five grams that's a toxic dose of glucose in your body and it your body reacts to it as a toxin by trying to detoxify it by raising your insulin trying to get that below 4 Gams and if it maintains above 4 grams and you have diabetes basically not basically literally then that's when people start dying and getting multiorgan failure and getting their limbs hacked off and kidneys failing and dying right it's because of that one extra gram of glucose so we're throwing in hundreds of extra grams of glucose and fructose and and galactose and all these sorts of things that's that's harming you and your body can compensate for that for a while but not forever and so that's not something that that you want to do and certainly not something that I want to do uh what's more important fat or protein both they're both important you need enough fat you need enough protein so it's not that you want one or the other they are both essential nutrients they're essential amino acids that you have to have and even the so-called non-essential amino acids you do better with more of them like porine and carnitine and um the fats are essential fats there are essential fatty acids that you have to have or you get get sick and you die or you don't develop properly your brain doesn't work properly your body doesn't work properly and there are essential fat soluble nutrients that come along with the fat that you have to have or you get sick and you may die and you have all these sorts of other problems that you you can get in in development and uh and Beyond so it's it's not just one or the other it's not they're not just calor sources that's something that we just need to throw out because a lot of these things are being used as Structural Materials are being used as precursor to other chemicals hormones and uh proteins that we make in our body everything that our DNA codes for is a protein right and so that's a stack and chain of amino acids in this in a line and then they fold flip around and then you have a folded up protein molecule that goes around and does work in the cell and in the body that's not being used to uh to to as a as a fuel source that's a building block of material so doesn't matter how much energy is released when you burn it because it's not being burned in the first place because we're not combustion engines we're chemical factories and we break bonds to create chemical energy and make ATP and then break those bonds to um uh facilitate other chemical interactions so that's just completely I mean that's like that's like saying like how much does left weigh like you're you're using the wrong units that makes no sense in this context right and so and um you know what temperature is sideways like no this this just like what's wrong with you this is completely unrelated and so um you don't look at it like that you need fat animal fat you need protein animal protein um because there are things like carnitine uh that uh don't exist in plants and that actually only 70% of people make enough of it and so 30% of people do need carnitine from their diet it is an essential amino acid for 30% of people third of the population right and everyone does better with more of it so you just need enough you eat about one gram of fat to one gram of protein up to two grams of fat to one gram of protein or thereabouts and you just see what your body needs again your body only has a limited capacity to absorb fat you just eat as much fat as you as you're able to and you check your stools and if you're getting constipation you're not eating enough if you're getting Di you may be eating too much unless you're confounding it by still eating other things I mean that whenever I say any of these things I am talking about in the context of someone only eating meat and only drinking water nothing else goes in your mouth that you swallow that you swallow that you know is is outside of those two things right so you're taking a sports drink or you're taking a pre-workout or you're taking supplements that have sweeteners or you're taking electrolytes that have sweeteners you're out you know that's not you don't qualify for what I'm talking about I'm talking about only meat only water right if you're doing that and you're getting diarrhea it could be that you're eating more fat than than your body can absorb it's likely it is or you're so constipated that you're getting overflow diarrhea and you're getting watery stools and then every now and then you get this Boulder that comes out and then you're back to the watery stools and that means you need a lot more fat but if you are drinking coffee tea non- sugar sweeteners magnesium supplements metformin other medications those can all cause uh they can all have a laxative effect and so it may just cover that up and so you may have loose stools but you may be taking metformin and magnesium and drinking coffee like well you probably will have loose stools on a cornivore diet we you don't have a whole bunch of fiber jamming up the works so if you're only eating meat only drinking water which I recommend to everybody then you keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good make sure your stools are soft and then you just eat to your body's demand it will change but the thing is is that you don't need to figure that out your body will figure that out for you if you're only eating what you're supposed to eat your body will be able to tell you and you'll be able to listen to it and so you eat until it stops tasting good that's very key and um because you you'll feel like oh I feel satisfied I feel I could stop that's not when you stop on a cornivore diet that's when you stop on a traditional diet when you can't trust your hormones when you can't trust your signals when you're just like I should stop because if I if I keep going I'm going to get fat you don't do that in the carnivore diet you keep eating until fatty meat stops tasting good because if it still tastes good your body is telling you that it still wants those nutrients and then eventually it but it tastes less good and less good and less good until eventually doesn't taste good at all and that's when you stop you take a bite and say didn't really enjoy that stop you just naturally stop that's how animals in the wild naturally stop at least that's what I've sort of come to come to realize sugar an outlier you can have these uh evolutionary traps they're called where you have something like hummingbird that sees something a little red little shaped object and they'll go in oh that's a flower I'm going to go get nectar and um in the midwest they had these these little wire electric wire ties that sort of were nearly that sort of shape in color and so the little hummingbirds would go in stick their little beak in to try to get the nectar and they' hit the live wire and they die right and so they had to change the color of these things because they were just every every time when they were red there's and they just they were just dropping like flies unfortunately so that's an evolutionary trap there's there's signals in them saying hey go get this so food scientists have uh taken advantage of those evolutionary traps in humans to make things highly palatable and say oh we should get this we should eat this eat more eat more eat more eat more eat more eat more eat more sugar is an evolutionary trap we did not find this in great abundance historically but we we you know it seems that fructose is the sweetest of the of the carbohydrates because there aren't any plants that are that are acutely poisonous to humans that are deadly to humans that day that contain fructose but fructose itself with long-term exposure at high levels will cause harm and so you know it tastes good we oh that's safe I can get energy and I can survive you know we get that signal but you know we're getting little crab apples maybe a bit of Honey every now and then and we're oh that's amazing okay we should get this but now we've refined it we' put it in everything and so we hit that evolutionary trap and so it just takes oh I want more I want more I want more I want more because we're never going to find it in that abundance in the wild you're just not going to and certainly not every day so that's hitting an evolutionary trap meat is not an evolutionary trap it does not make you want to do more and more and more until you hurt yourself that's actual more normal normal biology and so you eat until it stops tasting good that's how you figure that out so that's what you do you aim for about one to two grams of fat for every one gram of protein you eat that fatty meat until it stops tasting good and two to1 fat to protein is about 65% lean ground beef with 35% fat that's what that works out to be so a lot thrown at you but uh it actually is fairly straight forward when you sort of break it down Joseph thank you very much for the Super Chat what do you feed your cat and how many times a day do they eat meat it's the only thing that cat has ever eaten is meat raw meat you don't feed cats cooked meat um I mean you can occasionally but it doesn't have all the all the nutrients they need things like torine get uh denatured when you when you cook them and so they need um they need raw meat and uh experiments people should look up called pottinger cats a very interesting story on that on YouTube about how they just had said one group of cats raw meat and they were perfectly healthy and generation after generation one still meat but just cooked meat and they weren't as healthy and every generation got smaller and smaller smaller brains and worse bone structures in the face and smaller cheekbones and worse bone mineralization and uh you know less interested in mating and had more health issues and all these sorts of things and then the third Generations were very sickly very poor bone density they had the they said the bones were like made out of foam rubber it was really sad and you know one little kitten had like 30 fractures it was very very sad and they couldn't reproduce at that after that third generation couldn't do it weren't really interested in it and then anytime there was attempt they didn't get pregnant a few times they did get pregnant they had still births and so um it's uh it's uh is is they they're missing out and it sort of just it just adds up and eventually they just can't can't hack it anymore they switched it back over to raw meat and cats got healthier they were able to reproduce the Next Generation they weren't back to the the raw the raw cat group it took four generations to breed back to the raw cap size stature and health so there's a lot of EP multigeneration ation KnockOn effects and epigenetic effects which is which is pretty interesting actually um from a genetic points of view genetics point of you uh but you feed cats raw meat that's what you do oh you don't feed them raw chicken why the hell not yeah cats eat uh uh raw birds all the time in the in you know outside so uh you just feed them raw meat and that's the only thing that he's had he's very very healthy very active happy little boy still sort of Acts like a kitten jumping around attacking things which I think is awesome and um yeah and so that's that's what we do we feed the dogs that too um generally feed them about once a day but you know big bowl of raw meat might feed him more often like that that kid is a hunter like he anytime we're eating meat or steak like he wants in on it you know he wants in on the kill so even if he's eating that day so and the dogs too we just give them meat um you know sometimes we'll give them little scraps of like cooked meat and stuff like that but mostly what they get is raw meat and um for both the dogs and the cats Stephen Frank films thank you for the Super Chat just says thanks Doc well thank you I appreciate that Cordelia thank you for the Super Chat do you think the carnivore diet will actually heal the retinal hemorrage Hemorrhage in my left eye depends on what caused it um retinal hemorrhages can be caused by uh glycation damage the high blood sugar and fructose I believe is can directly damage the retina there are opthalmologists such as my friend Dr Chris Kenobi and others who have found that many opthalmological conditions can be fixed through dietary interventions and just going towards more meat and less of this processed garbage and sugar and Seed oils and all these sorts of things uh even before you get to a full carnivore diet um but you know ketogenic diets and and um and and uh just getting rid of garbage does seem to help and um I I know several opthalmologists that put their patients on keto and carnivore specifically diets and so it depends on what's causing your retinal Hemorrhage but carore diet can at least remove a lot of the harmful agents that can damage your retina yes so hopefully it does uh fix your particular issue but even if it doesn't help with that because there are other other causes of things going wrong in our body than just the food that we're eating but um uh it'll help you in many other ways anyway so it'll help you get a lot better in a lot of other ways so good luck with that and I hope hopefully it helps with that either way it'll help you in a lot of other ways and you'll feel great classic thank you for the Super Chat hey fever season or allergies are they triggered by the gut good question you know a lot of things are being discovered to be sort of triggered by the gut I don't I don't know that those are though I do know that my allergies have certainly gotten a hell of a lot better since I stopped eating broccoli and spinach and bloody kale I don't know why I ever ate that stuff it looks like something a brosaurus would eat stuff just prehistoric but um uh my allergy certainly got better it could be that you're just over sensitizing your immune system it's just start acting in a deranged fashion and you just get you just get a bit overworked but you know you can still sneeze you can still get reactions to things um it's just mine are certainly less and my asthma's way different than it than it was just by dropping the greens right so that was that was big for me I don't know if they're they can be triggered by the gut that's a good question but um it's uh it's not something that I that I know too much about so um sorry I couldn't answer that specifically Bishop deep learning thank you so much for the Super Chat does B production increase in response to increased fat intake I'm noticing I can consume more fat without getting diara the longer I stay on Carnivore uh probably that but you know we don't know for sure I mean we but your body is very efficient you know if you're if you're just not eating if you're just undereating fat for just decades and decad decades and decades you know bile is an expensive resource it doesn't just make it just for fun right and so it could be that you know if you're just not getting enough fat your body's just like okay well we're just not going to we're just not going to waste resources on this um and it can cause problems obviously because you keep concentrating this stuff you'll form gall stones and because any hyperconcentrated solution at rest will form crystals and precipitate that's what that's what gall stones are that's what B Sledge is and that's what the G gallbladder does is it concentrates bile right and um you know physiology textbooks will say it can go up to 20 times as concentrated maybe some people concentrated even more maybe those are the ones that are predisposed to getting um B gallstones but whatever reason you know um that they get gallstones and others don't if you just eat as much fat as your body is making bile for you you cannot get gallstones you can't because there won't be any bile in your your gallbladder anyway to form a stone doesn't matter and so I I I have noticed that phenomenon as well that people eating the exact same amount you know for a few weeks and they're getting diarrhea scopus diarrhea now often these guys are drinking coffee still or tea and or using non- sugar sweeteners usually in the coffee or tea and so that's a bit of a fly in the ointment but um often times people have sort of diarrhea early on and then it just izes and that could be that phenomenon where you're making more bile and you're absorbing more fat so I think it's it's quite possible and I think if you eating more fat and you're and you're tolerating it and your body's actually wanting it that probably is what's happening but um don't have don't have any proof one way or the other but I mean that's that's just the observation that's sort of a naturalistic observation of of what's happening and so that's very likely the case Steve Lars um has a question saysi wondering about potassium on Carnivor on day 52 of beef Eggs only uh well if you're on day 52 and your heart hasn't stopped then you're getting enough potassium pretty simple right so uh yes you get everything you need get everything you need in the proportion that you need it from meat because by definition uh you would have to if that's something that we that we're biologically designed for and it turns out that it is and so um you don't you know we need different amounts of nutrients when we eat different things because you know different different plants have anti- nutrients that block out the absorption and utilization of different nutrients and they can actually strip out different nutrients out of your your bloodstream body and some people may have disruptions in their electrolytes early on when they're when their insulin's coming back down to normal levels but not everybody um if you're in in that group and you're feeling a bit rotten and getting sort of Keto flu sort of things or us should be called the Atkins flu or the carnivore flu now all these sorts of things not everybody gets that but sometimes that can be from electrolyte imbalance and maybe that can help um if you're past that and you feel great great um I have I have yet to see somebody uh in my clinic that has had low potassium when going on a cornard diet I've seen one guy that I did a consult with after several months and he had normal potassium all the way and then it it blipped down just slightly and then I said okay well you had no symptoms of it you normally get um you can if it gets too low you're you can you can trigger atrial fibrillation and then ventricular fibrillation and then you die and so it's it's actually quite serious um which is why you know this is not something that it was oh I have leg cramps must be potassium probably not actually you know it's a when you have truly low pottassium you get heart arrhythmias and if you get truly low sodium you get uh cognitive issues and um and Consciousness issues you you will be very hard to Rouse you'll just be sleeping all the time you wake up and you just go back to sleep or you go into a coma and you die so these these are very important to keep it at optimal levels which is why your body does that for you and so uh I that that one gentleman that had very slightly low I mean just just on the just on the wrong side of the line that we draw fairly um you know could you know arbitrarily I mean is it is it it's 3.5 fine and then 3.4 oh my God that's a disaster I mean no I mean they're still pretty damn close and you generally won't get symptomatic if it's 3.4 but you you know potentially could um and so he was he was down sort of at that he was just sort of like 0.1 point2 down on his potassium and uh completely asymptomatic I just said look just just test it again could be an outlier could have been a lab error and um you know and it could be just a blip for whatever reason checked it again perfectly form in the middle of the range great so that's not a problem um you know if you're doing fine you don't have symptoms you don't have to worry about it if you're getting you know racing heartbeat in your regular pattern to your racing heartbeat that could be an irregular pattern like atrial fibrillation definitely get that checked out definitely go to the doctor get an EKG ECG and get your your electrolytes checked I I really haven't seen people have to do that you know but if you do if you I mean some people get get uh what they would call palpitations because it's a very hard strong heavy heartbeat and but it's not over 100 beats per minute it's not not an irregular pattern that's more likely to be that your heart's now running on ketones which is its preferred fuel source and now you're just running on Rocket Fuel instead of your know crude oil and your heart's going yes this is it and so it's like beating very hard and that happened to me was very strange but you know I sort of looked at like that's a bit alarming but I because I could hear it in my ear I was just like trying to see it's just you know it's just like very loud and um and so I was counting and it was just like okay well it's it's a normal rate it's a normal Rhythm there's no power I'm like okay this is fine just my heart's beating hard for some damn reason okay my blood pressure is normal my rate's normal my rhythm's normal I'm not going to worry about it couple weeks later one away and so doesn't even sound like you're having that so if you're not having any issues with your heart I wouldn't worry about it if you get racing heartbeat over 100 beats per minute sustained at rest or you getting irregular pattern then yes definitely go see the doctor and get that checked out and and check your potassium at the time uh that's that's definitely important to do I haven't really seen that be a necessity uh though in that pattern I haven't really seen anybody get atrial fibrillation from from low potassium or just low potassium or just you know atal fibrillation com out of nor so um I think you're fine if you're worried to check uh Steve LGE thank you for the for the super sticker oh yeah so super sticker thank you very much um great I was going to see if we have any the Instagram side of things my feed didn't keep up um uh one from V malarus I am sure I destroyed that name sorry about that says hey dermatologist here from Greece what about vitamin E uh vitamin is great but you'll get you'll get everything you need from uh the fatty meat you know vitamin there's plenty of vitamin E in animal fats and organs as well so tons of that you'll get plenty in in the in the the meat that you're eating by definition like you get everything you need um in the proportion that you need it when you're eating your evolved diet and that's sort of sort of why you eat your evolved diet okay there we go Christina D thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm experiencing histamine issues I had to stop eating ground beef and eggs I was going to take Dao to help with the symptoms is that okay I'm not actually sure what Dao is um I don't think you necessarily have to take anything um but you know the main thing is is that is that if you are having problems um if you're having problems with with ground beef or eggs you you can avoid that and so if you're eating other meats and that's okay then just then just focus on those so you know you don't want to do anything that gives you a reaction for whatever reason be it histamines or something else you just want to you just want to eat the meat that tastes good to you makes you feel the best and that you have access to and can afford so that's that's what you want to do um if you're having problems with um if you're having problems with the with uh you know ground beef and eggs for for whatever reason then you know just avoid them it may be that that you may not have a an issue with them at a later date but at the moment you do and so you know just just avoid them if you're I mean you're taking sort antihistamines or something like that um then you know potentially that that can you know that can be mitigated with with antihistamines like antihistamines could help potentially but um it's uh it's and so you can try that you know if if you I don't know what Dao is I don't know if that's antihistamine but um you can just try you can just try uh whatever you want to see if that helps and if it does great otherwise just just sort of avoid uh those meat like the the the ground beef and eggs that you're eating so that's that's my advice it's just we we don't always know that these are histamines or these are or anything else we just know that we're getting a reaction and for whatever reason we're getting reaction just go go somewhere else as long as there's other meat that you can eat that's that's the important thing Herman rulin thank you very much for the Super Chat is high fat carnivore suitable for someone with pancreatic cancer absolutely so first of all it's suitable for everyone it's suitable for every human it's suitable for every nonhuman too um because it's it's not bad for anyone a giraffe can eat meat and do so very very healthfully and in fact a lot of large herbivores do opportunistically eat other smaller animals when and where they can and so it's uh it's it's good for everyone it's just nutrients it's nothing bad you know and so like that's the whole point plants have nutrients but they have things that are bad meat has nutrients and no bad um unless you run into like a poison Sack or something like that but that's not what we're talking about um so people especially with pancreatic can't just cancer in general uh it's very important to be on a proper human diet on a proper biologically appropriate diet where you're eating what you're supposed to eat your body is going to help is going to help your body work the way it's supposed to work and especially help your body fight uh the cancer um there are hundreds of studies showing key to ketogenic diets ketogenic metabolic therapy is very efficacious in um in in uh treating or helping cancer treatments they can work as an adjunct people have also used it as Standalone therapy I would recommend adjunct I would still recommend listening to your oncologists about chemo and radiation um especially for certain kinds of cancer that have a very high success rate with those pancreatic cancer is is often quite resistant um so it certainly isn't going to be a bad idea to to try other other sorts of things like ketogenic carnivore diets specifically ketogenic carnivore diets don't have anything with sugar or or um sweeteners or carbohydrates it's very important to keep your blood sugar down your ketones up and in a calorie restricted fashion four to one calories from fat to protein that seems to be sort of the magic ratio there or 3: one four: one in that range um that from the human trials and the animal trials that seems to be the best ratio of fat to protein for ketogenic metabolic therapy trying to keep that gki down which is glucose Ketone index lower your glucose higher your ketones the lower your gki you want to keep that below two or below one if possible that's therapeutic range is below two and you do this with comination of of carnivore diet and fasting and this can work as an adjunct too because it it actually improves outcomes of chemo and radiation that was shown in a study in 2018 2019 and 2018 was on radiation 2019 on chemo so it sensitizes the cancer cells to the chemo and radiation so they get more damage and it protects your healthy cells from the chemo radiation so they don't get damaged as damaged they're going to get damaged and so that I think is very important now the question is pancreatic cancer because the pancreas makes digestive enzymes that are now now it's a bit harder for it to do that and and should we eat meat because that's going to put more stress on the pancreas you need the pancreas to break down all your food and in fact it's a lot more difficult to break down non meat than it is to break down meat meat is what we're designed to eat meat is what we're designed to break down digest and absorb so that's actually easy easier for your body to do that it's going to be easier in your pancreas as well and so it's actually uh even better from that standpoint as well so if I ever got cancer pancreatic or otherwise I would probably not eat for about 21 days and then I would go through periods of fasting and carnivore with periods of refeeding keep my gki down as low as possible I depending on the type of cancer if it was something that relied more on glucose that's just what I would do if it relied more on glutamine then I would look into the agents that can interrupt glutamine metabolism and stop the stop the uh cancers from from running on glutamine either and if it was something that had a high uh you know um fiveyear survival rate cure rate remission rate with chemo and radiation I would consider it and if it's something that uh did not have a very good rate I probably would not consider cons because I don't want to do a bunch of damage to my body that doesn't actually get me anywhere so there's a lot of considerations in there but first and foremost I would absolutely do uh um a very high fat carnivore diet that was ketogenic get my gki down low long periods of fasting and get that gki down as low as possible and have periods of refeeding because you don't want to lose too much weight and um that's what I would do and hopefully you or your loved one who has pancreatic cancer does well good luck with that I'm very sorry that they've had to go through that unfortunately cancer is getting more and more and more prevalent as we go and I think that's that's very speaking to the um that's speaking to the state of our environment because cancer rates have never been this High ever and of course we knew about cans oh we're just screening or screening so we're get no if you didn't screen for these things they would just turn into full-blown metastatic cancer that would that would be terminal you catch it early oh look here's a little cancer there you catch that early you take it out you cut it out and it doesn't spread oh well that means that we're just catching more cancers no because we're C we're catching them early so they're not turning into a big metastatic mess at the end at the end of the store because that is what happens you know unless you're saying that these things just spontaneously resolve you're saying that you have a you know 5 inch lesion in your in your lung that's cancerous and spread to your lymph nodes and that's just going to self-resolve with doing nothing different probably not if you're doing something different like you go on a ketogenic carnivore diet you know then that that's that's shown that people can resolve as standalones that's in the literature that's published data but you know it's not just going to do it for nothing right so you know cancer rates are at an all-time high and it's and they're just going higher every decade and oh screening is just you know we're just doing more screening dumb dumb statement by dumb people if you don't catch those early then you're going to catch them late like they're going to come they're going to come down that pipe right and so just because you caught it early doesn't mean that you wouldn't have become metastatic and full-blown later on and you wouldn't have known about it like that's that's ridiculous um you know you would have you know I mean some cancers just sit there sort of like a you towed in a well and just sort of just chilling there like prostate cancer can do that or it can metastasize your bones and kill you very quickly you know but um you know the thing is is that uh cancer rates are going up and if you catch them early then you have a better of treating them you catch them late you have a less good chance of treating them but you're going to catch it it's going to happen you're going to get a diagnoses at some point you know you're going to find out that that person had cancer so is just not the case that we're just straining more people or same thing with the heart disease people saying this oh we're just getting better at screening that's why the rates are going up they're going up because more people are having heart attacks you fool you know that's not that's nothing to do with screening um you know if you screen someone and then they causes a heart attack we probably stop screaming then no more people are having heart attacks they're just surviving so saying oh well the age adjusted mortality rate for heart disease peaked in the 60s and 70s and then it's come down oh and that's that's so great that's because of you know we've gotten rid of saturated fat and we're putting people on on medications to lower their cholesterol nonsense you know we've got better interventions we've got better hospital system ambulance systems we can get people from in remote areas to Cath Lab more easily and people stop smoking massively reduce the amount of smoking so those are all going to reduce mortality rates but the incidence and prevalence is going up decade after decade more people are having their firsttime heart attack than ever before it's just that they're surviving right they're not it's not a death sentence anymore and so you know um and again age adjusted data anytime you adjust anything you're not using the real numbers so so basically just ignore anything that says age adjusted or this adjusted or that adjusted because you're not using the raw data you're not using real data you're you're changing it you're altering it you're adjusting it and you're adjusting it to fit fit your own uh purposes generally and um so no the rates of heart disease are going up the rates of cancers are going up more people are getting cancer oh we're living longer [\u00a0__\u00a0] the average life expectancy from birth has not actually gone up all that much in the last several decades in fact now it's starting to go down you know and so you know this is this is just not the case and so people are just making excuses after excuses and they're just trying to deny the reality in front of them either because they're just stubborn and pigheaded or it fits their ideology or they're a bastard and they're trying to trick people and uh they're under the payroll of you know whatever big food big uh Pharma whatever that wants to keep perpetuating this disease State either way it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] and don't listen to it Aaron thank you very much for the Super Chat wife has pots and EDS I'm assuming that's 's down syndrome she says uh I'm a weak on Carnivore and feeling nauseous with food aversions meat doesn't taste good and makes my stomach turn but I know I'm hungry what should I eat um we just try to eat meat or eggs that taste good you if you're getting meat aversions it is likely that you are not as hungry as you think um just generally at the beginning of the meal it probably will taste good it just me may be that you're not that you're you're eating less than you think you should you're getting carb Cravings sugar Cravings that's not hunger that's a craving that's a that's a that's a incorrect signal that you're getting that goes away that goes away usually after two weeks and so you you know just try eating at least once a day fatty meat and if it tastes good great keep eating until it stops tasting good if that's only a little bit in that's fine you know it may be that your body's just telling you hey you don't need to eat all that much and just listen to that if you're getting Cravings it's it's just you know carb Cravings sugar Cravings these sorts of things that that do go away so I would still listen to your body if your body just says that they just don't eat probably don't need to eat if you have excess adapost tissue then you're probably uh you know your body's doesn't need as much energy coming in that it that it would in other circumstances so just listen to that um but again well and also too you know some people feel nauseous because they're just not used to eating as much fat as all that and they're not used to eating as much meat and they're just sort of freaking them out um but if your body's telling you not to eat meat it's telling you not to eat it's not telling you not to eat that it's telling you just not to eat because that is what you're designed to eat it it'll go away um just do try to do that um you know drink water eat meat um eat meat when it tastes good when and where it tastes good and stop when it stops tasting good even if that's a lot less than you think that uh you would well a lot less than you normally have and you think that you need just you know you will get through this your body will will talk to you and is talking to you and so if it's if it's a certain meat that's doing that try a different meat you know maybe bacon Works maybe eggs work maybe lamb works but beef doesn't work something like that some people have these weird sort of things where they just like they're eating lamb for a while and then they and then the body's just like can't do lamb anymore and but beef tastes great or pork tastes great or something like that try different Meats but still listening to your body if meat stops tasting good just stop and um I would expect that to to settle down and then certainly the cravings and uh and everything go away things a lot of times we're just used to eating all the time that's we don't actually realize that we don't need as much as as we we normally ate oh I have to eat I have to eat more I have to eat more and um I eat once a day you know I've got I've got 23 hours of my day just just for me you know and that's not what it used to be you know it used to be you're just constantly looking for food because you're getting lowgrade nutrition and you're getting these deranged hunger signals that are telling your body to to eat and eat and eat and eat and eat um and that's not the case anymore and so when you get your natural signals you don't need to eat nearly as much or as often because you're eating high density and nutrition and so um you're week in still early days usually after two weeks those weird hunger signals will go away those carb fragrance will go away keep listening to your body eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good when it stops tasting good you're done you know you can drink water after that if you're feeling snacky or weird oh I should eat I should eat maybe try drinking water sometimes that settles that down if meat's not tasting good it's not sounding appealing try water instead see how that goes usually in another week or two this this will settle down and as long as you're eating enough and eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good you'll be fine hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own questions please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest of the Q&A okay question from uh Lena who says I had menstrual cycle before starting carnivore when I did animal based but now that I switched my cycle um now that I switched my cycle has been late for two weeks how can I fix um so the thing is is that is that obviously this is very hormonally based and so sometimes when you go on a carnivore when you go on a carnivore di you cut out carbs you cut out sugar and you cut out all these other sorts of things it will disrupt your normal hormonal Pathways and your and production and utilization that you can get disruption in your in your period um you know so that that can happen and so in in women that that does disrupt their their cycle It generally lasts a couple months sometimes 3 to four months four or five months that's sort of the outside that I've seen and then it and then it is it fits into a more normal pattern so it may take a couple months before this this sort of settles down I mean if your Cycle's been late for two weeks is there a possibility that you're pregnant you know that's obviously always on the cards hopefully that didn't freak you out but it's something that you should consider and if that's a possibility to get that checked as well because that's obviously part of it part of the equation but if um if uh it's not that then it's likely just your hormones are being are changing and adjusting and fixing and optimizing and then that can change your cycle and that can happen and that's actually quite common for women that it it changes their pattern of their cycle but then after a few months that settles down and just uh goes pretty well after that uh the D thank you very much for the Super Chat not seeing a question attached but maybe there's one down the line um I'm not really seeing one but I'll keep an eye out for it Vladimir thank you very much for the Super Chat thanks for all you're doing man uh because of you I'm Carnival for life well awesome I I appreciate that you're very welcome I'm glad that that's helped and uh you know good luck with it Joanna Hunter thank you for the Super Chat five months on Carnivore and recently having episodes of beling I'm thinking belching and a little heartburn um am I dumping oxalates any recommendation well the thing with oxalate dumping is it can be very vague it can sort of manifest as anything I haven't heard it really be belching but maybe you know I mean the thing is they almost almost do anything anything um and a little heartburn um I I would that wouldn't be my first guess you know I I think that it would it would proba more likely be something else one of the things to do is to try to get a um like like a journal like a food and symptom Journal we just write down what you ate and what time you ate it every day and when you got symptoms what your symptoms were and and see if there's any sort of correlation sometimes it can be that you're eating certain things and that's just sort of disagreeing with you maybe there's something in like the juice to not really handling chicken or pork or eggs or something like that and your body's just sort of reacting a bit negatively to that and um uh or could be completely unrelated and at least then you have information you can find a relationship maybe you uh get away from you know whatever was was associated with that maybe that helps it or maybe you find there's absolutely no association whatsoever and then you sort of look at other sort of causes but that's that's what I would do um oxalate dumping will quite typically come with different sorts of things like rashes you weird stuff white crystals coming out of your eyes or your skin or uh joint pains and gout like symptoms you oxalates can cause gout and that's that that's one of the one of the causes of Doubt um is oxalates and um I think that it's called pseudo gout but previously there were five causes of gout and oxalates being one of them and now now gout is is um ter is the term for uh uric acid crystals in the in the joints and then the other causes are pseudogout so in any case it can cause gout like symptoms and those sorts of things but um I hadn't heard it with belching and bit of burn I mean maybe you know but it wouldn't be my first go-to I think that that in this case would be a process of of of elimination and that the oxalate sort of thing would be a diagnosis of exclusion if you can't find anything else you know maybe consider oxalates in this case and you have you know very low amount of oxalates like a little bit of lemon juice or something in water I believe that'll do it or just like a bit of tea that will have a bit of oxalates in it and see if that helps and if it does then great you know have that for a couple weeks and then try coming off of it and see what happens and see how you go but I would start with the diary first and see see what that does for you Verge thank you very much for the Super Chat big fan eight months in and loving it just curious have you been um have you been more immune to say common cold since you've been 100% carnivore and if you still get them do you experience them differently to PR corniva absolutely so my immune system is way better now I I don't get um I don't get the you know the um well I don't I just don't get sick as often and nearly as often and um and uh and when I do get sick it's it's more I just feel a bit more tired and a bit run down I'm not getting like the body aches and feeling you know pretty rubbish and things like that so it's um it's it's it's much it's much more subtle I don't I used to get sick like every month like every month I would get a cold and uh that sucks especially because you you're playing rugby and winter sport in the winter months and you're just sick all the time just sick all the time and um you know because of my asthma if like if I if that sort of went into my lungs I would you know I would get pneumonia quite regularly so I get pneumonia sometimes once sometimes three times a year confirmed diagnosed on x-ray on chest x-ray not good not what I want and so you know I would uh I would just be sick all the bloody time I've really not been sick since I went full carnivore again in my early 20s I was just never sick and I remember like in my teenage years it was just sick all the time my friends always laugh at it and you know when I was uh when I was doing cornivore in my early 20s and they oh yeah you're just sick all the time and I was like I was getting a bit like I don't get sick anymore like like that's not a thing I don't get sick and now looking back on it that was that period of time I was just never sick and then again after that I started getting sick all the time and now I just don't get sick and if I do get sick it's I'm more tired and run down I don't even feel sick it's just I noticed there are a lot of other people around me that have flues and it's like okay I guess that's what that's why I'm feeling a bit tired and run down or I feel like I'm just maybe fighting something off and then I go to sleep and wake up fine the next day so yeah no it's very different my immune system is far better than it was before and um yeah it's it's much much different very different Abdi Kanani thank you very much for the Super Chat is there any issue consuming Diet Sprite and gum uh yeah I mean it does have a lot of chemicals in it that you don't want I mean just remember that you we're not combustion engines it's not about calories it's not about burning things and getting energy from burning them because we don't do that we're chemical factories we put chemicals in and on our body and we're going to get chemical reactions and so that Diet Sprite and that gum uh you know the the non-sugar sweeteners that are in there they will have chemical interactions in your body and even though they're not going to have the same chemical interactions as as sugar they're still going to have chemical interactions uh Stevia there's a study in in mice that showed that given one equivalent of one diet soda can worth of stevia to these mice reduce their fertility rate by 55% so okay it's not calories it's not burnable energy it is still uh a chemical and it's going to have chemical reactions in your body so I you know that's why U you know my rule for myself is no plants or mushrooms no sugar or any sweeteners and nothing artificial so the Diet Sprite in the gum uh I mean gum comes from a plant anyway um and the and the sweeteners you know or the any sweeteners and there's artificial sort of ingredient ingredients and things like that in there so that sort of ticks all the no boxes for me and um you know so I would I I would avoid those for Optimal Health I mean you a bit of you know uh sugar-free gum I mean honestly if I I haven't chewed gum in six years or seven years but if I were I would probably chew it and like spit it out like spit out the the sugary or non- sugary sort of sweetener flavors until it got down to being just Bland and just chew on that um I wouldn't I wouldn't uh want to to consume any of that um to consume any of the the artificial sweeteners or the sugar sweeteners okay uh Serge XC thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm not seeing a question but maybe maybe down the chain Logan p smithberg great name uh thank you very much for the Super Chat dad is on the standard American diet struggles with chronic back pain for 20 plus years um he has as assuming that's ankal loing spondilitis has tried almost everything and thinks it's irreversible possible fuse spine stiffness Etc can the cornivore diet help it certainly has helped other people with anking spondilitis and other autoimmune diseases as well and back pain oh my gosh back pain um and just pain in general chronic pain it just reduces inflammation you're bringing in less of these inflammatory factors that are going to cause pain and you're raising your ketones which will reduce inflammation even further they directly suppress inflammasomes that are going to cause more inflammation and that's subsequently going to cause more pain and so if you go on a cornivore diet yes people's pains dramatically reduce my back has has hurt since I was a kid at 15 years old I would joke that I had like the back of a 60-year old man I was like God is always hurt um and then all of a sudden for five years six years in my 20s it just didn't hurt at all and I didn't have any back pain and problems and then it started hurting again when I was sort of 27 I'm like oh that's weird my back hasn't hurt in years and that's when I sort of slipped off and I started eating other garbage not garbage I was always whole food I never I never ate garbage I was was like very rarely I mebe once every few years that i' get fast food or something like that and um and then you know now you know I mean I just stopped eating carbohydrates in in my late 30s just because it it I just noticed that my back would hurt a lot more whenever I had anything with carbs in I'm like okay so I sort of avoided that and then you know getting rid of all the rest of the plants it's much much better so you know I still have a bit of a bit of pain and stiffness but it's um nothing compared to what it was before and that's what a lot of people are talking about um in their own experiences and my patients I've dramatically uh you know reduced pain and some of these people that have had chronic pain issues for you know 10 years 12 years 20 years and they're on you know fibromyalgia and they're on all these uh medications and opiates and injections and nothing's really working they're pretty miserable and then they just go on a cornivore diet and three months later they don't have nearly the issues that they have or a month after one gentleman came off all of his uh opus and medication that he' been on for 12 years in one month on a carnivore diet so yes it can definitely help uh there are absolutely people with anging spontis that have improved their symptoms dramatically by going on a cornivore diet and any autoimmune issue is going to help I I've yet to see an autoimmune condition that doesn't improve dramatically on a carnivore diet so um red meat and water is the most important that's going to give him the least um adverse effects that's going to give them the most benefit uh by being just red meat and just water so good luck to him um it's it's not going to turn back the hands of time but it will definitely reduce inflammation it can stop this from progressing further and significantly help his symptoms absolutely I have uh no doubt of that he needs to be strict he needs to be strict red meat and water not even coffee that will increase inflammation that will cause pain it'll be a lot better than it was but it won't be as good as it can be and so you you know do at least 30 days of only red meat only water nothing gets in your system otherwise and then you'll see how good you can actually feel he'll see how good he can actually feel and then Asing cough and goes nope that's not working because that makes my back hurt a lot more so you know get that Baseline where you know that you know you can where you know that you can um uh you know at least see how good it can possibly be and then you add in different sorts of things so you can see that contrast on how you you should feel and how that makes you feel it's big difference it's a big big difference and that's why I don't touch anything else because I've seen that contrast and I don't like it and I think that he'll he'll be he'll do the same if he's able to make it 30 days I'm sure he will you know it's just I mean this if this can dramatically improve his life like why not why not give it 30 days you know you can do anything for 30 days and the grand scheme of your life and completely improve the rest of your life for and give you decades longer like why wouldn't you you know why wouldn't you uh go for that so in any case good luck to him can someone had a triple bypass to carnivore yeah absolutely so uh in fact probably great idea to to do that anytime you have sort of medical issues uh these sort of serious medical issues it's even more important to be on on a proper diet eating proper nutrition that's biologically appropriate for our spe species and all the best evidence shows that that's a cornivore diet and So for anybody asking any questions you know is it you know can someone with X do a cornivore diet the answer is yes because we're all humans and just like it's like saying can all orca whales eat seals well what about if they have that yeah they're orca whales they can they can definitely eat seal what about polar bears can they eat seal what about if they have a tooth missing yes they can definitely do that they're just going to chew funny you know it's just it's just the the species right you know can all cows eat the types of grass that cows typically eat even if they're pregnant even if it's a male even yes you know food is species specific and humans we're carnivores and again herbivores eat meat too if they can opportunistically it doesn't hurt them it is it is still good for them right it's the plants that you have to avoid if you're not not involved to eat them that's the problem those are the ones with the toxins in them not the meat so yes you can definitely do a corn diet and it will uh you know help in a lot of ways and especially someone who's had a triple bypass the last thing you want to do is keep doing what you were doing before that could put you in a position to to get a triple bypass and so hopefully this will help prevent future episodes that that require surgery Etc Linda angerer thank you very much for the Super Chat can you speak to kidney stones my husband has multiple stones and was told to not heat meat uh can you give uh can you give me an understanding um I mean just ask him for the data on that is ask him to say okay you know is is there a study that shows that eating meat causes kidney stones uh I can tell you right now there aren't and certainly know um yeah no there's just none I mean it's just nonsense I mean what the hell in me is going to cause a kidney stone you know can cause kidney stones plant toxins like oxalates 75% of of kidney stones are calcium oxalate stones that does not come from meat that comes from plants that contain oxalates like spinach and things like that and many others and so no that's that's not the case um you know do it's just weird you know some people just gotten you know caught up in this hype this plant-based hype that just meat is awful meat is awful oh my God your kidneys oh you got to stop eating meat when the hell did that happen you know people just having just you know fulminant kidney failure and kidney stones going back through Antiquity because we've always eaten meat you know and yet we're having this rise in these problems more recently that doesn't make any sense and um you know if there's say oh well your your kidneys are damaged from kidney stone so you don't want to stress them out more so you don't want to eat meat because higher protein can cause damage to your kidneys well first of all no they can't but you maybe that's what they're talking about if they think that but the studies actually show that higher protein consumption improves kidney function it doesn't lessen it and so no you don't have to you don't have to avoid meat for for kidney stones in fact that's the thing that's going to protect you against it because you're not bringing in a whole bunch of stuff that can precipitate kidney stones like the oxalates now there's some people that down the road years down the road they can get oxalate dumping and they can still get calcium oxalate stones after the fact but that's because they've built up so many oxalates in their tissues and their body's trying to get rid of all this crap and it's going out in your kidneys and it's binding the calcium and doing all that and um and that is um is possible to do that down the road but that's again the oxalates from years and years and years of eating eating High oxalate foods like spinach so no meat does not cause kidney stones at all whatsoever full stop and it does not cause kidney dysfunction at all whatsoever Full Stop in fact improves kidney function I've seen this again and again and again and that's what the literature shows as well ien thank you very much for the super chat um carnivore for five months my blood pressure has improved and I now get laded getting up too quickly on my current dose what can be done getting off the that'ss on together so that that's what I was talking about earlier with the other gentleman asking about blood pressure medication that's a sign that your blood pressure is too low with the medication so yeah definitely work with your doctor and talk to them and say hey I'm getting these light dizzy spells start checking your your blood pressure at home U just normally at rest and then when you get that lightheadedness check your blood pressure and so you get those data points in say hey look my blood pressure is you know 105 over 60 uh normally and then you know I I get up and all a sudden drops down to like 80 over 40 or something like that so that that's clearly a case you know you have you know clear evidence to your to present to your doctor say hey I need to reduce this so depending on on the medication that you're on um depending on the dose that you're on you you may need to reduce in a stepwise progression or maybe you're just on the lowest dose and you can just come right off but that's something you'll need to talk to your doctor about but it definitely sounds like that's time to do that you're you're getting symptomatically uh low blood pressure at that point and that's that sounds like what's happening there so definitely a good time to talk to your doctor about that Miguel Diaz thank you very much for the Super Chat is it possible to remove arterial plaques from arteries if so how well surgically take those and ectomies uh have been is is a common procedure common enough anyway but um there are limited studies showing that the body does this itself however there are some like so the lean mass hyperr data um with Dave Felman and Nick norwitz they found that um people on a ketogenic diet high fat meat-based ketogenic diet where their LDL cholesterol was elevated far past what is considered the normal upper limit which I don't consider the upper limit I think that it's exactly where it's supposed to be uh when the LDL goes up like that in that circumstance when you're on a carnivore keto diet um but with this Elevate what what they term elevated LDL cholesterol um is uh you know and if LDL just causes heart disease then obviously we should see heart disease develop in these individuals that were at these elevated levels quote unquote elevated levels for um an average of 4.7 years and in fact they found no progression in atherosclerotic plaques in fact the trend was to reduce atherosclerotic plaque and there are studies with meditation funny enough that that was sort of one of the main Interventional trials has ever shown that you can reverse arterial plaques and that for 40 minutes a day if you meditate do mindful meditation for 40 minutes a day calm yourself relax yourself get your cortisol levels down uh stress levels down that um you can actually reverse atherosclerotic plats so yes it can be done it has been shown with the you know meditation studies and we're starting to see that in the dayve Felman studies and seeing it anecdotally I've I have patients and people that I've worked with online or my patreon group uh who have absolutely started to reverse this and there and case reports are starting to be uh put up as well so there there are people um you know Dr Jamie Seaman like her husband reversed his plaques and they're talking and and um when speaking to her they were thinking about writing it up as a case report getting it in the literature I don't know if they've done that that was something that that she mentioned and then I've had people in my Patron group one one guy uh Chip he had a 100% occlusion complete occlusion of his I believe his right cored artery and now it's patent it's still very narrowed but it's open now that's not supposed to happen so it is going backwards and basically you just eat a natural diet and you stop exposing yourself to harmful things like cigarettes and alcohol and sugar and and plants in general and your body can heal from all sorts of things that you know it's uh it was thought not possible to heal from previously so that's what I would that's what I would say and um you know if you're just doing what your body if you're just eating what you're supposed to eat your body's going to do what it's supposed to do it's going to heal from everything that it can heal and it appears that people can actually start healing from AIS chotic plaques as well uh stress is a major one sleep is a major one these are these are things you know that it's not just diet that comes into play here but that's a major major major fundamental um issue here is is what we're eating what we're putting into our body but also stress also sleep optimize your sleep and um you really prioritize your sleep and reduce stress as well and fix your diet and I think you'll be fine the dude thank you very much for the Super Chat type two diabetic eating full carnivore just wondering uh I have some decrease in my blood sugar but considering I have no sugar going uh in at thought I may have dropped more I would have thought I would have dropped more calcium score uh will carnivore help so okay so so piecing that together type two diabetic eating full carnivore um had have had some decrease but thought it would would do more it just takes time so you you still need to be on medication if you're prescribed medication until that gets down to a point that you can safely come off of this and you don't get elevated Rises but you know the thing is is that you know if you've been diabetic for years and decades that means that you've had insulin resistance for another decade to 15 years on top of that so this is this is a long process it has taking you a long time to get here it's going to take you a while to get out it's not going to take 15 20 30 40 years to get out of it like it took you to get into it but you know there's there's there's no shortcuts so you know it's like if you walk 10 miles into the woods you got to walk 10 miles out you know like that's that's all there is to it your body has to heal and it takes time to heal so your blood sugar is dropping it is coming down and that's a good thing right still take the medications if you need it to keep that blood sugar below you know in that optimal threshold because you need to because higher blood sugar kills people that's a problem and so you know and just just be patient you know it's early days I mean it's it's you know be one thing if it was like a decade and you're like oh this really isn't shifting but look it's it's it's something that you need to give time it took you decades to get into the current position that you're in now you know a few months or even a year or two isn't really all that much uh in the grand scheme of things considering how long it took you to get here so you need to give your body a chance to heal as well uh calcium score we don't really know one way or the other but my my suspicion would be yes it does seem to help with plaques plaques are different than just calcium score calcium score doesn't say anything about the soft plaques so you could have more calcification but smaller soft plaques and your CAC score goes up but but your total plaque and total occlusions go down you know so that's not really um going to tell you a full picture just by looking at the CAC score but you know but the thing is you just check it once a year once every two years and you just and you just see what happens eventually I would expect that to come down yes and certainly your plaques in general like your soft plaques I would expect those to come down as well um but we're still waiting on you know more long-term data the the Day filment stuff is sort of the long that we have at the moment that's for keto not even pure carnivore um it's but they show this trend Down Show the the reversal in um AOS chlorotic plaques which is great so that's what I would expect to see uh is that given time that CAC score and your plaques in general will will recede that is what the that is what the trend seems to show at the moment Mr now fenor okay um thank you for the Super Chat Michael in chat is wondering if um cornivore diet is appropriate for someone that has had a triple bypass cheers um yeah I think I think we we spotted that yeah so it is it is definitely um it is definitely appropriate for someone a triple bypass or quadruple bypass or quintuple bypass and probably more so because they have this AOS scerotic disease and this is going to be the thing that's going to reduce inflammation reduce that uh the things that are going to precipitate more accumulation of AOS AOS sclerotic plats and hopefully reverse it but um you know we have only preliminary data on that now we don't have hard evidence that will do that but certainly a lot of case reports and certainly you know day filment showing that Trend to decrease is already very positive Jill Jill thank you very much for the Super Chat will carore help if someone has R yr1 well it depends on what R yr1 is just look that up real quick r y R1 [Music] um so skeletal muscle sort of issue as to do with um calcium release I don't know uh it's not oh announc R yr1 database presentation at the muscular distrophy Association okay I don't know is that something that's um has to do with muscular distrophy I'm not sure it's not something I've come across before um let's take a look sorry a little boring when other people are looking things up but um has to do with calcium release in your muscles I'm not too sure um it's um it's possible but I I don't actually know much about that disease unfortunately um so I don't know uh but you know a lot of these issues you know you have a genetic predisposition for something and then you have environmental trigger and so sometimes you you're not going to get the presentation of the disease or the symptoms um just by having the genetics uh you you need other things to to to go along with that and so that's that's quite a lot of diseases and so when you remove the different sort of En environmental triggers and factors uh many of which will come from food that we eat inappropriately or the lack of nutrients that we we need that um that that can precipitate that there something in muscular distrophy that it mentioned that I don't know it's association with muscular distrophy but the interesting thing about muscular distrophy that I that I found out that I've I've spoken about before is that cows have muscular distrophy and it's exactly the same presentation apparently from what I've been told by veterinarians and ranchers uh that this is the same this is the same presentation of muscular distrophy in humans except they know that it's nutritional so called nutritional muscular distrophy in cows and it's a selenium deficiency so they have a deficiency in selenium and because of their specific genetics that deficiency in selenium ends up presenting as muscular distrophy so that sort of begs a question is is this a nutritional deficiency in humans um worth finding out I mean Jesus like why wouldn't you you know I mean I I like why isn't that I mean obviously you know you don't you know vets and doctors don't necessarily talk about all these sorts of things things but you know you you would have hoped that like you know vets at some point would have been like hey that's must distopy and cows and that's nutritional H maybe maybe we should look into that for people too I I mean why hopefully that's been done but I I don't I don't trust anybody in this um that question needs to be answered and so you know if you have a child or you yourself have muscular distrophy you know it's generally pretty uh difficult and you people can can die from this um so but if you have a family member or child or someone you know has musular distopy find out you know put them on a carnivore diet check their selenium you know check their other micronutrients correct anything that's missing put them on just a meat and water diet red meat and water diet with a bit of liverance organs every now and then see what happens um I am very curious about that could that be with the the r R1 don't know it's not something I know about and I haven't come across uh certainly not in the context of a carnivore diet even and so but again worth finding out it's one of those things that you just it's going to help you in Thousand other ways anyway it may help you in this might as well check it out might as well try it out and then report back let people know um if there's forms that you're in uh and that has helped you or helped your loved one talk about it spread around say hey this worked for me maybe it'll work for you too and and it helped me in all these other ways as well and whatever condition that is if it's if you're optimizing your health otherwise it's certainly going to make that condition even if it doesn't help that condition it's certainly going to help you live with that condition better because you're just going to be healthier in other respects anyway so still definitely worth the effort Serge XC uh says I have severe Mass Cell Activation Syndrome uh do you have any advice on improving and can the carnivore diet heal my condition um so the thing is there's different causes of mass Cell Activation Syndrome some of them are oxalates that's one of the that's one of the known um causes of mass Cell Activation Syndrome and so getting away from oxalates and just eating a cornivore diet can absolutely improve that you're not bringing a bunch of oxalates and and and uh triggering off your mass cells so a lot of things that we do and expose oursel to um when we stop exposing ourselves to that our body starts cing down so it could very well uh improve mcast um has for other people um it's stubborn and there can be other things your body's reacting to outside of your diet so you need to make sure that you eliminate those things as well and obviously work with your doctor but um it's absolutely worth a shot because you're going to be removing out things that can trigger off mcast and um and it's again it's going to improve in so many other ways anyway it can just make your life a lot easier and better uh even with the mcast so good luck with that I would definitely try it yes dova Squad 52 thank you for the Super Chat cha is the best well thank you very much I appreciate that um let me see let me see here if we have any questions in the the chat here with um and um in IG so uh there's one from um there's a question here in Instagram says a husband had a cardiac arrest after 3 months on a corn di 54 years or sorry 45 years old taking a lot of pills now he'd love to cut down the pills for cholesterol Etc is there a chance that he can in the future he was perfectly healthy not sure why he had a cardiac arrest the doc said his cholesterol was through the roof and says probably genetic um thing is you stop eating for five days your your your LDL is going to go through the roof basically it's going to go back to exactly what it's supposed to be um and it has nothing to do with eating fat or meat or anything like that it has to do with not eating carbohydrates and so this is just a metabolic State change you have to mobilize fat around your body because your body's running on your fat stores instead of the carbage that you're eating and you need cholesterol to mobilize that fat the Lal cholesterol molecules or the transport molecules for fat and energy so that's what's happening there uh it certainly wasn't carnivore diet you know you don't you don't develop um you don't develop AOS scerotic and just dead in all your your arteries in in three months of any diet you know and if you were carnivore your whole life and then you switched um you know and 3 months later something happened it it likely wasn't because of the switch there's something else happening and so you know you're not going to you're not going to go from no heart disease to heart attack time um in three months of anything of any diet or any change or smoking for three months or doing drugs for three months unless you really go after it you know so um you know it's likely this is built up over a lifetime and then you know just you still had plaques and hadn't reversed them it takes a long time to reverse these even if they even can be reversed it seems that they can but we don't we don't know that for sure but that seems to be what's happening um but it takes much longer than three months you know remember in the Dave Feldman um Le mat hyperresponders when they had this you know LDL that was through the roof um that they had um on average four and a half or sorry sorry 4.7 years at that level on this diet his ketogenic diet and um and the trend was coming down in atherosclerosis but it wasn't like it was just oh bam it just like just dropped off completely it was trending down but this takes years to undo so it takes years to build up takes years to undo and so that's that's likely what what was going on there um as far as cholesterol medication is concerned again and you know this is just a metabolic State change your body is mobilizing fat around the body and it's those cholesterol molecules that are that are doing that and so I think that those are necessary I don't think those those are damaging I definitely don't think that they cause heart disease or atherosclerosis um always remember that we we've had you know even the genetic conditions like familial hyp cholesterolemia um we have you know through the roof LDL that has that the same amount of that those genes have been in the population long before um cardiovascular disease became the number one killer in the world you know this was this was unheard of in the 1800s and before right the first heart attack first death by myocardial infarction in America proven on autopsy was in 1912 and they didn't believe it they thought like well we've all seen thousands of autopsies we' never seen this we don't bu it 10 years later they started like oh okay we're seeing more of these I guess that guy guy did find something 10 years after that in the 1930s it's the number one killer in America right we're eating less meat at that point than we had in 200 years right before and after right so that doesn't make any sense right and before that when this was unheard of we still had people with the exact same rates of familial hypercholesterolemia in the population so so why why why why why wasn't that causing heart disease and heart attack and strokes and things like like that so it's um it's it's a bit silly to think that cholesterol causes this and we know that the sugar companies just use cholesterol as a scapegoat to paint the blame on something else besides sugar because there studies coming out saying hey look there's a strong association with with refined sugar and and access to sugar and heart disease and and they were like no we need to cover this up so they did opposition research this is what this is what industries do this is what big business does this is but they they just put out data well they put out fake data and studies to say that their product's safe and someone else is causing a problem you know it's this is just [\u00a0__\u00a0] we know that it's published in the journal American Medical Association in 2016 their own internal memos detailing how they paid off various professors from Harvard and elsewhere to falsify data and publish fraudulent studies to make it appear as a CL cestal caus heart disease when it was really sugar and to exonerate sugar say he was safe it was just an empty calorie that's where that turned term comes from that's where that phrase comes from and one of those professors was named head of the USDA and he is the one who authored and published the USDA declaration saying that cholesterol cause heart disease saying that saturated fat increased cholesterol stop eating both oh my gosh that was the first time in the USA had ever said don't eat something as opposed to eat enough of everything you need to get enough nutrients before that um it was we were worried about malnutrition as opposed to eating fat and having problems it was just never a problem problem and that's because we weren't eating high octane garbage like we started to in the 20th century with a bunch of refined processed seed oils and sugars and refined carbs and processed foods and all this garbage that uh that came through so cholesterol was never the problem it wasn't a problem then it's not a problem now it wasn't a problem in 1800s and for thousands of years before that that we've have records and for millions of years before that when we've been eating just solely meat if cholesterol was a problem if eating saturated fat and meat were a problem it would have been a problem millions of years ago our ancestors that started eating meat and more fat they would not have survived they would have died out they would have not have met their um their um evolutionary uh goals and their the people the the the our early ancestors that stuck to eating plants they would have been the ones that survived not the ancestors that switched to meat and got a survival advantage from eating meat because the plantbased ones that were eating more plants those lines died out it was during the ice ages when the ice shell shells came down that Homo habilis who was carnivorous and became an apex predator was able to contend with just eating meat and taking down big massive animals that way outclassed Us by every physical metric they're the ones that survived because they're the one because eating meat gave a survival advantage over eating plants it would have been the other way around if uh meat were bad for us and cause harm and either way over millions of years you adapt to whatever the hell is in your environment if you are surviving right this is why people that have had more access exposure to agriculture over the last 10,000 years like Europeans and people from the Middle East and elsewhere North Africa parts of Asia that and in mees America things like that that these people have had adaptations that that other indigenous populations that have only been uh hit with agriculture more recently have not had and so we still get sick but we just get sick at lower rates than say the Plains Indians in America who were eating bison up until the late 1800s or the native Australians who were eating just meat and hunting up until last century or two right so you know life adapts and so we we have had some adaptations in some populations over 10,000 years so what about over five million years that we've been eating meat six million years 8 million years two million years of being apex predators of course we're going to adapt to that if there was anything bad in it which there is not there is nothing in meat that is harmful to you nothing right this this is meat is this harmful to you your own body it has just toxins in it they're just killing you from the inside out I mean that's what these people are suggesting they're suggesting that what you are made of is is killing you and so if you eat that that will kill you it's like makes no damn sense you're eating things to get nutrients to make more meat and bones and tissue right you eat bone eat meat bones and tissue you're going to get all those requisite materials you're not getting a whole bunch of other stuff those materials are not harmful to you those materials are what you need and then we're saying that our bodies just make things that just kill us like our muscles like our fat oh my God uh or the cholesterol your body's making something that's toxic why would we make LDL and cholesterol in the first place if it was just toxic if it was only toxic it was just a matter of time we're just going to get this if you just go pure vegan you you don't your LDL doesn't disappear and so you know let's say we were herbivores which we weren't that's just dumb um and you know even vegans don't even argue that we work you know so it's just like so what the hell's the argument you know and so but even just going just plants your LDL doesn't go to zero you know it's not supposed to be zero it's there for a reason your body's making this for a purpose and then and we're just trying to disrupt that and we're getting sicker and we're having problems and so you know LDL is not the problem cholesterol is not the problem it never was never will be and so you know I think that um you know it's up to you and your husband and um and what what you guys choose to do but I don't I don't you know the evidence is very clear that cholesterol was never the problem ever and that it was just blamed for hard disease when it was more likely sugar and processed foods and you know we just need to get away from that we just need to stop talking about it like no that was a con it's con then it's con now we're just not going to talk about it and if it's not if it's not the problem if that was the in the first place we don't need to drop it we don't need to reduce it we don't need to take medicines to to reduce it either and I don't that's why I don't um my cholesterol is uh higher than the than what is considered uh the you know the threshold for needing treatment or whatever couldn't care less could not care less that's exactly where it's supposed to be I'm eating what I'm supposed to eat my body's doing what it's supposed to do and my body's mobilizing fat that's what it's designed to do my body is not going to be making a whole physiologically in a normal physiological State it's not going to be making a whole bunch of chemicals that are just killing me right unless I have some sort of rare genetic defect but if everybody in the population is making ldls probably for a reason right so uh no I don't sorry that's 20 minute rant but it's just garbage it is just garbage and we need to get away from it we need to just stop thinking about cholesterol in those terms because it is not the cause of heart disease it just isn't Cody Savage thank you for the Super Chat would it be more beneficial to use some carbs on a day I know I'll drink alcohol I've heard alcohol without carbs can do more damage to the body no I haven't heard that myself um I would probably go the other way and if you're if you're going to damage yourself with alcohol the last thing you want to do is damage yourself more with carbs and alcohol and and get a whole bunch of like sugar and sugary drinks and things like that you know fructose damages your liver in the same way as alcohols you actually get further damage to your your liver by uh having sugary uh mixers with it uh so no I don't think it'd be beneficial I think you do the the least amount of exposure and the least amount of your harm of harm possible and um yeah I mean some people say oh you got eat a bunch of carbs to soak up the alcohol where' that come from I don't know but it's it's not um it's not uh something that uh I think anyone has ever shown me any evidence for it's just something that people say you know as you're as you're growing up partying and things like that but um no I don't think so I don't think that's a good idea to have carbs ever or alcohol ever but if you do want to have alcohol sometimes I I wouldn't make it worse by adding carbs um okay guys I think I'm I have a little more time today so I'll probably go for another hour um probably end around noon but then I've got to go get ready for work so that's one hour from now but I've got a sort of a afternoon uh Clinic that I'm that I've got to do so I'll probably go for another hour um but uh maybe stop the super chats here because there's still still a lot of them uh that I need to get through I don't want to I don't want to miss uh out on on anybody um because I don't I don't like doing that but you know have to stop short of in about an hour so okay Jesse and Megan red meat Redmond salt water for three months gained 20 pounds M feel better that's great uh question is over had step two and congestion earaches um sandpaper itchy eyes red eyes is getting sick or colds normal for some yeah you can still definitely get sick um it's generally less severe and um it's generally less severe and and less often but you can definitely still get sick and um it's just that your your immune system is going to be much better so yeah and it's great you know it sounds like you wanted to gain gain weight some people are you know underweight they want to put on muscle they want to put on lean body mass it sounds like you have and that's that's really great um but yeah no you can still definitely get sick I mean I've like I said you know I've sort of felt a bit run down been like I'm sort of fighting something off there's there was one time I think that you know I got I got covid and um just felt pretty rotten for you know it hit me sort of in the late afternoon I felt pretty rotten went to sleep woke up feeling pretty rotten and then sort of cleared up and I was better after that and I was just a bit run down and tired for the the rest of the week and that was it uh and my neck hurt for some damn reason my neck hurt like hell and um that was it you know and um and then I think the worst one I got was I got like exposed to a flu uh when I first came to Australia um and I hadn't you know gotten flu shots or anything like that and I I hadn't I'd been in America so I hadn't been exposed to the strains that were bouncing around per and so I didn't have it sort of the builtup sort of uh crossover protection that you would get from other exposures and uh you know and I felt pretty rotten and but that you know got over that you know fairly quickly as well and haven't been sick since really that was it those are sort of the two times in six years that I've been sick otherwise I just sort of feel a bit run down and then I get over it so yes you can still get sick but it's it's much more reduced both in frequency and severity the motivational Misfit thank thank you very much for the Super Chat do fruits and vegetables cause cancer hard to say about cause and effect you know when you don't have um uh you know well thought out well planned out um single variable randomized control trials but there are there are substances in fruits and vegetables that have been shown to be carcinogenic and yes can cause cancer at least in animal models they found to be mutagen iic carcinogenic um that's not according to me that's according to The Who and botany books and various studies on the subject you're looking at these things in animals showing that these things can cause cancer a lot of these things can damage the mitochondria anything that damages the mitochondria long term is likely to be able to cause cancer because can the Hallmark of cancer is damaged mitochondria that can't function properly mitochondria are vital for the normal functioning of your cell and division of your cell because it's the the mitochondria that act as the policeman for cell division the cell's trying to divide and the and the mitochondria if they see something wrong and they don't want it to divide they stop it from happening but if they're damaged and they can't stop it then it just divides uncontrolled mitochondria have to be functional to stop cell division and so if you have damaged mitochondria you get unregulated cell growth and division that's what cancer is and if the cell is damaged and has says oh no we got a program cell that we got to just shut it down it's the mondra the condra that actioned that so they're the policemen they're also the execution so they're saying oh hey nope not doing that we're stopping here but now they're damaged they're not there so you know the riot continues and then you know say no we got to shut this down and uh but they can't action that if they're if they're damaged so you do things that damage the mitochondria you can precipitate cancers sin directly damages the mitochondria omega-6 like lenic acid directly damage the mitochondria a lot of these different plant toxins directly damage the mitochondria fructose can damage the mitochondria high blood sugar can damage the mitochondria dyum high levels of dyum can damage the mitochondria do damage mitochondria so um and that's what people don't know about Dum is very interesting it's heavy hydrogen so it's hydrogen proton with a neutron so it's the it's the most different isotope that with that we have it's double the weight uh with the same charge right so you have you know U you know the different different sort of isotopes of the different atoms um they'll they'll maybe have a couple neutrons different but they've got 14 protons or 16 protons and maybe they've got a different number of neutrons but that that doesn't change the weight and size as much as doubling it you know if you had you know 14 protons you don't have anything with 28 neutrons you know what I mean it's like it's like that's massive and so um or you know 14 neutrons whatever so like it's it's just a massive massive difference you know or you go from 14 to 28 neutrons or something like that that's a big difference that's a big big big difference um hydrogen quite often has one proton and every now and then about one in every 6,500 of these suckers will have a neutron on top of it it's double the size that goes through these little molecular Motors in the mitochondria and it's like a throwing a bowling ball into a blender just just going to just destroy the gears so it destroys and then that can't function properly the more you do the higher you du tyum the more those things get damaged and they they overwhelm your body's capacity to fix them and the mitochondria break down and so you know there's a lot of these things in there fruit and vegetables have high detarium being in a in a ketogenic state will lower your dyum because your uh mitochondria actually make metabolic water every one kilo of fat that you burn in your mitochondria produce 1.1 lers of dyum free water so you're lowering your total dyum levels down uh whereas like fruits and vegetables they can have quite high levels of dyum and they put you out of ketosis and so you're just damaging and damaging and damaging your mitochondria so you know you eat an apple every day is that going to give you cancer probably not you know but this is this is just this stuff just builds up in your body and it just sort of Damages you as you go and just eventually you can just overwhelm your system and you get cancer so yes there there are um there are chemicals and naturally occurring chemicals in fruits and vegetables that have been shown to be carcinogenic yes uh in in mostly in animal models so take that for what it is but that's that's what the data is is that in a lot of these animal models they've shown that these can be carcinogenic and mutogenic so they have carcinogens this is why I stopped eating plants 24 years ago because my cancer biology professor at University of Washington Seattle uh showed us there's 136 carcinogens just in Brussels sprouts and over 100 in mushrooms and over 80 in spinach and accelery cabbage and cucumbers and and uh you know all these other sorts of fruits and vegetables that we would eat on a regular basis and and um you know so there are carcinogens if there is a carcinogen in them that means that that chemical can precipitate cancer down the road insufficient quantity and exposure right and some of these a lot of these things have been done in animals and so um you know is that perfectly translatable to humans not always so take that for what it is but yes there are known carcinogens in fruits and vegetables yes Julie dismukes thank you very much for the Super Chat been doing carnivore for a few weeks and cholesterol came back Super High um at 327 HDL 61 LDL uh 259 triglycerides 58 drct wants me on Lipitor but I want to wait it out since I just started thoughts and advice thank you so much uh yeah don't worry about it uh your that looks great your HDL is great your Tri glycerides are great you have more HDL than triglycerides which means you're metabolically very healthy um and so you almost certainly have pattern a LDL which is the large buoyant LDL molecules which you are supposed to have those are the ones you make and aren't damaged and the um yeah and the thing is that the cholesterol was never a problem full stop and um you know it's a metabolic State change if you just started eating carbs for for a week or two your LDL will come down you eat Oreo cookies for two weeks your LDL will come down right so Oreo cookies good for your heart I I hope your doctor doesn't think that um but you know you know as you go your LDL may come down a bit but I I you know wouldn't really worry too much if it doesn't because it's supposed to do that you're mobilizing fat around your body and it's LDL that does that LDL is moving fat around your body for you so of course it's going to go up you need it to go up right that's part of being fat adapted is you're moving fat around your body so you can run on it and so you know that that doesn't go down who cares you know again we've been eating meat forever we've had familial hypoc cholesterol in the same rates of genetic expression for hundreds of years thousands of years however long but at least the last couple hundred years when heart disease was non-existent really you know first heart attack in America America confirmed on autopsy in 1912 there's one obscure reference to from a from a a you know presentation in um the late 1700s and probably in Europe somewhere I don't know exactly where where they said that there's like oh well looked at this on his autopsy and looked like there's just thrombus in the coronary artery it's like so you got one maybe something kind of in the 1700s and then one actual confirmed death on autopsy from myoc Cardinal infarction 120 later nothing in between there right so why is that we still had cholesterol then we still had LDL then they were eating a lot more meat and fat then a lot more and a lot less junk and they were smoking and drinking but 80% of men smoked back then you know why is this well because it's just complete garbage you know it was never the problem in the first place and it's not the problem now um so you know and what does lior do it doesn't doesn't get rid of the sdldl or the other damage it gets rid of it stops your body from making large buoyant LDL molecules those are ones you want so you know I I think this is just a simple simple misunderstanding of of the physiology and you know again you know the journal American Medical Association published actual internal memos from the Sugar Company showing that this was a force that this was this was a scapegoat that they used to stop people from blaming sugar when that's probably exactly who should have been blamed it certainly wasn't fat and meat um that has never caused a problem why the hell would it cause a problem now so because of that we just throw it out be like look cholesterol doesn't cause heart disease don't care that my LDL is that high uh studies with 11 million people have shown that higher LDL of any description there's over a 100 different kinds of LDL first of all so that's something that you should be aware of as well um that higher LDL of any description is associated with longer life okay so what's the problem here you know so I'm looking at that going like great you're going to live longer why would you want to lower that I wouldn't want to lower that I don't want to lower that so I don't lower that in myself or in my patients I I never checked um cholesterol in my patients and unless they specifically asked for it because I think it's a complete waste of time and money it was it was not is not the marker that we were told it was and it's a bloody waste of time looking at it uh for that reason because it was a lie that's it that's all there is to it so those are my my two cents on it and um if you really wanted to just get your doctor off your B eat some carbs for two weeks they'll come right down and you get that test oh wow they look better now great stop eating the carbs after that and move on with your life uh Bruce Lynch thank you very much for the Super Chat I tested positive for centrair antibodies can red meat and water help me I have started cornivore diet for a month now I have no clinical symptoms at this time does the meat have to be grass-fed as it is expensive uh no it doesn't necessarily have to be grass-fed uh unless you are reacting to grain finished beef but most people don't even with autoimmunity you have antibodies towards yourself that means you have an autoimmune condition and every autoimmune condition I've ever seen responds very well to a pure red meat and water diet but stick with red meat it doesn't have to be grass-fed and finished if you can get it that's great um that's that is objectively better but you likely won't notice a difference in your health and your autoimmunity if you if you just use grain finished as well um so yeah so that's perfect just yeah red meat and water that's it and but grain finished is okay if you if you seem to have problems with that um try the grass fed and finished and if that makes you even better do what you can to try to get that if you go directly to a farmer a Rancher and you buy one of their cows direct from them it is going to be miles cheaper than than just buying it you know ad hoc from a store in steak form if you buy a whole loin of ribey or New York or whatever that's even cheaper than just buying steaks you just cut those things up yourself and and you've got a bunch of staks at you know generally half the price they generally charge you uh double the price just to cut it for you so you know don't do that um if you can and uh yeah no but um I'm glad that you're giving this a try I hope I'm hopeful that it will uh help you you have no clinical symptoms which is perfect keep it that way uh by by staying on a red meat and water diet good luck with that copper cornivore kitchen uh thank you so much for the Super Chat you did not have to do that congrats on busting through 250,000 Subs uh thank you for all you do uh for all of us and thank you to elmarie for sharing uh so much of you with us well thank you very much it's very sweet of you and thank you everyone for you know supporting me and supporting the channel 250,000 subscribers pretty crazy um I didn't have any sort of aspirations or goals or anything like that when I started a YouTube channel I just you know thought I had something to say and just wanted to say it and just get that out there I was actually considering not doing as much and just leaving it as is because I had these sort of these discret videos that I thought were pretty good and encapsulated all the things that I wanted people to know about and I didn't know if making more videos was just going to sort of drown it out um and that that can be the case you know it's can be difficult to find some of these things you like hundreds of videos on my channel now and um so that can be difficult to that end if people do want to sort of go to like the sort of curated list of what I think are some of the most important ones to know about I've made a playlist called uh getting started on a carnivore diet it has ones on how to do a carnivore diet properly like carnivore for beginners um fasting or um fiber constipation diet frequently asked questions what about fruit and honey what about Dairy what about coffee and tea and caffeine basically don't eat them and then the ones on why why to do it why it's important why it matters and um those I think are the most important when you understand that and you understand just how important it is to not eat this garbage and to eat as much fatty meat as your body's asking you for uh it makes a huge difference in in how you approach this and how you you know go forward and say okay I'm going to stick to this because because this is really important for me and you're seeing all these positive benefits that you know I can call out exactly in the stepwise progression and then you're seeing that in real time you're like wow okay so everything that he's saying is going to happen has happened I'm feeling better in the ways that he's described and now I know why okay well this is this is a lifestyle for me now not just it's not just a temporary diet I'm just going to do this and so if people uh want to go see that it's uh yeah it's get getting started on a carnivore diet a playlist there and I have ones on cancer I have ones on Athletics and building muscle and those sorts of things so the playlist can be can be helpful as well to sort of look for uh individual ones I should probably do them on I'll do another one on Mental Health as well because that that I've got several uh ones on there that are that are really important Eating Disorders also as well female issues PM um pmdd and PCOS fertility issues and fibroids uh those can all be help by diet and um those are some of the least watched videos on my channel but um but they're important you know this effects a lot of people so those exist thank you very much uh Melissa for that very nice uh sentiment I really appreciate I appreciate all your help thank you and everybody else for your support and your help and for getting the message out there it's really important you know if you guys aren't sharing this with people it doesn't get shared and people don't see it and then people don't get helped and that's that's why I want to do because I I don't like seeing people get hurt especially when it's something so simple so simple to change and they can they can be uh they can dramatically improve their life and we're you know there are people are trying to help them you know they're trying to do the right things say oh well only 9% of people are following the guidelines who gives a [\u00a0__\u00a0] thank God only 9% of people are following the guidelines because these guidelines suck 9% of people in America are diabetic too do you think about that maybe those the ones following the guidelines and um you know the thing is is that even if you're not perfectly following the guidelines the guidelines have shifted everybody towards more plant-based more processed foods Less meat less fat more seed oils more sugar more fruits and vegetables more grains more carbs more garbage right and so we're going away from red meat we're going away from saturated fats we're going towards poly saturated fats and plant garbage and processed foods and people are getting sicker it's causing problems right so even if there's not perfectly adhering to the guidelines they're going towards the guidelines and just going towards the guidelines has made people very sick so not good and um without you guys sharing this and helping people and getting this out to people and coming to these live events coming to the premieres that I put out and watching the videos and sharing them with your friends this doesn't get out there and so thank you everybody I really appreciate it because I'm trying to just get the message out there that's all I want to do I don't this is not my I have a job I have a day job it's it's um it's very fulfilling and um and I get paid for it and so that's I'm happy with that I'm not trying to do this as a job you know I'm not like the know the lame Norton and and the Simon lewises out there this is their job and so they have to desperately cling to their narrative and and not get any inch because I have to be right they they need to they got real jobs if they had real jobs and were just you know beholding on their influencing and that nonsense then they probably would have a different perspective on things um I don't I have a day job and this actually takes time away from that which I'm willing to do because it's important but you know you look at Dr kils I mean that dude is very successful he has one of the most successful fertility practices in America you know and he's uh he's very very successful very well off he does not have to do any of this stuff this does not benefit him from a financial point of view he is doing this purely because it helps people Dr Baker as well he left a very lucrative surgical practice in order to to focus on metabolic medicine um you know Casey mean she was finishing a um her residency in head neck surgery at Stanford was going to take a faculty position uh when she finished and she went complete left field and went into to metabolic health and metabolic medicine because it's the right thing to do and um and and so on Dr Barry like I mean he just he has other things in his life that he could do he could just sit on it you know doesn't have to do this stuff and so you know it's um the people that are doing this are doing this because it works because it helps people it's because it's important but it doesn't get out there unless you guys share and so thank you very much everyone for coming here and for sharing with uh with everybody you know and it's just a good thing to do too because your sphere of influence is going to get broader and broader and broader and people are going to start listening to you and they're going to start getting better effects and other people are going to see that and they're going to want to do it again and do it for themselves as well it's just going to grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and that's how we get this that's how we make this Grassroots movement work because it sure as hell not going to come them from the top down there are too many trillions of dollars at stake for them to to give up on this stuff easily like the statins they're the most lucrative drug that's ever been put on the market you think that they're ever going to tell you that you don't require statens out a chance in hell we're going to have to pry that out of their cold dead fingers you know that is always going to be there they are not going to give that up and so we have to make sure people understand that it is not necessary and it is likely causing more harm than good so that all comes from you so thank you guys everybody okay back on the questions Emma Stephenson uh thank you very much for the Super Chat any thoughts on the lean mass hyperresponders yeah so it's um I think it's great you know I I I think that there's clearly an abundance of evidence to show this the whole colesterol hypothesis was complete [\u00a0__\u00a0] in the beginning it wasn't even a hypothesis it was it was a um it was a propaganda scheme it was a smear campaign to try to take the the the blame off of sugar processed foods so it was never a hypothesis in the first place no one ever went like hm I think that this might be what it is that was it was [\u00a0__\u00a0] from the beginning the you know anel Keys did not just come up with this on his own the sugar companies came up with this and they paid off anel keys to push it that's what happened and so uh it's crap it's total crap and so there's there's an abundance of evidence for this half of people that have heart attacks in America don't have high cholesterol have never had high cholesterol and you lower their cholesterol even more and they die more often that was a study with 150,000 PE patients and half of them had low cholesterol half of them had high cholesterol and LDL cholesterol dead even there wasn't even like a a slight increase in in the prevalent in the the the high cholesterol group right but interestingly they follow them for three years after that and the ones that maintains So-Cal low normal LDL cholesterol and the ones that went from high to low through pharmacological and dietary means they were twice as likely to have died in those three years of followup than the ones who maintained higher cholesterol this is killing people this is killing billions of people around the world this is ruining their lives so you know I think this is plenty of evidence I mean before um Dave Felman started doing this I was already just like yep throw it out this is crap and I think there's more than enough evidence to do that um it's hard for some people to sort of come around to that so it's very important that this sort of work like the lean mass hyperresponders uh stuff goes out there just to prove once and for all that this is total [\u00a0__\u00a0] and you do this in in an experimental fashion you have people doing this you track their aerosis you say look it's not happening it's not happening it's not happening look at that it's getting better in fact so so you're dumb and uh you need that and so I think he's doing great work I'm really happy that he's he's coming out with this stuff it's absolutely fantastic it doesn't show me anything that I that I wasn't already convinced of already from the current literature but it is going to help move that needle for a lot of other people and eventually it's just going to be no denying this is just complete [\u00a0__\u00a0] and you need to throw it out and so that's very important work that he's doing Chim a monkey brains um thank you for the Super Chat I have PCOS lupus and type two diabetes do you think that a cornivore diet can help me get pregnant um left here and there like all these different things and then the pregnant thing so I have um I've had three miscar I'm very sorry to hear that I'm almost 40 if so what specifically do you suggest well the thing is is that PCOS is the leading cause of of female infertility in certainly the Western World anyway um type 2 diabetes is very common to have along with PCOS because they're calling PCOS type four diabetes Now Alzheimer's is being called type three diabetes Now PCOS type four diabetes basically insulin resistance and damage of the ovaries diabetes of the ovaries and so yeah I absolutely think that going on a cornivore diet can help in that regard because it can help reverse your PCOS um as I mentioned earlier I did do a a video on P cosos and fertility that people can watch it would be you along with about 4,000 other people again it's just my least watch video um but it's important I think it's a good one and um and uh talks about that and so you know that's something that's not just me but this is in the literature that ketogenic diets in general can reverse PCOS and that's something that people are doing um High insulin causes the the ovaries produce too much testosterone women make testosterone women and make men take make testosterone first and that's converted into estrogen so high insulin will cause women to make too much testosterone and then it will block the conversion of that testosterone into estrogen so you get too much testosterone not enough estrogen and you can get PCOS you get the the Hallmarks of PCOS and you can get PCOS without all the Hallmarks of PCOS such as you know weight gain and and uh inappropriate hair growth and things like that in man it's the opposite you don't get enough testosterone actually suppresses your testosterone suppresses your growth hor suppresses growth hormone in men and women and the action of growth hormone in men and women that's important and so also another reason you should need a bunch of cars before you go to bed because it just it depresses your uh the the action of the growth hor you get after you go to sleep which is your maximal dosage is after you go to sleep if you go to sleep on time which is also why getting proper sleep at proper times is really important um but yeah lupus uh all my patients that had lupus have significantly improved everyone I've seen online with lupus uh going on cornerboard has significantly improved again any autoimmune condition you need to be very strict red meat and water for best results really cut out everything else even coffee and and other sort of sweeteners non- sugar sweeteners and yeah and just just get on to just meat and water diet red meat and water diet that should help all of those that should put all of those into remission or at least significantly improve them and so that can help with fertility certainly um there are many different causes of miscarriages but putting in the wrong nutrition in your body they have different sort of loads screwing with your hormones screwing with different sorts of chemicals that are going in your body that can cross the uterus and across the placenta into the baby you know this can damage the baby and vegans and vegetarians have higher rates of miscarriage they have higher rates of birth effects they have higher rates of kids with autism right so you because you're not getting all the proper nutrients that the baby needs and you introducing things that are harmful to the baby um there are other causes of miscarriage of course sometimes it's just something that has a chromosomal issue or defect or something that your body decides this isn't compatible with life and so it it has causes a miscarriage because it needs to because that baby wouldn't have have formed properly and would would would been born still born you know once your body just says okay this isn't this isn't working and so that can happen too and that's very sad but it's not necessarily your fault but you can get rid of all the things that that can get in the way of that and going on our ancestrally appropriate biologically appropriate diet can can do a lot to that end and can definitely help with PCOS Loop and diabetes uh so good luck with that I hope that that that helps super fluidity of naughtiness very interesting names uh thank you for the Super Chat 260 pounds 6 fo2 recently did a three-day dry fast followed by two more days with water then I went carnivore I went it went really smoothly and effortlessly compared to trying without the Fest uh does that make sense yeah I mean it's uh it's interesting you know I mean you're a lot of things that you get from fasting is you just you're just not eating the wrong thing and you're and you're getting into metabolic State you're supposed to be in you know just fasting to get into it could potentially get you into that state quicker and a bit more seamlessly potentially and then perpetuate you know a lot of people don't have any problems going corn I had no problems going cornivore I I I dropped all this crap and I just felt great right away the first time I did it 24 years ago and then the second time I did it six years ago felt fantastic both times the first time I was just sort of weird because I was just looking at all the things I couldn't eat and it was weird for me but I didn't feel sick I didn't feel unwell I wasn't getting carb cravings and like oh my God I have to eat it it was just like I can't eat that I can't eat that I can't eat that it was just it was just a logistical issue and it just sort of felt weird getting used to it then after two weeks I didn't even care um and this last time I I didn't care either um and so it's um it can be seamless for people but that's that's good to know you know if someone's having you know difficulty transitioning you know maybe they try that maybe you try fasting for a couple days I mean be careful with it you know you don't want to especially with the dry fasts you know I mean you do make metabolic water like I said you your mitochondria make about 1.1 liters for every kilo of fat that you burn but you know you can get dehydrated you can have too little water and and hurt yourself so do be careful with that um I think the majority of benefit from fasting just comes from not eating the the wrong things and from being in the correct metabolic State maybe fasting completely can help you get into that state quicker and I'm really glad that that helps helped you um yeah something to keep in mind for other people um that uh that maybe have a more difficult time transitioning maybe could help them but you know um maybe not it could be that you're um having problems with a bit of electrolytes or you're just withdrawing from things and and that's going to make it a bit more difficult but anyway I'm really glad that that went seamlessly for you Michelle CI thank you for the Super Chat uh hi there on Carnivore diet for 43 days and feeling great the only thing uh that threw me off is um the only thing that threw me off was a menstrual cycle was um a couple weeks late is that normal when starting Carnival it can be it it doesn't do it for everybody but it it it has happened and it can happen it generally normalizes after a couple months so sort of three four months five on the outside is typically what I've seen people um maybe get sort of a bit of derangement for three or four cycles and then it sort of gets much more normalized after that even if they've had irregular periods before that often times it will it will normalize their periods everyone's a bit different on that on how they're body's respond but yes your your hormones are going to be changing a bit right and that's going to affect your cycles and so but that normalizes that should normalize yeah so just keep with it make sure you're getting enough fat make sure you're getting enough food and um you know just remember all your hormones are made from cholesterol so your body's made of cholesterol your brain's made of cholesterol bile is made of cholesterol um so many important chemicals in your body vitamin D is made out of cholesterol all these things are very important so get enough cholesterol don't get you know the idea is oh too much cholesterol no you need enough cholesterol your body makes it for a reason it's there on purpose you need it it's important and we're being told to curil it and what do you know uh we've been fighting against our own cholesterol for 50 years and testosterone and hormonal issues are that their all-time worse in 2000 there was a paper that came out that said um that men in their 20s now aren't Half the Man their grandfathers were and they said that because the the men in their 20s in the 2000s had half the testosterone levels on average that the average 60-year-old man had in the 1970s right now it's worse and women are having more deranged hormonal problems as well we're just saying get rid of cholesterol oh my god get rid of fat cholesterol all these sorts of things our hormonal health is being destroyed our fertility R are being destroyed uh that's not a coincidence like this is a problem your brain is largely made out of cholesterol you need that and we're telling people to put kids on statins if they why are you checking a child's bloody cholesterol oh my God put them on a stat are you out of your damn mind the brain is made out of cholesterol and you're putting a Statin in their body that can cross a blood brain barrier potentially and stop the brain from making cholesterol it's so important to your brain to have cholesterol it bloody well makes it and now you're giving them drugs to stop that are you out of your damn mind like it pisses me off you are damaging the development of that child you're damaging the the brain health the neurological Health the mental health the the the cognition of adults and elderly adults in particular this is wrong this is wrong and it needs to be stopped so uh but yes your menstrual cycles can go off yes sorry I go on a lot of tangents I know um Jordan Whitehead thank you very much for the Super Chat I have a small 2 millimeter Acom aneurysm any way that I could heal it not needing any surgery later in life um ozone IV therapy and hbot diet or others uh not that I know of um you know that's a structural defect at that point you know can the body heal from some of these things potentially bodies do heal from all sorts of um things you know that that overgrow grow and out pouches of of different sorts of things Pops in the colon and skin tags on the skin you know that has to do with insulin resistance um but you know like think about diverticulitis or diverticulosis I should say where this you've got this damaged outpouching of the colon I don't think that that actually does recede and and heal up not that I know of anyway um potentially but um you know I I don't I don't have any I don't have any way of saying one way or the other um the important thing is just you keep an eye on it so 2mm aom aneurism um you know is still small but it's still something that can potentially burst even uh you know smaller aneurysms than that have burst and um so any sort of like big massive headache that just comes out of nowhere like a bolt from the blue um very severe you just need to get that checked out ASAP you do not sit on that could present as horrible neck pain horrible headache those sorts of things it's just bam horrible headache horrible pain you go to the hospital that's what you do and you let your family know as well very unlikely that that will happen however it can happen that's what you look out for um and you get that surveil you get regular Imaging with um uh with your doctor with the radiologist or the neurosurgeon whoever's uh taking care of that it's different in different areas um and then if that starts growing or becomes um you know is growing and's growing at a quicker rate or something like that that's when they say okay well we need to we need to do something about this you know you can you don't even necessarily need surgery there's a lot of endovascular treatments now where they go in and coil it from the inside um sometimes they need stance which is you know you'll be on antiplatelets for the rest of your life at that point which isn't ideal but a lot of these things you can coil and um you know so that's uh that's better you know and um uh so you don't necessarily need like a craniotomy and go in there and do a clipping from the outside quite often get these endovascularly and so it's it's not the end of the world I'd keep an eye on it you never know four or five years from now it just disappears great let us know you know again that's something that we don't we don't have any data on yet but if people start seeing that and we start studying that you know that's great but my guess is that it won't my guess is that you know you just need to keep an eye on it maybe it helps it stay stable longer uh but maybe not so either way you just get it surveilled and if it starts growing and your doctor thinks that it's time to do something about it I would go with their advice DC thank you for the Super Chat causes of acquired atrophy uh if not Hashimoto or low iodine can it be reversed I'm assuming mean thyroid atrophy um so there are there are going to be a lot of causes of low thyroid I'm going to assume that you're talking about hypothyroidism Hashim is cause that low iodine as well um can it be reversed it depends on what's causing it depends on what exposure you've had there are things called goitrogens in plants there's a class of of Defense chemical and toxin that cause goers it stops your thyroid from working properly and your thyroid swells up like crazy uh kale has a lot of goitres they gave these things to sheep and they had massive you know like softball-sized goers hanging off their neck that cause serious neurological dysfunction and problems and still births and all these serious problems the kale is disgustingly bad for you and bad for livestock they were giving um cows kale because they they just couldn't give this stuff away and so there were like cows were eating it and dairy cows and the milk were was giving people goers because of all the goitrogens that were now concentrated in the milk terrible stuff terrible terrible stuff I I don't know why anyone would eat kale first of all it's disgusting second of all it has all these toxins in it and the reason it's disgusting is because it has all those toxins in it and your brain recognizes them as bad and sending you a signal in no uncertain terms to spit that garbage out and and yet we convince ourselves that we need to eat it like you want to eat it you go ahead but um I I I did not lose any sleep when I stopped eating that disgusting plant um so yeah there's a lot of reasons that you can you can box your your thyroid even just nutritional deficiencies such as not getting enough zinc you won't convert T4 into T3 which is the most active uh form of thyroid hormone you know there's a lot of these things so you know getting proper nutrition uh and getting away from different sort of toxins and chemicals that can suppress your thyroid that's what you do and that's uh that's what's most beneficial for that so a lot of those things do get reversed so when I get people on a carnivore diet absolutely helps it absolutely helps and in most cases their thyroid improves dramatically it certainly helps with Hashimoto um and I mean even low iodine I mean this this can you know get you everything that you need depending on your food Supply so uh yes it does depend on what's causing the atrophy but it can help quite a lot of those reasons Keith Ser thank you for the Super Chat love your work well thank you very much six weeks carnivore lost 15 kg awesome that's like nearly that's like 35 pounds for for people doing the conversion feel amazing uh tips on losing stubborn belly fat um should I do fasting I want to see a sixpack uh just keep going keep going with what you're doing I mean you're six weeks in you know I mean and you've lost 15 kgs I mean that that's fantastic so I mean there's no reason to suspect that's just going to stop there as long as you're eating enough you're eating enough fat because if you're undereating you're chronically undereating yeah you'll lose weight but then you'll Plateau because you'll suppress your metabolism and that's something we want to do we want to we want to support your metabolism we want to boost your metabolism so your body just says hey we don't need all this savings we can actually get rid of this stuff and get down to uh uh you know a lower body fat percentage and um and that's when you get that so you know you exercise you do anerobic exercise you lift weights you do Sprints especially one of the best workouts is sprinting and um and then uh and then just keep eating keep eating the way you are you know it can take time you know I wasn't horribly obese or anything like that when I started this I was I'd always been active I'd always at least in some sort of EXT exercise um I was playing competitive rugby up until I was 35 and then I was you know back helping my folks and so I sort of wasn't really playing for a couple years and then I was 38 and I really wanted to get back into it I was getting very antsy that I hadn't been able to play I was actually 37 and then I went and did humanitarian work for a few months and then I was now 38 and I was like nope really want to get back to it now and I started corn like night and day difference I felt like I was 22 again and I lost like 10 kgs in in two weeks and then I stabilized I didn't lose any fat any weight after that but I was losing a lot of fat and I was gaining muscle because I was working out a lot and I was doing a lot of sprinting and I was doing a lot of weightlifting and even then you know I was getting fitter and fitter and fitter and and my body composition was changing dramatically but it still took like six eight months before I got down to a stable body fat percentage when I was just you know shredded and muscular and and five or 6% body fat without trying I mean it was just that I was eating maximally and that's just where my body wanted me to be um so it just takes time you know we all started different places even where I was which wasn't all that bad it was bad for me but it wasn't like you know as bad as it could have been um you know it still took time you know still took like 6 eight months before I got down to very lean stable uh body habit is so you know and that was with a lot of hard work and eating perfectly I didn't eat anything except beef and water like that was it and so um you know it just takes time you're doing great you've already lost 15 kg you feel fantastic the stubborn body that if it's still there after six weeks it's not it's not technically stubborn yet you know give it give it several months give it six months give it a year you know if it's just not shifting then you can call it stubborn and and uh but the main thing is is um uh lift weights do Sprints eat enough food you should be fine real deal mcneel thank you very much for the question um question is been identified having low sodium from blood work um and constant taste for a lot of salt took electrolytes for 30 days stopped but getting leg cramps do you suggest using or not for some people like look if you if you actually have low sodium then you know adding more salt if your body's telling you more salt more salt more salt then yes there are some people that when you lower your your insulin levels you can actually lose more sodium then you you get back by salting to taste so if you're in that category which it sounds like you may be and your your electrolytes are actually low then you need to make sure that you're supplementing with them the other side is sometimes people drink a lot of water a lot more more water than their body can handle and um so you can wash out the sodium um and that's people that are drinking like gallons of water a day though it's not most people are not doing that most people are having like a you know I talked to people that you saying I was like oh well I drink like I drink a lot of water I don't think I could possibly drink more I drink like liter and a half two liters of water and I'm like that's like a cup for me I mean this is that's my glass that I use at the house it's it's it's a lader you know or yeah like 40 ounces something like that um I have several of those a day and that's just me that's just what my body wants and so you know it's um uh yeah and so uh but I don't I don't have problems with that and in fact I get leg cramps when I don't have enough water so if you have less less sodium than your body wants generally that doesn't actually make leg cramps usually again that is dehydration so you know you sort of it sounds like you probably need more salt salt more sodium magnesium can cause leg cramps I generally don't see that with people with low sodium or or potassium in the hospital who are very sick because that's really the only time you're going to see someone with like truly low potassium or sodium um but if you have low sodium if that's been tested as actually low and you have a high taste for salt eat salt you know you need to you need to get get more of that generally that will that will stabilize after a few weeks and your insulin is just staying at this level in your body adjust to the amount of insulin and how much electrolytes you need to bring in uh but in that in in that inum then if you need more salt then you need more salt so yeah definitely add more if you need that uh Jessica key thank you very much for the super chat um new to carnivore I have PS see and Ultra colitis I'm experiencing High watery output that lasted well over two weeks is is is this normal with no colon um yes uh if you don't if you don't have a colon if you've had that removed then um the colon is what what uh condenses the the um you know the the stool as it comes out of of the small intestine and so if it's just coming out straight from the small intestine and out then that's generally um uh just the contents of the small intestine so that can be very watery that's that's quite typical um and so yeah that and and the thing is too is that if you're eating a lot of fiber that sort of makes it solid just because it's h it's just this bulk that you can't digest you can't liquefy you can't make that you can't make that um uh you know bre break down into you know useful things you know it's just it's just indigestible and um you know so that that is normal um you know it's not necessarily a bad thing it's just sort of something that you know is particular to your case if you've had your colon taken away due to ultr citis it's a shame that you you didn't find this before um that was taken away because Ultra colitis can be pushed put into remission with a strict red meat and water diet seen it happen more than once many many times and so you know I'm sorry that you had to have that taken away but the good news is is that you can still optimize your health from here and you can still have be very very healthy and very happy going forward but yes um you know High watery output can be can be normal because the colon is is what's condensing it because you're not eating fiber it's you're not going to have this whole bunch of bulk just soing up all that stuff so uh yes that can be normal I wouldn't worry too much about it do make sure that you're getting enough water because you you that's part of the Colon's job is to dehydrate and pull back in that water so you know if you're if you're losing more water than you should be you need to replace that with drinking more water and there's a nice little chat from my little El Marie saying you're the best no you're the best uh very very good to see you there sweetie nice to see you and say Hello thank you for doing that Roger Ram uh J shenar thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat it's very kind of you greetings from Indian India um Can someone on dialysis and injection frash of 30 beond carnivore uh yeah absolutely so like I said before just anybody with any condition can be on Carnivore and um and in fact with people with serious issues like this I think it's more important to do do that to to eat truly appropriate um nutrition for human beings and that's what a cornor diet is um dialysis you know you sort of endstage renal disease at that point um I have heard of three people now coming off dialysis I've seen one person now that's working on that uh still on dialysis but is making more urine which is great will they be able to get enough kidney function back to come off dialysis I don't know but hopeful um can't say that that's going to happen the likelihood is they won't be able to come off dialysis but it's certainly not going to make it worse I mean think about that uh if your if your kidneys just don't work at all you can't make them worse can you right uh but they don't make it worse meat does not make your kidneys wor work worse they make it better higher protein higher animal protein makes your kidneys work better and injection fraction of 30 you're having heart failure um is going to be worsened and you're going to put more stress and pressure on your heart when you're putting things in your body that it's not supposed to have just by going on a carore diet you're going to have more ketones you're going to go into a ketogenic State your heart prefers ketones so that could ostensibly improve the cardiac function and the contractility of the heart potentially and I have seen a number of people report back to me that their injection that their ejection fraction has improved well that help the person that you're talking about here be it yourself or others uh I don't know but there's that potential and either way it's going to improve their health in a lot of other ways that is going to make their life a hell of a lot easier to deal with while on dialysis and with an injection fraction of 30 I don't know if it's going to reverse those issues but it can certainly help them in a lot of other ways and and it's certainly safe it is not is not a problem for that U it will help if anything so good luck to them um I'm running short on time guys so I'm going to have to sort of pick through a couple uh questions here um I might not be able to get to all of them uh sunflower thank you for the Super Chat uh thank you Dr C my daughter feels sick whenever she eats meat do you know what is causing this reaction um quite often it's psychosomatic that we've just been told for our whole life that we're not supposed to eat meat we're not supposed to eat fat especially people in adolescence they they really don't want to gain weight and put on fat and things like that so they say you know oh my God Fat's going to make me fat I can't eat that and you actually make yourself feel sick and I have done that to myself anytime I would eat like just a chunk of fat because it was fried up and crispy and it smelled amazing I would it would make me feel physically sick oh my God I can't believe I ate that um and that continued and persisted into uh adulthood when I was 38 doing carnivore knowing full well that fat was good for me I was trimming off the fat like what the hell am I doing I like the Fat's good for me eat the damn fat and but even then I could I couldn't do it my body was rebelling because I had trained and conditioned myself to not eat this stuff and to and to give myself a visceral reaction negative reaction when I ate it and so I had to rearn learn it and retrain myself and um and so I did um and so she can do that too I mean if she's just eating meat and at first it tastes good and then eventually it stops tasting good well that's just her body telling her to stop she doesn't need that much it may be that her body doesn't need nearly as much as she thinks it does but if it's just the aversions um that from a condition response then just just work slowly but surely to decondition that just find the meats that she likes find the meats that taste good to her um and that she enjoys and then just focus on that and and keep working up if it's if she can only do sort of lean meats at the moment fine just try to work in a bit more fat and a bit more fat and a bit more fat cut off a slice of fat little piece of fat put it with a lean piece eat it together tastes good when you do that and so uh just sort of try to recondition uh that and um and you know if her body's just telling her not to eat not to eat you know a period of fasting I mean eating once a day is fine you know eating once every two days is generally fine for most people if that's what your body is telling you to do and so it could be that you just don't eat that day and the next day meat tastes great and she really wants it and doesn't feel sick but generally if she feels sick she's either eating past it it tasting good or more likely it's a condition response that just needs to be deconditioned uh carnivore power of healing thank you for the Super Chat attacked by two German dogs one and a half years ago um sorry to hear that um started six meters at 265 pounds gained 40 um 40 pounds now 280 lion diet since uh 1 of January um even started YouTube over 40 videos to show you can work out uh every day 50 years old 5 foot3 numbness pain and and morbidly fat um well that's great that you've uh You' started a channel you started on on the lion diet and are are being active and so you know people you know check them out you know see some of those videos like it's um it's great to see more and more people um doing channels and showing their healing and and doing it from the beginning you know it's like we don't need to hide this right you don't just have to show people that said hey I did this this was me before and now two years after the fact here's the result it's great when people are doing this in real time and people can see their their results in real time and seeing them getting better in real time and it's not a cakewalk for everyone some people do have teething issues they do have problems they have to get through but they get they get through them and they get better and there's there are things that can can improve and so you know that's important that's important for people to see so that when they run into them themselves they don't just go oh something's wrong I've got to abort uh no this is normal this is something that can happen to people and you get through it and you've seen other people get through it and you're going to get through it and so that's great so thank you for doing that thank you for making a channel and uh yeah good luck with that I hope it hope it goes well Linda angerer uh thank you for Super Chat just says thank you well you're very welcome I hope that my answer earlier was helpful um Alan myber thank you very much for the Super Chat can you speak to high home assisting levels and high blood pressure and trimethyl glycine supplementation um as was mentioned on Joe Rogan podcast is there anything else you would suggest around this well I didn't see that Joe Rogan podcast so I don't know exactly what they spoke about I'm not too familiar with trimestral methyl glycine supplementation but I can tell you that homocystine is a is a molecule that becomes more abundant when our B12 and folate or low and so you can get your homocysteine levels up which can irritate the the interior lining of Our arteries can cause damage to the lining of Our arteries and actually cause that the that sort of clotting structure um structural sort of uh changes that we see in atherosclerosis right if you look at the the Dynamics of the of the blood vessel um and the and the arteries um cholesterol even if it were cholesterol molecules who were getting in into the the lining of the tissue um there's no way for them to get in there even the smallest cholesterol molecules cannot physically penetrate that barrier and it's not going to go through the cell because it it takes active transport to transport these molecules into the cell and out the other side so that's not happening right um so it has to be damaged there has to be some sort of abrasion and cut in the in the artery that can then get this thing even if it is cholesterol getting in there which it's not there's something else going on um you know potentially macrophases that are sucking up a bunch of damaged cholesterol and then the macras is going into this damaged area of the artery lining to fix it and then building up or whatever or blood vessels going in there making a clot those clots you know um turning into plaques and scars and a lot of cholesterol being left over because that's what blood cells are made out of their cell membrane is cholesterol and um and or even plant sterols you know macroasia suck up the plant steriles but they hate them and so they've been actually shown to dump these things in the linting of arteries like in triaa like um um abdominal aortic aneurysms right so a lot a lot more going on here but um homosysteine can damage the lining of the of the or walls and so just making sure you have enough B12 and folate reduces homocystine reduces that damage from a homocystine to your artery lining so it's going to reduce that clotting that's going to happen that damage and scarring and buildup to your that that can happen with homosysteine and um can reduce blood pressure from that from that mechanism but also from a carore point of view right you're getting hold bunch of B12 you're getting a whole bunch of B6 and you know that's great especially if you're having a bit of liver because there a lot more fulla in liver than there is in muscle meat um so it's um it is the case that when you go on a carnivore diet and get rid of sugars and carbs and all that sort of stuff your blood sugar comes down your insulin comes down insulin resistance and higher levels of insulin can cause uh the uh stiffening of your arteries so they're not able to move and contract and loosen and expand and so they just stay tight and rigid pressure goes up in the system and so there are a lot of reasons why going on a carnivore diet not can improve your blood pressure not only just because of getting your insulin down but also improving your your nutritional status which can improve other things not not least of which is homosysteine homosysteine will go down and you'll improve from that regard as well so hopefully that was helpful I don't I don't know about all the other stuff though um okay let me see um okay so here's here's one from uh votus um thank you for the Super Chat love from tazzy doing carnivore in the van life beef lamb and animal fats bone broth and salt sometimes fish opinion on canant tuna daily as a snack uh yeah it's fine it's just super lean um and so you need to add fat to that probably butter grass-fed butter it's better mayonnaise is not unless you make your own out of animal fats is no good it's generally made of soybean oil and other sort of garbage that you don't want and so I would not I would not touch it um and um so yeah so I I I just wouldn't do that I wouldn't I wouldn't touch that stuff with a 10 foot pole and um and uh so but you need fat it's very very lean so you know you need it but just add fat to it like uh grass-fed butter something like that um okay um all right I think I'm gonna just answer this one really quick and then probably call it there and I've got to I've got to get to the office um um marisel Tomas thank you for the Super Chat I want to buy grass-fed meat unfortunately there's not much I can find here in Hawaii any companies that ship to Hawaii I could order from um the answer to that is I don't know but maybe someone here does know and can put that in the comments and so if you do know I mean there are things like um you know butcher box um Etc that can that can ship Meats I don't know if they ship to Hawaii but they they seem to ship around the country and there are a lot of other companies as well that do [\u00a0__\u00a0] direct from from the farm to your door and um could very well potentially do that I mean I think that um you know I mean I think that even uh what's his face Facebook guy he has a big herd of cows on on um Hawaii now don't know if he's planning on selling them or just stocking up for the the apocalypse but um it's uh you know it is possible that some of these companies will will ship over there so if anybody knows that if anybody knows some of these companies that ship or know of companies that ship that potentially could do it you know please do put that in the in the comments down below and um hopefully that can that can get back to you and uh maybe try one of those those sites to to see if that will help um all right let's see if there's any oh Christ um let's see if there's any questions here on Instagram um so here's one question from on Instagram from Chris uh Chris Chris schoffman who says uh cornivore diet is carnivore diet likely to help my friend with multiple sclerosis who has significant fatigue pretty much daily uh yes I did I specifically did a um a podcast with uh a lady uh she went by Dr Sarah she want to use her full name for professional reasons U but she's a PhD in biostatistics so she does you know high level medical research and um and she had multiple sclerosis and and I say had because um she went from being in a wheelchair and basically paralyzed and dying because this can be fatal um to going on a diet and she had followed a protocol where she's taking high do vitamin D and people can watch that episode to to get more on that um and vitamin D and carnivore died and in six months she was not only out of her wheelchair but she was back doing ballet which pretty amazing and so she's not the only person I've seen improv multiple sclerosis multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune condition and I have yet to see a single autoimmune condition that does not respond extremely well to uh corn di especially when just a red meat and water diet high fat um you know two to one grams of fat to protein if you can unless that's causing you diarrhea and so that's um that can absolutely help absolutely help it has helped in the past I would expect it to help here in this case and and hopefully it does because it's um you know that's a very very devastating illness you know Dr Sarah she was um you know because she really knows her stuff from a from a clinical from a um an academic point of view being able to read these studies you know she was getting worse and worse and she was like okay what the hell can I do the medications aren't helping I'm on my way out I need to figure something out or else I'm I'm done for and so she started she came across the cornivore stuff and she started looking into it started looking at the studies looking at the things that that I'm referencing that other people are referencing and she knows how to read a study she writes studies and so she looked at it and she said you know you know these people are on to something there like there is there is something here and um and so she tried it and it worked and so you know I would expect it to work for your friend too and I hope that it does okay all right well thank you all very much I really appreciate you guys coming on I
