        "body": "hey everyone just wanted to do a quick video just to tell you about something I just found out I'm here on Maggie's Ranch it's absolutely gorgeous she's got quite a number of cattle good area of land and it's beautiful absolutely wonderful up here in Alberta and I think we are knowing more and more about how the plight of ranchers is getting worse and worse and that's for a number of reasons and you can watch my episode with Maggie to talk more about that but what I wanted to point out here was something I think is worse certainly just as bad I don't know if anyone will be able to help with this or if enough people get aware of it that people up in Canada can you know write their politician and make enough noise to try to undo this because it's absolute garbage so she has had this property for decades decades and decades and decades it's been five generations of families you married into this part she had her own but um and then she married into this and they consistently lose money because it's a very difficult operation but something happened back in the 70s the Canadian government decided that your land is not your land the land belongs to the people sort of like USSR and China and other sorts of places that have gone down that road and say okay well you can have the top of it because you paid for it but all the minerals and the oil and the natural gas the Diamonds the gold anything underneath the surface belongs to the government so they've stolen people's land and their the the the valuable you know minerals and substances below below the ground so when Alberta it's very rich in natural gas among other things and on this land they have had a very high producing natural gas well that's been going for over 30 years okay maybe a lot more than 30 years 30 40 years and the government decided they own that they auction that off to the highest bidder and the ranchers and landowners get nothing they don't get anything back in the 70s when this first came about they decided that well since you can't be using the land that we have the well on and you can't use um you know you can't Farm you can't grades you can't raise you can't sell the land really it's not usable well we'll we'll pay you know a fair rate for that and that was thirty five hundred dollars and that has been grandfathered in it doesn't change so it's still 3 500 dollars so now in 2023 they're getting 3 500 dollars for what is likely hundreds of millions of dollars worth of natural gas that buy rights should be theirs and all the other landowners in Canada so Maggie shouldn't be struggling Maggie should be gloriously wealthy but she's not she's struggling she's in Mass amounts of debt she has to keep selling off pieces of land the land's very valuable not that she's getting paid for it by these people but she has to keep selling off more and more land just to keep up with her debt and so if anybody says well big cattle and big there is no big cattle it's not a thing you know the the packing plants and things like that maybe but the ranchers know and so after covid they tried to lower the rates they said well you know times are tough we can only afford to pay you fifteen hundred dollars a year so not only are they not paying what is worth they're trying to basically pay them nothing which is absolutely disgusting so what I want to do and I hope that people watching this can do maybe can help me out maybe people that are in touch with lawyers or politicians or just people in general that that care about normal everyday people getting absolutely railroaded by large corporations in the government can maybe have some ideas on what can be done how this can be changed giving the rights back to the people giving the land back to the people this is this is her land she's always had this she's pays you know all sorts of money for it she's in massive amounts of debt she's selling off more land just to keep this and she doesn't even get to use it and she doesn't even get the the benefits of her land which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars 100 I mean literally I mean think about 40 Years of a high producing natural gas well how many hundreds of millions of dollars is that going to be so and she's just one she's just one of so many people being absolutely scammed by the government and you know the businesses are going along with it and because they basically have no rights the the oil companies the gas companies they actually treat your like garbage they roll they have easements to get to the the well and they just uh they have in the past gone outside of that easement and driven right through her crops and destroyed her crops and left Gates unlocked let people steal their cattle I mean you know who knows maybe the people there that's another thing they have the same padlock on every single uh padlock that they use throughout the entire country it's the same damn combination so anybody who's ever worked there knows that every single one of these combination locks is the same combination and they could just go to any farm and just Rob them blind and it happens and and she lost about forty thousand dollars worth of cattle that way just woke up one hand was like where the hell are they and they were gone so that's ridiculous they're running rough shot over them this is her land her property and and it's being stolen from her and she's being treated like it's not even hers by the government and by the businesses so if anybody's out there that can do something about this write their politician talk to people and just just drum up awareness share this around leave comments try to get this viral get this going out there so that people understand this is you know and people need to be aware of this and understand how screwed they're getting and people like Maggie are getting and this is just I mean come on it starts here it ends with everything else everything else that you own you know and so you know that's that's the agenda I mean it was one of the political parties here in Canada I'm learning they even say in their in their Charter they say that like you know people should not be allowed to own land Farmers should not be allowed to own Farmland it was like are you out of your mind you go back to the Communist States 95 of the of the Farms that were communally run produced five percent of the output five percent of the Farms that were still being run privately were producing 95 okay this is just it's just a better model and also it's the it's right you know so this is this is people's property this is their land is their livelihood this is their Heritage and is being stolen from them for the good of the people that is  and anybody watching this please do whatever you can to make noise about this and get this out there to try and reverse this and get people their property back get people their land back get people their mineral rights back and the and the rights to the natural resources on their property which they own no one else owns that they own that and it's just going to the government so they can just waste it and to spend it on themselves and make themselves rich and so it's being taken away from you it's been taken away from Maggie it's being taken away from everyone so I just I plead with all of you do something write your politician make noise share this around and stop this from going on this has to be changed and you know if it doesn't get shaved if it doesn't go in One Direction it's going to go in the other if we don't start making improvements in in the in the direction of freedom and uh and private ownership it's going to go in the direction of slavery and uh and the government owns everything you know the whole say it's 2030 and you don't own anything and you love it okay yeah so let's translate that it's 2030 you're a Slave and you love it no I'm sorry I don't and we won't and no one will so let's stop this nonsense right now and please do whatever you can to make this stop this is thank you very much"
