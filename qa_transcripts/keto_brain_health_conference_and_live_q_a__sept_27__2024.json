    "title": "Keto Brain Health Conference and Live Q&A! Sept 27, 2024",
    "transcript": "okay hello everyone thank you for joining me for another YouTube live uh Happy UK Edition uh doing it a more European UK friendly time to have my friends Ben Heather who are calling in from the UK for the uh well to talk about the keto brain uh event that I'll be speaking at that they are putting on in Manchester next month Ben Heather ni nice to have you good to see you thank you thanks for having on yeah great so um tell us about the conference well okay so there's uh obviously the ketogenic diet is is known to some of us you the the power of ketosis for its uh effects on on protecting enhancing your your brain health and mental health and even being able to halt reverse sometimes even eliminate the symptoms of of a lot of the uh the conditions that we're seeing in the world today and it i' would say it's fair to say Anthony that the uh there there's a lot of these conditions that are just exploding in the world I mean when I was growing up in the 70s and 80s I can't remember knowing one child that had autism for example but now ADHD autism uh obviously things like depression de and anxiety but uh the most people don't know that the diet is potentially the single biggest and easiest hack that that you can do for a whole range of these obviously we can't make any promises but we've known about the ketogenic science has known about the power of the ketogenic diets since the 1920s so this is a hundred years of this so this is not an academic conference it's not a scientific conference we're not to learn about the latest papers and stuff this is for real people members of the public because we're all affected right even if you aren't personally suffering with depression or any of these conditions then we all know somebody who has Alzheimer's dementia again go all going through the roof so this is this is for real people to come together and and hear the facts honestly put by some of well in our view some of the best in in the business right now great and so who all will be coming so I'm I'm going to be there um of course like I said but who who else will be speaking so we have Zoe harkham um who is very very well known in this space especially for the help she gave Dr Tim NOS or Professor Tim NOS a few years ago uh she will be talking sfly about fat and um myth um about F then we have abin who is is um the guy to go to with regards to stattin and and Drugs in general he's going to be putting that to bed um importance of not taking them so to speak um then we have Richard um Smith who you know very well H kha Pro he's going to speak about the brain and um addictions relative to ketosis um and then we have H Rachel Brown Dr Rachel Brown who is carnivore shrink online and Rachel is the first metabolic psychiatrist in the UK so we're delighted to have her join us and um then from there we're having a small panel of people that have been through a lot in their lives and use the ketogenic diet to actually help heal them and manage their symptoms and that includes myself um Richard Smith and um Kira Jennings and that's uh tvis traumatic brain injuries um depression and addictions stroke binging um so it's been basically help people understand that you might resonate with what some of the people in the um panel specifically the people that have been through stuff um might might then help you go actually I get that and that's why I need to do this way of eating yeah well I think there that's a that's amazing group of people um I'll be certainly interested in hearing everyone talk I um yeah I haven't I haven't met Iver Cummings yet I've seen several of his videos a really um really interesting guy so Arkham's awesome obviously that was one of my um favorite interviews was talking to her she's great and um so yeah be very excited to to listen to her and then obviously you know Richard and uh you know Rachel Brown I mean they just always have wonderful things to say too it's always very interesting that's great well it's great that you're bringing in uh people that you know the panel or people that have had their own personal experiences to um to talk about as well because I think that's very powerful we can always talk in the abstract well we have you know this study and these numbers and X Y and Z but you know we have to remember this is these are real people that this is affecting and and when you when you see a real person and you see the the benefits that they've had it it it makes it a lot more real and I think I think that's the thing Anthony um I had this vision for a while and um Ben got me to push with it and do this conference and he's helping me um he's doing phenomenal amount of work to help me get this going and but the reason I'm doing it is because I've had um 10 concussions over the years mainly through horse riding but some really severe concussions um and I've also um been through U what begins with the letter R and a successful court case and no woman should ever go through what I've been through but it took me 10 years of PTSD to get over it um so I know what it's like to be traumatized I know what it's like to have high anxiety and be highly reactive because of said trauma of what I went through um and even an example is one of my friends it was at the very beginning of my physiotherapy degree and one of my friends told me one day after three years I gave her a hug it was the first hug I gave in three years so for me to realize how important this diet has been for me is something that I want to help with people and what I found was omega-3 first off really helped calm my brain down and from there I found out about ketogenic diet through first Do no harm the movie with Merl Streep and um I decided if that can help epilepsy and it was um started in 1921 and the most research diet out there it's something I had to try so again as I said um we decided that this is something that has to be put out there for the lay person because I work now as a holistic therapist not just physio but I also do nutrition and I've worked done Dr George E course and currently doing the nutrition Network um course but what I want is that I found that everyone thinks it's a um it's a fat diet and they're going to die or a weight loss diet and it's they're going to die of all these diseases but my dad died this year and I went out of my way to make sure my Ketone stayed High the whole 10 days I was with him before he passed and after he passed and I couldn't get over how come I stayed throughout and I know 100% that's the ketogenic diet so for me I want to get it to the lay press and that this is a phenomenal diet and the speakers were bringing to you we couldn't ask for better in this space and we've been incredibly fortunate that every single speaker we approached said yes so it's hopefully the beginning of many things but it comes from the heart it comes from a passion to help people and that I would also say and this probably speaks to something that I I know you're very very passionate about which is the the lack of evidence the lack of research and funding that goes into natural treatments for for for for these things through something as simple as diet because like like Heather said the ketogenic diet is the most researched and documented human diet of all of them um yeah and the evidence uh for its it's benefits for epilepsy are undeniable incontrovertible well documented but there's so many other mental health issues brain health issues that that we're being faced with and and increasingly he your dad for example died of vascular dementia he was a sugar addict his whole life and and declined pretty rapidly and that that took his life there was no need for him in my view for him to be taken that early but all all of these conditions um Can can I don't want to make too many promises but but can potentially be leaved or helped with the use of diet the problem is that who's going to fund that so if if the the scientific publication machine is dominated by Big Money interests as as there's a lot of evidence that it is who's going to spread the word we have to do it it's it's people like yourself it's the functional medicine people you know it's it comes to the rest of us it has to be a Grassroots movement which is why we want to bring everyone together in Manchester share what we know so that they walk out after that that one day going I so much more confident now I know I've got some practical things that I know that I can do in my life or to help my my children my dependents my maybe older parents as well um so yeah this affects all of us that's another thing I wanted to mention specific to the people that are listening to um this right when it um is um put up on YouTube or whatever is we're both carnivore way of eating I've been on the ketogenic diet since 2010 and I started the carnivore wave eating in May 2018 and I know for me a high fat carnivore diet which I call a Kore Diet Works really really well because people alsoas I don't know why P people aasly associate the Kore diet with green vegetables and avocados and olives and carnivore but it's not it's just a high fat version so I eat pemk a lot of pan I make my own I eat um bone marrow um I eat a lot of sardines and cod liver oil Pate um and then I eat ri eyes they are my go-to standard diet but if I overeat on a ribeye I get really tired and all my symptoms start to come back so it's it's really fascinating in this space how much I've had to work to work at how the carnivore diet suits my way of eating and and we should also add that it's possible to have a ketogenic diet if you're omnivore vegetarian in fact the lunches that we're putting on for the conference we've got vegan keto veget Arian keto omnivore keto and carnivore keto as options that people can choose when they book yeah well I I I was literally just reading um a study today well was a case series on um ketogenic metabolic therapy for gomas um out of Phoenix and there was a 16 case series and U you know showed you know significant Improvement in many of their of the patients especially ones that were able to keep it up and they were try to get them into ketosis that's x y and z um and uh and and they had no idea what the hell to do with a with a ketogenic diet so they were like yeah we we didn't know what the hell to do is we we pushed them to a nutritionist and what we did was a a more plant-based sort of Keto so even even that plant-based keto actually showed significant Improvement on um you know in these cancer patients you know which is just shows well I I wouldn't even call the power of a ketogenic diet it's just sort of the harm of carbohydrates you know that they can really mess you up and uh and and you'll get getting rid of them is just going to allow your body to work a lot better and um so yeah you know that that was one of the things when I was talking to my department about doing a you know study on ketogenic metabolic therapy for for gomas in our in our Neurosurgical Department they're like well what about people that are vegetarian like you can do a ketogenic diet on vegetarian you know when you're doing you know certain things you know just it is just benefits your body and your brain and your cancer survival rates uh almost certainly uh for you know this the cancers that we studied anyway uh to to be in ketosis and have lower glucose lower insulin and higher ketones and obviously you know I'm of of the view that there are other things that besides carbohydrates that are bad too and getting rid of those are great as well but even just that puts you so far ahead of the vast majority of people that it's it's well worth a try so even if people don't don't want to go to the full carnivore leap you know just start with the carbs you know well start with the process to get rid of that garbage get rid of the sugar get rid of the carbs go to Whole Foods um that that don't have a bunch of sugar and and starches and things like that and see how you go and go from there absolutely and another area I think that that we really want to cover is this this although we've said this is not a scientific and academic conference we we still want to make sure it's evidence-based but we want to include all the evidence so that's why we've got the panel of people saying look I've done this and I've experimented with myself I've been my own um my own lab and and these are the results that I've seen in my n equals one experiment so Rachel Brown's going to be there as a consultant psychiatrist within the National Health in the UK who is trying to fly the flag for metabolic approaches as well so she's going to be talking about when uh Pharmaceuticals can potentially help when they can hinder as well as ivvo who who will be talking about the uh the how much evidence is there for the relationship between between statins and neur neurological damage as well so yeah and also very interested to hear what what your angle is going to be from from the the neurosurgery perspective you know what what how how how you define a um a healthy brain or an unhealthy brain and what really helps and hinders there so that's going to be a fascinating conversation as well yeah that that'll be interesting because you can if anyone can do little little uh experiment they go to Pub met or Google Scholar and just uh look up um cholesterol metabolism dysfunction brain development kids things like that you will find no end of paper papers and studies in the peer-reviewed literature showing that if you disrupt the normal cholesterol metabolism of the brain you get serious ious neurological dysfunction and uh and developmental issues and and yet we have been just working you know day and night to cause dysfunctions in the cholesterol metabolism and and these these medications can do just that and cross the blet brain barrier and and prevent your brain from making its own cholesterol to use as a building block and structural component of the brain why would that be a good thing and then you have these people like Dr Alo that idiot he just made a video talking about how statins you know lower your your stroke rate and and they don't um you know cause any sort of neurological issues I'm like well um that's actually not the case you know mean you simply don't understand the basic physiology of the brain and cholesterol metabolism and and there there are studies on studies showing that higher LDL cholesterol higher total cholesterol lower rates of Alzheimer's lower rates of dementia lower rates of Parkinson lower rates of autism mothers that have higher LDL cholesterol during pregnancy have lower rates of kids with autism higher uh saturated fat consumption during pregnancy lower rates of kids with autism Etc so you know it's um that would be a good one to see from IA yeah I I have a client who um around 52 I think it was he was put on stattin and within two weeks took himself off them because he was getting and he just felt he wasn't himself anymore and as soon as he came off them within days he was back to normal so and that was intuitive yeah well there there's quite a lot of people that talk about that you know having this horrible brain fog memory issues always this that's a that's a very commonly reported symptom of of uh taking Statin and no no no there there's absolutely no no side effects you know like I mean it's you know that that's not even not even what's reported I mean you just just look on you know any sort of uh you know formulary you know on on these drugs and it will say that these are some of the side effects you know so it's not like it's not like you know this is this is coming out of left field I mean just just look it up it's on the it's on the the you know the little handout from the the pharmacist like you can just read it it's not it's not that hard but it's in fine fine print which makes it harder to read yeah exactly yeah and with with you're own statins and your don't work then you know affecting your neurological function then yeah then you might not be able to do it so is this is this a a one day event or is this a multi-day event or or how is this going to be set up yeah it's one day where we're going to start relatively early get in there for for about 8:00 a. because we we've got we've got a packed day we want um want to get as much out the amazing lineup of speakers that we've got um a great lunch and and uh yeah meet meet lots of people

people can just change their diet and change their life I mean it's it's remarkable how big of a difference it makes and it's it's such a simple so solution and if people want to try it they can try it and if it if they find benefit then great and you know if you don't like it then don't do it but it's it's something that's so powerful for so many people and I I can guarantee that someone does this for 30 days 90 days they'll it will absolutely change their life and they'll at least know what the alternatives are anyway I think that's the thing what I always use with my clients in in general is do you have a big enough why if you do it's so worth 30 to 90 days because the difference will help you understand why people Rave about this way of Ean yeah definitely well great well

interesting for people um both Heather and Ben are great people I've I've known Ben for a while and met Heather recently and they're both very lovely and um and both very interested in getting this this information out to people uh which is you know something that I think is very important as well uh so thanks everyone for joining and um please do check out the keto brain health. co.uk uh also want to say uh thank you to Chris brandlin at brandlin law.com brandlin law.com uh for helping me out copyrighting all my um YouTube videos and podcasts to to get a bit of security on that and he's uh he goes by the carnivore lawyer and helps uh different people in the carnivore space uh with free legal advice um should they need it so if people want to go and check him out he's at brandalin law.com okay so we'll start off with um the Super Chat that just popped up from Lively lionist thank you very much for the Super Chat eggs beef and chicken um I'm assuming that's what you've been eating uh painful pinching in stomach during bowel movements coconut cream eliminates the pain during the movement during the movements but excess butter and Tallow don't bad breath and acid acidic odor uh and white membrane and feces H well you know if something's coming out in your feces mean something from inside you going out maybe there's something that you're eating that's that's uh being a bit weird or maybe there's some sort of bacterial overgrowth or or something that's just probably more likely what it is because anything you've eaten is all mushed up and bunched up inside the stool itself or's anything on the outside uh that has like a sort of membrane or film on it is probably something from the the microbiome and uh sort of like a like a bofilm from the bacteria potentially so something to think about there you you know if that's causing issues you could think about uh different ways of influencing your microbiome such as um such as uh using like fermented uh dairy products like uh you know you know unsweetened unflavored uh yogurt and and uh you know but you want to put that on the meat and you want to chew them up together swallow them in the same bite that allows them to hopefully get some of that bacteria in the middle of that food Bolis and get it past your your um stomach acid and allow that to get down to the the large intestines so you'll give that a maybe you know have a think about that uh if you're eating anything else besides the the eggs beef and chicken and maybe cut those out and just see if just the meat and water can help coconut cream eliminates pain during movements I'm hoping you mean that coconut cream prior than your subsequent elimination will not be as painful um because yeah if I mean if you take some coconut cream you know as you're going obviously that's not going to have anything to do with it um but in general uh you know you're going to absorb certain amount of fat based on the amount of bile that you have in the excess is going to just go out and so it maybe that there's something in the coconut cream that you're not really absorbing very well but is is getting past you or um your small intestine into your large intestine to the stools and um allowed it allowed it to um you know soften things up as well um so if you took if you took the coconut cream in the morning and later had a painless movement you know is that is that necessarily going to be connected maybe but um you know often times people aren't aren't eliminating for days after you know they eat something so it's like because there's such just such small amount of waste that needs to come out it just takes a while to go because there's hardly anything there and it takes a while to build up so potentially you know and is that white film happening when you have the coconut cream or uh or not you know is it is that just there all the time or only when you're having those sorts of things so you when you try to sort of connect those things together you know eventually you will you will be able to eat enough fat that you don't absorb uh quite a lot of it and it will come out as diarrhea so you know you don't you know at some point you're going to get soft bowel motions and they won't be painful so it might be something in the coconut cream that that is you're just not absorbing very well and so it's you're allowed to you're able to eliminate it out and it could also be that you know it's just that coconut cream is very concentrated fat and that's enough to you know to get some through your digestion to soften up your stools but eventually you will get soft stools I mean if you get if you eat too much butter or too much Tallow too much fat fatty meat you will get loose stools and so just increase the amount of fat that you're eating like you there you know you do not have an unlimited capacity to absorb fat you simply don't and So eventually that will run out and you will be able to you'll have very soft stool so I would just go for that because that means if you're if you're getting dry hard stools are difficult to pass it means by definition you're not eating enough fat because your body's absorbing all the fat that you're eating and none of it's able to to slip out and make things soft which almost certainly means that you you're eating less than your body actually has bile for which means you're eating less than your body wants because your body's not going to make a random amount of bile to absorb a random amount of fat it's an expensive material it costs you energy and resources to make and it's not just going to do that in an inefficient manner because it's just it's just wasteful and your body can't do that like animals life in general can't do that or else they'll just they'll go away they'll go extinct I mean those inefficient processes uh got weeded out of the of the universe long ago you know it's only been very efficient systems if there were any other any inefficient system there may not ever have been realistically because the ones that didn't you know weren't efficient enough they all died out like all those dead species those extinct species were the ones that weren't able to thrive and they were probably super efficient they just weren't quite good enough to compete with uh all the other badasses out there too so just remember that you know you're descended from the winters your body's not just a just a hot mess it's supposed to work really really well and so it's not just blindly making bile so get enough bile for your body um or get enough fat for your body to um absorb as much as it wants to and a little bit extra it will keep it soft and you will get there with butter and Tallow trust me um you can put it to the test if you want just start going to Ham on the on the butter and Tallow you know see what happens you've been warned but it will happen so thank you for the Super Chat nav Gore for four months strictly meat salt and water still bloating having gas and multiple stools during the day will uh betan hydrochloride and Ox bile help um maybe you know it's uh it it's uh it may it may not I mean the thing is it depends on what's really causing that issue you know when you're getting bloating um and gas and things like that you know your body's reacting to some of the things that you're eating if you've you know been just strictly eating uh meat and water you could have a microbiome sort of uh you know disbiosis where you're just just it's just not coming around quite properly you know you try the fermented dairy and uh with the meat and see see what that does for you um if you have anything anything else especially like artificial sweeteners or you know these um these electrolytes and things like that that have artificial sweeteners or flavorings those can cause all of those symptoms um you know the multiple stools a day that's a bit interesting um because you know you should be absorbing the vast majority of the stuff that you're eating so so you know maybe you go through periods where you have you know more than one bowel motion a day but then you should go multiple days without anything um so you know there could be an issue with are you know are you breaking things down properly you know the bile uh the bile thing is is well if you're just if you're just getting crazy loose stools and you just you're not absorbing fat well then you know B would help you absorb the fat but why wouldn't you be absorbing fat is that because you're not making bile is that because you don't have a gallbladder and so you can't eat a big fatty meal in one go typically that just gives loose stools um not bloating in gas and things like that but either way if you if you if you didn't have a gallbladder what you do is you just split up your fatty meals throughout the day um because if you know you're you know if you're just allowing your body to absorb the fat that it wants through the ox through the its own bile well then you're going to um then you're going to absorb the right amount of fat your body you really can't overeat fat if you're doing that because your body just won't absorb it and if you take Ox bile then you'll absorb more than your body necessarily wants so that's that's not a great great thing to do either um you could try the HCL you know again it just just depends you know are you taking any an acids are you taking any ppis or any other medications you know if your um stomach acid is a bit uh higher in PH and you're not really breaking things down properly that's when adding in the HCL would help because that's what that is it's just you're adding more acid to your stomach and uh and potentially breaking things down but but if that's not the issue then it's not necessarily going to help um you could also try changing around the different kinds of meat that you're eating you know changing up and down the amount of fat that you're eating uh if you if you don't think that you're absorbing things or breaking things down properly you know you can talk to your doctor is there some sort of you know pancreatic insufficiency these sorts of things that uh you know have have been here to for undiagnosed you know probably should check that out you could always try HCL I've always very very hesitant with people taking Ox bile because you know you're just going to force your body to absorb more fat than you want than your body wants it to so and if you have a pancreatic insufficiency and you're not properly producing lipase then you know it's not the ox bile that's going to help you you know you need you need something else so um have a think about those and um you know if you're if you really are strict meat and water then you know try changing around the different kinds of meat see you know what uh if if those affect you differently you know take out eggs things like that see what what that does take out Dairy if you are eating that and uh and again any artificial sweeteners or coffee especially coffee because some people say like I'm strictly carnivore but oh yeah I have coffee and this and that and it's just like okay so I'm not saying that you do but I'm just saying that that's something to think about as well and um and yeah and if you if you think you have some sort of pancreatic insufficiency your body's just not breaking this stuff down properly uh you know talk to your doctor and see if they can they can investigate that for you and think about microbiome too because there's a lot of possibilities there silk Dragon thank you so much for the super chat um hey Doc don't stop working please uh a as I'm a former dialysis patient I eat ribey organs um organs on pills Burgers wagu eggs bone broth uh at anything um no I mean you know or obviously organs uh are going to be good me you don't need crazy amounts um but just you know just the fatty meat is really important you know making sure you get any bit if you have any sort of uh increased nutritional demands doing more high density sort of nutrients like the organs either in a mix or a blend or pill if you have to but really just just eat the eat the organ is a really good idea really like just one bite of liver a day that's really all it takes it's all you need so it's really not all that much and you know you can you can choke down a a bite of liver it's not that bad um Raw Liver is way better than cooked liver I find just tastes a lot better and so you know you can you can think about those as well what I'm really curious about here is where you're saying the your former dialysis patient does that mean that you're now not on dialysis that your kidneys functions are improving I've seen about three people come off dialysis by going on a ketogenic carnivore diet which is amazing that's just unheard up um and I know one other uh gentleman who um is in the process of trying that out and he's massively improved his health he's a former vegan raw fruitarian and and destroyed his health and neurological function was basically crippled his ner his nervous system started shutting down he couldn't even use his phone anymore and uh he was stuck in bed and then he's okay yep my diet's killing me I got to get away from this and he was already on dialysis in his early 30s and so he went on a carnor diet started massively improving his health and um regained his neurological function was able now out of bed now exercising he's got a physio he's going out he's being social which is really great and then um and just keeping an eye on things on on the kidney function and apparently he's been making more urine but still dependent on dialysis but he's giving it a year um before he considers a kidney transplant so hopefully fingers crossed he he's uh one of the lucky ones so is that was that the case with you I'd be really interested uh in hearing that um got a transplant okay uh okay so you um you got to transplant in January and but feeling much better on uh cornivore and your kidneys are perfect well that's really good to hear um and did yeah curious too you know did you start carnivore before after your transplant as well either way I'm glad you're feeling a lot better uh also but um yeah uh no I don't think you need to add anything I think uh you know all the things that you're eating there are are great just make sure you're getting enough fat you know obviously ribeye is is a pretty good cut but um sometimes people need a little bit more and sometimes the the ri eyes are a bit more trimmed or less trimmed so um Burgers can be pretty lean wagu generally pretty fatty but the depending on what is being fed maybe not the best kind of fat so have more Omega sixes then Omega-3s and things like that but uh great but yeah but if yeah well anyway that's interesting uh really great to hear that you're doing so well and thanks for sharing shenen thank you very much for the Super Chat carnivore diet dates back 1.5 million years while medical plant use only tens of thousands of years given your view on plant toxins and anti-nutrients is it acceptable to use uh for healing internally externally or avoided entirely noan we've been using these things to to great effect medically but medically medically is is a very specific thing that means that you only use specific compounds under specific conditions right you know you look get Fox Glove and has you know digitalis in it and you say like o that's good for heart failure so I'm going to take that because it'll make my my heart strong well your heart is going to stop you're going to die um because you don't need that and it's and it's actually a poison it's not making that substance to you help Hearts work better they they take they make that to cause cardiac arrests and and arhythmia to kill the animal trying to eat it and so we can take that and we can use a very small amount of it in certain circumstances where people's heart is failing just hardly beating it can give stronger contractions uh and so people can have a better cardiac output um but you would not do that unless you had that condition just like you know people say well you know thingss of garlic has antimicrobial effects and all that's so wonderful okay well you know so does a moxacin um does that mean you should just take a moxilin every day well no obviously you would wouldn't do that unless you had an infection so okay so don't have the garlic unless you have an infection either if you actually think that that's something that's going to help I probably you know um you know would would let my body sort of try to heal and if I if I was getting out of control with uh some sort of infection I would probably go straight for the antibiotics um but no if you if you have a plant that actually has you know a known effect and we have a lot of plants that had known effects you know have things things called Galan it was this guy gayen who was um Marcus aurelius's doctor I'm pretty sure back in the Roman Empire and he was a brilliant guy and he had all this experiment and you know careful scientific application to the the field of medicine and he but he was so arrogant and he just said you know what don't if you're going to study medicine don't just experiment for yourself and try to see what works you know I've already discovered everything everything you need to know about medicine I've discovered so just study me study my works it's all there you don't need to go anywhere else and so it shut down scientific Endeavor and inquiry uh in the medical uh fields for about 1500 years and everyone just studied Galen you know he was that influential and so um it wasn't for yeah another 1300 years something like that before people started to question gayen and it took another couple hundred years before people went okay yeah we need to move on um but uh yeah but we have these ganal which were these these different mixtures of different plants and herbs and things like that that had these different functions for different purposes but a medicine is only a toxin that under certain circumstances provides more benefit than harm but if you're not in that specific circumstance it's only providing the harm you're not getting the benefit from it so yeah you can definitely use these things um medically I mean we' Ed technology and our understanding ings of of the world and manipulations of you know uh plants and preparations of them to be able to use them more safely in food you know all the fermentation and nalization and all these different ways of of preparing food cooking the living hell out of them taking out the more poisonous Parts like the skin and the seeds and um and then uh but also understanding you know which ones can be used in certain circumstances for addal purposes so yeah I do think that that's something that you can do but you know at this point now that we you know we we've been able to identify the different compounds in these plants and we can isolate them and get the exact dosage that you want I think that's I think that's a much better option because you know you have digitalis okay you want the digitalis so you take the Fox Glove but you're getting thousands of other chemicals with the digitalis as well but you only want the digitalis right okay and how much digitalis are you getting are you getting 50 micrograms 100 micrograms 500 micrograms 2 micrograms how many are you getting because if you get it if you get the dose off uh if you get too low it's not going to do anything if you get it 50 m micrograms too high so one millionth of a gram you know so 51 millionth of a gram uh too high you you can stop someone's heart and kill them right so it's actually really important um and do you want to take an aspirin or you want to chew on some willow bark you know probably take the aspirin so you know if you're out in the woods and you know you have you have some you know understanding of herbology and and um plant medicine you know and that's you know any important in a storm but um you know probably best to just use the Pharmaceuticals at this point so you know exactly what you're getting you know exactly how much of it you're getting as well and you're not com it's not coming with anything else so that's a bonus question from nav thank you very much for the Super Chat I've checked my Ketone level uh and measured through my blood a few times I'm not getting into ketosis um eating as much fat as I can straight carnivore four plus months well you know thing is other people you know the thing is is that you it doesn't really matter too much on how what your Ketone levels are I mean if you're not eating carbohydrates you're not taking an artificial sweeteners your insulin is low and your blood sugar is low and you're not taking in carbohydrates then where are your carbohydrates coming from you're having low ketones but where are those ketones coming from they're coming from your fat and so you're mobilizing your fat from your fat stores and that's that's really what that's about I mean we call it um you know we we call it uh ketosis because we notice that there you know people have uh more ketones during this state than another state but that's not its it's defining Hallmark it's the main underlying principle physiologically is that you are accessing your fat stores and you can mobilize energy from your fat uh certain circumstances like cancer or epilepsy um that that could very well be that having higher ketones is is of benefit lower blood sugar higher ketones is of benefit otherwise maybe not and and the more the longer you go on a ketogenic diet the more fat adapted you become the more efficient you get at utilizing those uh that energy from ketones and so your your your serum Ketone level actually goes down it's not because you're not producing as much because you're not in ketosis it's because you're using it better and so early on you know you can have much higher levels of ketones but you're peeing some of these things out because your body just can't use them because you're just not fat adapted yet so as you go you know over over several months you become much more fat adapted and you start using them your Ketone levels come down down down now if you fast and you go longer periods of time like if you eat one meal a day for instance and just really eat you know one big meal and and just go For Broke and you go until fatty meat just really doesn't taste good anymore you want to stop um not that you're just you feel like puking but just you just like yeah I'm done I don't want to eat anymore um then quite often people aren't hungry for like another 24 hours unless they're doing a lot of heavy work and lifting weights and sprinting and being very active and their body wants to put on weight maybe they're undernourished and malnourish and underweight then uh then that can be different as well um i' I've seen it Melissa thanks and um so you know it's um i' completely lost my train of thought sorry um so either way it it you know don't get hung up on your Ketone levels just uh you know just you know worry about eating proper food get enough fat for sure so you're not getting hard stools and uh and make sure that you're feeling all right and uh and don't don't worry too much about your just your your your keto numbers and things like that uh do you feel good do you have good energy does you get better energy or better results when you eat slightly differently and slightly more fatter and different times and all these sorts of things that's that matters more so I mean I've I've only checked my you know my blood well yeah I really only checked my my you know sort of fingerprick blood test and and Ketone levels once ever and that was because it was at like a conference in in San Diego and they just had like a keto Mojo Booth was there and so you know Paul Mason and I went and checked our ketones just to see because then we were sort of predicting that we'd have pretty low ketones because we both you know been completely you know ketogenic for uh you know better part of a decade for me I think he's been over a decade keto anyway and me you know keto carnivore uh we're both point4 so does that mean that we're not in ketosis no of course not because we're mobilizing our fat stores so really we're just talking about this metabolic state that people call Nutritional ketosis or or ketosis or ketogenic metabolism whatever it's it's a it's our main metabolism is where we can mobilize energy from our fat stores and turn them into glucose glycogen and ketones and the majority of our our energy comes from fat oxidization that's it so you know it's not just like well we don't have high ketones therefore we're not in ketosis no it's about mobilizing your fat store so I wouldn't too worry too much about that if you want to go for numbers and see if that makes you feel better try eating once a day you just one big fatty meal a day and uh you can try taking a day off you know some people will uh you know just eat six days a week and just have one day off and just see how their body body goes and that just sort of resets and let you let you know it's sort of a good way of letting you know um how much your body actually needs Ian people often feel that they have just have to eat multiple meals a day because they just always have before and and then they don't eat for two days and they realize like actually that that wasn't that bad at all I don't generally Advocate fasting outside of specific uh therapeutic interventions like you're trying to get your gki down because of cancer or something like that but um you know or just necessity because there's just nothing good to eat I'd rather not eat than eat garbage um but you can try that and that can that will change your ketones your ketones will go up a little higher and your blood sugar will go down a little further um see how you feel and if you feel better that way then maybe incorporate in some you know the omad sort of style of eating and uh and go from there uh let's see yeah we got we've got several questions here in a couple super chats and um yeah unfortunately I don't have as much time today but um so maybe we'll end the end the super chats there and we'll try to get through the rest of these questions and take it from there um mm thank you very much for the Super Chat I've recently reintroduced coffee with no negative symptoms I know you'll disapprove but what percentage reduction from Optimum does a coffee a day cause 5% less than optimal 50% or Worse cheers 100% you're going to ruin your life no um look if if you feel if you feel fine on that you know if the if the symptoms that it's you know causing are subtle enough that you don't really care fine are you getting benefit from it you know think about the energy getting yeah you feel a lot better but do you feel a crash afterwards you feel sort of junky and gross afterwards I certainly did um the other thing to think about is that it has other effects that you may not actually appreciate uh acutely you know you have you have um uh there there are a lot of anti-nutrients in uh coffee as well as other plants but coffee in particular has a lot of antinutrients it will block out the absorption of nutrients even in in you know fully bioavailable foods such as meat and so if you take coffee around meal times then you're not going to absorb a lot of the food or a lot of the nutrients and that's not what you want they can actually get into your bloodstream actually strip out nutrients caffeine alone will just strip out magnesium out of your bloodstream soort will lower your magnesium levels dehydrate you a bit more too and so you know that's not what you want I have ALS also seen people uh when they're taking medications such as thyroid medications they they you're supposed to like just take thyroid medication with nothing except water wait 30 minutes before you eat anything else and um and then I I found people that uh were were um having coffee sort of around the time they were taking their thyroid medication their thyroid just was not working it was like they weren't taking anything their thyroid was very low um like their their T3 was very low and and they were on T3 specifically so it was just like okay did you stop taking your medications and uh they said no no no I'm still definitely taking it but you know turned out that they were having coffee around that time as well so I said okay it was just just push the coffee back you don't have to stop taking it just push it back two hours so you take your thyroid hormone and then you you don't take you don't take any coffee for two hours and see what happens two weeks later her thyroid uh T3 had doubled right so was massive difference and massive Improvement on um on uh the uh on her objective you know blood results just by moving the coffee time so think about that you know there's studies uh with oysters where they have people have ton of zinc and oysters people eating oysters zinc goes up so you give them x amount of oysters zinc goes up big jump in their serum levels like right away right then they gave them oysters with black beans only 25% of the rise of the group without black beans right so it blocked out 75% of the absorption so that's quite significant then they gave uh people same amount of oysters but with corn tortillas no rise in the Zinc at all so it completely blocked out the the zinc absorption by 100% And what else was it blocking out as well was it just the zinc probably not there's probably a lot of other things that were blocking out as well so that's what coffee does also so just just be keep that in mind when I see people you know and I check their their vitamins and minerals and things like that you know one thing that really holds people back in improving even if they're on supplements is coffee and it really really causes a lot of um malabsorption issues for these nutrients these these vitamins and minerals and um so if you're going to have it you just have to have it completely separate from any meal and any medication for sure and uh and then even then it can still strip some of these things out of your system uh even just going into your bloodstream so just keep that in mind that's a that's a problem that I have with it another one is is that it has a m laxative effect and so sometimes that that necessitates you eat less fat so you don't get the runs right because if you eating enough fat that you're going to have soft stools and you add coffee to that you're going to get you're going to get loose stools and so oh don't want want that obviously I'm eating too much fat you pull back on the fat and now you don't have enough fat but you have normal stools because of the coffee as a laxative so you know there's there Downstream uh downsides to drinking coffee as well even if you you know the the you know the shortterm uh sort of issues like soreness you know muscle aches after you know Doms delay onset muscle soreness and um you know joint aches and like that even if those aren't aren't that obvious um you know these other things can cause a problem as well so just keep that in mind um so meow Sparkles says carnivore for over a year lost 70 pounds and off 100 milligrams of mopal all taken for 18 years that's awesome fantastic great job and thank you for sharing that um same for my sister an off meds for mental illness delusional psychosis and schizophrenia that's amazing um absolutely fantastic really yeah thank you so much for for sharing that I'm I'm really happy for you happy for your sister as well and and you know obviously the weight loss is is great and having you know coming down on on the heart medication but then obviously the mental illness is I mean that's incredible you know I mean delusional psychosis and schizophrenia I mean this is you know that's that's probably one of the more difficult things that any anybody will ever have to live with because you can't interpret reality properly you know you're you're seeing things that aren't there you're experiencing things that aren't that aren't happening and that's really distressing I mean how could that not be really distressing um and so having that improve is is absolutely amazing thank you very much uh for sharing that I'm really happy uh to hear that um Annabella the happy carnivore thank you for much for the Super Chat thanks for being such a blessing to us Dr a love you all thank you very much that's very sweet of you um porus norus oh there we go there's the got attached down here thank you very much for for the Super Chat uh Mr porcus or maybe Mrs porcus um the porcus family so hi Anthony if I eat more uh than and 650 to 700 grams I get increased urinary problems um edemas in feet uh leg cramps nausea Etc any idea why is is happening underweight cannot gain strict high fat Carnival well I think there might be other health issues going on as well I think you need to think about that um there could be something else underlying I would imagine if you've had these problems there might be some other problems that you've been experiencing for a long time so that needs to fit in with any sort of diagnosis that you've had before if you hadn't had a diagnosis maybe go talk to your doctor to see if you can get a diagnosis um as far as as just you know 650 to 700 grams of meat causing that I mean there's there's no real reason why just eating more meat should cause that potentially something to do with the electrolytes potentially do something with the salt like if eating more salt in your body wants um you can potentially you know cause disruption and and edema and things like that you cause uh fluid shifts and different sorts of body parts Etc um so think about the electrolytes think about the salts sometimes people need more salt you know if you're um losing too much salt just U when you're as your insulin levels are are adjusting um way to sort of see or to get an idea if that's what's happening is if when you stand up at a chair you sort of get laded and dizzy uh pretty regularly that could be that you're you're dehydrated and not getting enough salt so you need to add more salt in even up to five or even seven grams of salt to day as your body's adjusting so think about that as well I mean the interesting thing is is that you're just getting you're you're getting this when you eat more than you know 700 grams you know so you know it's a bit odd as to why you would be getting these symptoms just with eating more meat so that makes me sort of Wonder is this something to do with maybe maybe too much electrolytes or salts maybe you're adding more so the more you're eating the more of these electrolytes are getting in how much salt are you adding are you adding anything else are you having any sort of added electrolytes as well so think about those sorts of things maybe cut those things out if um if uh if you are including those and and maybe you trim down um you know so most people are not salt sensitive most people do just fine with salt there is salt in meat I mean there is sodium there is you know chloride ions and potassium and magnesium and everything else calcium um but you know as we're transitioning sometimes you need a bit more and so you can get these fluid shifts so I don't know how long you've been doing this either but you know the thing is too is that you know if if you find that you're eating a certain way and it's causing a problem then you don't eat that way you know try to see if okay can you eat more with less salt you know would that cause the same problem something like that um is there something underlying is there a problem that you're having that that could be uh causing these issues to happen in general that may need to be treated U by your doctor uh potentially and so um nothing else added so no salt no nothing like that H well then that's a bit confusing um because you know if it's well if you you should definitely write a diary I don't know how um you know if you've done this or not but if you haven't you'll get like a food diary and and write down exactly what you eat when you eat it and the symptoms that you getting because sometimes we can we can notice these patterns but then when we actually chart it out we can see like well actually okay this is actually happening other times as well maybe not necessarily only them but you can always um you know you can always sort of test uh you know sort of write these things down just try to get a pattern you know and see if um see if there's something you can see but yeah I don't know why that would be why eating more than 700 grams of meat uh would cause that um unless it was something in the meat that was that was being problematic you could try having different Meats things like that um but you know those sorts of things it just it you know leg cramps almost always from dehydration so you know maybe try ramping that up a demon in your feet I mean if you're getting increased urine you're peeing more you're getting leg cramped you're getting dehydrated you know drink more water I mean that's that's an easy solution right there but um I I think you should probably just just ask your doctor see if there's anything going on why I mean because I don't know how much your legs are swelling or what kind of swelling there are as well or what other sort of urinary symptoms you're getting I me it could be that this is something profound it could be something fairly subtle then you know uh and or just a sort of an adjustment period leg cramps drink more water almost always urinary problems I don't know increased urinary problems I'm assuming that's more frequency you're just peeing more regularly I don't know but um you know if you are then more water and um could very well be if you're peeing more and you're losing more electrolytes through um insulin uh readjusting and you're getting dehydrated from that that could cause a problem there so think about adding salt if you're not adding salt maybe think about that increase the water first possibly add salt and uh you know so just go down the list make a list of possible things and then sort of work through them and and you know and again don't don't be afraid of talking to your doctor you think there's there's a problem okay Rita Jean hello Rita nice to see you uh hi doc I tried to recipe for bone broth and butter and loved it uh I'm using chicken bone broth and going to try beef next oh that's great so that was something that um we tried in um Washington we were visiting my parents there uh just had some like chicken broth and uh like you know chicken broth bone broth whatever and um we had this I forget exactly how we came up with this but anyway just made it made bulletproof broth and um and soort of had that and and blend it with a stick blender and just was just this creamy nice sort of you know salty meaty sort of stuff and it was really good um careful has a lot of butter and if you're if you're not absorbing that pretty fast then you can uh it can it can have you hit the hit the bathroom running but um uh I liked it anyway couple people got um got caught out but it was uh it tastes good anyway but just be just be mindful of that but H yeah it's it's a good recipe it's really easy you know just bone broth or or just you know chicken stock beef stock something like that you know put a stick of butter in it like a Bulletproof Coffee stick blend it tastes great uh Tyler Naas thank you so much for the Super Chat it's very kind of you U very generous Super Chat too it's really nice of you Tyler thank you for that um and sabii thank you for very generous Super Chat as well it's really kind of you um or the the super sticker as well sort of ran out of um uh super chats uh so uh and then sort of answered a couple other ones um grab a couple normal questions here one's from grisela Mora can a carnivore diet help with memory loss from temporal lobe epilepsy um the you know the um the thing with with with any sort of of memory loss or damage neurological damage Etc it matters how complete it is the body can heal from a lot and well we say to people that if you they you'll get neurological recovery basically up to a year after an insult and if you don't get anything after that then and you probably shouldn't expect to get anything after that sometimes up to two years for certain things but typically that's about it a year or two and it's going to be stable but I've seen people recover um with you know many years in between their their neurological insult like a stroke or TBI or something like that um so the answer is is it's possible being in a ketogenic State having high ketones ketones going to cross the blood brain barrier reconstitute into fatty acids that make up the physical structures of the brain um you're not going to be screwing with your cholesterol you're going to have abundant amount of cholesterol for the brain to make more brain and that can obviously help with with memory um memory uh that hip campus is is uh you know heavily involved with memory and uh being in ketosis stimulates uh bdnf brain derive neurotropic factor which specifically stimulates the hippocampus and can help with u memory issues as can getting out in the sun and getting UVA light into your eyes and onto your retina that can also stimulate bdnf so it can exercise but specific exercises like um anerobic exercises so weightlifting and sprinting high intensity sort of things but whatever you can do just do it but those higher intensity exercises can also stimulate bdnf as well and and that can help also so these sorts of things are obviously worth trying and certainly being in a ketogenic State uh for epilepsy temporal lobe epilepsy and we have these focal epilepsy they they aren't necessarily as uh you know as um susceptible to ketogenic diets they aren't as ketogenic diets aren't as helpful as other forms of epilepsy potentially are but there are plenty of people with temporal epilepsy that improve with ketogenic diets and uh it's not going to hurt anyway and you're getting all these fatty acids and um you know DHA and EPA and these sorts of things that are very very essential for your brain and your normal neurology so it's it's very much worth the try uh I would absolutely um I would absolutely do that um and uh and and see how that work how that helps and hopefully it does actually it looked like I missed a couple up here one's from Damen Williams thank you very much Daman for a very kind Super Chat uh would you consider setting up a gift send go to build up funds so that you or someone you know could travel and compile in-depth case studies for publication each book uh could cover specific medical condition um helped by carnivore well that's a that's a that's an interesting idea I mean I am you know put putting together some case studies uh and case series to publish on um you know different people that have have dramatically improved on um carnivore diets uh like so you know for instance like u ms multiple sclerosis going to be doing that as well heart failure congestive heart failure um other autoimmune issues as well because is so so much benefit that people find with with um autoimmune issues so anybody who um you you don't necessarily need to travel to do that you can we can do this stuff remotely in fact I'm I'm collecting um you know volunteers if if people are in that condition and they've they've had you know recovery from uh congestive heart failure or multiple sclerosis or psoriasis or all these other sorts of things uh email me at Anthony chaffy gmail.com and you know put in the in the subject line you know um carnivore case study this issue right and then and then let me know um you'd be willing to to be a part of that and and we can actually put these together and we publish these things and I think that's a very very powerful thing to do um I think it's a great idea to do some crowdfunding for um studies you know like getting more carnivore studies going uh Dave Felman did that they crowd crowdsourced a lot of things for the lean the mass hyper responder stuff it was funny uh Peter AA sort of called him out like oh if these people really care about it then you should crowd fun and get the money from them but you know he sounded pretty dismissive of it that people weren't goingon to go into it because they were you know for whatever reason but they people came out and droves you know to both be subjects for it and also to donate money towards it and um and there you go and we're getting out you know great information from that that really just you know goes hard against the um you know the narrative that cholesterol causes heart disease which is there is zero hard evidence for theyve never shown that uh cause and effect relationship between any form of cholesterol total cholesterol LDL cholesterol sdldl cholesterol any of the LDL particulates Appo LP little a anything nothing you know everyone talks in these abstracts oh melion randomized control just because has a word randomized does not mean it's a randomized control trial it's still epidemiology those those mandalian studies so um it's uh it's it's very funny to see these sorts of things because we demand so much evidence for for everything else and this is the one thing that just no hard experimental data is is ever asked for or provided and people just they just they just are beside themselves whenever you whenever you point this out um but yeah I think it' be a good idea you know that if I get um you know a big study going I'd love to do something like that like on gbms or or uh something else uh that would be yeah be fantastic and would absolutely uh be a great idea to think about uh crowdfunding for that and yeah yeah thank you for that Damian that's a very good idea and I think we'll probably end it here with icef fly 99 thank you very much ice fly for the Super Chat it's very kind of you um do you have a view on Parkinson's disease and a carnivore diet it's discouraged due to medication interference uh but I don't find people uh trying it oh yeah no there's there's plenty of people on uh carnivore diets with Parkinson's and anecdotally this has been helping there have been published case reports with ketogenic diets and Parkinson's there are studies that have uh spoken about ketogenic diets uh being helpful for Parkinson's higher LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol Studies have published that that this has a this is protective against U Parkinson's I.E people that have higher LDL cholesterol throughout their life have a lower rate of um Parkinson's you know or lower relative risk or whatever um or risk Association I should say and and um yes you can get some um medication interaction don't eat around those medications right so if you're taking the medications once a day just give it several hours um you know some people don't like taking the medications you know my father you know decided that he didn't didn't want him and they they weren't really helping him and so he decided to come off but he was carnivore for years uh on on different um Parkinson's medications really leoy Leo dopa which is like sort of a main one but uh yeah he didn't really find that it was all that helpful and he ended up coming off of it U because you know there were side effects and things like that he didn't like but he never had an interaction or issue with eating a cornivore diet um so but yeah if there's if if they're on some sort of Parkinson's medication that you know could have an issue just make sure that they're eating very separate from those medications that's a good thing and obviously any sort of interaction or or negative problem you just you change things up and uh and work with their their neurologist to uh come up with a good solution for that as well and uh yeah but no there's there's plenty of people doing it and my friend Matt uh Dr Matt Phillips who's a neurologist over in New Zealand he has um uh published case reports of his patients doing ketogenic diets and and having improved outcomes with Parkinson's as well so you know there's uh you know there's there there are there are people doing it and uh at least those individuals that have been doing it are are doing better so you know good to know about anyway okay um great I think probably end end there sorry it's uh sort of a bit quicker than we normally do however we're here for you know an hour and a half so I thought it's not all that bad um but uh yeah didn't didn't get to do any haven't been able to do like a three-hour marathon in a while but we'll see how we go I've just been traveling so much with um with work and speaking at these conferences that when I'm back I basically have to see patients um all day every day uh sort of every every day and so I'm sort of working seven days a week and and don't have like mornings free on on on many of the days that I used to do the lives and uh um so I just gota sort of get with the backlog of patience so but that's okay won't be like that forever I'll be able to start getting back to some of these um live chat live um YouTube talks eventually but uh yeah thank you all very much really appreciate you guys coming on uh hopefully that was helpful for people um and thank you again to Heather and Ben for coming on tell us about the keto brain conference uh really looking forward to that that's going to I'm those are like I wasn't just saying that I really really do enjoy all of those speakers I think they're all really great and I'm very much looking forward um to to meeting some the ones that I haven't met in person yet and hearing hearing um you know uh people uh such as um Ivor Cummings talk I haven't seen him live I haven't seen um Zoe harkham live I've only sort of seen her videos which are excellent and had her on my pod and that was a delight to talk to her um and very interesting lady and uh and very intelligent lady as well very very probing in her how she thinks and and how she investigates things and uh yeah so that'll be a lot of fun so if anybody's able to go to that you know please do and
