    "transcript": "[Music] all right uh hello everyone thank you for joining me for another YouTube live today is July 31st uh 2024 for me anyway and then in the 30th in the US so thank you everyone for joining I'm going Live on YouTube and x and trying to get it up on Instagram as well so we'll see how that goes also uh but thank you everyone for coming on uh have about an hour and a half today and I'll try to get to all the questions that uh we possibly can we already have some uh super chats have come in so thank you everyone for doing that as well try to get to questions from Instagram and X also but we have to sort of prioritize the super Chats on YouTube uh as well for obvious reasons so starting out with that there's a question from Ellie thank you for the Super Chat Ellie uh carnivore versus beef butter bacon and eggs versus lion which is best thank you well I mean beef butter bacon and eggs is carnivore it's just a it's just being very specific sayy eat these things you know and uh and I think that's a very good way of doing it sort of makes things a bit more simple and straightforward like well what do I eat eat beef butter bacon and eggs that's that's sort of what you eat and so it's um you know that that's I think why uh you know Ken be very phrased it like that frame it like he's very good at framing things like that or you know calling things a proper human diet things like that it's you know it just it just tells you exactly what we're what you're doing here and why you're doing it so um Lion diet of just ruminant meat and water especially if it's grass-fed and finished is always going to be the best you're going to have the least amount of um unnecessary plant toxins that get through it's going to have the most nutrients it's going to have the most phytonutrients people say oh you have to have these phytonutrients in the plant well grass-fed beef has more phytonutrients than the plants do because they concentrate all the phytonutrients and they filter out all the the harmful phytotoxins that also come with those phytonutrients and so line is always going to be the best um but most people would do just fine eating uh just any meat that they that they like and enjoy and and can afford you know and that's really important is that you know if you're you know on a budget you can still just brown beef is really cheap and brisket is probably the cheapest cut on the cow it's also the fattiest and one of the most flavorful so uh there are ways that you can do this even lion diet very cheap very cheap and it's a lot cheaper than eating all the produce because you even steak is less expensive per pound than spinach and spinach just rots and goes bad and it doesn't have all the nutrients you need it has a whole bunch of things you don't want so um you know it can still be done affordably but but the line DED is is definitely what what most people do the best with because it's the ruminant animals that have have the ability to ferment the food the plant material first before they absorb it and then they break down more of the toxins release more of the nutrients they get more nutrients out of it they get less toxins out of it and they're just a more nutritious uh animal for us to eat so that's why and then duka thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat it's very kind of you um they say I'm 150 PBS oneyear line diet 150 grams of protein 150 grams of fat per day electrolytes regularly depression 100% gone fantastic that's great but barely have energy to walk up the stairs not as great uh eating results in narcoleptic uh looking crash naps brain fog uh less severe on Carnivore but still bad well you know if there's specific meats that are making you feel a bit off then you know obviously avoid those try to eat the meats that make you feel as good as you can um I I don't get I you know it's not common to see people have you know narcoleptic crashes after they eat but a lot of people get very lethargic after they eat uh I get lethargic after I eat typically unless it's like grass vet and finished beef that's like you know that's like actually grass vet and finished then I just get supercharged um especially like that older cow that I ate it was like 10 years just on grass never ate anything else in its life and it um uh tasted amazing but also I just I just felt like you know I was you just eating pure energy and I just had I was charged after that so there could be something in the meat that you're eating maybe it's h you know uh you start going after you know grass finished as opposed to grain finished and maybe that can help you or just whatever um whatever Meats don't make you feel like that try to focus on those and then try to eat you know fast throughout the day and then eat your big meal at night and it crashes you down and then you just go to sleep for the night and uh and try to try to do it in that way that's what I I typically do I always feel better when I um when I when I'm you know fat you know not eating during the day and then eat a big meal at night after I work out and get home from work you know then I just naturally am lethargic and tired and want to go to bed and it's good because it's bedtime and I should go to bed and so uh that has been um you know better for me logistically um you know I would wonder if you are having uh the same experience if you just eat a smaller meal in the day and um you know if you like a small amount would that still make you really tired and lethargic if not not then try just doing that just try eating a small amount you know for breakfast or lunch or whenever you're hungry and then eating your big meal at the end of the day when you get lethargic and you just pass out and go to sleep um so yeah it is interesting yeah yeah and that's what it sort of sounds like that you are getting sort of worse after you eat so maybe just try eating later in the day try maybe eating a smaller meal see if that that affects your energy and then I I wonder if is that energy all the time that you're that you're um experiencing low energy and and not having you know much much fun going up and down the stairs either um check your Bloods you know it could be that you're you're having a malabsorption issue you're not absorbing some things you know check your B12 and folate vitamin D uh check your thyroid check your um you know zinc magnesium selenium these sorts of things for those ones you really want to try to get your orthy levels you want to check what's inside the red blood cells um so you can do like RBC red blood cell folate zinc magnesium and selenium getting the serum levels isn't really accurate or helpful so you know probably not don't waste your time getting those and you have to find a lab that actually does those because not all Labs do those specific tests and um yeah and then so see just make sure that your your blood work is is doing well and then you know like you're saying okay so lion diet isn't as good as just general cornivore so what that sounds to me is that there are certain meats that aren't affecting you to such a degree okay focus on those you know if it's if you do better on you know pork and chicken and fish or whatever and eggs than you do on beef and lamb fine you know just just listen to your body most people do better on lying but if you're doing better on something else and do that um and uh it is it is a bit strange that you're still having low energy if you're having low energy when you're when you're fasted that's a bit strange you know and um you know I I would I would wonder if there's anything going on like you're not absorbing something or something else in your environment or if you know there's there's actually something in your environment you know there are people that get exposed to you know mold exposures and things like that that have very similar uh symptoms they feel pretty rotten all the time they have no energy um you know that's something that you should you should look into you check your blood sugar you know check your fingerprint blood blood sugar and check your finger print prick uh ketones I would bet you that they're all in good levels so you know it's um it's uh or and if they're not then you have to sort of figure out why they're not you maybe increase the fat or something like that um but you know I would I would be surprised if they weren't in good levels and so you will have energy available so why isn't your body using it why why don't you feel like you have a lot of energy so that's the question to answer um so yeah that that's a place to start anyway and start looking at at you know what might be going on and then just changing things logistically so that you you um uh can you know function and have a have a good energy throughout the day and that's one of them you know if you're having a big narcoleptic crash after you eat then you know try not to eat until the end of the day when it's time for bed you know that's that's one solution and uh yeah and and if you're just tired all the time anyway even when you're fasting I think it's time to check your Bloods and see what's going on and see if you have an absorption issue because there are people that aren't able to absorb the nutrients that are readily avail able in meat and that's not a problem with the meat that's a problem with their body not being able to absorb these things but it's very important to know so do check that out another question from Ellie thank you Ellie do you eat super slowly uh so that you know you're full not particularly I mean I you know I sit down and you know and um you know try to try to have a sit down meal and you know conversation and things like that when um when I'm able to and I'm not sort of in a rush you know it's just better for Peace of Mind anyway um but uh I don't I don't you know voraciously scarf down my meals and I don't deliberately slow down my meals I I just um and I just and I just sort of keep working at it until I get to a point where I'm just like Yeah I'm you know you just sort of naturally start slowing down because not as enjoyable and it's just a couple minutes between bites get like why am I doing this just sort of slow down naturally and stop um and uh you know when I'm I'm like yeah no so keep eating Time Chamber last week which was awesome by the way me and you I just order more you couple more steaks and you four more eggs and all that sort of stuff they had great eggs you know just really you know dark yellow orangey dark yellow eggs that um you know little pastu and just just chickens out there in the jungle just eating whatever they eat and um so you know great I sort of know my Hunger signals I sort of know how much my body wants so I can I can sort of eyeball it a bit better but um I think it is still good to you know get you point we have a bit of leftover and you just sort of like want to stop like I'm not really enjoying this I just sort of want to stop and good if if it's pretty lean you're get over it pretty quickly and so it's important to make sure you're getting enough fat with the meat but if you're doing that and normal pace for you and it'll start slowing down your body will just start telling you like it's not that interesting you sort of know you slow down yourself there's a sort of an odd question uh from a population of one hypothetical challenge you must choose five vegetables what vegetables would you choose why and how would you prepare them um well first of all I wouldn't uh unless I was starving to death and I had to so in this hypothetical situation if I was lost out in the woods and I was just you know uh you know a bad Hunter um um hold on someone say something about the sound being weird let me just see if I can fix this real quick not saying that that my mic's set up so I don't know um I don't know I know it could be could be something to do with the internet U it's saying that my mic is is uh picking up and um stop showing anything that I can fix on this end but maybe there's a connection issue um sorry about that hopefully it's um I I'll try to get a little closer to the mic as well and see if that helps also so um so back to this question if um you know if I was vegetables I wouldn't I would just not just do it uh if I was starving to death and I just turned out to be a really bad Hunter and could not get get meat or something like that then um and um then uh you know then then what I would do is I I'd basically go through uh and eat the different things that were a available to me there on whatever deserted island or area that I was on in my or some sort of dystopian futuristic hellscape that uh I landed myself in um and I try to go through the things that you know Professor Bill Schindler talks about in his book actually funny enough he like a human so that's that's actually this is his shirt and his book by the same name and so he um you know he goes through all the different plants that people use and how they prepared them to lower the toxic load fermenting them um putting through different you know chemical baths and and processes to sort of lower the toxic load and increase bioavailability of the nutrients um and that's what I would do I don't know which ones I would use because um I've never done that little thought experiment because it it has never really occurred to me to worry about it but um you it also would depend on on where I was because the fact matter is I would never in my life eat vegetables if it wasn't something that I expressly had to do to um uh to survive and so when you're in survival mode it's not that you have like a you know a whole grocery store of vegetables to choose from you're just like you have something in front of you and you either eat it or you die you might die from eating it but you know sort of a killer cure situation there and um so I know it's not where you wanted to hear but I would do things in uh a way that that was more traditional like you know fermenting things try to ferment things and uh lower the toxic load and and uh you know ferment them cook the living hell out of them do all these other sorts of things to try to lower the toxic load and bring out you know more nutrients and things like that so that's what I would try to do there's little Ellie Melly thank you very much Ellie Melly for the Super Chat and saying hi uh hi nice to see you nice to see you too can you please explain to people uh that they are going to feel like crap when starting carnivore because of sugar withdrawals explain withdrawal sympt so they understand thank you uh yeah well um some people do feel pretty rotten and some people talk about this as like you know the keto flu and and um you know how they they you know sort of feel a bit unwell um a lot of times that that can be withdrawals or you know if it's if it's keto that they're doing often times they're told to eat just a ton of vegetables and um and that you're just going to increase the amount of plant toxins that that are going in your body and you're not used to it that's going to make you feel a bit rotten as well until your body builds up some some more defenses towards that uh but a big part of that is going to be withdrawals and like sugar withdrawals people find that you know getting off of sugar and and nicotine and caffeine some of the some of the hardest things that they come off of um I I've SP I was speaking to a guy um recently and he was saying that he had you know different drug addictions and like you know serious addiction issues and he'd been sober for you know a number of years and he said that just getting off nicotine was one of the hardest things he'd ever had to do I mean getting off like heroin and other sorts of things were easier than getting off nicotine which is very surprising but you know maybe you just don't think of it as like as such a big deal as like you need to get off this because your life is at stake um and so you don't have as much of a of an impetus to to get you off of it but uh either way they're saying it was very difficult very very difficult and same thing with sugar I a lot of people say that sugar is very difficult for them to get off of and and you go through withdraws and you feel like garbage so you can feel a bit you know fluish and tired and achy and and weird almost like you're coming off a drug because it's a drug and you are you are withdrawing from it um so a lot of times you you'll get Cravings as well and just you'll just feel bit off a bit weird you know not as good maybe you know um you know like like you actually feel a bit unwell and and you get like really bad cravings and you're just like everything I want that sweet I want that this or that other um and uh but it it it does go away you know like any any drug and any withdrawal you get through it you know it's not like alcohol or benzo that you can have seizures and die you know you'll just feel a bit crummy and you'll have you'll have uh you know withdrawals and your body will say hey give me this drug and um hey little boy oh little boy sorry caught a cat good boy and um you know but it does go away and so if you eat enough fatty meat like if you get uh you know the Cravings then just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and that will at least dampen down those hunger signals and those cravings and um and so it um uh it it goes away usually about in a week or two and so the first week is usually the worst um sorry sorry buddy I'm bring you up here so people can can still hear me talk and um and um so you know it's usually the first you know week that that things are the worst usually the first days obviously so as the days go on uh it's going to get less and less as long as you're eating enough the Cravings should get better and better and um and then as you go uh after about two weeks the the actual you know chemical addiction Cravings uh should be pretty much gone and after that if you get Cravings it's uh almost always because you're just not eating enough and so just make sure you're eating enough fatty meat and they typically go away uh but yeah that's a that's a very good question that um you know that people often uh often wonder about is you know is that why that why I don't why do I feel like crap when I'm starting carnivore a lot of times it's it's from withdrawals and and uh it can also be from low electrolytes you know when your when your blood sugar is coming down and normalizing your insulin is coming down and normalizing that can change how your body um keeps and and holds on to electrolytes especially early on eventually your insulin will sort of get down to a more normal level and you know your kidneys will balance out because you know your the insulin affects how much uh electrolytes are being sort of held on to but that's counterbalance with other processes in your in your microtubules in your kidneys to actually excrete them and um you know and so you know you're not born with insulin resistance and massively elevated insulin right that takes years and decades and people's insulin are just creeping up and creeping up and creeping up and then you go from having a fasting insulin of five to then having a fasting insulin of 72 that was the highest I've ever seen in a patient and um and as a result your body is going to be trying to overcompensate and excrete more electrolytes than it normally would because you're having such a strong you know uh signal from the insulin to pull these things back in but that had to compensate in One Direction otherwise you just would hold on to way too many of your electrolytes and you die because too much is going to kill you just like too little will as well and so it was able to adjust in that direction so why wouldn't it adjust back in the other way way of course it will and can unless you break something along the way but you know most people will be able to to readjust and um and uh so while that's readjusting though you could be losing too many electrolytes that could make you spill out more water than you want to you can get dehydrated your blood sugar can or sorry your blood pressure can drop and you can get feel pretty rotten as well and that's another thing that people say they they feel lightheaded and dizzy and sick and all these other sorts of things and that could be because of the low electrolytes and low uh or the drop in your blood pressure as well so those are some things to expect uh or to not necessarily expect is not everybody goes through these things but something to be aware of when you're starting and uh and understand that they go away you know if you need to add in a bit of electrolytes do it and drink some more water as well if you're getting dizzy when you stand up you need more water you need more electrolytes and if you're getting these crazy cravings and feeling fluish you need to eat more fat meat and and that can help uh dampen down those cravings and uh and get you through it and then after again about a week or two they typically go away I mean even like the the electrolyte keto flu people they they notice that that just goes away in a couple weeks two three weeks and so what does that mean that means the body's compensating and it's readjusting for those electrolytes typically but you know some people do benefit from adding in more salt and electrolytes and um so just you know if that's you just just be aware of that and um you know add some in if you need it Raj Mander sidu thank you very much sir for your actually I don't know if that's um a a male or female name I'm very sorry but thank you very much for the Super Chat in general um in any case so as a soccer player how should I plan my meals around evening uh training 7: to 9:00 p.m. so it's easy to sleep at night I eat after training on a line diet yeah I would I would definitely uh train on a on a empty stomach um if you need to eat before that if you're not able to do just you know one meal a day especially if you're training a lot probably won't be able to I would eat at least five hours before and I would eat sort of like a half meal and uh and not just get absolutely stuffed because you're just going to be more lethargic during the day and then after your your training just yeah just eat a big big meal for me when I was playing rugby and similar schedule I would train from 3:30 to 9:00 at night for rugby going to University training and then to to the you know the men's training afterwards it was um uh I I I wouldn't eat during the day at all and I would just eat afterwards after 9 so I be I'd be eating at like you know you know 10 o'clock you I go home shower change and um and then I would uh eat after that and i' just have a big meal after that so uh yeah I would just eat a whole bunch of meat until it stopped tasting good and if you're going to eat before that you need give a good five hours before that and maybe don't completely fill up just have sort of you know just take the edge off and then uh wait until afterwards to eat the whole bunch that's the best idea a lot of fat remember a lot of fat Lacy Loft kit Lofton thank you very much for the Super Chat can you talk on the way to increase uh metabolism I had probably over fasted before carnivore but when I went carnivore I gained weight back how do I increase um how do I increase it also correcting hypothyroidism so the hypothyroidism well it depends on what's causing the hypothyroidism if it's Hashimoto then you just need to be strict lion diet and a lot of fat and that that will you'll you track your antibodies and they'll just they'll come right down but they take a long time so they can take upwards of a year depending on how high your your antibodies are for those things to come down to a more normal level or to a at a normal level being undetectable so um yeah your metabolism when you starve yourself when you just fast or you're not eating enough your body doesn't know that you're just trying to lose weight your body thinks that you're in a famine and you don't have access to food and so it says okay less is coming in less is going to go out and your metabolism slows down down and there's a number of different ways your body can do that one of them is by slowing down your thyroid and and raising your reverse T3 and and dampening down the effects of your thyroid hormone as well and so what you want to do is you want to encourage your metabolism so you want to eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good it's the same technique for everybody in every situation every time you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you do that at least once a day and if you're working out and exercising you may need to do that you know more than once a day so um what that does is it tells your body that you're not in a famine there's no shortage of food there's plenty here um you know when you get your hours cut at work and you're in you know desperate times the last thing you need to do is start spending you know blowing out your savings account and maxing out the credit cards that's a bad time to go on shopping spree so being physically responsible which is what your body is you just less is coming in you just have to cut all your expenses and costs and you just have to stop putting it out and you do that for a while and you're just like yeah that was miserable I hated that I never want to go through that again and you're used to living under under your means now and you're live used to living at a at at a lower level and you're not you're not really wasting money and then you get your hours back you get a promotion and uh you start getting more money in but you're like hey I don't need to just start you know buy a Lamborghini and just you know max out and then go into more debt I don't want to go through that again I want to put money in the bank I want to say I can still live under at these you know under these uh um you know lower expenditures and and that's fine I'm used to that now and I'm going to put money in the bank I'm going to put money in the bank so in your body that's fat your fat is the bank and so your body is just saying yep we're we're just going to save we're going to save save save because that that sucked in that awful and we don't want to go through that again and if there's a downturn uh we don't want to be screwed so that's what your body's doing and so you need to show your body that you know it's uh that that times are good and that you're not going to um that you're not in a famine and your body can just actually you know release and say okay well maybe we can maybe we can buy that long Furniture okay well maybe now we can buy that new car like okay I guess things are okay we can buy that new house um it's uh you just have to you just have to coax your your system and your metabolism into being uh healthy again and just so that you do that by eating and and that's why people yo-yo die because they their metabolism goes down because they're starving themselves and they start eating anything else and then just slams back up um and so you know you just you want to do the opposite you want to encourage your metabolism so you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you're not eating anything you're just eating actual food actual meat and fat and uh you might put on a bit of weight at first but when your metabolism catches up and says okay we're happy now that will go away and and you can watch um people like uh Kelly Hogan she has a she has a YouTube channel and uh and uh and uh you know groups and things like that and she gained weight for the first you know six months that she went carnivore but her all of her health issues were healing dramatically and so she was like okay I trust the proc and everybody was telling her hey look just you know just stick with it your body just needs to heal and eventually you will start losing weight but you know you have to have to let your body heal and um you what they're talking about there is your hormones and your metabolism you know and that and you can track some of these to a certain extent um but things like leptin is a really good marker if that if that's elevated then it's going to be difficult for you to lose weight until that comes down but that will come down you're in ketogenic carnivore diet leptin will come down because High insulin blocks leptin fructose blocks leptin alcohol blocks leptin and you get leptin resistance and so you know you cut all those things out and your leptin will start coming down down down down down and eventually you'll get to a point where your body just says okay this is fine and you'll just start losing weight and that can take a couple months that can take six months it can take a year or more it it's usually not more than 6 months but you know everyone's coming from a different place so just keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good focus on your health first and foremost and how you're feeling and and um and then body composition next and then weight pretty much never because weight doesn't tell you anything about uh your health um or your body composition and so you know just just uh just focus on health the weight and the body composition will come with time uh but it can take longer for some people than others but uh good luck with it just stick with it and uh you'll do fine and and you know watch Kelly Hogan watch my interview with Kelly Hogan watch her videos she does videos on you know stubborn weight loss and things like that on a carnivore diet and and there's plenty of those out there as well you know some people just just lose weight more slowly which is frustrating when you're seeing 95% of people go on a carnivore die just just shedding weight like crazy some people don't and um you know just have to wait for your metabolism to to recover and that just comes from eating enough and eating the right stuff so good luck with that nav thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat that's very kind of you uh hi doc I V remember you mentioned something about eating steak and not ground beef because ground beef can be problematic for a reason uh what was that reason I'm eating only steak the past few days helps with lose stools um no no I'm I'm happy with ground beef ground beef's great you know um you know I guess some people report they say they have some sort of reaction whe be it histamines or or something else um you know I'm not 100% convinced that that's a thing but you know it's there's something you know people seem to be reacting to and so who cares you know if you're reacting to ground beef don't eat it and um or leftovers or whatever it doesn't matter just don't eat it but ground beef is great you know you just want you want to get the fattier ground beef and um but it's the same it's the same stuff it's the same cow you know it's just ground up because if from tougher parts of the cow you really can't sort of make into a roast or a or a steak and so you need to you need to just sort of grind it up so it um is uh is able to to ingest e more easily but um no there should shouldn't be anything wrong with with ground beef ground beef's great um so yeah um you know sometimes if you have ground beef more of the fat can render out especially if you're cooking it more well done and then you sort of lose a lot of the fat which isn't great um and then you're you can pour that rendered fat back on it but then some people have problems you know absorbing that and maybe that can go through them too quickly but um you know and so that can that can cause a bit of loose stools so people might have a problem with that but there but other than that I mean there's really nothing inherently wrong with with ground beef it's just you know how your body handles it and um and digest it how you cook it and if you're just cooking all the fat out you know that's you know that's a problem in and of itself but um no in general ground beef is great so yeah there's no no problem with ground beef carnivore clarity thank you very much for the Super Chat uh hi Dr C um does a rise in blood glucose after drinking milk have the same negative effects as honey fruit and other carbs thank you well the the rise in blood sugar if it's the same rise in blood sugar and insulin is the same rising blood sugar and Insulin so that's going to be a problem in and of itself um you know milk is going to have a lot of really good things in it with those carbs as well so you're getting positive benefits from those nutrients and the fats um honey has a lot more sugar it has fructose specifically fruit has fructose specifically fructose is is a worse carbohydrate than glucose and galactose which is what is in uh lactose that makes up lactose and so the fructose part of it I would say yes is worse um you know fruit can come with a bit of vitamin C and that can offset some of the fructose Honey comes with other things that are uh you know of some benefit as well but again a lot of fructose and glucose um they're going to have a lot more sugar the fruits and honey typically especially honey I mean honey is just is sugar with a bit of nutrients added to to it and uh and then other carbs other carbs are just going to come with other antinutrients they're going to come with other plant toxins and along with those carbohydrates but if you're if you're having enough to have the exact same blood sugar rise and the exact same insulin rise well that part of it's the same it's just what else comes with it everything else that comes with milk is pretty good for you so the casine can be a bit inflammatory people have some some issues with some of those other other um factors in there the ques Morphin can and make you sort of eat more than maybe you want to because it causes a bit of compulsive eating um and other than that it's just really good beneficial stuff especially raw milk is is really really good for you and um you know honey has more fructose so that's a problem same with fruit and uh and then other carbs rice and potatoes and things like that grains and night shades and things like that they're just going to have other oxalates and toxins and solonin and lectins and things like that that you don't want as well so if it's the same but if it's the same glucose rise it's the same glucose rise same insulin rise it's the same insulin rise and then it's just a matter of what else comes with it to make that better or worse overall Alex sain thank you for the Super Chat uh been carnivore two months doctor took me off uh testosterone because of high red blood cells my test is 174 and getting hot flashes um fatigue and should I get a new uh primary care physician uh yeah that's a bit that's a bit funny um well you know i' Wonder I'd wonder when they took you off I mean you really shouldn't just go straight off of it you know just you should have a weaning dose so your body can start of get used to starting to to produce it stuff again um when I have patients on Carnivore you know after you know 3 to six months they're they're even earlier than that but cly 3 to 6 months uh they can they can significantly improve their testosterone levels just on their own without going on any sort of testosterone and so you know it could very well be that your body can make a recovery if you're very low and you're symptomatic you know that's probably a bit inappropriate to take you off uh that quickly it should have had sort of a weaning dose it also depends on why you're on testosterone was there some sort of injury to your testicles that you really not able to produce testosterone properly or was this just that you're having sort of lower levels associated with aging and um I wanted to sort of get up to more youthful levels if it's the latter then your probably your body will probably recover and I've seen people come off of testosterone and actually get uh higher levels of testosterone subsequently like you know six months or so afterwards they come back in their testosterone levels are higher than they were on the testosterone which is pretty amazing but you know if you've had an actual injury and um and hurt yourself then you know and and your and your testicles aren't really capable of of uh you know meeting that demand then you know they may not they may not be able to come back online um you know high red blood cells you know I mean how high and and you know if your if your testosterone levels are in the normal range then then it's probably not that causing the high red blood cells so you know you can always get uh you can always get a different uh blood test and and check and see like okay well what are my red cells doing well they're still up even though my testosterone is down so that's probably not it you know it could be that you went carnivore and your your B12 and folate and all these other sorts of things and iron started improving and so your body just started making more blood cells and that's normal for you um or it could be something else going on but it's not necessarily just testosterone especially if you were in normal ranges and you weren't too high I mean what you do there is you just lower the dose if it's too high you don't just completely take somebody off of it and have their testosterone levels bottom out um especially in that that shock to the system where you just stop it all together and you smash to the ground so um I would uh yeah I you know yeah maybe get a SE second opinion or maybe go back to them and just say say hey I feel like garbage and uh this isn't really helping and my testosterone level is way too low now uh what can we do it's it's fair enough to go back to the same person and just say hey there's a problem if if your doctor does something and and says hey this is what I think we're going to try and and you don't go back to them and say hey there's a problem then they assume there is no problem because there're they assume they're going to hear from you because just like Hey we're going to do this and let's see how it goes and you didn't come back and say hey there's a problem so they don't think there's a problem they're not going to follow up with you they're not going to chase up and say hey you know what happened how do you feel uh they should you know but that's usually what return appointments are it's like okay let's do this and I'll see you again in a month and see how you're doing um that's usually a good way to do it but um you know you need to go back and tell them that there's a problem and um you know and and then just say Hey look it's um maybe go on a more graduated reduction because like this is this has gone to this has gone sort of too far the other way I think in time unless you've had an actual injury uh that will stop you from being able to um make testosterone probably properly you will you will probably make start making normal amounts of testosterone again and that that's what most people do but you know it could be that your body's not able to do that in which case you you might need to take something long term um and so yeah I think that's maybe a bit Overkill you know taking off completely just because that you know red blood cells went up a bit especially if your testosterone levels were normal right if you're too high sure bring it down but you know testosterone level of 174 is not normal you know that's that's quite low actually so um yeah I would go back and talk to them and if and if they're not really uh very approachable and not really wanting to hear it then you know yeah get a second opinion it's um you know definitely definitely your right to do that it's your body it's your life it's your health and um and if someone's not really helping you then you're able to you're allowed to go to someone else and and ask their opinion as well that's fair Steve Larch thank you for the Super Chat uh 225 days carnivore omad very good body compet composition changed dramatically uh awesome only lost six pounds some belly fat um should I decrease the amount of meat until my goal and no I wouldn't really because you know that's going to go back to what what we were talking about before whereas like you reduce the amount you bring it in like yeah you'll lose weight but you also slow down your metabolism especially if you do it too quickly you know when people are going for like body composition um uh competitions right so they're doing like bodybuilding and trying to get down to like you know you know three four% body fat they um even when they're doing carnivore sort of things they'll they'll sort of slowly reduce a bit a bit a bit a bit a bit but do very very slowly and um because if you do it more quickly then you're actually going to uh trash your metabolism and as soon as you start eating more again yeah you're going to put on more fat right so um you know what I think is the best way to do it is just again you just do the same thing now as you're going to do in 20 years eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good eat once a day if that's all you need eat twice a day if you need to especially if you're working out um and so I don't think you need to to restrict like that I mean if you're getting ready for a competition and you need to sort of you know uh speed up the process you can do that but it's it's going to cost you on the other side it's going to slow down your metabolism a bit and then you're going to put that weight back on when you start eating again and um you know so I I don't think that's a great a great way to do it um and and the thing is too you're talking about your body composition changed dramatically that's great so you know you only lost six pounds who cares you know I I I don't I don't want to lose weight I don't want to be less of a you know of a person I just want to have low body fat percentage and and good musculature that's what I want muscle is more dense than fat and so putting on a small volume of muscle equates to a larger volume of fat and so if you're only losing six pounds but you put on muscle then you've lost a lot more than six pounds of fat and that's why your body composition has changed so um you know you can you can you can alter how much you're eating to get down to your goal but you're going to do it at the expense of your metabolism and you're going to then put it back on afterwards so maybe not what you want to do you know you're trying to get you down into a slim suit to go to high school reunion or something like that you okay do what you got to do but you know I don't think it's it's good long term um I think exercise is very key weight training resistance training the strength training sprinting that high intensity interval training so hit training so sprinting hard as you can for as long as you can then you rest you catch your breath you do it again and you just do that you know running sprinting Hills lifting weights all these sorts of things those are fantastic workouts for you they will have you put on muscle they will make you use your muscles which makes you use your fat and so you train fasted and you sprint and you lift weights and you do it until muscle fatigue and exhaustion or temporary muscle fatigue and exhaustion and and by doing that you'll you'll lose more uh fat if you can play a sport that's fantastic you know these high-intensity Sports where you're really pushing yourself and you know realize it but you're you're spending hours running and sprinting and doing those sorts of things it's it's a lot easier to get into really good shape when you're doing a sport than if you're just okay I'm just going to do Sprint relays for the next three hours that is just mind-numbingly boring and it's awful and you're just you know it's terrible you know if I'm you know if I I make a break and I'm sprinting and trying to you know outpace people to score a try like I'm G to work hard as I can without even thinking about it and I get to the end I'm like oh my God okay that was that was hard work or I'm chasing someone because they've made a break and I'm like I've got to catch this guy you know you're not thinking about how hard you're working you're just working as hard as you can and um and so you can go a lot longer and a lot harder because you're distracted and you're doing something else that you're that you're focusing on and um it's a lot easier to do that it's a lot easier to work hard when you're in that sort of situation than if you're just you just doing sprints on a on a track you know it just it just is at least for me anyway um so that's what I would do I just focus more on on the exercise side of things weight training and sprinting to try to get your body composition where you want it and uh just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good yeah um okay let me see how many super chats we've got we've got probably got enough here [Music] um I've got about 50 minutes um so why don't we yeah why don't we cut off the super chats now and we'll try to get through everything that we can and um and then if we can open them back up we can if we go through if the questions are more quick uh or we can just sort of answer other questions as well that people have asked that aren't super chats okay so um a or Ally thank you for the Super Chat can carnivore cause uh fluid pimple like on hands that are itchy shouldn't sounds like you're sort of reacting to something other something that's in your environment something's sitting on your hands uh possibly something that you're eating uh but it's not going to be you know meat that does that it's just um you know um it's just uh you know you're react you know that that sounds like something that you're reacting to fluid pimples like on the hands I mean yeah so it you have to sort of see it but I mean you know something like that you could you know I mean you look like I mean things like shingles and and those sorts of things that can be those nasty little itchy horrible things on your hands it could be something like that it could be like an actual you know viral sort of rash uh infection sort of thing that you maybe get checked out by your doctor um it could have nothing to do with carnivore at all um and uh yeah so I would I would check that out probably get someone to take a look look at that um carnivore shouldn't cause that wouldn't cause that you know if you're reacting to something having like a sort of a weird allergic reaction to something then sure you can get weird rashes um but uh you know fluid filled pimple like sort of things that sort of sounds you know uh different and so that's something you should probably just get checked out and and maybe you go on some antivirals or something like that and um and that clears it up but uh no carnivore won't won't do that hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys okay horge RM thank you for the Super Chat did did carnivore for three weeks lost 13 pounds of the first week very cool felt okay then after that felt great uh wondering how long it would take H for significant testosterone level increases um it it's individual but uh I I regularly see uh I I I test people first when they come in you know try to get him on a carnivore diet and uh and then check him again sort of six to eight weeks later and typically I see a significant Improvement in testosterone in that time so you know I'd say you know give it two months and uh and check your testosterone levels again and see how you go uh it's very important how you take testosterone and all your tests really but testosterone is is in particular you need to take it first thing in the morning because you get your your hit of testosterone first thing in the morning like when you wake up or just before you wake up and uh and then it spikes up and then it goes down right so if you T Test your testosterone in the afternoon or midday it's going to be lower than if it if you had checked it that first thing in the morning so check it first thing in the morning between 8 and 9:00 a.m. fasting from the night before 12:00 p.m or sorry 900 p.m and you only drink water after that only drink water in the morning no coffee tea cigarettes heroin anything no food either in the morning um until after your no medications either until after your uh your blood test and then no exercise stress or sexual activity for 48 hours before you take your blood test all those things can affect how your uh testosterone levels come out and all your other blood tests come out and if you're taking supplements like B vitamins that contain biotin biotin is a b vit vitamin this in most multivitamins or B vitamin complexes that can disrupt your hormonal panels as well so you need to stop taking those uh for three days before you do three to five days before you uh take your blood panel so all those things matter um so yeah just wait wait two months and then Tech test your uh testosterone in that way and uh you'll probably see an improvement but you'll probably see an improvement after that as well so you know just if you don't see a big jump right away just you know wait another few months and and see how you go as well lifting weights sprinting proper sleep all will help as well and uh chronic cardio and just long prolonged cardio can actually dampen your testosterone levels as well so just keep that in mind as well Damian Williams thank you very much for the Super Chat good evening my Tad poll uh comment last time was an example of a species where individual members have different optimal diets half the group is herbivore and the other uh have cannibalistic or carnivore well it's interesting because you know like like you said you know um under different conditions they can eat different things and then uh when those conditions change the vegetarian ones die off but the cannibalistic ones carnivore ones actually survive so is it really optimal they may eat different things but is that optimal sometimes you know you have to eat just to survive you eat certain things because you have to because you're not you're not one of the bigger stronger tadpoles that can eat the other tadpoles and uh and bugs and things like that maybe you have to eat these other things in order to survive but is that optimal is that the best that they could ever do you know just because they do eat it doesn't mean that's the best thing that they could ever eat uh but that's uh but that's a good good thought as well yeah uh but you know just by your own example when you mentioned that it uh you know what you said I don't I don't I don't study tadpoles so I don't know but um the uh but from what you said that when the conditions change when then the conditions worsen or Haren the uh the the herbivorous ones died out and the cannibalistic ones survived so wouldn't that be optimal I would probably argue that it is so um but yeah it is interesting that they they would eat different things but it could just very well be because they're not they're not capable of getting uh their more optimal diet and that happens and you know and that's a survival advantage that absolutely is a survival advantage in humans you know we've been able to eat plants and survive more so than lion like a lion if it doesn't get a kill it's dead if a crocodile doesn't get a kill it's dead you know and uh but that's not the case for us we can survive and so 100% that's a survival Advantage but that doesn't mean that it's optimal it doesn't mean it's the absolute best thing for our physiology and that's an important distinction tulip oare thank you very much for the Super Chat uh how do you feel about taking herbal tinctures and medications like ashwagandha valaran Etc even though they have plant toxins I I typically don't um you know it depends on and you know it any medicine should be only taken medically you don't take antibiotics every day take Augmentin every day just because you know oh but it has antibacterial effects yeah that's the entire point and it can kill all the the gut floor and and U and things that you want there and cause a bunch of side effects you don't take medications every day just because uh you take food every day just because and but you don't need medicine every day if you have a specific health issue and concern that that can help with sure I mean we've using herbal Herbal Remedies and and um plants medic ly for thousands of years at the least and you know that's fine you know if you have that illness because you do get the bad with the good and so you get the good results you know if you have a specific issue like you have an infection you know you take this and it helps you clear that infection great but you wouldn't take that otherwise because it does have other effects that are negative and other things that are bad for you like these different plant toxins and and really realistically the medicine side of things are the plant toxins and so those plant toxins are killing more bacteria and fungus then they are killing you and so it's it's a net benefit but if you're not if you don't have a bacterial infection or a fungal infection and you take that poison that's going to kill them it's also going to hurt you and you're not getting any benefit from it so it's the plant toxins that actually are acting medically in those certain circumstances because the definition of a medicine is a toxin that under certain circumstan es confers more benefit than harm but outside of those conditions it's only conferring the harm so you know you need to be careful about that so if you have some specific health issue that you're taking that for that can help with go for it I mean I think it's probably going to be safer to take an actual medicine where they've extracted out the active ingredient that actually does what you want and and doesn't bring along with it all the the negative stuff as well because you know again you do take you do get the good with the bad you know and so you don't want that you just want the good and that's what that's what pills provide but again you don't take medicine unless you have a specific illness Sydney K thank you very much for the Super Chat uh can you talk a bit about doing carnivore while pregnant any supplementation to include no you don't have to supplement anything you just you just need to make sure that you know the the meat that you're eating is know it's good quality that you're getting enough fat it's very important for that baby in the growing brain and uh I would I would uh probably include a couple ounces of liver every day just to make sure that you're getting everything you need all the B12 and folate and d and and um you know all the different uh Myriad nutrients that are much more abundant in liver you don't need to go crazy you don't have to have you know pounds of liver a day or even a week just um you know a few ounces today and uh while you're pregnant because your body has a much higher demand for these nutrients and you know grass-finished beef is great but it's not as good as you know grain finish beef is great but it's not as good as as grass finished and it's not as good as regenerative it's not as good as wild it's not as good as these other sorts of things and so you want to make sure that and the soil isn't the same as it was you know even 50 years ago so you want to make sure that you're getting all the nutrients you need and and liver does that you know some people uh need a bit more folate you know they have MTHFR something like that and so maybe they won't get as much folate as they need for muscle me most people do you know when I check people's folate levels it's almost always you know in good ranges uh when they're on a carnivore diet just like their B12 is and some aren't and so you know you just need to be aware of that and those people you know you take in some liver you're fine there are people that argue that you don't even need folate as long as you have enough B12 but you know when you're talking about a baby maybe you know I'm not I'm not taking any chances with that just eat some damn liver and get your fight up and um and make sure your fight's up so those the sorts of things there's nothing anything particularly special that you have to do I would just make sure that the quality of meat that you're eating is meeting your nutritional demands and so if you you want to take a you know prenatal vitamin fine um be you know a Li you know liver is is a multivitamin it's it's Nature's multivitamin and so I would at least do that you know if you want to take some some other vitamins things like that to cover your bases you know you can uh liver will cover it you know and so just eating a lot of fatty meat eating till it stops tasting good having a couple ounces of liver a day Raw Liver is great too that's something that Adele Davis who's probably one of the only nutritionists uh that uh uh I I've ever respected not really but uh she she had a lot of she got a lot of things right you know back working with very very little information and and just having to try to figure things out on her own so she's actually um has quite a lot of good information but you know some things I sort of look at that and go like yeah well we you know sort of like that one didn't didn't uh you know uh La you know age well but things like liver I mean she was a big fan of of liver and raw liver as well especially for pregnant women and breastfeeding women it's just super nutritious and it's going to be really really good for you and the baby so um I would I would look into that and raw liver tastes a thousand times better than cooked liver so word of the wise I don't even like cooked liver but I will eat raw liver that stuff's good I've got some in the fridge I'm G to eat it today uh Vladimir thank you very much for the Super Chat uh what are your thoughts on uh row grass ground beef um I'm having it 2 lbs a day plus 20 row eggs um I don't really know what row grass ground beef is um or row eggs either um regeneratively raised I don't know uh a day and feel amazing uh carnivore for one year Row for two weeks row I really don't know what the hell row is raw are we are we saying raw um BR is fine as long as it's not um as long as it's [Music] um you were saying like fish Tes but no it's not it's not fish Tes because that's um it's saying row grass ground beef you know so that's um you know fish row obviously but uh I mean row eggs that could be it but um but not row grass grass-fed beef so maybe raw maybe we're talking about raw here not too sure Ross fine as long as there's no contaminants and things like that you know if there's contamination there's bacteria on it you could get um a problem with that if you're eating uh it with uh you know and you haven't drank water in the last few hours then your your your stomach acid will be much more concentrated and you can s clear up a lot of bacteria so you probably um be able to kill more bacteria than than if you uh weren't in that situation but uh you do that's that's the only major thing you have to be careful maybe you can comment and see are you talking about raw or you talking about something else because I'm not I'm not too sure what what row grass ground beef would be um so maybe if you can comment that we can take a look at that but uh yeah that's my idea thought on Raw anyway [Music] um so here is's the question from X from Princess uh parasia switching from vegan to carnivore last year I lost weight really fast now I look like the carnivore version of the OIC effect any way to fix this well first of all thank you very much for being open-minded enough to you know try something so different polar opposite from what you were doing before going from V vegan to carnivore the vast majority of people that follow me on YouTube and social media uh were in that position they were either plant-based or even full vegan and then you know because of health reasons um or just because you know there's the same motivations you you want to be healthy you want to do the right thing for your body and the planet and um and so you go vegan for those reasons and then you start coming across things like maybe actually it's the opposite maybe I was I was told a bunch of Lies by um uh people with special interests and so um vested interests so um you know good for you for trying that you know other people have gone plant-based to carnivore maybe comment and see what um uh uh maybe you know comment and and let us know what your experien has been with that as well and how you felt on you know uh on vegan or plant-based versus carnivore that' be very interesting for a lot of people to see um as far as the OIC effect Lo losing weight if you're losing more weight than you than you think you want or is healthy you just need to eat more you need to eat more fatty meat until it stops tasting good and it's it's very different you know you're not eating like oh I can stop here so I should stop there no you want to eat until it just you get a bite that sort of tastes like cardboard and just go like yeah I don't really want to keep going anymore uh because you can actually listen to your satiety signals now you can listen to your your body and if your body's telling you to keep eating and it still tastes good then you should listen to that and keep eating if you are only eating fatty meat and if you are only eating water you mix that up you start adding in even Dairy that can sort of change that up and make you eat more than your body actually wants so but uh listen to that listen to your body keep eating until fatty meat stops tasting good and you'll be able to put on on lean body mass and you won't lose too much weight and um yeah thanks for thanks for giving it a try I'm glad that you lost lost weight and that you're hopefully feeling better too make sure you're eating enough it is really easy to undereat on a carnivore diet and you can lose more weight than you need than you want to so don't do that make sure you're getting enough and uh and you'll do fine Tony Vargas thank you for the Super Chat can you explain how hormones affect fat storage and how sugar is sugar is sugar is sugar uh you're a beast yeah hit the like and share it thanks Tony appreciate that uh yeah well I mean look you know it's you know calories are important but they're not the most important factor there you know if you uh don't have insulin you cannot store any of the calories that you eat oh my God but the you know the first rule Thermo first law of thermodynam first law of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems where things cannot go in or out so you're saying there is x amount of energy in this system that cannot be created or destroyed fine we're not a closed system we breathe we spit we pee we defecate we eat things are coming in things are going out all the time and so that's the definition of a open system and so the planet is uh more in keeping with with a closed system but it's still not a closed system there's still inputs and outputs as well um but if you get energy in your body you say oh but it can't be destroyed so it has to be if it's not used then it's going to go into your fat no people pee it out that's where diabetes metis comes from diabetes lot of pee metis sweet so sweet tasting urine because you're peeing out glucose so that's energy that's energy that you're not storing you're peeing it out and your ketones go way up you go diabetic keto acidosis ketones way up glucose way up and you're peeing them both out right so look at that you know you're not destroying energy and yet you're not storing it either because you can't because if you do not have insulin you cannot grow your fat cells you cannot you cannot store uh fat insulin is the fat storage hormone and so without it without the effects of insulin you're you're not you're not storing fat so um calories while they are necessary they're not sufficient to put on fat right and so if you have a type 1 diabetic that doesn't make any insulin they it doesn't matter how much they eat they cannot put on weight they they waste a away until they die they can't put on muscle they can't put on fat they just they just waste away until they die and uh they me they could eat 50,000 calories a day they could 50 million calories a day doesn't matter they will not store any of it and they won't be able to uh survive without insulin so it doesn't matter how many calories you eat if your hormones are out of balance and if your hormones are out of balance doesn't matter what you eat you're going to start storing fat so people have something called an insulinoma that is a tumor that secretes insulin it doesn't matter what these people eat they get enormously obese very quickly and um and if feel horrible and wretched everything put in their body that just gets stored into fast they have horrible energy their metabolism is so slow the higher your insulin the lower your metabolism and so you just you feel horrible and lethargic and tired and miserable and um you know and you're just getting fatter and fatter and fatter it's just you know it's it's really uh not fun and then you get that thing cut out and just and just shrink right back down you know so it's um you know it's very much dependent on your hormones and you know and that's just something that that you just understand you know there's some things that are more insulinogenic so you eat carbohydrates it slams up your insulin because high blood sugar is toxic high blood sugar kills people this is what kills diabetics this is what makes your toes rot and fall off and then your get your foot amputated then your legs and then your kidneys start to fail then your eyes start to fail and then your heart starts to fail and you get Alzheimer's and your brain starts to fail and you get this high blood sugar is damaging your vessels and you that's damaging the blood supply to different part parts of your body to your eyes and your retina to your kidneys to your feet to your brain all these sorts of things and to your heart you're building up atherosclerosis and and more damage and more damage and you and you die that comes from high blood sugar right one extra gram of blood sugar and we're eating hundreds of grams of blood sugar and your body's going oh my God it's trying to keep just trying to keep your your blood sugar under four grams and you and you're just eating 400 grams and you're like what the hell do you think that was going to do right so this is just desperately trying to get this the hell out and it raises insulin as a result insulin affects over a hundred different mechanisms in your body right so just saying that oh well your blood sugar goes up and your and your insulin goes up and that just drives energy into cells oh that's what it's supposed to do no it's not it's supposed to do that down here a physiological levels but you're up here it's super physiological levels it's going out of balance now if the only thing it was doing was driving energy into cells that would be one thing but it's not it has over a hundred different mechanisms that it affects in the body and the brain and so by raising your blood sugar and raising your insulin you are now elevating your insulin so it's affecting everything at this elevated level and everything's out of balance it actually causes a lot of harm but it's so important for your body to keep your blood sugar under four grams because you die otherwise you know given time that uh it's willing to screw up those 100 plus different mechanisms in your body by jacking up your insulin it's that important so you know the idea that you you just you know that this doesn't matter and that these hormones don't matter you just eat whatever the hell you want as long as you keep your calories down is uh it's it's just really ignorant of the facts and it's it actually hurts people you know and that's a fact you people say oh well you know um you people all the time it's like well I'm cutting calories I'm eating less I'm eating less I'm just I can't I can't lose weight and then people just call them Liars like oh that's lying you're a liar you're not in a calorie deficit like no you're just an idiot you don't understand understand how the body works and you don't know what biochemistry is now some of these idiots say they have degrees in Biochemistry or have taken biochemistry they clearly weren't paying attention or they just you know flirted with the teacher or something like that or went to a shitty school but they did not understand biochemistry and they do not understand its application in medicine and weight loss so uh yeah hormones matter uh calories matter too hormones matter more uh Fred thank you very much for the Super Chat uh Missing the question of bacteria fungus and viruses in your speech uh plants aren't the problem alone uh well look I mean there's there's whole bunches of things that obviously affect us you know positively or negatively the um the you know the idea with the plants are trying to kill you I mean it's just it's just pointing out that there are more things out there that can cause harm and that we should be aware of that but yeah certainly you know viruses and fungi and bacteria and all these sorts of things um do play a significant role not maybe as much of a role in our diet which is you know sort of what I what I speak about just say hey what what inputs are you putting into your body and those do affect bacteria fungus and viruses as well because when you're putting the right inputs in your body and your immune system works well then you you're able to fight off uh all of these you know opportunistic uh sort of infections as well and your body just is just healthier and you you you know weather the storm of all these uh uh would be a salts um much uh you know much more uh appropriately so you know all these things do matter of course and and you know our diet is just one part of the big puzzle of overall good health you want to get outside you want to be in the sun you want to have good you know Family Social connections you want to bond with people and animals and and and the world around you and you want to get proper sleep you want to reduce stress you want to exercise all these things are insanely important um but it's um you know so it is important to remember this is one part of the of the bigger picture um but you know it's just really talking about like food that you're eating can be harmful or beneficial and so understanding which ones are actually harmful and beneficial is really important because they've said that plants are all good and that meat is all bad and that saturated fat is always bad and cholesterol is always bad and it's exactly the opposite and so that's that's the main point uh that I try to make with my videos is uh is that that of nutrition Mrs meat suit thank you very much for the Super Chat uh uh hubs is having gallbladder issues told it needs to come out as near constant pain and sludge no Stones can the gallbladder heal itself or is surgery the only way thanks for all your wisdom uh yeah it can heal itself I mean you know there there is a point at which it's you know not going to and you could get into an acute situation where it's very inflamed and damaged or ruptures or something like that you have to get surgery um but no there are a lot of people that uh improve their uh symptomatic gallbladder issues even when they have stones and they go uh carnivore and they eat a lot of fat you know that sludge is concentrated and uh very concentrated bile is now forming precipitates right it's forming crystals right and then those stones are you know bigger crystals so why does it do that because you're not eating enough fat if you're not eating enough fat then you're just going to sit there and it's going to sit there and concentrate more and more because you're not expressing it out to go and absorb that fat so you need to eat fat you know at a certain point you're going to get stones and they're going to be too big and you're not going to pass them and they're going to get stuck and you're going to get hurt if you're still in the bile sludge phase though you could you could absolutely pass those out and and not have an issue with them um but it might be a bit sore and painful because of things inflamed sorry my voice is throat's getting a little dry but um yeah but you know with the with the sludge side of things if you're still just in the sludge phase he can definitely uh recover from that well he he can recover from that not to say that he necessarily will recover from that you know there could be could be problems that necessitates surgery but if it's not an acute emergency and he's not sick and unwell and and having a problem that it's just like look this is just this is a matter of urgency then you know then there then there's time to think about it you know and um and try a high fat carnivore diet and you know give his body a chance to recover and if that symptoms go away and the sludge clears up and his and his gallbladder calms down great if needs to get it taken out if it sort of becomes an emergency situation and he has to do it uh that's fine too you know you can do cornivore without a gallbladder you just need to split up your fatty meals throughout the day and and most people actually form a pseudo gallbladder which is an out pouching of the common bod duct and that actually acts as a as a as a gall gallbladder you can get stones in them too I believe and um and uh and so that can that can allow you to eat sort of more one meal a day big fatty meal at one time and um you know and so but if not then you just split up the fatty meal throughout the day you still eat the same amount same amount of fat just do it in five meals instead of one or two and uh and that can be fine but uh no I I think it's well worth giving it a try unless he's in in a place where it's just like look this is an emergency in your life is at risk you needed surgery get the damn surgery but um other than that um other than that um it's uh you know you have time and uh rosin doesn't like me fidgeting with the mic well too bad rosin so uh Southpaw Jack thank you very much for the Super Chat uh Dr chaffy from your experienced perspective what are your thoughts on pursuing academic degree in this field with the amount of brainwashing in the education system today God bless um you know yeah it's it's it's interesting isn't it you know people pay a lot of attention to the letters after your name and they say well you're not a nutritionist you don't get to say this and then you say something oh well you're not you're a nutritionist but you're not a doctor you're not allowed to say it's just like shut up they're just G to make an excuse no matter what you do you know uh you you will get um you know people that put a lot of credence on your you on on your your titles and things like that you know there there will be some beneficial things that that can come from degrees like this and you get a degree in Biochemistry bi biochemistry really is neut nutrition and um you get like a you know or like a master's in nutritional biochemistry that's going to be a much more rigorous uh examination of um of how our bodies work under certain nutrient um uh nutritional you know demands and things like that and um uh you know but just keeping that that that open mind and understanding and you know that that they might not have all the answers and that they uh you know are you know influenced by you know different Industries and and and people that may um not not be as accurate as it as it could be so there are people doing this and there are people still getting nutritional degrees and um and then saying okay I have a qualification I'm a I'm a qualified nutritionist and this is all [\u00a0__\u00a0] and uh you know and uh and and go this other way and you can you can structure your practice any way you want you I mean if you want to be a nutritionist in a hospital probably you know going to be bit difficult because you you sort of have to you sort of have to follow the textbook when you're in in the hospital setting um or you can you can sort of you know lose your job and uh so you You' probably have to be an independent nutritionist and and set up your own practice as a as a you know an online sort of you know health coach or nutritionist and things like that and then and then do what you think is actually beneficial and then you uh you know you work with your clients and patients and you see what works you know and then you say yeah okay this is what I was taught and it doesn't really work that well and this is what you know I've learned on my own and this actually works a lot better and that's what you do and that's what everybody should do that's what hypocrates said you know 2 200 years ago you don't just do things to do them you know you do what works you you do the things that work for your patients and so if you're getting told well but this is what the study says this is what the guidelines says and you're seeing it hurt people you are um you know you are under ethical obligation to not do that and to do the thing that you're seeing that works and so I see my patients they do massively better on a carnivore diet it it would be unethical and immoral of me to do anything else because I can see the difference I'm not blind to that and so you know this this not this is not a small difference this a massive massive difference and I see it every time and I say hey superi your Bloods they're off this is because you're eating X Y and Z and if you if you cut out all that and just eat fatty meat this is what will change and in two months later they all change that way and they feel amazing they've lost weight and most people lose weight uh early on some people take longer and and they just feel amazing they're like everything you're saying work you know was true I'm coming off medications I don't need any of these things anymore you know coming off testosterone coming off HRT coming off blood pressure medications coming off diabetes medications they're reversing autoimmunity they're reversing diabetes um you know it's like like you you can't ethically do anything else once you see that and uh and you're not supposed to that's part of the the the um the original teachings of hypocrates was to um was to to not just do things and then they were talking about you know like praying to Apollo and all that sort of stuff no you need to do things that work you to do things that you see work right and so you know we're back praying to Apollo we're praying to the guidelines we're praying to the you know the the nutritional studies I mean it's nonsense you know it's like no you need to do what works so you work with your patients and you do what works and if something that you're doing isn't really working well and you try something else and it works better you do that thing you do that other thing and then and then maybe you publish on it and try to get other people aware of this you know which is what we're trying to do now you know in the carnivore Community but you still do it you know I mean there's there's plenty of information there's plenty of of um of evidence to to show that this is the right way to eat and this is going to help People's Health in a number of ways and when you do it and you see the dramatic effect it has on people's Health you can't just oh well that but the guideline screw the guidelines you know the guidelines are a guideline they're there if you have no freaking clue what you're doing you just follow this this path that someone's laid out for for you until you you know get you know get out of diapers and can actually you know think for yourself and um and that's fine you know having having a guideline when you're really new when you just you need to follow something so you follow the guidelines and then you learn better you go like yeah okay that was cute but you know training wheels are off now I'm going Offroad you know and I'm gonna get the job done and um and that's what you do so you know it can be a bit frustrating but there are people going through it and you just keep that in mind like well that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] that's bull [\u00a0__\u00a0] I mean I did that in medical school I look back at my old notes and like I I know they're my notes because there's all the like snarky smartass comments well that's under some something that the the lecture said like well that's complete [\u00a0__\u00a0] and this is why and there's a link for something and all this other sorts of stuff and um you know you just have that in mind you know that that your your professors don't always know everything um no one knows everything um there's not a single human being ever in human history that has ever known even one person % of the totality of human knowledge it's not possible there just way too much and anybody who thinks they just know everything knows even less um you know as Thomas Soul said it's uh it takes a lot of knowledge to understand just how ignorant we are we are and so if you think oh no no I just know everything you are even more ignorant than that you don't even have enough knowledge to understand how ignorant you are and so you know just understand that that that you know just you know they may not know everything you keep your own counsel listen to what they have to say and apply the things that you think are correct and are going to help people and um and be that from from your formal teaching or from uh you know from your own studies you know that's the important thing is when as you're a professional you do your own research and you do your own study and you are a researcher and you're furthering the boundaries of human understanding you know people saying that oh you just have to stay in this box and oh no one no one's allowed to question anything no one well then there's no progress there's no you will never progress anywhere in our understanding of anything no no no you just have to stay here and just do what you're no F off uh that's that's just that's wholly ignorant and um and uh just they don't understand what it means to be uh a professional and an adult you know you always question things you always push the boundaries that's how you push the boundaries by questioning the where those boundaries are set right and um and that's what you do so you but yeah there's a lot of brainwashing and um you know you could you could certainly get through it but it might be frustrating to to go through that um but people do you know put put stake in that so it depends on what you want to do with your career you know if you want to be a nutritionist or or um have an academic degree in in you know in something else you know you can you can do that become a professional and then and then push your way it's a bit of was a bit weird if you're going for an academic uh position you know it's publisher Parish you know you've got to publish a lot of stuff and um you know early on if you're if you're sort of you know Making Waves early on it may be more difficult to get published than to get tenure and so some people say well I'll start making waves when I have tenure and usually by that point theyve been in their career for 10 15 years and they and they're just so used to just Towing the line that they never they never push any boundaries so you know it's a difficult one but um you know I think you just you just you know get the degree that you think is going to is going to help your life and your understanding of the world and uh and help you in your career and um and then you push boundaries and you push back on people and you try to you know show with you know good evidence uh you know how the world really works and um unfortunately we have to do that through the systems that are at the moment but there there's still a lot of good information that you can learn in these institutions and um you know and then you can help undo some of the misinformation as well from the inside so that's that's something to be uh yeah so that's that's a good thing too cus hikes or cusac hi Mike thank you for the Super Chat uh hey Doc do you have any suggestions on how to have a carnivore food how to have carnivore food prepared for a family of five two jobs in school sports to deal with yeah uh roasts are really good you you put a roast in the oven in the morning at like a low heat you know at like 170 degrees uh Fahrenheit you know that's the you know that's not going to burn or Scorch or anything like that just slow roast it cook it over the end of over the day you know put in the beginning you know it's good to have someone at home with that you don't want to leave the oven on um uh with people not there just for you know safety reasons but um if uh if you're able to do that you know just put a roast in the morning everyone comes home you have this big roast for the family at the end of the day um you know eggs you know in the morning you know steak and eggs in the morning um you know you can you know chop up steaks send it to to people with uh for lunch but you know typically when if you're eating a lot of carnivore high fat carnivore diet you don't need to eat three times a day you know Growing Kids and things like that you know maybe a bit more um and then um there's like just a bunch of food a night you know so roasts are really good because it's a lot of meat in one go and you sort of you know see how much your your family needs and then the next morning you know you have the leftovers you chop those up you fry those up with some eggs eat that for breakfast you typically don't need lunch or maybe that becomes your lunch the next day or your kids lunch and um uh yeah I mean that that's that's uh pretty much it you know it's the same as it's the same as everything else but roasts are a good idea when you're when you're feeding families because they're they're cheaper they're easier because you're just cooking one big thing in a go uh and they just sit there you just put it in the oven it just just sits there and um and so those are good options as well and then the leftovers the next day or or breakfast and lunch you know add in some eggs things like that those are pretty good good options as well you know for us we you know maybe have some eggs in the morning I don't really eat breakfast um if I'm working out more I might you know but I I just typically just will cook up a steak steaks take only a few minutes to cook air fryers are really easy as well but you have a big family five you don't want to cook everything in an air fryer because it actually will take too long but like for an individual just to just cook up a steak real quick air fryer is great um and um you know and uh and so then we'll you know cook and you know cook a steak for everybody maybe cook some eggs for everybody and uh have some other sorts of you know know fat chopped up and cooked up and things like that on the side and uh any leftovers become lunch the next day typically you know or uh or or those sorts of things yeah I think that's that's pretty um pretty good way to do it anyway and um uh so yeah hopefully that helps uh IO 80 thank you very much for the Super Chat why asking is carnivore Diet safe for her with gallbladder taken out doctor says no when do we stop listening to the doctors um yeah there's a lot of gallbladder questions today I've noticed um like in the super chats and the normal chats and um yeah of course it is you know I mean like you uh you you make bile in your liver you don't make it in your gallbladder um I don't know why the doctor would say no it's a good question to ask them it's like okay why it's it's it's really is a fair question asking why is is fair you know and and um you it doesn't have to be you know uh confronting you have well why you know uh I mean you could if they're just being ass about it but um say you know is that safe no no no it's not without a gallbladder okay okay why why is that they're not going to have a good answer you know because you make bile from your liver it's stored in the gallbladder and um and is concentrated so that if you don't eat every day or every few days you have you have more concentrated bile so that you can absorb a big bolus of fat in one go because you need the fat that's very important and so it's um you know it's you still make the bile and it and it still goes into your intestine you just need to split up the fatty meals throughout the day but you'll still you'll still make bile and uh and that's good you want to make B because you need fat you have to have fat you die without fat and so you know it's just you may not be able to eat a big fatty meal in one go U because you might not absorb all the fat and you'll just get diarrhea so you just eat split up those fatty meals throughout the day and um and and then you might form a pseudo gallbladder a lot of people do form a pseudo gallbladder and that makes and that works just like a gallbladder and then you just eat once a day twice a day as you see fit so yeah you can 100% do carnivore as a with a gallbladder taken out and there there are thousands of people tens of thousands of people doing it right now I'm sure there's probably people in this chat right now watching this video we've done that so you know please do if you have your gallbladder out please tell us your experience with with uh carnivore and uh and how that works and and help uh reassure this gentleman and his wife uh netti uh nety Daniel thank you very much for the Super Chat I have incredible pain in my body since beginning that's not good I know this is part of it but can I do anything to help I work out daily well yeah I I most people actually improve their pain symptoms and they reduce inflammation they increase your ketones which also reduces inflammation and their pain typically gets better um if you're having pain from with withdrawals then unfortunately you just have to sort of weit it out um you know if Tylenol or Advil helps and you know great um just eat a lot of fatty meat a lot of fatty meat and if it is withdrawals then you know it it should get out of your body in the next sort of you know two three weeks and uh and hopefully hopefully it does um also depends on you know sort of what is causing the pain of course you know if you have a bit of an injury and you're working out and that's exacer things and you know a good idea to rest and just let your body recover but if you have sort of overall generalized paain and you think that's something to do with with withdrawals then you know just uh just eat as much fatty me as you can try to you know rest if you need to and and hopefully it sort of goes away because that's that that is abnormal that people would actually get worsening pain uh from going carnivore it's usually like the plant toxins and the junk food and all that sort of garbage that increases increases the pain as well um try eating you know sometimes you know pain uh issues like fibromyalgia can come from um torine deficiencies and torine gets cooked out when you cook meat so maybe try a bit less cooked meat some like some rare steaks for example see if that helps you do make torine but you make it in your liver and that goes out in your bile and then you need to reabsorb the bile so people saying hey you should eat a lot of fiber and take medications to strip out your bile so that you lower your cholesterol while you're also lowering your torine and other sorts of nutrients and you're not absorbing fat which is super important as well so it's um uh you know that's that's one thing that that people have found that torine uh deficiencies can actually uh exacerbate pain disorders like fibromyalgia so maybe give that a try just as a you know as a as an you know an as side that could possibly do something but you know you'll be making torine anyway it's just a matter of absorbing it so eat a lot of fatty meat uh maybe have some rare steak and for the touring and hopefully that helps and hopefully this is just a bit of withdrawals that that uh go away soon and good luck with that I'm sorry that's happening uh AER R thank you very much for the Super Chat uh perhaps you've gotten this question before but I'm curious about your cat's diet yeah raw meat all the way so cats have to have raw meat they first of all they require torine they don't make torine so they have to get it from their diet so you can't really cook it I mean they can have a bit of cooked meat but they need they need they need raw meat as well because they need the um you know different amino acids and nutrients that can get cooked out when you cook meat and uh for very interesting uh research on this look up pottinger cats uh funny enough I think my mom was a patient of the original Dr pottinger and um and she was unwell with something something and he thought it was a nutritional deficiency and uh and he prescribed her raw liver and just said hey she need she needs to uh liver but he needs to be raw and cleared it right up pretty cool and then you know Weston a price he actually teamed up with the original Dr pottinger from pottinger cats uh who studied the whole cook versus Raw um diet for cats and um found it made a huge difference and that's a very interesting study people should look up there's descriptions of it on YouTube uh using some of the original pictures from the from the from the time and um the original um westn a price found it a West A price foundation that's actually a more recent uh Foundation the original Was A price pottinger foundation that's with price and the Dr poers from poers cats who apparently was uh someone my mom went to as a kid or got taken to which is very interesting when she she grew up in Southern California so uh yeah so we feed my cat meat he's never eaten anything else we never given him kibble or anything like that and um you know it's the wrong teeth they real pointy teeth why are you giving them hard crunchy nonsense you know uh they need meat and uh so I give them raw meat in particular sometimes we'll give him you know some like you know rare cooked steak with a bit of whatever you know but I try to give him the more raw parts and um because he just freaks out he just wants to eat whatever the hell we're eating and um and so yeah see he he just gets meat and your meat like like the whole meat not like minced up meat um try to give him like actual meat that he has to chew and rip off the bones good for their teeth as well and uh yeah and he's super healthy he's never had never had a an issue ever in his life just very very lean muscular healthy happy little cat we do that for our dogs too same thing Kurt William thank you very much for the very generous super chats very kind of you um uh Kurt says thank you for your work I have benefited from it also an inspiration small token I appreciate you well thank you Kurt that's really really kind of you I I really appreciate that and uh thank you for for coming on I'm really glad that that um that this has helped you know that's that's the whole point you know this is not my day job this is not what um I want to do as a career like I like seeing patients I like doing surgery I like just being um you know out and and then seeing people face to face but this has been amazing to be able to to reach so many more people and uh to get this information out there but I mean this isn't you know getting getting proper nutrition out there I think is just you know just an important thing to do it's just a service to humanity and it shouldn't be like a job you know people just know how to eat and you should just be healthy and then you should have doctors to to help with the accidents and emergencies and traas and things like that uh the acute issues that we've been treating for you know thousands of years years and you know the broken bones and head injuries and those sorts of things and you know that's that's what I want to get medicine back over to and and hopefully um you know my practice in in metabolic medicine you know doesn't you know doesn't have to be my whole career because people just know how to eat and they don't have these problems in the first place and and and they know that well if I'm getting sick I should just start eating meat again yeah I already know you don't need a doctor to tell me that and don't need a bunch of medications I just yeah I just need to need to fix up my diet I hope that we get to that point in the next you know decade um but realistically it's probably going to take longer than that and we probably all going to have a lot of work in the metabolic field uh but it would be great if I could just do trauma surgery and just uh you know help people have had accidents and things like that that would be my that's my goal in life is to is to get people healthy enough that we only have to worry about those acute emergencies that would be would be a life accomplishment I would be very happy with and I'm glad that you know you and others are are getting there already and and getting a lot better that's great hey everyone really happy to announce a new sponsor for the show and for everybody down in Australia Stockman steaks who are delivering highquality grass-fed and finished pasture raised beef and other meats flash frozen and vacuum sealed to Door something I've been enjoying a lot of myself recently as well they also have a great range of specialty it items such as high fat keto mints and carnivore beef and organs mints with liver kidneys and beef heart as well so use code chaffy today for free order of beef mints or another specialty gift along with your order at Stockman steaks.com and I'll see you over there thanks guys uh yukino morama thank you very much for the Super Chat day 24 carnivore diet I suffer muscle soreness due to exercise um does it get better by simply uh intake of salt I only eat meat eggs and butter um yeah you know sometimes people just have like a bit of things that are in their system maybe they drink coffee or tea and that can absolutely cause soreness um you know you might still get just you know a bit sore uh if you have some of these things in there or or things are still working out of your system but it should be massively reduced on on a carnivore diet just eating just eating meat and water and eggs you know other Dairy butter is usually okay um other Dairy can can cause a bit of soreness um and uh so I would wonder you know is is the soreness getting better or is it just still sort of there and like it's supposed to be completely gone typically does get completely gone um but you might even feel like oh okay there's there's something going on there but like that stiffness pain like oh god oh you know that that shouldn't be there that should be pretty much G on and um you know if you you know it is early on you may benefit from increased salt intake that usually doesn't have anything to do with soreness uh that that's typically to do with your um your energy levels and your blood pressure and things like that and how intense of a workout you can get um and that's actually going you know going back to that gentleman who's um who's you know a year into carnivore and doesn't have much energy have you checked your electrolytes have you tried increasing electrolytes and you know salt and water in um increasing your um your levels some people some people just don't feel good unless they have added salt and that added electrolytes you know my friend Dave Felman who does the uh lean mass hyperresponders uh research uh he he has to add a lot of salt and he he just wasn't really feeling great until he started adding salt and that just just changed his life so you know if you're having these sorts of issues and you don't know why and just have low energy and all this try salt you know try electrolytes try more water and see what that does to you and check your Bloods too because you know you may have an absorption issue but um you know if if you want to try some extra salt try it and if that helps that should be great I haven't really seen you know extra salt help with soreness but World a try and uh just make sure everything else is out of your system and out of your diet such as coffee tea alcohol obviously all those sorts of things any additive spices seasonings those sorts of things can all can all contribute so just keep that in mind raw trucken thank you very much for the Super Chat uh any good CoQ10 supplement recommendations my dad had open heart surgery recently and is on a torvest Statin and it depleted yeah uh his body of CoQ10 I I don't know um specific brands that would be better or worse I think I think um there's like some liquid stuff that I've seen at Costco you know you just take a shot of that I would take that I mean I think it's I think it's borderline malpractice putting anybody on a toris stat and then you and not putting them on CoQ10 as well um or even putting them on a toris stat and I think is getting to the point of malpractice really at this point but um definitely without CQ I think is is just completely uh negligent as a doctor so um yeah I don't I don't know specific supplements uh brands that would be better but um you know just just just any trusted brand from like a you know a a reputable store like Costco or you know GNC or one of those places um and uh and heart heart muscle um has a lot of CoQ10 and which is why you know we want coq1 for our heart um it's funny we we take statins for our heart and it depletes CoQ10 which damages our heart it's a great idea guys and um so yeah so just take a supplement cq0 supplement I take that every day and you know maybe add in some heart it has a punch bunch of CoQ10 and and heart tissue so um super cheap too you just sort of chop it up you know finely and uh and you know saute s Stir It Up Stir Fry it up in some you know butter or Tallow or ghee and um you know and just eat that little pile next to your your meat and um have tons of good nutrients in there as well same you can do the same thing with liver or just eat the liver raw eat the heart raw you know eat the hearts of you know get the strength of that animal in you and uh by eating it but um yeah uh I I I don't know that that one supplement is good uh is is you know better than another um but har definitely has a lot of cutan as well so I would do both really Jasmine Ortiz thank you very much for the Super Chat I've been on strict carnivore for three weeks uh when do people typically get uh that awesome feeling and mental Clarity everyone talks about and went on Carnivore uh experiencing mental fog and energy dips uh it it's different for different people most people do start getting into it about where you're at make sure you eating enough make sure you're eating enough fat make sure you have enough electrolytes make sure you're getting enough water those are all really important things especially early on it's very easy to undereat on a corn for diet remember that and if you're eating a big meal you are going to be lethargic you're you may have you just get more tired and you know be struggling a bit and have energy dips like you're saying so if you eat breakfast or you eat lunch you can have a big dip after that because your body's just saying hey you've got your energy for the day what the hell are you doing go to sleep rest you know relax and recover and you know obviously that doesn't you know uh fit very well in a busy schedule and so try to eat more in the later in the day if you are eating during the day just take like a half meal just sort of half of what you want just take the edge off and um and then go from there um and then again enough water enough food enough fat in particular and uh and also get enough uh electrolytes as well that's that's really important hey little boy your good catch hey buddy so fat bastard thank you very much uh for the super chat um I've noticed being on a car on Carnivore my veins seem like they are getting bigger doing carnivores the only change I've made what's up with that you just get more vascular you're also losing fat you're losing more fat uh subcutaneous fat and that makes your your your um veins pop out more and be more noticeable but also you know if you're working out and the muscles are getting bigger and they're demanding more blood then you have to have more blood flowing in to the muscles and so your veins have to expand to to have them flow back out again so the combination of those two things will get you more vascular I get I get pretty vascular I don't you know even when I'm not really working out you see in pictures of me I usually my veins are uh pretty prominent and you know when I get blood draws you know the photus is usually pretty happy to see me because they're like oh my God this this is you know it's like a you know thumb or finger sized vein going down my my uh elbow you know so or the inside of my elbow and like um you know so it's uh you know you're just yeah just moving more blood and then you have lower subcutaneous fat so it's this more prominent and that's usually what's going on there Eric Gman um just said he's down to 3117 pounds from 375 on Carnival is amazing that's awesome Eric really well done that's uh that's fantastic so it's a huge accomplishment I mean know you're talking about 60 pounds uh is fantastic and just eating as much as you want isn't that crazy you know so you don't have to starve yourself like these yahoos oh you have to be this calorie def so you have to starve yourself it's just like shut up you know this just you just don't know how the body works you know and and your body will naturally put you in uh the calorie deficit um and it will also fix your hormones as well by just eating normal food and so you actually listen to your satiety hormon or satiety and hunger signals your body knows exactly what it wants you just listen to it it's just like every animal in the world you know I've never seen a koala pull out a calculator to figure out his macros it just eats it just eats and something internally tells them when to stop and when to start and um and and I you know you don't see some you know uh koalas that are all fat and Bloated and diabetic that just doesn't have any self-control you know um and I mean it's just this that's not how it works that's not how any that it's not how life on earth works and if you are are forgetting that then you just you just aren't thinking about how the planet actually works and how life on Earth actually works or you just don't know how it works and you shouldn't be giving anyone advice in the first place but uh that's great to see thank you for sharing that and congratulations on such a such a dramatic weight loss and you know keep going you're doing great Jay Carrero thank you very much for the Super Chat my 26-year-old son was just diagnosed with uh lupus uh with blood work what meat do you recommend him to start um reversing the fatigue and laded and fogginess he is desperate for B yeah lion diet 100% all the way so just ruminate meat and water so beef fatty beef lamb go goat venison Yak Caribou you know these sorts of things all the ruminant animals um that's going to be the best it's going to filter out more of the plant toxins that's not going to get into him what I can tell autoimmune diseases are your body reacting to plant toxins and other toxins and making antibodies towards them which then crossreact with your body right and so what happens when how do you treat that well you get rid of those plant toxins you get rid of those other toxins that your body's reacting to making antibodies towards and those antibodies come right down and it stops attacking your body and that's what I see that's what I see in clinical practice and that's what we see in the literature you when people go on an elemental diet and they just cut out all the different sorts of nonsense they just take in the macros and micros that they need their antibodies come down and they go into remission on Crohn's disease and other sorts of autoimmunity autoimmune diseases and you know so you know that that means that the food is causing the disease that means you are reacting to something and um and then you just take that something away so just not eating certain things is the best treatment for autoimmune disease that's in the literature that's in randomized control trials in humans and so what is a stake if not an elemental diet it's just the nutrients you need and nothing else and it's all of them in the proportion that you need them because it's our natural evolved diet so uh your son should just just really stick to just a lion diet just red meat and water very high fat try to get about two two grams of fat to one gram of protein add in a bit of of organs just a couple ounces a day especially for the first few weeks uh and then maybe go down to a couple days a week if that's um if that suits you better but you know you always need to play catchup when you're switching onto a uh switching from another way of eating because it just the way you're eating is not nutritionally uh replete and so um you know just make sure that you're you're getting uh enough and uh and catchup with a bit of organs and things like that and don't eat anything besides fatty red meat and water and um and he'll do good he'll do really well uh really avoid it coffee tea all that stuff has to go alcohol especially has to go sugar has to go everything has to go besides red meat and water and he'll he'll do really well I've got a number of patients with lupus they improve I've got I don't know how many hundreds of patients with uh autoimmunity of some form well over 100 patients with just Hashimoto you know maybe another hundred of of various other sort of autoimmune issues um they all get better you know they all improve um will they all get into complete remission only with diet that remains to be seen but they all improve and they all get better and and if you and you go outside that and you start eating these other things bam antibod go right up a negative flare up so just remember that uh so this is perfectly within his control you know it shouldn't be like Oh I'm going to be so restricted no this is freeing this shows him he has a way he has something he can do that he does not have to live with lupus and take horrific uh and damaging medications for the rest of his life that are going to completely screw him up in a thousand other ways you know he he gets to control this himself that's very freeing that's very empowering so think of that in the in the right way and um and good luck to him I hope he does well let us know how he does too it' be uh great to see solid jken thank you very much for the super chat um hi doctor I'm on day five carnivore and my heart rate has been about 5 to 10 beats higher than normal am I just missing electrolytes or something else uh you know I I see this sometimes when people you know they they they're very careful about tracking their their heart rate and this that the other you know if your if your heart rate is still under 100 you're not Taco cardic I wouldn't worry about it you know when your heart is running on glucose it actually is efficient and um and then you go into a cornivore diet ketogenic diet carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet and it all of a sudden your ketones go up your heart primarily preferentially runs on Ketone so now your heart's actually running on Rocket Fuel so you know picking up the the pace a bit is not all that abnormal is that going to stay like that you know maybe maybe not but at at the moment it's just sort of readjusting to like running on Rocket Fuel you know so it's like if if you're you know if you had a Ferrari and you running on you know you know you know 27 Octane and now all of a sudden you're getting you know you know super premium and it's like you know 105 octane oh my God you know you or 100 or you know 98 octane or whatever and you're just like you know hauling ass it's like oh wow that works better yeah imagine that so um I wouldn't worry about it too much you know if you if you are feeling good and you're and you're doing well there's nothing to fix um if you think that uh you could feel better and you want to try some electrolytes try some electrolytes and if and if you feel better on those electrolytes great and um but it it may not be you know it could just be that's actually pretty common that I see most people just don't track their their uh heart rate and things like that you know super uh super closely but now we have these like you know a rings and the fitbits and all that sort of stuff Apple watches that track all this stuff and so oh my God this is different but is it bad that you know different doesn't doesn't mean bad necessarily and so I I wouldn't worry too much about it you know unless you're not feeling well in which case you know you know see see if you can do something about it um you want to add in some more electrolytes you know fine see if that helps you just do that self- experiment and if you feel better great uh if you're just worrying about your beats per minute though I wouldn't worry too much just just focus on how you feel and the results you're getting that's the most important thing uh Hugh Thomas thank you for the Super Chat question is about uh Calcium deficiency on Carnivore no you won't you won't get Calcium deficiency your body needs a different constellation of nutrients based on what you're eating and so if you're eating a bunch of plants with plant toxins and oxalates and antinutrients that bind and strip out calcium you will need more calcium to catch up uh always remember that female lions make milk that has calcium and have bone bones that have calcium and they maintain their bones and they grow their bones so you know baby mammals drink their mother's milk they get a lot of calcium from that milk but then as babies they are weaned onto their mother's diet and the mother's diet provides enough calcium to make that milk that's high in calcium and so then they get weaned onto that and obviously there's enough calcium for their mom to make milk and there's enough calcium for them and that's actually when the majority of long bone growth happens is when they're uh just weaned onto their adult diet and so you have to get you have to be able to get a lot of calcium from from that diet or or enough calcium in any case or else you won't you won't uh you won't grow your bones properly right you'll get you know weak soft bones and osteomalacia and you know it's not going to be not going to be very conducive with a with a healthy adult and uh so yeah you you'll definitely get enough calcium it's just that you know we we make these rdas at a time when everyone was eating a mixed diet and so you had to have different amounts of these things you having plants with oxalates you know there's studies back in the 50s and people say now people say now I've heard people say oh you should eat um um spinach because it has so much calcium in it so good for your calcium it's like no we've already done these studies or studies in humans back in the what 50s like 1955 somewhere around there where they um where they gave people spinach because there was calcium found in there by mass spectromet spectrometer that so that that doesn't mean that it's it's bioavailable just means that it's in there and but you don't know what form it's in there and uh so they gave people a bunch of spinach to try to raise their calcium levels and what happened their calcium level went down why is that because the calcium is bound up in ways that is not bioavailable so we can't access it because we don't have the enzymes to because we are not designed to eat spinach and it also comes with a lot of oxy which then go into our body and bind our own calcium and strip that calcium out of our blood and then we have to strip calcium off our bones to keep our serum levels up so we we don't die because your heart stops if your calcium gets too low so it's um it's it's a very different story when you're not eating those plants and those plant toxins those antinutrients and you're actually getting bioavailable food and calcium so no you don't get you don't get deficient um and I have I have a number of patients you know elderly women who have osteoporosis had osteoporosis and and then in eight months to a year on a carnivore diet they don't have osteoporosis anymore and they're also doing exercise and resistance training things like that but you know women in their 60s and 70s reversing osteoporosis right that's not supposed to happen and in that you know you know any any traditionally drain trained you know doctor orthopedic surgeon will tell you that's impossible that cannot happen it happens every damn day and maybe even people here in the chat that have done that so please you know leave a comment with your experiences on that but I have a number of patients that have done that and and shown this on dexa bone scan bone density scan uh that they've gone from osteoporosis to normal bone density for a 25y old woman within a year of a carnivore diet so no you get plenty of calcium on a carnivore diet and that was without calcium supplementation by the way that just the diet uh big boss thank you very much for the Super Chat uh Jesus is it I'm oh okay I'm going slower than I thought yeah okay I'm gonna have to sort of speed up here everyone um hey Doc I was joking about being vegan and turning into a tree from the last live I'm actually carnivore and eat only human only eat human meat well you are what you eat so you know if you eat a a you know a leard you could turn into a leopard I guess so I guess in this this age of furries and things like that you know everyone can just be whatever they want and you can you know you can eat a badger and turn into a badger I guess but um uh um you know that's um you know it's uh it's it's always funny when people say that you are what you eat yeah we we're we're actually meat we're actually animals and so we should eat meat we should eat animals because you are what you eat and you're getting those nutrients that animal tissue because we need to build and maintain animal tissue and that's exactly what uh what you need to eat and you certainly don't need asparagus because we're definitely not asparagus and so if you are what you eat you want to eat animals because we are animals hams air thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm 170 I'm assuming pounds uh maybe not years old but that would be great I want to be 210 or 215 at the same time I'm lactose intolerant how do I gain weight thanks Doc yeah okay so you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good uh you eat twice a day at least and then you really go until you just take a bite and just go like I I don't want another bite um a lot of fat you need a lot of fat you'll get you'll get a ton of protein with that but you need a lot of fat and uh and you'll put on muscle and you need to work out obviously I'm sure you are working out you don't want to just put on you know 50 pounds of fat you want to put on 50 pounds of muscle is you need to work your ass off you need to lift weights you need to get on a on a rigorous lifting program whatever suits you best there's plenty of different camps on on what the best way to build up muscle are but you can talk to a you know a strength and conditioning coach or a bodybuilding coach and say Hey I want to put on a bunch of muscle get me on a a lifting plan I'll I'll take care of the nutrition myself and then you just lift a lot of Weights you do sprinting sprinting three days a week just try to kill yourself out there you're going to get big old legs and you're going to get very very uh fit on top of it as well and um and then you lift and then you eat a lot of fatty meat you eat twice a day at the least you eat twice a day and you work out a lot and if you're doing that you'll put on muscle very very easily uh Braden field thank you very much for the Super Chat uh hey Doc I've been carnivore for 18 months uh currently get bloated in nausea uh e just eating red meat uh which I experienced no bloating on this diet previously any ideas uh just want to eat ri eyes again yeah it's really weird you know it could be that you're you're getting things from a different Source could be that there's something you're reacting to um just eat the meat that that you enjoy try to switch up the different sources that you're getting because yeah you weren't getting bloated before so why are you getting bloated now EA the same thing maybe something changed in the in the the quality of meat that you're getting um you know try grass finished try those sorts of things try things that aren't aged potentially you know sometimes people have problem with aged meat and start try to get more fresh things see if you can have lamb those sorts of things see what that does as well but just play around with it try changing different things see if there's anything else that's slipped into your diet and and get a food journal and diary and so mark down what your symptoms are what you feel how you know what you're eating at what time and when you get these symptoms and see if you can find any patterns and then just unfortunately just have to avoid the things that that are doing something bad to you try going to different butchers getting different different cuts of meat and uh and see how you go because you know blow blo in and nausea shouldn't really happen with uh with this especially if it didn't happen before so it just sounds like something else has sort of snuck its way in and is you know reacting too negatively so try to find out what that is good luck with that uh Andrew thank you for the Super Chat two weeks ago a beast stung me in the hospital that's not good uh years ago stings were mild could carnivore increase Venom sensitivity um via Al oh he put you in the hospital Jesus okay I thought stung you in the hospital and um uh so it's not good to let bees in the hospital but uh wow put you in the hospital well anybody can can develop a sensitivity at any point in their life and and you know repeated exposures to something actually increases the chances that you'll uh start getting a hyper sensitivity to it uh I don't think that that carnivore will increase uh Venom sensitivity um I would I would actually imagine it goes the other way because a lot of people have have less allergies and and histamine responses uh with with previous exposures that they've had um you know like like I get mosquito bites and they're you know almost don't even really feel them they're not even all that itchy they're not a big problem I haven't had a had a b bite or B sting um since so I don't know and I don't plan on testing that one because I don't really want to get stung by a be but um it's uh it's it's unlikely that carnivore did that but um you know you could be just this happened to be when your body triggered and got more sensitive so but I wouldn't think it was with the carnivore but either way you know if you have a if you have a hyper uh sensitivity reaction you just need to be really careful you know go around with an EpiPen things like that uh because you know you don't want to you don't want to take a risk yeah it's uh so it's it's hard to say you know maybe it gets better in the future or maybe it doesn't but either way you you're in the situation um that you need to sort of be careful about it so very sorry about that but hopefully you you don't have that again in the future but be careful you know do carry go around with a nappy pen good luck with that um Alex uh Alex sa thank you for the Super Chat well my test was 225 when I was put on uh testosterone age 35 uh played with peeds in my 20s then took off uh my blood count when my blood count was 19.6 I feel like garbage yeah so that was previously when they were on um testosterone yeah so you know that's the thing it's like um you shouldn't you shouldn't get taken off that quickly you know if you sort of damage your body's ability to sort of make testosterone I I do think you probably will be able to recover in time but you just you don't take someone off that quickly and let them bottom out because they're clearly not you're not going to be able to recover right that quickly um there are medications that can help stimulate your your testes U making testosterone and and you wouldn't you shouldn't just drop people off of those things without weaning them off of them or with uh without putting them on something like that that can help bolster their natural response so I would go back and talk to your doctor and um and if he he or she isn't uh really you know hearing any of it yeah I would talk to a different doctor for sure yeah because that's that's not right uh James Joseph Finn thank you for the Super Chat would salt uh be a cause of Edema and low in lower extremities and difficulty frequent urination in the middle of the night or elevated insulin from a little pasta or both um could be a bit of both um you know excess salt you know you can get a bit more EMA and fluid retention um you know so you can just just try both you know just try try reducing the amount of salt and you know cutting out the pasta definitely and uh and see how you go uh because that uh either one could do that and and um you know if you're having this issu you just have to again do the self- experiment and try to try to sort of cut those things out and see how you go it could be something completely different too you know so that's why you get the the journal and the diary sort of say hey my legs are swollen here this is what I ate today had leg swollen or didn't and you can sort of see patterns uh that way as well so that's a good idea um jiren Louise thank you very much for the Super Chat hello from Massachusetts well hello I had a gastric sleeve surgery two years ago uh now I have bone pain and hair loss oh I'm sorry to hear that should I take supplements since I can't eat that much yeah you might need to I mean go for the the um you know that that's a very common thing with uh gastric sleeve and and the bypass surgeries and those sorts of things you get malabsorption issues and and so it's uh you can actually cut out parts of the stomach and small intestine that that actually help you absorb certain things and you just can't absorb them anymore and so that's not good and so uh yeah you want to have more nutrient dense things so you are going to need to eat more liver and kidneys and heart and um and then check check your levels you know and if you are too low on B12 folate and iron and vitamin D and these sorts of things yeah you know um and the organs aren't enough then yes you know I I would supplement absolutely and sometimes you have to do that in injection form because your your body just can't absorb it through your gut and that's a really unfortunate consequence of these sorts of surgeries which is another reason why I'm really not a big fan of them um but uh yeah so no that that's perfectly fine you know if you're low on these sorts of things I would check all of your your blood levels and see what's going on because you know you shouldn't have a lot of pain you shouldn't have hair loss and these sorts of things check your thyroid too that's another one for hair loss that's important and um and uh yeah and just just make sure that that you're getting the organs and if that's not enough yeah I would supplement definitely okay this is the last question and then and then we're got to got to wrap up because I've got an appointment here shortly I have to run to uh so Molly Madness thank you very much for the super chat um St SC in carnivore it's helped me with a lot of problems but um experienced hot flashes as a fale in my 60s interesting because the thing is I've seen women in their late 50s actually reverse out of menopause and actually start producing normal amounts of of estrogen again for a 25-year-old and so it could be that that you're sort of maybe on that edge where you're starting to produce some more estrogen in your body did before enough to then start giving you the hot flashes as well was before you just didn't really have anything to speak of and now it's actually sort of making a bit of a recovery and so uh that's very interesting I would check your hormones I would check you know uh check your blood work um and I would just keep eating a lot of fatty meat your body can can help normalize your adrenals can start uh creating more um estrogen and so on and some androgens as well and um and that can help you feel very good and and strong and healthy you know for the rest of your of your life and without HRT um but you know if your if your kidney if your ovaries are starting to wake up as well you know it could be that you're starting to make a bit more estrogen to the point that you're starting to sort of feel the you know the effects of that and so you know check your levels and see how you're doing um I don't think you necessarily have to go on HRT I don't know if you're on HRT or not but uh that happens you know what happens that your body starts to recover and make more uh estrogen so which is great and um and yeah so good luck with that but that that can absolutely happen and so it's um you know at a certain point I I I think that you know women will go through menopause and won't be fertile anymore but um it's a lot later than I think people uh previously thought because it's um the body just works so much differently when you're uh when you're eating properly and your hormones work very differently as well so yeah so good luck with that hopefully you don't have any bad symptoms and hopefully your your body and your hormones improve more and more and more and you just keep doing better and better and thank you for the Super Chat okay there's been some uh super stickers and things like that so say thank you uh to everyone here uh to um uh thank you for this the donation to buy Dr CH a sure microphone I think there was some some recommendations on um some other microphones I think this one work great you know I sort of looked it up all the reviews that this was one of the top ones but you know I think getting one on a boom like that can actually get close to my face more easily when I'm sitting down might be a good idea so we'll we'll see about an upgrade here in the future Stuart Williams thank you very much for the very generous super sticker um and um Fred thank you for the super sticker and Jeff Hardy thank you for the super sticker and Jeff Stone as well thank you all very much for [Music] that and thank you all for coming thank you all for submitting questions thank you all for watching all the different platforms on uh X and YouTube and Instagram and I really appreciate it I'm going to be back doing regular YouTube lives every week like this and in two days time as well and um and keep putting out more more interviews and podcasts on top of all that also try to get this tickle out of my throat too and uh so I appreciate everybody coming out hopefully this is helping people hopefully this is is keeping people on track and putting them in the right you know getting going in the right direction so that they can heal and get better and you know not need the medical establishment and whole bunch of drugs and pharmaceuticals and things like that and just be healthy and happy and um and and have lead Better Lives as a result so thank you all for coming on um I would love to stay longer but I actually have to have to jet out so um it was great uh great live today and I will see you all next time"
