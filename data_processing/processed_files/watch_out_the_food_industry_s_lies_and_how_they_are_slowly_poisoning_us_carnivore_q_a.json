        "body": "I think most people are really trying hard to do the right thing for themselves for their health for their children for their parents for their loved ones and so they're just they're just taking the advice of the authorities and finding out that the authorities are full of crap isn't isn't a nice isn't a nice uh realization or realizing that they're corrupt and they've been bribed or they've been misguided from ideological wants that that stem from this decision in the 1800s that everyone needed to stop eating meat for their own good okay hello everyone uh this Dr Anthony chaffy here today I have a special guest bold carnivore my buddy Matthew and um we will be talking about carnivore diet as usual U Matthew has U several questions that have come up so he wanted to ask me about those and then we'll take other questions from from the crowd if we have time as as well so we'll probably be here for about an hour and uh get to as much as we can uh Matthew thanks for coming on well thanks for having me yeah no worries man all right so what are what are some of your questions first up yeah what is your sleep schedule like because we had an email session once and you were awake at like 12:30 at night I was like dude you're awake well it's I mean it's just all over the place with work and so you know sometimes I'm working overnight and sometimes I'm just working until very late other times I get home from work and then I have different meetings and interviews or consultations um that I have to do so that that can end pretty late and then I have you know work work that I have to get to and and um that can go pretty late as well so it's it's pretty all all over the place but I try to prioritize sleep but that's not always possible unfortunately but when I do get sleep I get very good sleep recently I used to sleep horribly but then went carnivore and I've been much much better since nice so before going full carnivore again because I know that you were carnivore before and then you had a stint where you weren't carnivore right and then going back to it and improved your sleep patterns or just the quality uh probably both I mean it used to be very difficult for me to get to sleep in the first place I mean my my sleep habits and patterns were generally regulated by my my schedule so I I would definitely want to be asleep or try to go to sleep but if I had too much going on you know that I just had to get everything done and then obviously when you're just sort of you know young and you're on like summer break or something like that you're just you know up all night you know going out and doing things you know so um but you know when I was carnivore in my early 20s you know I wasn't wasn't really drinking either so I was I still had a pretty normal sleep schedule I slept pretty well but um that was probably just just to do with my schedule just very hectic you know I was in I was in university and then I was training with rugby you know all the rest of the day and so I'd get home pretty late and just need to you know do what I you know do some reading or some homework and then then go to sleep and do it again because I just really didn't have time for anything else okay so on this one I may be behind the curve because your your regular you know friends may know this one already but I found something online that said that you began medical school when you were like 15 years old is that accurate No not medical school I I went to I went to University when I was 16 I started I started college when I was 16 yeah yeah no but then I I took actually a long yeah so that's was the thing you know I I was sort of ahead ahead of the game there and so that's why I felt I could I could take some time off and you know pursue rugby and and really you know enjoy that and uh and concentrate on that for a while because I started early I finished you know um early and then I start okay well you know why don't I just take a bit of time and you know see see what rugby has to offer and then I ended up you know playing rugby at a sort of a you know high level for like 10 years until I I ended up going to medical school so I took a lot more time uh than I had had sort of caught up so I did end up going to medical school late I ended up going I start well I started um the application process just I mean just takes forever so it's it's just you know there's a lot of preparation getting all your ducks in a row and then you apply you know one year for the next year's Admissions and so it's a long process but I ended up starting medical school when I was 29 so it was um I started college early but I also started college late in some ways that's interesting yeah okay so I know you're playing rugby at at a top level and I know that you've had some injuries on the field but how about your legs have you ever had a leg injury I broke my my right leg uh just around the ankle so I had a sort of unstable fracture of my distal right fibula I ended up you know still playing on it which was not great I I remember I remember well it was actually an intentional so someone I grabbed my leg when I was when I was sort of tackl and just sort you know did like like an Al you know crocodile roll and you know just tried to break tried to break my leg and he succeeded and um that was in a championship game up in in British Columbia Canada um we're playing a team up there and it was in the finals and uh they hated us uh the Canadian teams in general hated us because we were the only American team at the time in in their Canadian leagues in the Canadian Premiership and they really resented us being in the in the their leagues and there's a lot of animosity um there was a lot of weird vitri and like there was um The Ref didn't like us players didn't like us so there would be like fights people be stomping on heads throwing punches doing all these sorts of things and ref just sort of would let it get on with it because they they didn't like us either and so you really had to um you know take your own safety in your hands and so that's why I didn't I didn't accept people doing that accepting people you know hitting me illegally or hitting me or throwing punches I just you know I I I took care of it there was a guy Deacon Jones who's a Hall of Fame NFL player and he said that you know he would never accept someone you know hitting him illegally or dirty and so he said you know when that happens you have to serve Justice and if you don't know how to serve Justice you're gonna get kicked around the league and so you know I had to figure out how to serve Justice whenever that happened but this little bastard got away with it because he broke my leg and then you know I can't just like just get up and go and kick kick his ass um because I could barely walk so I was I remember I was putting my leg down and I could feel my foot slipping away from my leg really was just skin holding my foot on and I was like that's not good and you know we only had like 10 minutes left in the game and our fullback a buddy of mine Ryan Bishop I just hear him in the background he's like chaffy get in there and I'm like I was thinking in my head I was like oh I should probably go off this is that but you you're so filled with adrenaline when you have an actual injury like that like a major injury that you don't even feel pain you just know something's really bad and and he was like japie get in there so I was like yep guess I'm not going off and so I sort of hobbled over to the side of the Rock and then just like got down on my hands and then my left leg and like curled my right leg up behind me and like Runner would come in I just shoot myself into his knees and then you know sort of get knocked back and I knew that if I if my foot hit the ground it it was GNA rip right off and so I had to keep that up and elevate it and then sort of like three poost bear crawl over to the side hit another guy bear crawl over hit another guy I so I did that so I made a number of other tackles and and then I was sort of standing there I just like call scream for the ball but like wouldn't actually run for it so i' like draw people in and then they'd pass it off but unfortunately I was pretty useless other than that and um after the game I was just sort of hobbling off but it was so it was so difficult for me to get off the field and like I didn't think to like somebody like hey I I really can't walk can you help me so it took me like you know 10 minutes just to to get off the field and they ended up putting me in a in an aircast just sort of a you know like this brace split that tied up and that that at least allowed me to walk I mean I I didn't think there was any way I could even shower because I was so unstable um and so I had that on and so I could I could do that then and then I um ended up going out and being pretty depressed and thinking like well you know I don't drink during the rugby season but like I clearly broke my leg so obviously the rugby season's over and that was the last game anyway and so I was just like right well I'm gonna get drunk and I ended up like drinking and um and I remember you know getting getting pain relief from the drinking and I ended up like actually walking around and drinking and going to bars I had the aircast on only thing s keeping it together and um and then I went to the hospital the next day and it was like where where they took the cast off it was it was literally black on everything that the cast wasn't pushing on and giving pressure on literally black and um but I like walked in there and so you know the um the sort of the the emergency department rules on how you assess like whether or not you need to give somebody like an ankle X-ray on the odds of them being you know having a fracture or something like that I think it's the Toronto ankle rules or something and um is like if you're weight bearing and you're walking in there like don't need a you don't need an an x-ray right and so I went in there I was walking in there and I sort of was talking to them but I was I could handle the pain and so they triaged me very low right I was I was very low on this on the standing and so I was sitting there for hours and hours and they looking in there and and the resident I remember looking in there going like w that is b o ke and um and the attending was like well no hold on you remember the the ankle rules you know he walked in here he's weightbearing it's the day after there all these other sort of things and uhu and I'm inan my head I'm just like you just don't realize that that I'm not a a wuss you know and so like oh but you know he's here so you know we'll do an we'll do an x-ray but you know really it's it's really unlikely you know probably just a bad spring it comes in is in horrible fracture and in fact the the foot so here's your two bones your fibula and your tibia it's supposed to sort of sit here cradled in there really rested on your tibia and then your fibula sort of on the side it was out here it was just sort of pushed out there on the on the X-ray so I was referred to an orthopedic surgeon pretty much right away he didn't see me that day I ended up seeing him the next day and he just said look your foot's out of socket is dislocated and you know so there's you're going to have a lot of soft tissue damage and you have this break I mean the fracture is the fracture but if we don't do surgery and relocate your your ankle and repair that soft tissue you're never going to walk again you're never going to well you're walking but you'll never use that ankle again and I was like right when do we do surgery and he's just like oh um I now I we just just like two hours we get done and so I was in surgery two hours later and um wow they had to they had to repair my um they had to repair my my deltoid Li actually when and when I went to medical school years later um that was taught to us that you cannot actually break the the deltoid ligament it's so strong it's actually stronger than the bone it's attached to it actually evolves it'll just rip off the bone um before you damage the ligament or before you you know rupture the ligament uh well I did it and so I I destroyed my deltoid ligament and even though in the textbook it says you can't do that I did that and so that had to be repaired so they had to sort of repair all those ligaments and things like that and uh and put everything back together so that was a pretty bad injury and I was I wasn't walking I couldn't walk for five months after that and my my leg end up being skinny as my arm and um probably skinnier than my arm is now and normally my legs would be like tree trunks because I just I you know trained so much and you know worked out so much and lifted and sprinted so much so it was um yeah that was bad it took a long time to recover from that was the main injury that was my main injury unfortunately that was right before the 2003 World Cup and so that put me out of contention to try out for that that was that was my aspiration was to was to play in that World Cup so during that time though you were fully carnivore for the most part but apart from drinking on occasion is that the case well I never drank during the rugby season so I always you know maybe it was like once a year if that be years in in in a in a row that I wouldn't drink now I know I never do anything I very rarely drink it again be like once every two years or something like that maybe you know and then it would be not all that much um the thing is is that you know you feel the effects of these things much more significantly when you have everything out of your system and everything works fantastic and so you don't have um you don't have the same desire because you you feel worse as a result so I mean I I noticed that I don't feel my best for full three weeks and I don't I can't work out as hard I can't push myself I don't have the same energy and so that's not um you know that's not what I want you know I don't want to have I don't want to have you know an entire month of my life uh feeling you know not my best and not feeling great so something has to be worth me not feeling my best for a month for it to be worth it now those things come up every now and then you know like a good friend's wedding or you know something like that but um very rarely so it's I I don't I don't even know the last time I drank but it would have been you know a couple years ago at least right speaking of working out that's one of the next questions I have see I know that you're busy a lot right and you have said on other occasions that you don't really work out very frequently anyway but what exactly is your workout schedule like well at the moment I don't H I don't have a schedule so I just sort of get in workouts when I can but it has been a while you know when I'm traveling I try to use like the X3 so I actually probably work out more regularly then just because like I have it with me and I'm like oh it's stupid to bring this thing and not use it um then really I should I I try to use it when I'm when I'm ster time as well but you know you just sort of get so busy you just don't do it when I'm when I'm working out regularly when I I like to workout like at Le lift weights at least four days a week uh Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday and I like to do sprints on uh stairs or Hills because for some reason my my knee um swells up every time I I just run on Flats so but if I do sprints on stairs it's fine so I'm trying to rehab my knees I've I've got some advice from uh Ben the knees over toes guy he's a really nice guy and very helpful and so I've been I've been trying to do his exercises whenever I remember and um and hopefully get get my knee rehabbed and and you know maybe eventually I can I can start you know running again properly but until then I do sprints on the stairs and for some reason that works and it doesn't doesn't swell up my knee and I can get a good Sprint workout there so yeah know eventually I'd like to be able to do normal more more frequent workouts at least Sprint like three days a week and hopefully get back to rugby that would be that's the goal but it's infrequent at the moment so yeah that's the good thing about this diet is that you know I can get I get you get in a lot better shape when you're working out but you never get out of shape so this is my Baseline I never get worse than this and but I I only get better so you know that part's good yeah I've noticed an uptake on my ability to hold muscle and and my my power is definitely improving the other day I was doing explosive push-ups I haven't done those in years nice amazing yeah yeah absolutely yeah you know we see people well I was just gonna say you know we see other people we have people like you know that that haven't been able to work out in a long time being able to do a lot more and even people that are elderly that haven't been able to work out in a long time all of a sudden they're feeling great and they're and they're doing sprints you know you people in their 60s and 70s doing sprints which is amazing and so you know that that's fantastic to see that people can can um you know recover so much ground that they can get back to working out like a like a teenager again like a superhero man yeah that's it so I got a question from a friend from my community he asked what are the best studies that show plants are pro-inflammatory and that they are that many are carcinogenic so I mean those best the best things are from the actual field of Botany you know you don't want to look at nutritional epidemiology because it's garbage and um so you look at the Hard Sciences which is biology and botany and like there are nearly a million different chemicals in plants that um you know they use as defense and so this is just this is just an objective truth you mean there things that bind nutrients or things that disrupt your hormones there things that that stop you from absorbing certain things there are things that are directly toxic and harmful that we know are directly toxic and harmful so what you can do is you can look up those individual toxins the who has a a great web page called what is it like to um natural natural toxins found in Foods or something like that now they say foods but literally every single thing is is a plant mushroom or algae there isn't there isn't a single thing on there that's toxic that's in meat so that should tell you something that there isn't anything identified in meat that is that is known to be toxic there's all these epidemiological studies put out by special interest groups that have doctored the evidence to make it appear as if meat were bad but there's nothing actually in meat that they can say hey here's this poison here's cyanide you can say that about 2500 different plants though that they have Cyanide and so you know this is just this is just an objective reality and there are a lot of studies showing that lectins tannins oxalates Fates saponins you know hormonal disruptors all these sorts of things are in plants and there's you know plenty of studies showing that they cause harm literally going back hundreds of years I mean you know every you know this was this was a major part of of biology was and and um and philosophy was understanding this it's understanding The Sciences of how plants worked and how they could kill you I mean they the ancient Greeks knew that Hemlock would kill you and they poisoned people with Hemlock to kill them that's how Socrates was killed was with Hemlock so this is something that's that's always been known really is that plants are toxic and then you have to understand how to use them and utilize them safely in order to be safe so looking at the different toxins going on that that web I have that in my plants are trying to kill you talk on my page and then on the list in the bibliography on the low carb down under um video version of that the the the links for that wh article and you just go through that you just see all the different categories and that's not even all the categories you know that I Nam there's more categories on the who website and there are more categories that aren't even on the who website so you can go in there and you can look up and you can see exactly what it is but this this is hard science you know these things these things exist and there are number of of government websites as well and I have links for those in in many of my videos especially ones on plant toxins where they talk about how there all these different toxins that are found in food you need to be careful and cook and treat and and and do special things to them in order to detoxify them ferment them put these things through different chemical chemical processes which we've done for thousands of years to try and reduce the toxic level and increase the bioavailability of the nutrients something we've been doing for thousands of years and so I mean that that's just that's just a a you know a tacit understanding or tacit admission it's like there are poisons in here because if there weren't poisons you wouldn't need to detoxify them and so you can look at those and then sort of look them up individually look up all those different chemical categories individually but you know the who even says that that some of these things can kill they can cause serious harm and they can can be mutogenic or even carcinogenic I mean the who says that and then you can look those up individually to find out out which ones but there's there's many articles there's article from um Professor Bruce Ames in 1989 and he showed identified 42 different toxins in Plants 20 of which were shown to be carcinogenic in in lab studies so you know and then you study cancer biology I studied cancer biology and we learned that you know there were over a hundred known carcinogens in many of the produce items that we that we eat and there were dozens in every produce item so the information is out there you're not going to find it in an epidemiological nutritional study mostly because they're crap that's not real science that's that's that's hypothesis generating but it's not it's not actual science um and uh most of it is is completely corrupted by the 7th Day Adventist Church and the big food industry indries that are just they're the ones pumping out you know the vast majority of of this nutritional um paperwork and they're and they're peer-reviewing it themselves because the Seventh Day Adventist Church has multiple medical centers around the world and they have a major medical university called lomalinda in lalinda California and they do all their own peer reviewing so any any plant-based nutritional propaganda that comes in all oh yeah stamp of approval stamp of approval so of course it gets approved you know and and they sort of you know weed out things that they don't want and don't peer review them and don't don't approve them for publication and they obviously approve anything that Ms meets with their ideology which is really corrupt that right there leads into my next question so I saw your video presentation on the Seventh Day Adventist in Dr kog you said they pushed with plant foods to reduce sexual desire I wanted to know what line of research were you on when you found that threat and was it all a matter of public record or did you have to dig real hard to find that no that that's public record I mean that that's that's in their own documentation and writings and Publications they say that Ellen G white was their profitest and one of their founding members if I'm not mistaken me she was there from the beginning she was influenced by Sylvester Graham who made graham crackers for the same reason because he he theorized that you had to eat Bland plant-based Foods in order to suppress sexual urges this was a this was a notion that I saw the earliest record I saw of this was in the 1820s it probably came before that uh from a doctor who said that this is how you suppress sexual urges is eating a plant-based diet and then you know decades later Sylvester Graham made graham crackers influenced l&g white then she heard this learned about it and then said she had a vision from God that said meat was evil and toxic and it caused lustful feelings and lust was a sin and therefore you know you should stop eating meat that was that's in their Doctrine so this isn't this isn't the secret I mean this is this is an open admonition this is this is their religious tenant that meat is toxic it's a horrible thing that you shouldn't eat you shouldn't bring in your body and and that was that was one of the main reasons was because it it beg got lustful feelings and eating you need to eat a Bland plant-based diet in order to stamp that down this was open they're openly talking about this Kell you know LG white wrote dozens of books Kellogg wrote dozens of books and um you know spoke about all this stuff so now this is this is all just public record it's just no one really knows it anymore so would you think that it would really concern the Discerning public that their food is being tampered with intentionally for religious purposes well I'm sure I'm sure it would bother people that the the the guidelines and everything like that were influenced in this way um you know I mean some people may not care but I think I think most people are really trying hard to do the right thing for themselves for their health for their children for their parents for their loved ones and so they're just they're just taking the advice of the authorities and finding out that the authorities are full of crap isn't isn't a nice isn't a nice uh realization or realizing that they're corrupt and they've been bribed or they've been they've been misguided from ideological WS that that stem from this decision in the 1800s that everyone needed to stop eating meat for their own good and that's why Kellog started making Kellogg cereals processing plants trying to make these cereals um he was very very influential I mean he he was like a doctor to the stars and he had some of the most famous people of the day Captain of industry um you know major politicians Henry Ford um I think Carnegie will Durant was his patient for a while which makes sense because I S so if people don't know will Durant is one of the more famous historians ever and classicists ever he wrote a book called I Claudius it was turned into a BBC drama um Captain Bard played um was it dramaticus anyway he was in there and he was a bastard and um they uh so it's very famous he's very very very famous he wrote wrote the history of civilization the history of civilization so it's this massive 11 volume work these big Toms and there's 11 of them and so it goes all the way back to the beginning of civilization all the way up to the the modern era so this guy was a major major figure and he was heavily influenced by Kellogg and I remember reading an excerpt from will Durant and um he said that you know well people are on this side they think this and these other people say this but you know Dr Kellogg agrees with the first people and you can never go wrong listening to Dr Kellogg I'm like oh Jesus I had no idea and so this guy was really influential really really influential and uh so he made a lot of waves and so he influenced like I think something like 36 serial companies all grew up out of his area a lot you know post cereals that Mr post was one of his patients and clients and he ended up founding his own cereal companies after after he was influenced by Kellogg but Kellogg would make these processed cereals and nut based fake meats that was he was the orig of fake Meats was with Kellogg and he would make these nut-based ones to try to replace meat so people didn't need to eat meat and that's what he pushed on his patients that's what he spoused for this is the healthiest thing is what you need to do and you needed to clean colon and you needed to have multiple enemas a day he invented the machine that would give High powerered enemas like six something like 60 lers of water in and out of your colon in in under a minute this is like intense and he gave himself two of those a day for some reason I don't know if it's because he was um even though he was married for something like 60 years he never once slept with his wife according to record um he never um he never yeah so there's some sort of crazy sexual oppression there U repression there but possibly yeah possibly just possibly they adopted all their kids little bit for example and he um that was it he was just so brainwashed by by LG white and how and and the the temperance movement when they were just like sex is evil masturbation is evil and you just you just can't do it so he just would would never have sex or do anything like that and he was just I think he was just a bit deranged you know from this this brainwashing but he did a lot of things I think that he did a lot of harm uh to people and and this was just he's he is the person that influenced America to get circumcisions and so that was um that was that was him you know that's why we did it and but it wasn't in order to help people or be more hygienic that's that's what he claimed that this is more hygienic and it reduces cancer rates that's true if you never wash yourself if you never wash your genitals um then it can increase your risk of getting penile cancer uh from the from the you know my previous studies I remember it being by a factor of three so your three times we're likely to get penile cancer if you don't wash under your forkin but if you do wash under your forkin there's no difference so it's it purely comes down to do you wash yourself or not you sick bastard if you do then it's fine there's no difference um but also penol cancer is is vanishingly rare especially before the era of HPV so you know three times a small number is still a small number you know and then if you just wash yourself there's no difference so that was that was a complete lie that was a complete myth and um he did it in order to make it difficult for people to masturbate and to fornicate that was his that was his view on it and to deter people from that and then people figured out lube and then that was sort of the end of that story and so everyone was going back to having sex and masturbating but the practice of of circumcision stuck around because they didn't know that this was just about masturbation for forication they thought that this was oh this is actually healthy for my kid and so they did that and they they had no idea but that's why that's why he did that and that's why he pushed that hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own questions please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest of the Q&A okay wait wait talking about kids and Helm that's another roll in so let's see about that one shall we okay so this was asked earlier by D she wants to know what your opinion on brain development in children with a primarily carnivore diet is like and why schools push high carb foods do people really not know or is it intentional to dumming down the kids you know the teachers and the and the schools I mean at that level they have no idea so they just think this is what you're supposed to do this is what the guidelines are so yeah this is this is great and and of course course they wouldn't do that they whoever they are would never promote a diet that's bad for kids because who would do that well  and evil people will and they do you know the food companies know damn well that this stuff is really bad it causes disease causes metabolic dysfunction causes harm and you know they they don't care you know they they're happy with that um you know c means has been a whistleblower for the for the food uh Industries and um I believe he's shown what the pharmaceutical companies are up to as well but you know he was saying that you know he that all the the food companies know that their processed food cause harm they cause metabolic distress they cause dysfunction they cause disease and they know that and I know they know that because I've been in the board meetings with them while they talked about it so they know at least and you know the schools once it gets down to that level I mean they're just worker bees at that point they're just just sort of doing what they're told and they're just expecting that everybody above them is a benevolent uh Angel and just wants the best for everybody maybe or maybe they just don't care to to think about it or find out as to brain development on Carnivore yeah I think that's going to be a number one the best thing for kids in brain development think of it this way prior to agriculture the adult male brain capacity was 11% larger than it was 10,000 years ago directly after Agriculture and that's continued to today so there an 11% drop immediately that has persisted in women it's more pronounced it's 177% so the brain size dropped 177% bam 10,000 years ago and that's persisted so that's developmental that can't really be anything else you've affected the development of that child and now that child could not develop to their genetic potential so that's wrong and just because well I'm smart and I grew up on a it good for you you're not as smart as you would have been you're not as tall as you would have been your brain isn't as developed as it would have been it's not as large as it would have been you are not the person you could have been maybe you're a very nice person but you are not the person you would have been I'm not the person I would have been that I could have been that I should have been none of us are you know unless we were actually raised by a wonderful set of parents that actually did carnivore before we were born during and after pregnancy and that's happening now there are more and more people doing that and their kids are thriving and their brains are are much larger they're off the percentile chart and so why is that well you're not eating well first of all you're just eating things that you're designed to eat and your body's going to develop the way it's designed to develop pure and simple you can stop right there but if you want to know a bit more detail um kids are always in ketosis in infancy and in uh the womb they're in ketosis and when breastfeeding they're in ketosis and early on they're in ketosis why is that because ketones across the blood brain first of all ketones are your brain's primary energy source for most of your of your the cells in your brain some still run on glucose most run on ketones and that's very important for the fuel and for the mitochondrial health of your brain and development of your brain secondly ketones cross the blood brain barrier and reconstitute into fatty acids which are the used as the building blocks for the physical structures of your brain your brain is made out of fat and cholesterol this is something you have to have in abundance or you will not grow your brain properly and so this gives your brain the building blocks and this is why kids need to be in ketosis because they need ketones in going into their brain so they can build fat and so that's a major major portion so you keep stuffing in carbs and sugar you are kicking them out of ketosis you are suppressing their Ketone levels and you are suppressing their brain development you're also blocking out necessary nutrients like you need meat and you but you need that to be your sole diet because if you eat other things that's replacing the nutrients in the meat so you're not getting as enough as much meat you're not eating as much meat you're not getting as many nutrients and you're getting other things they can be anti-nutrients they can block the you know Tannis can bind up proteins and other sorts of nutrients and oxalates and Fates and and um so many other things will block and disrupt your body's ability to absorb and utilize different nutrients you have proteas Inhibitors like in wheat and soy and many other things that stop you from absorbing amino acids you're doing low fat diets or your brain is made out of fat your body is made out of fat cholesterol you need this stuff and so you're really limiting yourself and you're poisoning yourself you're giving yourself direct toxins neurotoxins there are a lot of neurotoxins that plants develop to to damage the brain caffeine being one of them that's a neurotoxin and an insecticide side that was developed to fry the brains and nervous system of insects trying to eat those plants so you know all there are so many things that we put in our body that really should never be there and again it just comes back to that Sentinel point if you eat what you're designed to eat your body's going to work the way it's designed to work and if you don't it won't so you need to find out what our bodies are designed for what our species is designed for and you look back at biology you look back at our historical past the immutable law of biology is that of adaptation what you have been adapting to the longest is what you're designed for so we've been eating meat we've been apex predators for over two million years the definition of an apex predator is a carnivore apex predators eat other animals that is a definition in terms and we were eating meat a long time before that but we were apex predators for at least two million years so we have been evolving and adap adting to meat for millions of years so we are designed for it we are optimized for it we've only started eating plants regularly very recently and it caused a huge disruption in our health and development immediately 10,000 years ago which has persisted and you look at Native populations that go from their Hunter gather mostly Hunter past like the Plains Indians in America who in the 1800s were eating a bunch of bison and they were the tallest population on Earth that's a study that came out in 2001 showing that and now that's very different they're not as tall they're suffering from serious chronic disease obesity diabetes cancer and all these sorts of things which did not exist in their population to any great extent prior to the adoption of a western diet and they were called Western diseases back then they're still called Western diseases when you're talking about the context of Native Americans I was just reading a book on this talking about the health and changes like yeah when they started westernizing started getting developed sort of structure they started getting Western diseases and and diseases of civilization and and all these sorts of things it was just like this has been written about for for literally like recently going back centuries and yet we're not putting it together that that this is this comes about from eating this garbage food and not eating what we're supposed to eat and designed to eat which is daddy meat that's it who in your opinion would benefit from reducing the population or and the intelligence of the general population oh who would benefit from that oh gosh I don't know any any sort of psychopath but you know I mean there are a lot of people there there you're never going to run shy of of narcissists and megalomaniacs in the human race and so there's always going to be someone that thinks they can do everything better they can do everything right or that they deserve everything and they should be running everything everything and they want to control people you know power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely and so when you start gaining power and getting more and more power you want more and so you know that tends to be the way especially and you know good way to do that is through government and as Thomas Jefferson said the the nature of the world is for government to grow and for Liberty to yield and so government is going to grow and grow and grow and grow and grow because these are the aspirations and and and machinations of different sorts of power hungry maniacs and people's power is going to people's Liberty is going to go back and go back and go back and go back and then we're we're sort of we have our backs against the wall at this point and now because we have our backs against the wall now people are saying well we need this is this hasn't worked the American experiment has failed and so now we need to go to you know Glo now we need to try something new and wonderful like Global communism and you and know that that's the WF sort of slogan it's like it's 2030 you own nothing and you love it I mean how much more like brainwashing propaganda can you get hey you don't own anything and it's great you love it you're like what the hell are you talking about so if I don't own anything who does oh no one owns anything everything's no no no someone owns things that's how the world works so if I don't own anything if you don't own anything if everyone doesn't own anything that means that very select few people own things and so what does that mean that means everyone's a slave so you work but you're your the product of your labor is not your own that goes to someone else you are given a place to live you are given food you are given just enough to keep you happy and you keep working like a busy little worker be but you're never going to rise up above that you're always going to be where you are unless you have some sort of you know political sort of connections but that's really it they're going to keep things too class so they they want to go back to aristocracy they want to go back to oligarchy they want to go back to this Gentry class where like they're in charge no one else is and everyone else live is living in serfdom well we've done that for thousands of years and it and it sucked frankly and um you know we don't we're not we don't want to do that anymore we've had these a few bright spots of freedom and liberty for the common people and that that that tends to get some sort of megalomaniac that wants to take control and take over and they end up doing it and so you know you have you know the the democracies in ancient Greece lasted about 150 years generally uh democracies generally ended up in tyrannies and autocracies because they just once people figured out they could just vote themselves more money they you know they never work again you know and they just sort of vote vote vote vote vote so that's why Rome started a republic you know a representative Republic and that helped this disseminate some of the the the power around it wasn't like a direct democracy and that helped for and that lasted hundreds of years lasted longer than America has you know and then you know Caesar came in and said yeah we're going back to Empires and then people said no we're not going to do that so they killed Caesar and then kept the Empire I like well you should have kept Caesar then because he was actually doing a good job and you didn't like cast yourself into Civil War um but then Rome lasted you know another several centuries and um you know and then you had uh America that popped up and that sort of influenced other spheres you know the Magna Carta and all these sorts of things little spots here and there that sort of just gave people back their freedom and control and then and then they just wash up again you know so we're sort of looking at that right now we we're watching the door of Freedom close on the end of that and look back and was like oh thousand years ago thousand years from now I like oh yeah there was this really good spot worked really really well and sh you know closed shut and then it took however many hundreds of years to for people to crawl themselves crawl their way out of slavery um that's what we're looking at right now so I you know there are a lot of people there's no there's G to be no shortage of people that are willing to enslave their fellow man and profit from their misery and suffering I mean you have the food companies doing it now you know they know that this stuff causes disease and they do it anyway to keep them addicted and keep them profitable and then they also invest in the in the pharmaceutical companies because they then sell them the diabetes medications and the you know all the different sorts of uh meds to treat the different illnesses that they have you know to me that's that's malice of forethought you know that this is causing harm you know this is causing disease you know this is killing people and then you and then you sell them the drugs that can help mitigate that I mean that that shows you know what you're doing you know it causes harm and you're doing it on purpose so that you can profit off that I mean that's that's something you should go to prison for that's something you should probably be exec well it should be think about think about the think about the the cigarette companies you know I mean they they spent decades denying that cigarettes caused harm or were addictive and that they were going to court and they're saying well you have these studies and those studies and and then they say oh but our studies say this our studies show the exact opposite I mean oh oh what can we do well you know then they got then they got those leaked um boardroom meetings the the thebco memos showing that they they damn well knew that this stuff caused disease it caused harm and of course it was addictive and the fact they were trying to Target kids to get them addicted early like any drug dealer like any any cartel you know they want to they want to addict kids early so that they can have you know an addict for life you know really disgusting human beings and and so they knew they they got done for perjury and all that sort of stuff but you know what they didn't get done for and they got fined for you know $400 billion I think the settlement was and and then the government just took that and you know wasted it um you know and they had some other payouts and things like that but you know what they didn't do is they didn't arrest these people and say Hey you are intentionally poisoning people and you knew it was causing cancer you knew it was causing empyema you knew it was causing death and yet you did it knowingly knowing that it was doing that like that's they caused the deaths of tens of millions of people and destroyed the health of of probably billions so why the hell don't they go to jail why don't why don't they face a firing squad I mean they should I mean you know it's it's I think honestly we we we live in a darker time now that we've gotten rid of public executions for like this I mean I I really do you know it used to be that that people that committed treason and sold out the safety of of hundreds of millions of Americans died you know and then you had people selling us out selling secrets you know leaking the nuclear um nuclear um weapon technology to the Soviets because they felt that the Soviets should win and they're better and the communism is so good you need to die you know you potentially cause the death of you know millions and millions of Americans if if those nukes ever hit hit our soil um why why would you ever bat an eye about executing someone like this well you know if you can execute someone like that why aren't you executing someone who is knowingly causing the death and harm to tens of millions of people hundreds of millions of people around the world you someone who goes around and poisons a well just for the sake of poisoning people you know they die you know they were lynched they were hung like how is this any different you you know this is causing harm and unlike the PO unlike the um unlike the uh the well poisoner it's just this random act of evil I mean you're you're doing you're selling them The Poisoned well water knowing that it's going to kill them that that's just sick these are sick people yeah and um and so you know the food companies are doing this now you know the Pharmaceuticals comp companies are you know not much better I mean they're they're they're likely in bed with the food companies and whether they know what's happening I don't know but if they do know then I think that would amount to a criminal act but what they do say and have said is that it's not really a good business model to cure diseases the Better Business model is to find something that they can they can paper over and Band-Aid different symptoms that so they can they can have them again addict them for life so you get put on people on blood pressure medications since they're 30 and you got them for you know the rest of their life or you get people on different you know medications they get diabetes when they're 10 awesome they're on these medications for the rest of their life so I think it was Kelly means it might have been someone else who said that that they they heard a pharmaceutical executive saying once um asked a question say you know do you know what my favorite medication that our company makes is and like oh what's that you know you're curing cancer and kids you know something Noble no my favorite um medication that our company makes are any medication that causes side effects that we have medications that treat okay these are sick people you know they're saying they want you to suffer so that they can sell you more drugs that's disgusting disgusting to me and these people are disgusting they should be criminally prosecuted if it if if they can prove that this was um you know if this was done knowingly it's never gonna happen if if you if you didn't if you're not going to do it to the tobacco companies you know I mean who the hell are you gonna do it I'm with you they deserve but yeah I totally agree with you malice equals murder so uh I figure I'll give way to your your start comments over here so that maybe you can get to answer some questions so people done super chats and stuff yeah definitely so I'll I'll get to these so we have about eight super chats here everyone and I'll I'll I'll go through those and um and we'll see we have we have about 10 minutes so we should be able to get through these and see how we go af ter that so Vicky land out thank you very much for the"

        "body": "would bet that that goes down andyz thank you for the would bet that that goes down andyz thank you for the Super Chat my partner has chronic pancreatitis the doctor said she is not allow partner has chronic pancreatitis the doctor says she is not allowed or supposed to eat any fats fat containing foods okay will this diet be safe for someone who doesn't have a working pancreas uh yeah um it's it's the optimal diet for everyone in every condition because this is our optimal diet as a species so pancreatitis is an issue because the pancreas obviously is inflamed that's the itis part of that uh chronic meaning it's just ongoing when you have when you have inflamed pancreas and it's caus and it's sort of being damaged um it's hard on the pancreas when it when it's producing the enzymes that it needs to produce so it produces lipase it produces proteas also produces amas and light and um that is you know they're all these enzymes that break down food we eat so you know just forgoing fat and then not producing lipase is isn't isn't the only thing you have the proteas and the amalay you know that are going to be break down these other sorts of things so you're still going to have your pancreas working and so one thing when you have acute pancreatitis you basically just don't eat anything at all you go in the hospital and they fast you and just put you on liquids um just just just IV nutrition there are things like Creon that that are sort of these pancreatic enzymes that sort of help you break down your food like if someone has complete pancreatic insufficiency I believe it's Creon if I if I'm not misremembering that um you know that they can they can get help with but no I mean you you're going your pancreas is going to be working no matter what you eat so you might as well eat the thing that's actually good for you and is going to reduce inflammation like fat and the carbs are going to are going to increase inflammation and even just you know because that caus metabolic distress that raises insulin that causes that causes inflammation the different plants cause inflammation and then suppressing ketones not having enough ketones and uh and fat are going to be a problem because higher Ketone levels actually suppress directly suppress inflammation and so I would expect she would actually get better you know if the if anything if she Chang her diet in any way I would say fast she just stop eating everything let her pancreas rest but if she's okay to eat then she should still eat what she should eat she should still eat the healthiest thing that's available to her which is fatty meat because that's the healthiest thing that anybody can eat and I would expect it to help and I would not expect it to hurt her um any more than any food would and so you know she needs some some digestive enzymes or something like that like the the Creon then you know that's something that she might need to might need to look at but um no I I would I would fully disagree with that I think that's that's her doctor's own personal bias and they just there oh Fat's bad Fat's bad oh my God you have to stop eating fat and I was just like dude think about it for two seconds protein carbohydrates both need to be broken down by enzymes from the pancreas so what what's why is lip such a bad thing you know I mean maybe there's a reason but I don't know it and I wouldn't I wouldn't expect it to be to be the case hope that helps uh super sticker from from Tim yeah thank you so much for that I appreciate that Tim and Peter Weeden um question further info strict on carnivore um I think that strict carnivore yeah um but I think this was added in oh further info on that question was use strict Carn yeah so strict carnivore uh you have to look at stress and get out other things in your environment and uh and and cut out the Beef Pork no sorry not the beef the pork chicken and farmed fish especially farmed fish is terrible um and just cut out the dairy for good measure um you just just play it as safe as possible and just go red meat and water and um and reduce stress and I would expect that to [Music] improve might he also look into environmental toxins yeah definitely um yeah just try to clean up your whole exposure profile you know food's obviously the most important thing because we we shovel that into our face every single day but you obviously you do get exposures in other ways as well so yeah I don't don't know of any other environmental exposures that are going to raise triglycerides um but I have seen stress do it and um theoretically L linolic acid could do it as well so yeah but yeah just cleaning up everything you know and then you just cover your bases you know because you never know you know and either way it's going to help you in other ways you you you cut out all all all these different exposures even if it doesn't improve your triglyceride it'll improve other things and so you know that's that's never a Bad Thing uh andyz um thank you again for the"

        "body": "never a Bad Thing uh andyz um thank you again for the never a Bad Thing uh andyz um thank you again for the Super Chat I'm gassing out low energy um on high-intensity workouts when zero carb do I need to add more salt to water when working out for elect extra electrolytes possibly some people do um but just experiment with yourself you can just try that I don't even use salt at all now and I I haven't I really don't know the last time I used salt it's been it's been months and months and months the only only salt I get that isn't just in the meat itself is like at a at a restaurant or something like that when um if they cook it they add salt to it as in the cooking but I never add salt so I just you know like the taste now and then they add a bit of salt it's where it tastes too salty I don't really like it so salt to taste that's always been my advice if your body's telling you you need more salt and then go for it if you want to try having some salt and more water go for it there are other things that can happen though I don't know how long you've been doing carnivore but once you've been zero carb and actually zero carb for a few weeks you generally feel a lot better and you have better energy but definitely in a few months because this has this has further knock on effects that you then become much more attuned to keto ketosis and running on ketones but I mean you have you make carbs all the time anyway you know so you should have those available um pre-workout drinks post-workout drinks those are all poison you need to get rid of them those those will screw up your workouts you know because of the artificial sweeteners or even if they have sugar but if they don't have sugar and they have artificial sweeteners those are not good those uh I I've I've I've seen that in patients that have cgms constant glucose monitors and it makes their blood sugar sort of go all over the place and I've seen it myself myself I've tried taking you know Branch chain amino acids which I used to love I thought that was just a GameChanger in my workouts when I was just eating you know a regular diet and I would take BCAAs for a workout I'd have great workouts I'd have like a rugby tournament I'd just be Gass at the end of the day I'd take BCAAs and go into the finals feeling like just just fresh and ready to go and just you know kill it now or when I when I went carnivore I was like oh you know are these still going to help I would take it really cut down on my workout actually I didn't feel nearly as good on the workout so I'm like okay probably the sweeteners and the crap that they put in it because the BCAAs are great but the sweeteners are not so I would definitely get rid of those also you need to remember that if you eat during the day you are going to get lethargic and you're going to have a terrible workout so try to train fasted um always train always play on an empty stomach always train hungry because you're you're sort of telling yourself physiologically that like you need to go and get a kill that's what your body expending energy is is to fight mate and kill so you can eat so your body's going to give you that energy you know if you have just eaten a whole big meal your body's going to turn into a rest and digest metabolism you're going to go into a lethargic State you're going to pump in a lot of your you're going to dedicate a lot of your blood down to your intestines to digest this food and absorb it and that's blood that's not available for your brain and your body and your muscles and so you're going to you're going to be more lethargic and so I would do that as well I would just not eat before you work out even if you're not working out till the end of the day if you if you need to eat something I eat a very small amount and then you know stay sort of just you know take the edge off but still be you know hungry and and see how that goes you know if that if that doesn't help and you find that putting some salt in your water helps great so be it you know that probably isn't the thing that you'll need to do for the rest of your life um but some people find that they need to uh especially early on when they're getting um used to their body running slightly differently with um you know different metabolism so that that's what I would try uh let's see here just a couple more Peter Weeden uh question 60 years old six heart attacks from 2008 um cabbage in 2012 that's a bypass surgery um CT angio Perth in August great result patent graphs no progression Believe last two events in 21 and 22 from extremely high stress Dr Bryce and Prof Watts want meds me no opinion well you know I I think at the end of the day this is this is ultimately up to you the patient always always should have the final say and I'm I'm sure um you know Dr Bri and and Professor watts would agree with that even if they don't agree that um that it's a good idea to be off of them it is important that people have autonomy and and in their medical decisions and so if that's something that you're concerned about or you don't think you need then you are you are fully within your rights to say Hey you know i' i' I'd rather go another approach and doctors are here to give advice and to help and to counsel but it's to counsel it's not to direct it's not to command you know if you're passed out and you've had a heart attack you know unless unless you have a directive you know doctors's going to make the best medical decision to save your life and to help you that they can or if they think look this is this is this is not salvageable they're going to be you know they're going to be a lot of trouble and you talk to the family say okay look we we probably would recommend they don't do anything here you know you're going to make you're make a medical decision in an emergency but other than that you have control of this you even have control when you're passed out you have a thing saying do everything you can to save me great or you know don't go past this point fine um that's good too so when you're conscious you definitely have a choice so you know you had heart attacks six heart attacks in four years which is impressive um and you mentioned sort of allude to two events in 2021 and 22 um I don't know if those were full on heart attacks but there some sort of events and high stress but you're saying that now you have very painton graphs and no progression so if you have no progression and and great results and everything's good and everything's stable I mean it's reasonable to keep doing what you're doing and um you know have everything's stable like if things start getting worse okay well then maybe you need to rethink what you're doing I'm sure what what the good doctors are concerned about is is is trying to stop something before it progresses but if it's been a number of years and you've had no progression well um that's pretty good then whatever you're doing seems to be working and even in the face of high stress you know that can be um that can be difficult you know on your heart you know high stress levels can absolutely damage your heart and damage the vasculature of your heart as well and almost certainly leads to atherosclerosis so that's something that's very important to get under control is your stress levels um I don't know which medications there suggest gesting but there are a lot of different opinions on these sorts of things you know for instance uh Dr multra who's an Interventional cardiologist in England he wrote a book called a statin-free life and he goes through the data for going on statins and so whenever a patient talks to him about statins you know he goes through the literature with them and and gives them the choice is this something you'd like to be on I'll support your decision either way um and so so you can just just take a look at those things arm yourself with that information so that you can make the best decision that you can for your body I absolutely firmly believe there are medications that are very helpful to people um and I believe that others aren't so helpful and are really just there to perpetuate the drug companies and not and not People's Health so you need to sort of take a look at those and see which ones you think are there to help you or would help you and which ones you wouldn't really want to I would look at the interview I did with Dr multra um asem on my YouTube channel and then the the solo video that I did by myself called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease and it just goes through the history goes through the studies about how cholesterol was really used as a scapegoat so if cholesterol wasn't the problem cholesterol lowering medications aren't the solution if that's true so take a look at the studies take a look at the data and see what you think and uh and then you'll be able to make your your own decision on that um but that was a good video I saw that one oh thank you yeah so I think that that's important important stuff to know about ye ah and uh Mr Reen again thank you very much uh for the"

        "body": "ill be Jamie McCulla thank you very much Jamie for the ill be Jamie McCulla thank you very much Jamie for the Super Chat how is it possible for me to eat 25 pounds of meat in 10 days and only have two small poops and lose six pounds and not be constipated um you know magic obviously you know some sort a wizard did it you know um but uh the the thing is is that you're you're absorbing 98% of the of the meat that you're eating you know because you're not eating it with a bunch of plants that disrupt your digestion fiber that blocks 30% of the absorption proteas Inhibitors fiic acid um you know oxalates all these different sorts of things that panins that will bind and block you from absorbing your food and you're not taking with a bunch of fiber so meat when eaten alone you absorb nearly 100% of it like 98% of it if you take out the gristle you're just eating the soft muscle meat and the soft fat without the gristle you'll absorb basically 100% of that and so you almost won't have any sort of stools and that was the point of a Salsberry steak back in the 1800s was you ground up hamburger meat in such a way that it filtered out that tough gristle and you only had the soft meat and then you added did that because often times the the the fat was stuck to the gristle and so you needed to add in more fat and that was because you know people with like Crohn's and all sort colitis these horrible digestive issues they had to just completely rest their gut absolutely they could not have anything going through there and so when you and when you got rid of the gristle you would absorb 100% of it so you wouldn't go to the bathroom at all so contrast that with plants that you know around 95% of of it it is fiber and you can't digest you can't break it down it has to come out so you're eating a bunch of plants with fiber in it 95% of that has to come out the other end the converse you know is completely inverse uh with meat you're absorbing 98% only 2% is coming out or so and so 25 pounds uh in 10 days and U you know let's think about that so 25 PBS 2% of that you know you're just talking about like what is that like just half a you know half a pound something like that it's not much um yeah it's it's like it's half a pound so um you're you're going to have half a pound of stuff come out in 10 days that's not much right so yeah two small poops and lose six pounds yeah and so you know constipation isn't about isn't about the frequency it's about the the um the uh consistency and so if those are soft that means you're eating enough fat a little bit extra Fat's coming out and you're keeping that all soft and so uh that's great so that's why you're absorbing 98% of the meat that you're eating you eat less gristle and you'll have even less than that come out so you know well done with that it's really funny you know people just really can't get their heads around that you see the vegans like freaking oh my god oh what's going on this must be terrible you know pooping as a carnival like yeah you're just jealous you know that we don't have to crap eight times a day you know and just like I mean what else are you doing in your life you're eating six meals a day you're crapping 10 times a day I mean like what do you you don't even have time to like get a job no one of these people are just trolling on the internet all the time they can't even you know have time to work you're just sitting on the toilet you know just going oh my God you guys suck you know so it's like you know it just doesn't make any damn sense I mean think about how much of your life you get back now where you're not just sitting on the toilet it all the time I mean my God I I had a friend of mine that I played rugby with and he was just oh yeah you know the more poops a day like the better I'm like I don't see how that follows and I was just like so you go up to he's like oh yeah I'll go like six times a day I'm like what like I was appalled you know for me at the time I was I was I wasn't full carnal then but I always just really only ate meat it was like once a week you know that was that was always normal and um you know and that those the thing just oh are you regular it's like yeah it's regular it's every Wednesday regular you know and um um but yeah I just God I I just I at the time I was just aul I was just like that just that just sounds awful you know that yeah I i' wonder it is it one of the prevalences of like col disruption or colon cancer or even perhaps ruptures that we just use our colons too damn much you know I mean I think so go to the toilet all D and time like that it's got to do damage I I I absolutely think so there have been studies you know looking at you know doing colonoscopies on thousands of people and looking at the risk factors and they found that constipation wasn't risk factor meat wasn't a risk factor fat intake wasn't a risk factor all these things weren't risk factors but the two things that were uh were increased number of bow motions a week more than 15 bow motions a week so you know on average just over two a day and uh more fiber so the more fiber people ate you know more you have to you know excrete and so I think you're just overworking your colon is really what it is you're just you're just overworking it overdoing it and you're just wearing it out just like heart failure you're just sort of overworking your heart just pushing it against high blood pressure high gradient and you're just you're not giving yourself good food anyway so the tissue starts to break down anyway and you're just just putting under too much stress and it just starts to fail and so that was that was the risk factors for diverticulosis which is sort of a failure um of the distal colon which then causes outp which is outpouching of your distal colon which can then rupture become infected and cause all these sorts of problems so and constipation um they they found different Interventional studies with fiber that have actually shown that more fiber caused more symptomatic bloating and constipation and actually getting rid of fiber improved symptoms eliminating fiber eliminated symptoms so this is just like blocks of wood this is a bunch of sawdust they actually add sawdust to many foods to up the the fiber profile because again fiber is good for you isn't it and it's an essential nutrient so you have to have it so they add sawdust because sorry ladies and gentlemen sawdust is uh fiber cellulose that's what it is so obviously that's good for you then um so that's a bit crazy but um yeah so they'll add it to that and that just just just makes bulk and that was the thing oh you want bulk and then you can your your bowel can push against this okay was pushing at this you're not eating enough fat so it's getting rock hard and it's just big block I mean that's what's going to cause obstructions really is getting these big blocks of wood stuck your colon and so and you as we age you know people get neurogenic colons they don't move as fast they don't move as well and so they'll they'll get harder and drier you're eating all this fiber you're taking more fiber to push it through and you're just getting bigger and bigger blockages so yeah I think that that's definitely not a great thing is um in general I haven't had fiber in you know bloody six years so you know I'm and I've been better than I've ever been so yeah you you definitely don't need it anyway 70% of animals on Earth eat other animals they're carnivores they don't get any fiber and in fact herbivores that eat fiber you know break down some of that fiber so there're still they don't break down it fully but a cow is really good at that so they're their their stool is very very wet and sloppy whereas like horses they're not as good they can't digest it as much so it comes out just the balls of grass you know but um you know at least for the cow you I mean you know you can't say that it's fiber that's moving this along because they've broken down most of the fiber you know I'm sure some of it still still around because it's very hard to break down that's the whole point is that fiber is very it's very difficult to turn plant tissue into animal tissue very difficult so if you're not biologically designed to do that you know stay in your lane you know let the pros do it and um and then eat them you know and you'll be fine yes yeah tasty cool all right man I should I should run sort of w ent a little over time but I just wanted to get to the"
