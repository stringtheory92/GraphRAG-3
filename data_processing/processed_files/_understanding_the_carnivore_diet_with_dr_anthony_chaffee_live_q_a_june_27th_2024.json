        "body": "t on that one knockum Knight thank you so much for the t on that one knockum Knight thank you so much for the Super Chat can you explain more about weightlifting and muscle gain Pro progress on cornor I is really on me that this about this diet so I'm using your answers to fight him uh well you know the thing is is that you just just results speak better than anything so you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you do that twice a day when you're when you're lifting weights and working hard train your ass off work really hard eat a lot of meat don't eat before you train eat after you train you'll feel much better and you'll get better workouts and you and you'll recover much better and you won't get sore and so you'll be able to work out more have more uh workouts during the week if that's something that you want to do there are different camps on that some people say that you know you want more sets and and and and a higher load and that helps you uh build muscle and and build strength and others say no you don't want to do that you want to have big intense workout and then let your body rest for few days and all that sort of stuff uh even before you do the next muscle group so there there there are different schools of thought so you do what's right for for you but it's from a diet standpoint you're you're going to be able to put on lean body mass more easily on a carnivore diet than any anything else you can put on more mass more weight by eating a whole bunch of carbs but that's fat glycogen and water weight because when you're eating a lot of excess carbs this is bad for your body this is not this is not contentious this is what kills diabetics is high blood sugar and so your body tries to get this stff stuffed away stores it in glycogen in your muscles and liver glycogen pulls in two water molecules for every one uh molecule of glycogen so you get water logged muscles in liver and then you also deposit intramuscular fat and intrahepatic fat and intra organal fat and this is called myosteatosis when it's in your muscles and this is a pathological sign that we see on MRI very commonly it's actually uncommon to see it these days um at least in um in in the MRIs that I've seen so sure you can gain more bulk by eating a whole bunch of crappy carbs and sugar and nonsense like that but that's not muscle and so when you go into a cutting phase you're going to lose all that and so oh yeah well that that yeah you you can't put on muscle unless you put on fat at the same time who told you that you know yeah there all these these obese Lions you know walking around until they get in their cutting phase you know like this stupid stupid um it's you know the the golden ear bodybuilders Vince Gonda Serge nuub these sorts of guys they were staking eggs steaking eggs steaking eggs Sur new bra would eat four to six pounds of horse meat a day it's French the French eat more horse than other people do and nothing wrong with it though uh as far as nutrition is concerned and absolute monsters absolute monsters and this was before the the steroid Heyday so it's um it's absolutely uh in your best interest to do a carnivore diet when you're when you're lifting weight so so just do that you know just uh you know just just eat a whole bunch of meat you know point out the you know Vince G and and serge newra you know one thing with Ganda is he thought that once a week you had to you had to load up on cars because he thought that was the only way to store up your liver glycogen that's not actually true uh you you do store liver glycogen and muscle glycogen whether or not you eat carbohydrates but at the time that was our understanding of biochemistry and then uh actually speaking with Professor Tim noes who's one of the foremost Sports Medicine doctors and scientists and sports physiologists in the world he has over 750 published um papers studies and books on the subject and I mean the man's prolific and he's he's just an absolute pillar in the field and he is very clear that you you do not I you do not need nor want carbohydrates in your training as a top tier athlete because you get the exact same performance and in fact I would argue that you eventually once you're fully keto fat adapted you get better performance that was certainly my experience um you have unlimited nearly energy potential because even in an athlete who has 5% body fat someone very lean they're storing in their body fat 100,000 calories of energy in their body fat right so you don't need to carb load you know a th000 calories of pasta or 2,000 calories of pasta you've got a 100,000 calories and fat stored in your body at 5% body fat for the average sized person so this is not um you know it's not hard like you get you get way better um access to energy and you're not going to run out of energy and crash and all these sorts of things and he was very clear that glycogen is not actually um the the muscle's primary source in fact your body uses that up to then get to the fat and once you get to the fat you you're oxidizing fat you know up to your maximum V2 Max you know they they used to say after 85% V2 Max you can only burn carbs No in fact it's you only burn carbs if you have excess carbs to burn once you get through those and you're a ketogenic State you're just you're just um you're just burning fat after that and he's shown that in clinical trials with athletes right and they've been done in in recreational athletes there's also been done in in uh high performance Elite world class athletes and like ultramarathoners and things like that so you know that I would watch I would look at at Prof noes and things like that so you don't you first of all there was a there's the what is it the faster study by volik 2016 where he talked about um well basically showed these these ultramarathoners and I had 20 of them they've been doing keto for over six months so they're very adapted and they had you know brilliant performances and they found that their glycogen actually was better and recovered faster in the keto group so the ketogenic um uh Mar oners recovered their they did muscle biopsies they recovered their they had similar muscle glycogen before exercise and they had more glycogen directly after exercise and they recovered their gly their muscle glycogen uh faster as well after they exercised and three hours afterwards they had similar amounts of of um muscle glycogen between the keto fueled athletes that were not ref feeding or eating anything else and the carb fueled athletes who are just sucking down sugar water and things like that so no long story short um you can definitely put on a lot of muscle um but you won't put on the fat the glycogen and the water weight and so it may look oh you could be getting bigger fast bigger is not the point more muscular is the point more lean body mass is the point and that's what you're going to get with a carnivore diet is it's not going to be you know just putting on a bunch of fat glycogen and water weight so uh yeah uh that's what you tell them and then you just prove it with you r results that's the main thing Andy thank you for the"

        "body": "r results that's the main thing Andy thank you for the r results that's the main thing Andy thank you for the Super Chat I'm not seeing something with it there we go Andy V says 58y old female carnivore for four months 7525 fat to protein ratio not a pound lost fasting sugars down to 30 which is huge for me though um blood pressure is also down walking 30 minutes so the main thing is your health and uh the very further down on as a very distant number two is your body composition nowhere on that is the scale and how much you weigh because the the scale doesn't tell you anything about your health anything about your body composition you can put on muscle and lose fat and stay the same weight and that happens very commonly I I experienced the same thing I lost weight initially in the first sort of two weeks I lost like 23 pounds and then nothing I didn't lose anything for months months and months and months but I could visibly see myself changing in the mirror and because I was working out I was lifting weights and so I was putting on muscle and I was losing fat so I could see that and but I stayed the exact same way literally to the pound I stayed 243 pounds on the nose every single day for months but I was absolutely transforming physically and and my health was was dramatically better and I felt amazing on the Rugby field so you know I was able to go back and play rugby at 38 which was you know not not everybody can do that and I felt fantastic doing it um so that's the main thing your your sugars are down your your blood pressure is down also remember that if your blood sugars are up even at 130 you know that that's probably still too high and so if your doctor has prescribed you medications you should continue taking these medications until such time as your body has recovered enough that you don't need them if indeed that happens which it does for most people but don't just say like oh I'm doing this now so I don't need medications anymore that's not really the case you know especially with blood sugar and with blood pressure you have to be very careful about these things not everybody can fully come off medications although many people do fact I would say probably most people do um but they they all reduce their demand for them significantly so make sure you're still taking medications look at your body composition look at how your clothes are fitting take take progress photos once a month you know don't don't get too hung up on this it's it's um you know just focus on your health and how you feel first and foremost then body composition very just in second and see how you go you know and the other thing is too is that a lot of people have hormonal issues they'll have metabolic issues that that need to get better they need to heal and and before their body starts giving up their fat stores and so there are a lot of reasons for that and there's some markers that you can tell fasting insulin uh leptin levels these sorts of things if those are elevated you're not going to lose weight uh straight away necessarily some people do but most people don't when you have a very slowed and depressed metabolism your body just going to hang on to that fat a little longer and then as by eating enough meat so you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good every day and you do that and you exercise you're going to encourage your body and basically tell your body hey we're not in a famine anymore we don't need to we don't need to sequester all this um excess energy and you'll start using it so it's um it just takes time so some most people will lose weight straight away and quite dramatically some won't and it just has to do with their metabolism and their hormones and their body at that time so you just have to be careful uh to not get discouraged just because you don't have as dramatic weight loss results as other people do because everybody's coming from a different place they have different levels of health and they're they're going to react a little differently but long term you're all going to get there you're all going to get maximize Health you're all going to optimize your health and you will lose weight will lose body fat and you will be a lot healthier as a result of that uh there are a lot of Forums on this there's a lot of Facebook groups have been doing this for 20 years plus and this is a common thing some people just don't lose weight right away sometimes it takes a few months sometimes it takes six months a year a year and a half that's rare but it does happen so hopefully you're in you know the six-month group or even the four-month group and you'll start losing weight but just make sure you're eating enough eat until it stops tasting good and just focus on your health make sure you're taking medication if you still need medication if you're getting dizzy or getting low blood sugar that's obviously uh uh time to start reconsidering your your dosages of your medications and talking to your doctor about you know what uh what would be the appropriate dose for you so good luck with that don't be discouraged yo u'll you'll be fine Beth Rimer thank you again for the"

day 42 carnivore no caffeine and Ling last eight days really good job I get a normal solid stool in am no constipation later in the day I get loose stools I don't get solid and loose simultaneously they are separate with time any tips um yeah that's interesting it's you know if you're if you're eating something fatty and that's when you're getting the loose stools maybe you're eating more fat than your body can absorb if it's distant to that maybe something else is going on if you're getting hard dry Rocky stools and then otherwise you're getting like liquid stools regardless of the time of day that it happens it could be that you're actually more constipated than you think and you're getting these sort of semi blockages and then the liquid stool is sort of passing around that and you're getting liquid diarrhea it's called overflow diarrhea or spous diarrhea and so that's something to consider as well so if it's just sort of normal soft but formed stools and then more liquid stools you're probably on the other side of that you're probably having more fat than your body can can absorb as readily that's not doesn't mean that it's bad for you doesn't mean that you're sick or you have an infection it's just you know inconvenient um but if you're having really hard stools and then liquidy stools you're probably actually more constipated there's sort of a U-shaped curve so uh you have two little fat you'll get diarrhea you have too much fat you'll get diarrhea so you want to be Serv ofing that middle ground so you aim for one to two grams of fat per one gram of protein and um you know that's around you know 65 35 ground beef to 753 25 five around there and um so you're in that range and uh and see and adjust from there and if it's that's not enough fat you're sort of getting those harder drier more difficult stools along with the loose stools up the fat see it and they might have loose tools for a while but you get all that clear that blockages out of there and then your body will start sort of forming these things more naturally um it's a bit of a pain but uh you have to sort of play around with it to see and uh and also remember that it's not just coffee coffee is obviously major one but you know coffee caffeine tea uh but also artificial sweeteners magnesium supplements metformin which is a very common medication for diabetes that people are on all of those things can act as a laxative and so you need to um remember that and if there's any of that you know in in there you can't just adjust your your fat intake um and then after that if you think it is too much fat and and and you're not really absorbing it try staying away from the rendered fat try any more solid fat that's in the meat itself and yeah so so a few things to try anyway and and the other thing is you can do a a journal right what you eat when you eat it and when you're having solid or loose stools and see if there's a connection there because it could be that you're just having something with more fat than your body can contend with and then it just just comes out and if that's it then that's easy to to deal with but it's uh it's sometimes easier to see when it's on paper uh Leah aloha aloha from Maui it's my 49th birthday I just started a carnivore diet and just ate try tip to celebrate hey well that's great happy birthday and welcome to the club uh I'm sure you'll do really well with it and thanks for for giving it a shot you know because why not you know you can always go back if it's if it's not working for you but very very rarely does that happen Gish shoer says your thoughts on cornivore diet and extreme Combat Sports like Muay Thai is it possible yeah absolutely I I know a number of um uh Fighters professional fighters there's um oh God who I I'll try to remember but there's the there's is a UFC fighter right now that's um carnivore and how do I know this because he's uh carnivore bar sponsor him and he and he says he's carnivore so um and then there's a lot of top athletes um there's a more there's a boxer here in Perth that's giving it a try um there's uh Holland Gracie you know one of the Gracie family he's um head of Gracie jiujitsu in San Francisco I've had him on my podcast he does a carnivore diet and he says his his performance and training has just gone through the roof and um and numbers and numbers of athletes so yeah absolutely I mean I did I did Muay Thai and pancre so you know MMA uh for quite some time before I I switched over to rugby fulltime and it um I wasn't I I I went full-time into rugby and then went carnivore but I did dip back in and have trainings you know in in you know MMA and fighting things like that felt just like a like a different person now it's hard to say because you know I I transitioned to rugby full-time when I was 18 you know and so you know I go back at 2021 and I'm already you know uh uh an accomplished rugby player obviously my you know that training and years of maturity physically and mentally um are going to help when you go back into any sport you you're going to look at things you know very differently and and um you're going to be better at it so you know it's hard to say but um it's uh I definitely notied it a hell of a lot easier uh to train in any sport um Wilton Ziggler was the guy's name he's a he's an MMA fighter I'm pretty sure he fights in in uh in um the UFC so yeah you definitely do that any sport any Endeavor any health issue uh this can help op it's optimal nutrition you're giving your body the exact fuel that it needs to be optimal and if you're optimizing your health you're also going to be optimizing your athletic performance um you know there you know there are things like like different drugs and amphetamines and steroids that may give you a a shortterm boost to your athletic performance but do hurt you overall from a health standpoint but if we're just talking about nutrition what's optimal nutrition for you as a person should also optimize your health in general which will make you a better athlete right those two things should go together and so yes you can definitely do Muay Thai on this um okay then Laura

replacement um doc admit about taking aspirin and avoiding salt thoughts I would listen to her doctor so especially with things like aspirin uh for those sorts of procedures uh there's a high clotting risk High clotting risk um after the fact and you know especially if it's a mechan you know you're having a mechanical valve um the she's she's gonna well she's probably going to be put on warrin for the rest of her life if it's a you know if you're putting mechanical valves it just they they they'll clot up and uh they'll block off and you can throw off little emble and you'll get massive strokes and things like that so really not something you want to mess around with the salt you can sort of ask you know what's the salt about is that a blood pressure issue and all that sort of stuff um about 20% of people are a bit salt sensitive and and maybe should probably avoid it or or reduce it um for blood pressure issues they might have spikes in their blood pressure for instance other people don't and so um you know a lot of people find that that they're fine and and something that um Professor Steve finny who's been studying ketogenic diets for decades um you know he finds that some people you know need more salt on a carnivore diet I don't think you need salt necessarily especially long term I don't really use salt anymore in fact when salt gets put onto my food it just tastes too salty I don't really like it and so I don't use it and um I'm still here and I still have blood pressure and I still have electrolytes and so it's um it's not something you necessarily need when you're on an actual carnivore ketogenic diet that' be interesting to see you know if any studies are being done in that because the argument is is that we didn't really start using mineral salts until after the Agricultural Revolution started including plants and so maybe there's something to do with plants that you require more salt there's certainly insulin that gets involved so you know if your insulin's up or it's down it affects how much salt and electrolytes are being held in with your kidneys but the thing is is that you know people start with no insulin resistance and normal insulin when they're a child and then it raises up and up and up and up and up and so your body obviously has counter measures to the excretion of electrolytes at for and against right so if your if your insulin is going up and up and up you're not just going to sequester so much electrolytes that you die of hyperemia or hypernia right you have to keep that balanced or you die and so your body's obviously going to excrete more and then when you start reducing down your insulin all of a sudden like oh now it's too much okay sure you're losing some so sometimes people need to add more salt and need more electrolytes fine why wouldn't your body adjust back the other way though right because it started out only excreting a very normal amount for a normal amount of insulin and had to adjust up when you had more insulin now you don't have that so why wouldn't it go back I think it will in fact I think it did because I don't take salt and a lot of people don't a lot of the long-term carnivores don't so you know the thing is is that um you know I would I would 100% listen to her doctor and just just take his advice on board uh for now if she starts getting low blood pressure she starts having issues to do with electrolytes I mean is she on Carnivore I mean we haven't even didn't start with that didn't say my mom is a carnivore and she's having a valve replacement soon um so this you know every all these questions I just sort of assume you're talking about someone who's doing carnivore because that's the context that I'm that I that this this uh this uh Q&A session exists within and so um you know just keep that in mind uh but yeah I would I would 100% listen to her her doctor on on um on what to do posttop because that's uh that's very important you know things with Statin that's a bit more nuanced and it's really depends on the individual and it depends on how you feel about it it you know um and and so there are online resources and lectures and things like that and books you know like by Dr mahra like a statin-free life where he argues probably not all that great but some people could benefit how much do they benefit about five days you about five days if you've had a heart attack and take statins long term but that is a benefit you know um does that outweigh the the side effects and that's something that only only you as an individual can decide but as far as these things are concerned when you're getting surgery listen listen to the [Music] surgeon um so there's a question from carnivore Scott said what um what does Anthony say about how long it takes to get back to insulin sensitivity given I've been insulin resistant for decades just wondering it's uh you know how long is a piece of string it depends you know and so it's um it's different for different people but insulin resistance uh can actually correct fairly readily it depends on how high it is and how resistant you are I mean I had a guy whose insulin fasting insulin was 72 that should really never be above nine and um and you know 72 and in 6 to 8 weeks it was down to 35 right so we' already cut in half right so it it can move move but it takes a long time I mean even 35 is way too high um but you know depending on how high your insulin is you know we're talking months probably um probably less than a year even if it's very very high like I got 72 that's the highest I've ever seen actually um was his his fasting insulin of 72 and he was fully fasting he it was like 24 hours he didn't eat so uh and that and that dropped in half in um two months on a carnivore a strict ketogenic zerocarb carnivore diet so it's not this fuff around with you know fruit and honey and all that that sort of stuff is just meat that's it um but uh depending on where you are you know months probably but uh you know just either way it's going to go in the right direction don't worry overly much about it just make sure that you're doing well and that if you're diabetic that you're on Diabetes medications that that uh keep your blood sugar at a normal health y level uh Sher Hutchinson thank you very much for the"

        "body": "y level uh Sher Hutchinson thank you very much for the y level uh Sher Hutchinson thank you very much for the super chat um and and welcome again this is this is our our new visitor good evening I've been carnivore for six to eight weeks I have sasis in um Parkinson's along with neuropathy I am already experiencing changes uh give me some advice to keep going well that's that's great that you're already improving high fat a lot of fat and and really strictly ketogenic no outside carbohydrates that that don't exist in meat or organs and um for psoriasis and other autoimmune issues really a best idea to be just beef and water like beef lamb and water so the ruminant Meats you'll always do best with autoimmune issues if you're just eating red meat and water and uh the Parkinson's as well you just need to get you know very high fat your brain's made out of fat you need High ketone or you know good ketones enough ketones to run your brain properly and help rebuild your neurons check your B12 a lot of people have low B12 if it's in range it's probably low because most of the ranges for B12 or too low because these are an average for the community they're not the optimal range and how do you test this you go to five different labs in your same town that are owned by different companies and you you test your B12 on the same day and you'll have roughly the same number and they'll all have different reference ranges why is that why is one good one's High one's low why why is that none of them will be low because the low is just way too low um so that's because it's not an optimal range it is an average range and most doctors don't know that oh well that's within our range oh we were happy with that right no no no no that's an average that's an average for your patient population but people are sick and people getting blood tests are definitely more often sick and so who gets a blood test people that are unwell and so they get sent to get a blood test and and they rorm these things every every few years and the first few thousand people that come in that is the reference range so why are we looking at this as if that were the optimal range of course it's not we're not looking at healthy people we're not looking at 2,000 healthy people health individuals with no health issues and saying okay well that seems to be where healthy people are that's not what they're looking at they're looking at sick people too sick people old people obese people metabolically unwell people diabetic people um you people with cancer all these sorts of things that just that's just that's just the average so that's okay so it's not okay so B12 is typically too low so in America you want your B12 between 1100 and 1600 in the UK a Australia and and most of Europe um 800 to 1200 that's where you want this to be and that's that's generally a lot higher than most reference ranges go but it it it just depends so here in in Perth uh we use a a a clinic here and uh the upper range is 650 right so 700 will be too high and yet there's another Lab at 750 is fine so okay so that's fine so you get it done at one lab it's fine you get it done the other lab and your doctor goes oh my God you're at a toxic level you need to shut it down no um and then another one's 800 and another lab is a th so that actually gets into the good range but it goes way too low it goes down to like 150 that's way too low under 400 you can actually get demin and nerve damage right oxward showed in 2008 that if you had um B12 below like 320 uh for a prolonged period of time they tracked these people uh for five years did an MRI every year and they found after five years that they had uh shrunk their brain by 5% volume right not great that's in that normal range right because a lot of the normal ranges go down to 150 or 130 but under 320 under you know 320 or so you know you're you you can actually shrink your brain by 5% after five years so clearly that is a that is a true deficient level and so that's not where you want to be so keep that in mind high fat make sure you got B12 folate and a lot and and vitamin D you know get out in the sun eat fatty um uh animal fats that have a lot of vitamin D and things like that Cod Liver cod liver oil cod liver in its oil and uh butter grass-fed butter all these sorts of things um are all all beneficial so that's what I would do and exercise there's actually a studies called um pedaling for Parkinson's where if you um pedal on on a stationary bicycle even if it's like an automatic bicycle that actually moved your legs for you it would um uh and you got your rep range up to like you know I think it was like 80 to 90 RPM uh that and you and you maintain that for like 45 minutes four days a week I think for six weeks actually or eight weeks it actually significantly improved uh the motor functions of Parkinson's and and in fact when they stopped that those benefits actually persisted for another eight weeks before they started to come down so that shows that you're actually probably improving uh the nerves and the and the parts of your brain the control movement which is amazing so that's what I would do um that's what I would suggest to anybody with Parkinson's Arturo uh balanza thanks from Honolulu Hawaii well thank you it's good to see you um okay so uh Rebecca uh bavy um looks lik e she's a nurse so thank you very much Rebecca for the"

sodium for oenia not I don't I don't prescribe anything for osteopenia but uh drugs.com says long-term bis phosphinates yeah yeah it's a bisphosphonate okay um use associated with femur fracture and esophageal cancer she's been on keto two plus years active and healthy your thoughts thank yeah so um bisphosphonates are are a bit controversial um typically people put them on it and does it does it actually lower fraction fractures and all these sorts of things typically uh not as far as I understand and like you say that can actually increase um um fractures in some in some cases like femur fractures like NECA femur fract fractures things like that which sort of like the main main ones you know you break a hip you fall down and you uh some and 50% of people that that break break their hip uh actually die within the first year it's a 50% one-year mortality rate for a fractured hip at least it was when I was going through medical school so that's not good and uh and now you're taking a drug that makes that more likely so you know it's something that she needs to you know sort of think about with her doctor but I I can tell you that you can absolutely improve your bone density without medications with a proper human diet the textbook says that you can only put on bone density up until the age of 25 so you need to get as much as you can because after that just entropy everything's just fading away and dying which doesn't make sense because no other animal species on earth does that no other life form on earth does that you get your certain oh just just breaking down for the majority of your adult mature life you're just breaking down and dying do you see trees doing that no they live they're healthy and then they die you see animals live they're healthy they get eaten by something or they keep going and then they just die um so have healthy active adults that are hunting and running away from hunters and then one day they just sort of slow down a bit go to sleep and don't wake up and they don't they don't have this slow degenerative uh breakdown over years and decades and then finally just give it up and and just can't make it anymore that's not what happens uh in the Wilds while when they start slowing down they get get eaten by something sure but that doesn't happen in the zoo either uh they don't they don't just all getting decrepit and you know toothless lion drooling and walking into walls and things like that because they're so demented and and sarcopenic and that just doesn't happen and so why the hell would it happen to us and so you shouldn't you you got to eat the right thing you eat the right thing and your body will work the right way and uh that goes for your bones too so I I've seen people I have patience I had a lady in her must have been her late 60s um who came in a couple months ago and and she uh had a dexa scan eight months ago she had osteoporosis she went full lion diet carnivore only meat and water wasn't even taking calcium supplements wasn't taking bis phosphinates or any drugs and eight months later she got another dexa scan and she had normal bone density not only she do she have normal bone density for her age she had normal bone density for a 25y old woman right so that was that was a massive Improvement and uh I can't say everyone's going to get that sort of improvement but she did anyway and she also did resistance exercises if you're if you're doing strength training resistance training you will stimulate the bones to grow as well as the muscles to grow and if you're eating properly they'll actually do it and so I would suggest going not on a ketogenic diet but a full carnivore diet because ketogenic means you can have vegetables and things like that that don't have carbohydrates and those vegetables are going to have things like oxalates which are going to strip out calcium and demineralize your bone and make it very difficult for you to lay down bone density and and mineralize your bones and that's exactly what you need to do so I would cut all that crap out and I would only go to red meat and water and I would have her do as much resistance exercises as she can just body weight exercises light band work whatever is challenging for her to push resistance isometric is very good you know so if you're in like a sort of a shallow Hall and you can just push as hard as you can you just push and you just push and you just push until you get tired and you stop right um or you know you can lay down and and and push against the wall and just push or or even like um you know leg press machine you just put the weight up to a point that she can't do and she just presses as hard as she can for as long as she can and she's not GNA hurt herself you know she shouldn't be able to push so hard that she um damages herself um and just and just do those isometric sort of uh uh exercises and and that'll put pressure and force through the bones and through the joints and that will uh stimulate bone bone deposition as well and if she's eating properly she'll actually get it so I would get a Dexter scan do that and then get a dexas scan in a year or so see how you go and things are going the right way she probably doesn't need those medications does she because I agree they're not ideal so uh yeah that's uh that's what I recommend you can you can absolutely um sort this out with just a diet and lifestyle if it's the right diet and the right lif estyle so good luck to her Alex sain thank you for the"

        "body": "n down here below top five thank you very much for the n down here below top five thank you very much for the Super Chat been vegan for 25 years since birth have cidp Lyme disease IBS um and what is the best way to start adding meat to the diet worried about digestive issues with meat so first of all I'm I'm really I want to applaud you for just being open-minded enough to give this a try you know you were sort of raised vegan and um and now you know it's hard to get out of that and it's hard to sort of uh you know change something that you you've done your whole life especially if you've been raised to to understand that that's the best thing for you I mean sure your parents were were doing their best and thinking that that was the best thing for you and um you know we all do the best that we can with our kids and everyone's going to mess up unfortunately but um it's great that you're you're looking at this now and and I do think that that you can significantly improve your your issues with that so you are fully designed to eat meat you can have psychological Hang-Ups and you can get psychosomatic sort of Hang-Ups where you just like meat's bad meat's bad and and as you eat it and you're just you're expecting something to be wrong and so you manifest that as physical symptom that's very common there is nothing wrong in meat there's nothing that's going to harm you there's nothing that's bad for you this is what 70% of all animals on Earth eat and even herbivores opportunistically eat meat when they can there's nothing inherently harmful in meat uh some animals make little poisons and poison sacks and things like that that's not what we're talking about we're talking about just meat um there's nothing in normal meat that's harmful to you so just remember that and so even if you oh this feels so funny just know you're fully designed to eat this stuff your pancreas is set up to break these things down and absorb them very well like I said earlier you absorb these things you liquefy them and absorb them very quickly as long as you're not eating with plants that have a lot of digestive Inhibitors um so it's up to you I know a lot of vegans who have just jumped right into it went just from only plants to only meat in a day and because they were very motivated and they were convinced by this they just said this is [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm not eating this stuff anymore and they switched and they did great if you're more hesitant and you're like oh what's it going to do to me you know maybe maybe transitioning a bit more slowly uh might be in your your best interest so if you do Transition slowly just remember that your body is going to digest things differently depending on what you eat it with and there's those Digestive disruptors and those uh nutrient blockers those antinutrients and things like fiber are actually going to make it more difficult for you to break down and absorb meat so I would probably suggest adding in a bit of meat on its own and not eating it with plants and not eating it with the rest of your meal like you could do that you know add some chicken to a salad or something like that or you could just have a bit of meat and just you know do that and see how it feels and you could just be like actually I feel fine actually that tastes amazing um it will especially if there's some fat on it um it's actually quite quite nice sort of heartwarming you see these videos on on YouTube and elsewhere of people you know who've been vegan for a long time eating meat for the first time in years and and they're sort of feeling like looking like they're guilty like oh what am I doing they eat they go oh my God oh my God that's amazing because their their body is so happy that they're getting these nutrients so they get this big reward of yes that's what we've been missing so um give it a try you know I would try just just eating it on its own you'll absorb it and digest it much better uh when you eat it on its own if you think that it's better to sort of ease into it that's how I would ease into it I'd sort of have I'd start eating more meat maybe have your other things at other times but start introducing meat on its own don't eat it with other things because that that changes how your body digests and absorbs the things and I talk to people say oh I really can't do it it gives me you know upset stomach and I always asking him I like have you ever tried just eating it on its own because you're it's a very different story when you're just eating it on its own and I've had a number of patients come back a bit grumpy but still happy because they're feeling good that they're like like I I was I was convinced that you were going to be wrong that it was still going to upset my stomach but yeah damn it you were right it it was completely different I have absolutely no problem eating meat when it's on its own so that's something to remember remember if you want to jump into it and and you you sort of try some meat on its own and like okay that tastes good you have some eggs okay that tastes good I feel good that's not causing me any problems okay I can have a bit more I can have a bit more and you want to just go in and just start eating meat great you can do that if you want to do it more gradually but you want to if you want to just add meat but still have you know different whole food plants you know that that's obviously something you know that you I still that's really really good you know you're getting really good nutrients um and so then you can play around with uh what that looks like for you if you want to eventually get to a carnivore diet and try that to help with all of your your issues which I think would really help you by going on a full carnivore diet you can either jump straight in like I said with that sort of transition pathway or if you want to do it a bit more slowly you know you introduce the meat like we said and then you cut out carbs and sugar first and foremost alcohol obviously just get rid of that stuff all cooking oil seed oils plant oils get rid of those things they're just toxic they're not what you want you don't want any of that stuff artificial sweeteners as well just get rid of that crap so that's first and foremost and then you start reducing other things and you have a you mark it on the calendar in your phone or on the wall probably better on the wall you have an X you're like today I'm cutting out car sugar alcohol seed oils great the next next week big X cutting out night shades potatoes Tomatoes eggplants Peppers right next week big X cutting out High oxalate foods like spinach and those sorts of things and then the next week cutting out uh everything else you know and so you know you have a have a stepwise progression of what you're going to cut out and you start building up more and more meat as you go and then just every week is just okay you're just cutting something out cutting something out cutting something out and then eventually you have a day that you decide in advance about four weeks later maximum that you say on this day it's gone and I'm just eating meat and eggs if you want eggs and if you do well with eggs most people do but autoimmune issues probably avoid eggs and that's what I would do so sort of a long answer but uh I felt it deserved one so hopefully that was helpful and good luck to you please let me know um how that goes and and how you do in in the coming weeks and I'm sure you'll do re ally well okay Larry Scott thank you very much for the"

effects and loss of muscle mass cold turkey your taper uh what works in your experience it it just depends so I have um I've done both for patients um some patients just say look I'm feeling great I'm coming up to the end of my prescription what do you think like well it's fine yeah your your testosterone level is you know at a good level it's not like 25y old level with the with the test with trt uh but it's at a good level especially for the for this person's age he was in his 40s and um and but he felt great and he said look I I don't I don't think I need this stuff anymore I feel really good okay well why don't you just stop it we'll check your your testosterone levels again in two three months and see what it is and um two three months later he said yeah I felt fine the whole time didn't didn't feel like a drop off when I when I stopped the trt because he'd been carnivore for six months at that point you're actually longer than him so you know I think you'd be fine you're about the same age too and his trt or his sorry his pre-testosterone these are Australian numberers are different than American numbers American numbers because it's a different scale slightly higher um but so in Australian numbers like a 25y old you like a healthy 25y old uh you you expect to see between 600 and 900 and uh this guy was 450 so you know closer to it right but then he came off trt and two months later his testosterone was 650 so was up in that 25y old range right so it actually went up coming off trt because the thing that people don't realize is that when you go on trt it actually rests your gonat so you're this is an endocrine hormone an end endocrine organ and so yes there's a bit of a dip in your body starts to to make these uh you know U between when you stop taking it and when your body starts making this again but you can actually find that people can start making more testosterone because they've actually rested their um their uh their organs right and so you've allowed this to rest and uh and and you know it hasn't had to produce and work as hard to make testosterone and now it's just primed and ready to go and now you're eating properly you're giving your body what it needs to uh to work properly and then it and it comes back so there's a lot of people that just come right off and then other people um you know they might be on uh testosterone and then we just see check their testosterone they're taking the same dose and then all of a sudden they're you know they started out at like 150 for like someone in their 40s I have a patient in his 40s is is like 150 170 so that's actually very low very low especially for his age um or even for his age um that's that's that's I've had 70y old patients that had higher testosterone than that and then tripled it going on on a carnivore no trt that was a guy 72 he had it's like 220 250 was his testosterone and then um yeah like four or five months on a carnivore diet no trt never started trt 750 right so he tripled his testosterone so this gentleman had even lower than that it was in the 100s 150 170 something like that he got put on te on trt by um another doctor at my practice and I inherited him after he retired and uh I don't put people on trt I put them on Carnivore and that that does the same or better as trt and but I've inherited a lot of patients on trt and I get most of them off of it and so this guy was was one of them and so you know he had you know sort of 450 500 testosterone with the trt so that's good that's better than it was and he felt better certainly and but then it started going up and it was and you take DHE as well which is over the- counter hormone in America but it's prescription in Australia and um and all of a sudden his is taking the same dose of DHEA is just going up and going up and going up and going up and that was actually too high for a 25y old so I said okay well come off the DHEA and it maintained at that 25y old level great and then his testosterone kept coming up and kept coming up and all of a sudden it's 600 and 700 and 900 and 1100 he's taking the exact same amount right so he said okay why you just come off and um and so he was yeah and then so yeah we took took him off that and we checked his um testosterone again a few months later hadn't taken um any of his testosterone and it maintained around 900 just over 900 so it's like well there you go you know you don't need to do that and so other people will be like maybe they'll be on an injection form and they'll be on a cream form and um so they might go up too high so okay so stop taking the injection that was one actually um with him we sort of did it uh in that in that manner because uh we tested his testosterone again and it was like a month or so after he had taken his last injection but he was still taking the cream and it was like 960 a month after he it didn't take it okay so obviously you don't need the injection so you know stop the injection because that would just go up from 950 and obviously 900 is actually the upper border of where you think would be optimal for 25-year-old in Australian numbers and um and then since then it's just continued to sort of go up so we're just reducing that down so you know for him um he was able to come off all of that stuff eventually but it was a bit you know of a stepwise progression but you know we could have just just come off completely as well I I I have no doubt um so it just depends you know if you if you want to just taper it that's that's perfectly reasonable you know you can just you know you know slowly sort of take it down you know sort of a half dose for a couple weeks and then a quarter dose for a couple weeks and more and more uh talk to your doctor you know this it's it's not something that's um that's a uh you know huge problem you know the thing is if if you're just feeling rotten coming off of it you know then okay taper it you know or or taper it more slowly um and then that can sort of ease your body back into making testosterone so it's really up to you um you know you can talk to your doctor and say Hey I want to come off testosterone can you help me with that too so you know it's always a good idea to to talk to the you know to the prescribing doctor to see about coming off of it but I see that all the time and I see people come off cold turkey and they just say yeah I didn't even feel a let down because they'd been in carnivore for so long their body just sort of got right back onto it um and others you know taper and I I think both are fine and um uh you know you you are less likely to have side effects uh by tapering so if that's what you want to do then then do that but yeah you can definitely come off and I would I would expect that you know after 3 to six months of being off of it your testosterone levels will be great and you'll feel great as well so and again test it in the morning fasting no exercise sexual activity or stress within 48 Hours of taking that uh test and you get it first thing in the morning fasting from the night before fasting in the morning just a couple glasses of water nothing else no medication supplements anything it's very important testosterone is a is a [\u00a0__\u00a0] to test if you don't if you don't test it in that way because you just get you just get all random numbers it's just not reliable you can't trust them you just have to test it again because they like okay you didn't do it right do it again and then you see but uh you'll see It'll you'll be fine and you'll feel fine and that's the main thing um there's another comment from tanro it says hello new here well welcome 4 days in and my energy is through the roof fantastic been so inflamed for years can't believe the energy rendered fat is kicking my butt literally though love solid butter yeah rendered fat you know sometimes is more difficult to absorb so you know just go for the more solid fat but I'm really like you know it's four days and you're already feeling better so that's that's that's awesome and that just shows you you know what eating proper food does for you and what not eating improper food uh does for you as well so really good job I think that um I'm probably um probably wrap up in the next sort of half hour 40 minutes just trying to see how many super chats are here um you know maybe we'll just cap it on super chats now and I'll just try to get through the rest of them and we'll see how we are on time and maybe can add ask some other other or answer some o ther questions as well

        "body": "me spread the word uh Desiree Fetti thank you for the me spread the word uh Desiree Fetti thank you for the Super Chat I have a friend battling sovial saroma I'm very sorry to hear that she is already drinking raw milk that's very good very nutritious uh please give me any advice I can uh give her to start carnivore so raw milk definitely if you're going to drink milk drink raw milk um for cancer I would really steer clear from any carbohydrates including from milk even raw milk because that is what feeds cancers and different cancers have a different dependency on glucose versus glutamine or a combination of both but they take glucose and to one extent or another and so it's really something you want to limit you make some of it right so you make you're not going to you're not going to get rid of that you're not going to stop yourself from maybe you can you can actually lower it there's medications that can lower your blood sugar even more uh fasting can lower your blood sugar more obviously ketogenic diets intermittent fasting those sorts of things uh calorie restricting diets U even carnivore calorie restriction carnivore diets those sorts of things can even reduce your glucose even more blood sugar even more and bring your ketones up even more and um and that's really important for cancer because uh you know something called the warberg effect named after Otto warberg who's a Nobel Prize winner and studied cancer for decades and he found that well he proved that cancer cells require about 400 times the amount of blood sugar and glucose that normal cells do and so by limiting that if you don't have these big spikes you're not getting those big brushes of blood sugar into their body into the cancer cells and so it's actually really limits them they and they just die and then you do periods of fasting where your ketones are up your blood sugar is down you get your gki under two that really helps under one if possible even better and um and then you you can think about these other repurposed drugs that will interrupt glutamine metabolism as well and this is something that that um professor CED uh from Boston College who has over 150 peer-reviewed Publications on the subject cancer biology and ketogenic diets and ketogenic metabolic therapy for cancers uh you can you can look up his work uh s YF R IE D you can also look up our interview together uh on YouTube that's uh it's my most popular video um most popular long form video it's like almost two million views which is crazy because it's an hour and a half long and it's it's it's about cancer biology you know so it's um it's wild that there's that much interest in it but it's also very good so you know doing those sorts of things um are going to limit the amount of energy that's available to those cancer cells and so I think it's really important for people to really attack this aggressively because it's attacking us aggressively and so uh I actually shared um something from Professor C freed on my story on Instagram today so people watching this fresh today go on my Instagram and check that story out and and he sort of talks about this and how this affects the cancer cells and and why they die when you limit the energy available to them in this way and and other cells actually cannibalize these cancer cells because you know if you're fasting and you're like hey you know we need to you know we need to break these things down they go after these and and take these things out so it's um it's very beneficial so I would think I would I would start by watching the um interview I did with Professor sea freed I also have a lecture that I gave at a medical conference in San Diego last year that was just called ketogenic metabolic therapy as a novel adjunct to standard of care for the treatment of cancer bit of a mouthful um which is probably why it's not doing as well as it could on YouTube but you know it's done decently well but it's um it's important and it and uh it does seem to work in pre-clinical and now clinical trials actually bought a lot of clinical trials in a number of different cancers I don't know about sovial saroma I haven't seen any specific studies in that however um the biological principles apply to all cancers that they all require more glucose they all have damaged mitochondria things like that so the same principles should apply because it's it's an underlying physiological mechanism so good luck to her um and um you know just encourage zero carb and and watch those videos and hopefully hopefully that helps Inspire her to to um uh to try something like this because I I think it would help I think it would help anybody going through this good luck TMS says uh doc I'm a rugby player I play as a prop and I'm on Carnivore how can I eat the night before game day and on game day does staying hungry during a game mean not eat on the game day or or uh eat something small you get if you're going to eat eat something very small and like minimum 5 hours before you game for me nothing I ate nothing I even felt bad I I I typically didn't even eat a big dinner or any dinner uh the day before like I would be fasting 24 Hours by the time I get sometimes more um I always felt better I always told uh you know my teammates and and players always always play hungry um because it just it just gives you a bit of an edge you know if you're just satisfied and all satiated oh everything's fine you you don't have that that Killer Instinct an edge you know your body wants that bit of a like hey you need to go kill something like go do it you know here's energy here's aggression here's testosterone go do it go kill a mammoth you know you guys like yeah it's go time you know and and I just sort of the way I thought about it um but uh whether or not that's true or not who knows but that's what I experience and so um I and a lot of other people experience the same thing I know a lot of professional rugby players that never eat the day of the game even if it's like a whole tournament the whole day and you're going till seven8 o'clock at night just will not eat the entire day and I I don't either and I've always always always felt better like anytime I had anything to eat I always regretted it always regretted it uh so yeah so the night before you just eat eat meat right so you just eat you know fatty steak fatty meat um and then don't eat a thing on the game day I wouldn't even eat anything if it was like a 700 p.m game you know if you you could make an argument for that you know having having a light sort of breakfast you know uh like like not much of it you know have just a smaller steak and a couple eggs or something like that and then getting on with your day or whatever you know nighttime games it's a bit it's a bit weird but um I typically didn't even do that and so um I would uh uh uh yeah that's what I was suggesting give it a try especially if it's like an afternoon game late morning afternoon game definitely don't don't e anything before the game have dinner the night before see how you feel maybe even have a late lunch and leave it at that and don't eat all that much at night I I always felt better like if I was getting to the point where it was like late um I I wouldn't I wouldn't eat dinner it was just like no it's too late I'm just going to go to sleep and get ready for the game I don't want to eat this late um so that was me but play with it I definitely wouldn't eat the day game and see how um how you feel eating the day before I typically would feel better eating like a late lunch in afternoon and then nothing um late at night so but but give it a try see how you go and this is a"

        "body": "tis good luck my fly Style thank you very much for the tis good luck my fly Style thank you very much for the Super Chat a month on Carnivore 85% very well done uh few veggies coconut oil and Mana uh reduced caffeine very hard to do so well done there using unsweetened non-dairy creamers uh stomach is flatter lost six pounds acne Vanishing sleep and energy needs serious help well first of all you know great job uh improving I mean it's already improving a lot and you know you you moved drastically in the right direction and you've gotten actually pretty great results um already in just a month which is great sleep and energy needs serious help so um a lot of people improve their sleep when they when they go on a full carnivore diet so um but some people it's weird some people seem to to have a bit worse sleep the vast majority of people improve their sleep when they go fullon just meat and water so that's something you could consider you know if you try if you try getting rid of the the rest of that um you know plant stuff and just go straight meat and water and see how you go uh that could help optimizing your sleep routine you know going to bed at the same time turning off lights an hour before you want to be asleep getting off screens and phones and all these other sorts of things uh are all very important uh to do and um that can definitely help energy levels what there you know it it you know I wonder you know how much little carbs are still in your diet because the thing is is that low for energy levels for overall health low carb is much better than high carb but for energy levels low carb can sometimes be worse then no carb because if you are having low carb and low carb means different things to different people but if you're having some carb hydrates enough to raise your insulin you'll actually get reactive hypoglycemia so blood sugar goes up for a bit but then it goes down and now your insulin is up high enough that you don't make GL blood sugar you don't make glycogen you don't make ketones and so you don't make energy and you don't feel well and so even that little bit of carbs actually can make you feel worse and so when you get rid of the that last little bit of carbs you actually feel better because now your body's making um its own blood sugar and ketones and you actually feel a lot better I would try that I would try getting rid of all carbohydrates try to get rid of uh you know the dairy and things like that anything with sweeteners anything with sugar you know it's non you know unsweetened Dairy creamers but you know Dairy itself can can have um uh you know sugar glucose those sorts of things but it's like a creamer you know maybe not but um you know just see see what you're doing if you're having any sort of carbs maybe just try to cut those out maybe try 30 days of just eating just fatty meat and water do try to eat enough make sure you're getting enough fat too fat is where your energy comes from and so you're not going to have as good of energy if you're not getting enough uh fat as well it also takes time to keto adapt to fully keto adapt it can take you know eight weeks four months six months before people are truly keto adapted and then two years before your your modic HRA you're fully primed up and uh and and working as well as they possibly can you'll get be getting better the whole time but you'll be getting better and better and better and better and better as you go and so sometimes people don't feel as good as they could um or better than they did uh for for months and that's rare most people feel a lot better even early on but you know you know people will react a bit differently so I would try that I would try cutting out absolutely everything and really try cutting out every single scrap of carbohydrates and uh and that usually will help energy levels make sure you're drinking enough water make sure you're eating enough and eating enough fat don't eat during the day because if you eat a big meal you're going to get tired afterwards you're have horrible energy energy levels you eat at night after you're done with your day you have your big meal you eat until it stops tasting good and you'll actually be lethargic after that and you'll probably sleep pretty well after that uh whereas if you eat that in the morning you eat that in the afternoon you're going to be very tired after that and so something to remember as well so um I did a video on on why some of the common reasons people get tired some of those I went over over here um but um there you know probably a couple others but you know that that's pretty much it so um check it out um check it out on the um uh on my on my YouTube channel just um you know you know getting tired on Carnivore diet or whatever um yeah and good luck with that let me see here okay um so apparently um my sister said um that apparently in the non-dairy creamers there are different sorts of like oils and Seed oils and um oh was a non dairy creamer okay yeah um yeah so I mean God knows what's in there right you know so is that is that almond milk is that oat milk is that you know um how do you milk an almond exactly it's almond juice is really what that is and um it's uh you so yeah so that can have have things in it that that you don't want either so um yeah I would probably I would definitely I would definitely cut that out as well so basically just cut everything out except meat see how you go might just sort you out and and hopefully it does Caleb Robinson thank you for the"

so awesome thank you um who and what is needed for creating more carnivore scientific studies yeah good question you know it's it's it's um you you need to get people that are you know in um involved in in like research institutions that are willing to take the stuff on and then it's a matter of getting funding it's it's difficult um because you know you you you you have to get sort of like government grants because you're not going to get industry grants because they're not going to you know there there's not many indust you know um there's not many people in in like the the meat industry that are I mean there's like the um the Cattleman's um catlan Society or the Cattleman's yeah I think it's cattan Society in America like they you know they all the ranchers sort of pull in to do advertising for you know beef and all these sorts of things um but they haven't typically um been very forthcoming with with helping with research studies you know which is um more of the pity because it's it's you know it helps their industry um to get the the information out there that this can help people um so you need people at uh the interested people faculty people at universities you know I mean there there's clinicians and independent people like myself and Dr David Unwin David unwin's published a ton of his patient um uh you know the information from from his patient population I plan on doing the same thing um and uh you know because we have a lot of we have a lot of patients who've been on Carnival for a long time and we have massive improvements and so publishing those case series uh large case series we have a lot of people that are improving on Carnivore die we can even break it up like all the people with Hashimoto and how they've improved I mean tons of people with Hashimoto in my practice that have improved different autoimmune issues multiple sclerosis these sorts of things uh diabetes easy I mean that just goes away um and so insulin resistance pre-diabetes diabetes all these sorts of things they just vanish and um even Unwin has now gotten 137 plus people off of all diabetes medications so reversed 137 verta Health in America over 25,000 right those aren't specifically carnivore that's low carb ketogenic carnivore is low carb ketogenic should be and um so I think you just need you need that you need people that are interested in doing the research and uh and you need to get funding and so that's that's the main thing you know and um and sometimes you have to pass these things by by ethics approval as well it's easier to to do uh patient populations you don't need to get ethics approval because you've already treated these patients these are just the results that you have and so you can because you're not doing a prospective study you don't have to get permission to go do something you don't need ethics for that this is retrospective you're saying hey this is what happen when someone did X and so um you know you can you can just do that a bit more easily at least in most most places you know obviously some places are going to have different uh different rules and requirements but uh in general that's what you need and so you just need more people that are interested in in doing this and you need to get funding because these things cost a lot of money and that's the uh that's the main issue so people's time uh interest and money is um is what you need so if you're involved or if anybody's involved in um you know research institutions is something that they they do or they're regularly interested in please contact me I'm more than interested I'm I'm um Happy to get involved in this study help recruiting people um help uh you know uh with my patient population I've a lot of patients on Carnivore um and and even doing a you know a novel approach and and testing carnivore against something or seeing hey you have all these people with crohn's disease let's put them on a carnivore diet see what happens oh look at that it goes away isn't that fun you know and you you get them off medications or sympatic symptomatically they go away and biopsy after 3 month is clear lovely that's what it will show that's it will show that um but you know uh it's like it's like a picture didn't happen you know it's like that's it's just what people think so you know fine so let's do it you know let's uh let's have a have a controlled trial people okay you're doing your normal thing you're doing it with medication let's see who wins you know that'd be a great study to do and so um you know if someone wants to do that let me know i' be down and um but that's what you need you need interest you need money and you need uh an institution to run it out of that's pretty much it so yeah so if anyone knows of anything let me know always happy to do do something like that Oscar B Bonito Calder on Diaz great to see you again buddy thank you for the"

        "body": "on Diaz great to see you again buddy thank you for the on Diaz great to see you again buddy thank you for the Super Chat uh thanks for the answer uh from you're welcome a friend has general herpes and he is 29 and my niece is 15 with severe Crohn's disease to the point she is being fed um through her nose will carnivore help them recovering get better I'm really sorry to hear that about your daughter carnivore will uh definitely uh help your daughter um if you look at if you look at um the literature on this if you look at Elemental diets which which is just breaking down to the macro micronutrients that we require the ketogenic as well uh typically that has been shown in clinical trials to be a better treatment for Crohn's disease than uh prazone which is steroid which is the gold standard just sort of shuts down the immune system shuts down the antibodies all that sort of stuff what is an elemental diet if not a steak it's all the macros and micros that you need and nothing else right so just not eating certain things is a better treatment than steroids right so don't eat those things just eat meat um you can even fast for a couple days let things heal let things rest and uh and then start in on on some uh eggs eggs are going to be very easy uh to take in oh actually never mind not with crohn's meat you want red meat avoid eggs avoid Dairy definitely avoid Dairy and avoid um even chicken and pork and fish just red meat beef and lamb and just a little bit at a time you know some ground beef things like that this what a Salsberry steak was it was a way of grinding meat so you filtered out the uh gristle so there was just the soft muscle meat and just the soft fat and they added butter to that because a lot of the fat came with the gristle and um that was because that 100% of that absorbed in the small intestine so it never got to the large intestine so you know these people with really bad Crohns or also of colitis it completely rested their bowel and that's important when when you're in as as difficult a position as your your daughter is or your es I'm sorry and so that's what I would do and yeah I would I would absolutely expect it to help just like it's helped uh everybody else that I've seen that have done this autoimmune issues especially respond really really well to uh just a red meat and water diet only as far as the the herpes is concerned um I don't think it would necessarily cure it but it can definitely increase uh improve people's uh immune system so they don't have as many flareups they might have it so that they're just their body just works better and has a better defense structure so it doesn't have um as many flareups hopefully but you know the problem with with these sorts of um viruses they retroviruses they live in the cells and they're in the DNA basically if if those cells don't die those cell bodies don't die the um the virus doesn't die and so you're never going to get rid of these things and so every now and then they'll just they'll just cause a problem and and um you know so you having having a optimal diet and um improving your immune system can help keep that down to a minimum but it's it's not going to get rid of it entirely but it it can help symptomatically and it can help um reduce the occurrences of it anyway but with crohn's it can just go away because it can um uh it it just what I can tell from what I can tell autoimmune issues are your body reacting to these plant toxins and other sorts of toxins and making antibodies towards them that's getting cross reaction with your body and the evidence of that is you stop eating these things the antibodies just go down so it's not that you're sensitizing yourself and now your body's attacking your body oh that's gonna kill no because that it doesn't matter what you eat your antibodies would just keep going up but they don't you stop eating plants you just eat meat especially red meat those antibodies just go right down and that's what we observe and that's what we measure and we can see that and you can see that in real life in real time real fast especially with something like Crohn's Crohn's responds very well so uh yes that's that's um definitely something that that can help so yeah good luck to your niece I'm sorry to hear that she's having such a rough time that's really sad okay so that's um that's all the super chats um there's just some other comments and uh and things like that that uh um people actually go through some of these um n says thank you Dr chaffy you give me the confidence to continue carnor seven months so far and lots of healing well that's really good I'm glad to hear that um we have Arlin rusa from Facebook who says hi Dr chaffy uh what's your thought on spirulina and uh chlorella I think those are plant things don't eat them that's probably my thought yeah I don't no no plants or fungus no sugar any sweeteners nothing artificial and uh that goes for sausage seasonings drinks supplements everything else like that as well so that's what I do I just eat meat and water um actually don't know what all those things are the spirulina I think that's a plant isn't it um and the chlorella sounds like some sort of chlorophyll supplement that was one thing early on people were saying but if you're if you're not eating plants how you get your chlorophyll I'm like do you need chlorophyll does that did that show up as an essential nutrient that uh that I wasn't aware of like uh you don't need chlorofil um and so um you don't need any plant at all so um maybe some plants are better or worse they're all going to have PL plant defense chemicals they're all going to be able to defend themselves chemically and so um I just and you don't need need them so I I don't have any of those things uh Emma eser um the hard facts are our grandparents cooked meat and everything in lard ate the whole chicken including the chicken juice and the gravy and lived to 90 plus having never seen a doctor yeah you know I mean this is how people live for a very long time all people died in their 30 no they damn well didn't that was average life expectancy from birth was 38 in the 1800s and that was because infant mortality was was extremely high it was like three out of five and um but if you made it to 10 if you survived to 10 on average you'd make it to 58 not 38 58 right so if you made it to adulthood you weren't killed in a war in a famine or in a some sort of infectious disease typically you lived as long as you do today or longer sometimes so yeah um that's the thing and we're we're always eating meat fat and Lord oh my God none of the heart disease that we have today none of the not nothing close to the um chronic disease rates that we have now 90% of deaths in the Western countries 90% are from these non-communicable chronic diseases that's insane 74% around the world right so that's all the Infectious Disease all the traumas all the infant mortalities all these all the wars and all these sorts of things still 74% of deaths are non-communicable chronic diseases like heart disease diabetes cancer autoim Community all these other sorts of things total total garbage um that people say oh yeah well it's probably always happening probably even worse because oh now we're so now we have Science Diet and we have all these wonderful multi-trillion dollar corporations that all they care about is your health not their bottom line obviously and so they're putting out these products that are just so good for you because they paid me to say that you know it's just like get out of here um of course that stuff's not good for you didn't even exist a hundred years ago some of these things and um why are you putting things in your body that didn't even exist in nature uh ever you know some of these things have never existed in nature why the hell would you put that in your body or on your body for that matter just uh just insane to me but um yeah you know just just just look at look at anthropology look at what happens in the world around you when people eat real food they are healthier you know anthropology they talk about they talk about how um when you have a A Primitive civilization um they have certain illness injuries and infectious disease that's what they got and malnutrition and not getting enough to eat starvation things like that famines and then when they start being Incorporated in more modern societies civilization they get different diseases they die to different things they live the same amount of time but they get different problems now they get the diseases of civilization that's what they call them that's what the non-communal chronic diseases are the diabetes the heart disease the cancer the mental health issues all these autoimmune issues things like that they don't have those in in their normal society when they're eating normal food so like it does not take much intelligence or insight to realize it's a problem with the food you know you change your diet your health change almost as if they're related so you know um yeah I definitely think you know looking back at in in history uh you learn a lot that's why all these same people are trying to erase history and pretend it never happened and because you know whoever you know controls history controls the present because if you say oh no this is what happened this is what happened that you learned from history people go oh okay that's what's always happened this is what's always been better I guess we should do that end now no it's really important to know what actually happened and what actually happen is people ate real food they ate meat they a lot of animal fat they lived a hell of a lot healthier lives and often times they lived a lot longer so yes definitely look at those sorts of things uh Lisa lion says um what a really informative talk tonight really uh going into depth uh right very thankful and great moderators too well that's very good thank you very much for that I really appreciate that um and stink ass cats says hello to everyone always good to see you stinky my friend um and we have a super sticker here from Alex Doom thank you very much Alex for the super sticker that's that's very nice of you um and R I think he was talking about the spirulina and the the chloras and algae I don't know what Algae is classified as it's classified as don't eat it that's what it is um algae again same thing um they have defensive chemicals that they can um use to kill you I mean this is I mean things like red tide and these different blooms these algae blooms that get in the water and that gets in the seafood you eat that um seafood fish or whatever or you drink that water and you can die from that algae so uh algae is yeah um not what you want there are some allergies that are that are that are safe or safer than others but um you know again you don't need it and uh I would say you don't want it and um yeah Melissa's reminding me uh that we are going to be at the Rev Vu City beef Roundup in August August 24th and so that's going to be in Riverton Wyoming so that's really really gorgeous part of the country um and it's and it's very close as these things go to Yellowstone and the Tetons and you know somebody from wyomi it's not close it's hours away it's a hell of a lot closer than I am now so that's what I mean by close you're at least in the same state and you're in driving distance away from the Tetons and and Yellowstone where most people aren't from most places in the country so it's close enough that you can get there and um and so I did and I plan to again it's absolutely stunning part of the country and um and it's a great time it was a lot of fun last year and uh they're really ramping it up to be an even bigger carnivore event um than last year so that that's really good and um also in August the week before that I'll be at the Symposium for metabolic Health in San Diego be giving a talk there and that um and that's always a great great conference as well that's a CME conference was generally directed towards you know clinicians and doctors and researchers but it's anyone's welcome and uh it's also it's always really um it's also really uh uh a good very interesting conference a lot of great people there and then in Spain I'll be in Spain as well so in the south of Spain just outside of Malaga in um October so I think like the third week of October I have um I thing on Instagram on that as well probably make some more posts about that as we go I think there's still two spots left for the the Spain thing it's like it's like a a retreat conference Retreat sort of thing it's this gorgeous place this old cathedral in um like a refurbished cathedral in the south of Spain it's I've seen pictures it's stunning and um and so that uh if you go to the bigfat challenge.com you can find things for Spain I think there's two spots left uh for that because obviously it's limited because it is a a retreat sort of thing that you you stay out on location uh I don't know if they have it where you can get like an Airbnb around there and just come during the day I'm not sure but you can probably inquire on that website and ask Phil escott and Ben Hunt about that and um yeah but uh that'll be fun too but I think there's two spots left so you know if people want those they can and then again thank you to Chris brandlin uh for for all of your help in the carnivore Community um that's the the carnivore lawyer who helps people out when they need it and you just go to brandlin law.com if you want to um uh talk to him and need a med a hand and then I think just the last comment here um some from spana uh yeah my great granny lived 103 and say she owned her long owed her long life to eating fatty meat probably right you know my grandparents lived nearly as long and they they said the same thing they bacon in eggs every single morning and not a touch of heart heart disease so that's really good um but yeah so thank sh pres yeah I don't know I don't know if I want that that hell on Earth it's it's
