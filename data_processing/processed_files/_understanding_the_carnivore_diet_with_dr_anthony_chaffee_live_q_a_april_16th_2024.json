        "body": "all right hello everyone uh thank you for joining me for another live today is uh the 17th of April here in Australia and the 16th in America and elsewhere so thank you very much good to see you all um we have uh a number of questions that we've already sort of lined up here so sort getting into those now and and if you do have a question you can sort of put cues by it and um and we'll try to get to as many of these as we can I've got a hard stop in about two hours um at 12:30 my time because I have another meeting starting then but uh we'll get to as many questions as we can in that time fix the camera here great okay so there was one here um that's sort of basically a topical Point that's been coming up um it said thoughts on alos and the data showing the increase gop1 and inhibits hormone glucagon um Dr bigman videos are drawing a lot of attention to it so I I don't know all all that much about it you know I have a lot of respect for Dr bman I think he's he's he's fantastic um but I I you know I work on the on on the principles that you know I don't want to put anything in my body that doesn't belong there and um you know where was allulose in the you know the mammoth hunting days of your uh you know I mean what something didn't exist and wasn't a regular you part of our diet and our life 50,000 years ago during an ice age I probably don't want anything to do with it um that's me personally you know some things can be used medically and so if there was some sort of reason you wanted to get the effects of that alos and from a medicinal standpoint you know that's something you could consider but as far as just eating and uh and have you in your daily life I don't see I don't see the benefit of adding in things that don't belong and at the end of the day it is a chemical that has chemical reactions in your body as we can see it increases potentially increases glp1 and inhibits glucagon okay so that's having excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms in your body is that really what you want is that something that you want to do in your body you know so we say oh we get this sweet taste great but it's not sugar so that's okay oh and it does these other things are those things that you want are those the only things that it does and um do you know so we're chemical factories we are not combustion engines we're not steam locomotives we burn things up and so you put chemicals in your body they're going to have chemical reactions and these chemicals increase glp1 and inhibit glucagon maybe maybe they do more things too so on that principle I just avoid these things because that's that's not something that that's disrupting your natural biochemistry so I don't I don't F I don't think that's a great idea if you are otherwise healthy and if you don't want your you know if you're disrupting your biochemistry because you're eting a whole bunch of other crap could the disruption that allulose gives be beneficial in that circumstance potentially but that's like you know giving somebody you know metformin or some other sort of medications for diabetes or you know OIC or something horrible like that um in certain circumstances right because um you know you're doing something to your body and now you're trying to counter that with some sort of drugs okay well just if you're not doing anything unbo to your body in the first place then you don't necessarily need that anyway so all things being equal when doing a carnivore diet and you're only eating meat I don't think you need to add these sorts of things in there and um you know we're talking about something sweet I mean you know is that really that important to you that you just need something sweet you know is that something that could you know trigger car you know cravings and you want more sweet things you want more sweet things and so you end up starting craving those things I mean I just I don't know why I don't know I personally don't care to go down that route at all I mean even when I drink milk it tastes like I'm drinking ice cream it's so sweet to me and that's very compelling for me I want more of that and so adding that back in it's just not you know adding in like another compulsion that I want more of something like that's that's to me that's something I I immediately want to avoid and uh for myself and you know we're saying that that well Al it's not sugar and it's not these other things and it's just like okay so it's it's okay and you know you're trying to get off cocaine and so you decide to snort riddlin instead it's like well it's not cocaine it's not cocaine it's it's it's actually better for you it's a medicine it does these things it's like yeah maybe but you know wouldn't you be better off just getting completely out of the situation in the first place and it's not to say that you know alul is the same it's not it's a it's a loose metaphor but it's the same idea you you're trying to replace something harmful with something that you believe is less harmful but is it less harmful or is it just not harmful is it beneficial that's that's the only thing I care about you know I I don't want to put something in my body that's not beneficial you know I don't want to eat something just because it's not as bad as something else I don't want to put anything bad in my body because um you know why would you you know I mean this is this is the vessel that you're in this is this is everything and if you don't have your health you don't have anything you know I mean you know we all have uh have or have had elderly relatives or have seen people in the later stages of their life that are you know not doing so well maybe aren't as healthy as they could be and that's difficult and that's really hard to see your loved one go through that and then you know doing things that so so you know and I want to help that them as much as I can and get them as healthy as possible so they can get their quality of life back but also for myself like I don't I don't ever want to end up there I want to be just healthy all the way through and then just one day go to sleep and just not wake up you know and that's what most animals do in captivity they're just healthy healthy healthy adults and then they just one day they just don't don't wake up again and they do that in the in the wild too if they if they don't get eaten by something so you know adding in things like ose you know just because it may not be as bad of something than something else and you could do that but um we don't know all the things it does we do know it has chemical interactions in your body that's you know part of the the argument for having it and um what else is it doing and do you want those effects maybe maybe not for me I ca n I can do without Beth Roker thank for the the um the"

        "body": "n I can do without Beth Roker thank for the the um the n I can do without Beth Roker thank for the the um the Super Chat looks like it's seeing question two um I don't know if I see where question one is um so anyway is it bad to drink water close to meals thing it's not necessarily bad but you you're filling up space that that could be used for food and so sometimes you get you stop eating prior to when your body actually wants you to and it can dilute the stomach acids and digestive enzymes so you know potentially so it's it's it's been long thought that you should probably not drink sort of within two hours of a meal and that's hard if you're eating multiple meals a day but if you're just eating once a day pretty easy to do you just sort of uh just sort of cut off at a certain point eat your meal maybe have some sips to help wash things down if you if you want to and then just you know just wait an hour or two after that before you have some some more water after that so especially for people with with gastric sleeves or bands or other sorts of bariatric surgery to help them lose weight which is a growing number of people you want all that space available for actual food I mean that's the thing you know we we it's the signals to eat that are the problem not the size of our stomach right it's not just like you know we were just made oh these just stomachs are just too big it's just ridiculous you know we just got to cut these suckers down so you just can't physically fit food in there no it's the impulses to eat eat and to overeat and and also when you're eating High caloric but low density nutrition you know with low nutrients value your brain's just telling you like your brain tracks nutrients it doesn't track calories so it's say yes it has stretch receptors and it says okay well you're full now but but it also sees that there's no nutrients in your stomach you know do you have receptors in your stomach that go up your to your brain from your vagus nerve and trct nutrients as you're eating this high octane garbage that's designed to taste good and Trigger that oh this is good sense by these you know very clever food scientists but then it actually gets into your stomach and your stomach goes yeah there's there's no actual nutrition here keep eating and you disrupt your leptin and your gin and your hunger cycles and your hunger hormones and your brain is just telling you this perfect storm for you to just pile on food and so it's okay well we need to physically limit this because you know you just you just can't have any self-control that's nonsense if you're eating the right thing because your body just tells you to stop and so it's not about how big your stomach is it's about how much nutrition you're getting in and are you disrupting your hormones and that's another thing when they do the gastric sleeve they cut out part of the stomach that that makes gin which is which is a actually a very important hormone you don't want to like not make grin um and so I mean grin has has effects on all other things too trigger growth hormone as well so it's like you know is is that really what you want to do is is cut that out is cut out your body's ability to make an entire category of hormones like probably not and so it's um it's you know it's a bit backwards I think and I hope hopefully that whole field of medicine goes away very soon because it hurts people it's it's really not good for you and so if you if you have had that then you have this smaller container you really need to maximize your your volume for just food so you just need to eat fatty meat and you want to eat it on without any water or whatever because you're going to fill up that space and that's going to that's going to severely limit you from getting enough nutrition so uh for those people especially definitely best to not drink water within at least an hour if not two before and after meals and then next question from Beth thank you for the the"

        "body": "and then next question from Beth thank you for the the and then next question from Beth thank you for the the Super Chat as well um rhr used to be uh 38 to 42 now mid-50s is this normal thank you thank you very much or thank you so much rhr we referring to something rhr before I'm not actually sure what what that is um what is rhr if anyone knows what rhr is please or if Beth's still in the chat maybe just pop up what you mean by rhr I'm not seeing another another chat before that that sort of talked about rhr um if people could could spell things out I mean there's a lot of acronyms out there and and unfortunately I don't know all of them or fortunately I don't know all of them resting heart rate there we go um resling heart rate used to be 38 to 42 now it's mid-50s so first of all that's remarkably low um so almost like dangerously low that's but if that's normal for you then great as long as you're getting the right cardiac output mid-50s wouldn't worry too much about it I have seen people who have um found that their resting heart rate does go up a bit you know it's uh it's hard to say exactly why that is I just probably has something to do with your heart now running on ketones which are its preferred energy source and now it's just running a bit more energetically um I wouldn't worry too much about that you know it's not that the lower the resing heart rate the better not necessarily you know it's whatever your body wants it to be so and also the mid-50s is really low I mean that's that's sort of in the in the range of uh I'm taking medication to slow down my heart level of low um so I wouldn't worry too much about it you know if your your resting heart rate goes up a bit and it's still within well within uh the normal range I would worry too much about it as long as everything else is okay okay so here's a question from Karen Ferell who says um husand had a heart transplant eight years ago heartt is doing great he has COPD which is giving him difficulty is a carnivore die for him he is nervous about how it will affect his anti-rejection meds it's not going to it's not going to uh mess up with with his medications it's going to make him as healthy as possible um I mean it is true that that um people have used um seed oils as anti-rejection meds to suppress the the immune system so you know uh I I think that that's a good reason to get them the hell out of um everyone's diet but um you know it it won't interfere with the medications it'll just improve his health in a lot of ways and and should improve his his COPD as well it's not going to regrow dead lung tissue but it can make his his healthy lung tissue more healthy and potentially help his symptoms as well who knows if it can regrow a bit of it um we don't have any any evidence for that yet but there are people with COPD who have reported significant benefits and improvements in their health and and reduction in their oxygen demand which is amazing so you the very least it's going to help improve the quality of the lung tissue and that that you know gas exchange go better and can help the the other sort of processes in your body improve as well so I would expect that it would help him from from that standpoint I do think it's for him I think it's for everybody really because I think this is our this is our biologically appropriate diet and especially for someone who has major medical issues this is there's it's really the most important of all because it's it's vital for them to be as healthy as they can be because they're going through a lot more and they have a much lower threshold uh to deal with problems so yes I would definitely say that it's for him I can't see how that's going to uh cause a problem for his anti-rejection meds it's not going to interfere anyway I mean the only thing that you could possibly say is it's going to improve the workings of his of his um immune system so is that going to be stronger now is he going to need more meds probably not um know those meds are pretty pretty damn strong but you know they can always increase medications if that becomes an issue so I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about that and I would doubt that he'd have a problem from that side of things either and um but yeah but good luck to uh both of you any a ny case and um I I wish him well cby thank you for the"

        "body": "bly not that big of a deal so uh nav thank you for the bly not that big of a deal so uh nav thank you for the Super Chat 5 foot n male 30 years old weigh about 190 pounds overweight I'd say consistently losing weight and want to reach 160 to 170 range um want to do carnivore uh diet to treat IBS um but in a dilemma is not sure um what weight loss uh continue on here is going to look like on Carnivore like how quickly andc consistently can I lose weight compared to what I'm doing now which is rabbit diet losing weight in a consistent manner any suggestions a lot of people lose a lot of weight on um a carnivore diet and the thing is if you're on a rabbit food diet you'll lose weight just like you anyone can starve themselves into smaller smaller um clothing size but you know it that's not necessarily what's healthy um you we see this in concentration camps all the time it does work you can starve people to death if you want but it slows down the metabolism because your body is trying to stop you from dying and it says oh look we're in a famine we're not getting food we need to slow things down we need to decrease the amount of energy output and that slows your metabolism so you will lose weight um and and weight being the key thing there because you can lose lean body mass as well you can lose muscle and bone as well as fat so do you want to lose weight or do you want to lose fat for me I think that losing the fat part of that would be the ideal part of that equation and you wouldn't want to lose lean body mass and you actually want to gain lean body mass so a lot of people do that on a carnivore diet they actually lose lose fat gain muscle gain bone density and that's good that's really good and so the weight on the scale sometimes doesn't shift as much or maybe it stalls oh it's I'm not losing any weight it's like okay well how do you feel I feel great are you working out yeah lift weights four days a week and do Sprints okay so are your clothes fitting differently yeah I'm going down like a belt loop every couple weeks well you're losing fat then aren't you you know you're just replacing it with muscle and so you know that's what it's really about people lose a lot of weight on a carnivore diet um the vast majority of people will lose a significant amount of weight and it actually ramps up your metabolism so you increase your metabolism you don't depress your metabolism because what you do with the rabbit food diet so yeah you'll lose weight because you're starving yourself but as soon as you start eating real food again your body thinks okay we are still in a famine and we need to store this and and store up um for the next family because whatever food comes in boom that's going into fat because we need to store this we need to take care of this and um that's what you end up doing whereas with a carnivore diet you're giving yourself proper nutrition it actually encourages your metabolism and some people actually put on weight but it's like small percentage of people and the majority of people lose weight very quickly and do very well with it um the other people have sort of metabolic issues and hormonal issues that can that can sometimes test for and you can see like o okay you know this might be this might be why you know they're they're having trouble but um you can see that you sign post and say hey look you know your leptin is hugely elevated and you have insulin resistance and all these other sorts of things and so these are signs of of a depressed metabolism and you have these hormonal imbalances that can make it difficult for you to lose weight early on but these will all come down on a carnivore diet and when they do come down you start to see more and more rapid weight loss and then you get you know you get a lot of weight loss after that so you'll lose weight you know depending on where you are you've been starving yourself and your metabolism is what it is you may you may just consistently lose weight or you may body may say oh dear God we need to we need to store some fat because we're in a in a famine but at the same time you'll increase your metabolism eventually you'll encourage your body and um you'll lose weight and you'll lose fat in particular and you'll put on muscle especially if you're work especially if you're living weight especially if you're sprinting and so that's what I would do you know because this is about health it's about long-term health and sort of laying down the patterns of behavior that that will keep you healthy for the rest of your life and so that's what you want to do and it will treat your IBS like your IBS will go away as soon as you stop eating plants like it's crazy and so and you'll also lose weight and you'll gain health and you'll gain muscle so I I mean that that is what I would recommend anyway um guys seem to have uh sort of got the long end of the stick on this one um when I see people stall with their weight loss um actual fat loss it's typically women but even then it's it's a it's the minority most people lose weight but you look at Kelly Hogan she actually put on weight for six months and she she said it wasn't all muscle you know I was like Daryl was definitely gaining fat and but her health was getting so much better her skin was better her she had boils all over her body they were gone now and she felt much better and then after six months then it started going and she started losing a lot of weight so something needed to change in her body her body was healing from something hormones were improving and you just need to get that pattern of behavior just eating meat until it stops tasting good and eating enough and getting rid of all the other stuff and sod do diet drinks all these sorts of things and you get rid of all that and then you uh and then she started all of a sudden started losing weight and losing weight and losing weight and losing weight and after a couple years she was down to a very very slim uh slim physique and doing great so uh that'll happen for you and most most guys I mean I I had a guy who had uh quite elevated leptin it's like in in the 80s over a hundred and and bariatric surgeons will often say that you cannot lose weight without surgery you will not lose weight if you don't get surgery which is not true I plenty of patients with leptin over 100 that could lose weight but it it took a while they were the slower ones and um but when that leap and came down then they really started getting better and it's all about health anyway you're improving your health and their health was certainly improving their autoimmune issues were going were going away but this guy had Le him like in the 80s um that a lot of people that they won't lose weight very quickly until that comes down um and his insulin is fasting insulin should never be above nine really or even six or seven his fasting intin was 72 right so his his metabolism was very depressed and he actually lost like you know a big chunk of weight like in the first month you know it actually started very quickly for him so um it you know it most people will still lose weight either way there are a few people for whatever reason have a bit slower weight loss but eventually they it it all comes together and all their metabol metabolic issues and hormonal issues sort of themselves out and they just get better and and lose weight so yeah I think I would expect that to happen to you and your health issues more importantly wi ll get better okay so Jules Anderson thank you for the"

        "body": "ll get better okay so Jules Anderson thank you for the ll get better okay so Jules Anderson thank you for the Super Chat uh hi Dr from Adelaide um 58-year old female B6 is High um hidden as uh p5p in support or in supplements short-term use swapped out beef for lamb to reduce daily in intake any tips fatigue muscle joint pain vitamin C deficient to um is there a link um so I I I don't I don't think there's any any issues with with vitamin C anyway we don't need Vitamin C to make collagen you make all the collagen you need from uh you know the the proteins available and the collagen available and in the meat that you're eating and so you don't you don't really need it for that anyway and also um your your body absorbs more vitamin C when you when you don't eat carbs and there is Vitamin C in in meat there's actually more vitamin C prog gram of liver than there is in apples so you know if you want if you are concerned about your vitamin C issue you know add in some some liver things like that um you know as far as be um you know being High um you know High according to to who because you know all these different B vitamins um or all these vitamins in general are are generally um are generally um well the the reference ranges are for the average person in the community that's how these reference ranges are made and so the average person is Mal nurse and sick and so that's not who you want to be comparing yourself to especially for nutritional deficiencies when everybody's nutritionally deficient and so if you're high it probably means you're normal so for like B12 here in Australia the reference range is anywhere from like 130 to 650 or 670 but what I would say is an actual optimal range is 800 to 12200 so that entire range is out of range right and so they get up to you know 700 and that's like oh my God that's too high your B12 is too high right uh actually it's not high enough it's actually still low and then in the UK it goes up to 540 right so that's even less so you get up to 650 which is normal for a lot of labs here in Australia that's too high in the UK oh my God it's too high no we have we have absolute levels here that you know I shouldn't say absolute but there are levels here across Humanity that you know below this and above that it's better you know better or worse right so below 400 has been shown to in Australian numbers been shown to cause uh um demolation of your axons right and um and so that can cause nerve damage cause brain damage cause brain shrinking and and um shrinkage of your spinal cord and things like that um so you know that's obviously very important right um and so that's within that that range right you go from 130 that's normal 131 that's normal but below 400 can cause brain damage so that's not normal it's just the norm right it's just the average for the community but the average person is unwell and so that's not who you want to judge yourself against so you know I don't I don't know off the top of my head the the reference range for B6 I don't check it all that often but if you're if you're slightly high for the Australian reference ranges I I would probably say that that's good a good thing you know I have I have patients that you know like my B12 is high but it's not high it's it's exactly where it should be I don't supplement I just eat normal normal food for a human and uh you know my B12 is you know up above 800 that's exactly where it's supposed to be you you have in some liver you'll definitely be over over that um so I wouldn't worry about it too much the main thing with B vitamins is you want to keep them all relative I want to keep them all sort of balanced because if you get a a one of them way out of balance with all the others that can cause a relative deficiency in the others it's a bit weird they but they all go together and so you want you want all these things coming together so if you're just taking like thiamine on its own you know probably shouldn't do that outside of you know specific um you know medical conditions like someone who has you know alcohol withdrawals and things like that or like you know wores ketis or something like that some sort of you know alcohol driven thyine deficiency you short getting that up um but you want to keep all these things in Balance so just eating real food and eating meat eating some liver every now and then uh you don't have to have much but um you having some is usually good especially when people are starting out because everyone's nutritionally deficient if they that's what that's what we see in the reference range is every 's in a state of nutritional deficiency so we're calling nutritional deficiency normal um so obviously that's not normal and so everyone's deficient so you know starting out on a carnivore diet having more nutrient intense things like a bit of liver kidney heart probably a good idea and it'll catch you up or some DED you if you have you're really low you know taking B vitamins or taking I mean liver is a B vitamin supplement but some people you know bulk at that um and uh but if you act super low on 12 for instance you get nerve damage like you should probably get a get an injection if it's too low you know like here in Australia I'd give someone an injection if it's below 500 definitely you know that's way too low certainly if it's under 400 I mean that's critically low that's that's that's a true deficiency so if you're a bit high on the B6 probably wouldn't worry about it I'd probably consider that pretty much normal U for most of these things they are normal if you're above their range so keep that in mind and just try to keep all the other be bees in in um balance as well and that's probably more of an idea the issues with fatigue and muscle and joint pain is a bit weird I wouldn't I I don't know of that being associated with uh High B6 um but you know I would I would imagine that would probably be something else joint pain fatigue muscle pain um probably something else I mean it can be all sorts of things getting out of your system I don't know how how long you've been doing sort of carnivore um or if you're fully carnivore or whatever but you know you just get rid of everything except meat and water that tends to help a lot with pain uh fatigue can be a lot of different things could be dehydration can be that you're not fully fat adapted yet could be you're not eating enough could be that you're not eating enough fat either and so those a lot of these things that you can adjust for as well um I have a a video on frequently asked questions on a carnivore diet and and the Standalone one on feeling tired on a carnivore diet and that can um s of go through some things you just sort of try they're very simple things but you know worth going through and to see if they help and um otherwise if you're just eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good then uh and you're just drinking water and nothing else you know your body should sort itself out fairly you know and you know at some point anyway usually people take weeks some people take months some people like three months some people as much much as six months but then they they all come through and they feel a lot better so just just um you know address the things that you can address and optimize the things that you can that need optimizing and go from there Diane Hassan had a question here which is I've been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis does carnivore help with keeping msf Bay they offer preventative treatment and I refuse is it a mistake well you know it's it's certainly you something that you need to talk to your doctors about you know depending on how bad your Ms is and all these sorts of things but yes I've seen a lot of people improve on a cornivore diet I've I've never seen somebody not improve their autoimmune issues on a carnivore diet I just like I've yet to see that and Ms as well um there's a lady that I had on my podcast she went by Dr Sarah and um she's a PhD in biostatistics and so she knows how to read studies and she got MS and very bad very aggressive Ms in her early 30s she uh was in a wheelchair and having been a former ballerina that's that's a big that's a big hit and so she came across carnivore and she started looking into the research and she said okay no these gu these guys are on to something like there is there is definitely something here and so she did it she also went on a protocol of high dose vitamin D and so she went high do vitamin D and carnivore and in six months she was not only out of her wheelchair but she was back doing ballet amazing so you know uh do check that out and also think about B12 B12 again under a certain amount under 400 in Australia and the UK and Europe under 540 or so in America that can cause demalation and nerve damage so that's not going to help uh Ms is a dementing disease your body's attacking your milein sheath if you don't have enough B12 you're not going to be able to REM it you're not going to be able to recover from it and heal from it so make sure you're in that optimal range in America it's uh 1100 to 1600 in Australia and the rest of the world most of the rest of the world it's uh 800 to 12200 so definitely get your your um diet in order have some liver make sure your B12 is up make sure your vitamin D is up and uh get rid of everything except for red meat and water beef lamb water that's it maybe some butter but get some fatty off cut trimmings that's your brain's made of that's what your nervous system is made of is is animal fat so that's what you need in your diet and you need to get rid of everything else because that's what your body's reacting to and making antibodies towards and you're and your nerves are getting hit in the crossfire so um that should should help a lot and uh and Dr Sarah in fact on her MRI she wasn't just feeling better symptomatically but her MRI showed her lesions were resolving right she went on no medication now I'm not telling you not to go on medication but I am telling you that this can help and so if you need some medication to help you get through a really rough rough patch that's a good use of medication but it's not something you have to rely on as as a sole treatment because it doesn't it doesn't address the underlying root cause the food is the underlying root cause you're you're introducing things into your body that your body is reacting to making antibodies towards and that's hitting your body in the crossfire so you eliminate that the antibodies come down and I see this when I measure people's antibodies for various autoimmune issues that you can measure them for like Hashimoto or Graves disease very easy to to measure those things and they come down they come right down and then they eat stupid stuff and Pops right back up so you know there's a cause and effect relationship here and I I believe it applies to Ms as well so good l uck with that sjck thank you very much for the for the"

        "body": "uck with that sjck thank you very much for the for the uck with that sjck thank you very much for the for the Super Chat I appreciate it um mom had breast cancer cut out at an early stage avoided chemo the cancer was caused by high estrogen she eats lowfat High plant-based diet and also suffering from weak bones she has also had gallbladder remove uh help please yeah so you know I mean it is the case that you know plants use estrogenic disruptors they have um hormonal disruptors and a lot of those mimic estrogen and so soy milk or soy in general has a lot of estrogen so 3 o of soy has about half the amount of estrogen that a fertile woman would make in a day and about you know uh eight eight or nine times as much um uh estrogen as the birth control pill so it's a lot of estrogen uh in fact this is in the published literature that men have actually grown breasts by drinking as little as eight glasses of soy milk a day or as much as eight glass s milk a day because that's horrifying but that's how much estrogen is in there flax seed as well tons of estrogen and a lot of other things as well have high estrogen meat does not have high estrogen meat has unpro un hormon treated non- hormon treated beef for 3 ounces of lean beef has about 1.3 nanograms of estrogen in it hormone treated be beef has 1.9 nanograms okay so it's a 50% increase but Soy has 200,000 nanograms per three ounces right and a birth control pill is 35,000 and a woman makes nearly 500,000 so you know big difference there you know meat does not contribute to to um UNT estrogen levels it just it just optimizes hormones in everybody um if eaten on its own so low fat not a great idea either you need the fat it's very good for your body it's very good for your brain your brain's made out of it um and she has weak bones because she's doing that unfortunately the body is is made out of meat and we need certain specific nutrients really from meat that are going to help us build and maintain meat and we we can't do that from Plants we don't make we don't you can't it's very difficult to turn plant tissue into animal tissue it's completely different form of life and um you know some animals can do it but we are not those animals and so the reason she has weak bones is because she's eating these plants they have a lot of antinutrients things like oxalates which strip out the calcium from her blood and so in order to not die her body strips calcium from her bones to raise her calcium levels in her blood again because under a certain level of calcium your heart stops goes into tetany just locks up it just cramps it's like a giant muscle cramp but it's your heart right so that's game over right there and so that is is a direct consequence of eating these plants and getting these antinutrients in the plants and so if she removes those plants she starts eating fatty meat which is what we're biologically designed to eat she will reduce her estrogen load from those phyton phytoestrogens and she will improve her bone density I have seen people with osteoporosis elderly ladies with osteoporosis reverse that in a year of a carnivore diet with resistance uh exercises the resistance is important because you're pushing through the your your body heals in line heals and grows in lines of stress so you you work on a muscle in a certain direction you're working that muscle that muscle grows it's working the bones in there too you're you're stimulating the bones to grow and to support that direction of movement and force and weightbearing right so you need the you need the stimulus but you also need the the right nutrition and you need to stay out of your own way you know look up pottinger cats it's very interesting they fed cats cooked meat and raw meat had massively different Health outcomes the cooked meat cats were far less healthy and each generation they got smaller and smaller brains less developed skeleton smaller stature and um and and poorer health and less bone mineralization so exact the same amount of calcium and cooked meat as raw meat but just something about the nutrition changed and their body wasn't able to mineralize the bones properly went from like 14% first gener you know starting out to then 7% big drop and then the next generation was 3% and and the researchers said their bones were like the consistency of foam rubber when they looked at them on autopsy that's pretty crazy and some of these poor little kittens had like upwards of 30 fractures at any given time it was horri horrible and that's what you're doing right if you you disrupt how your body normally works your body can't work properly and so even if there's enough calcium available your body's just not able to regulate it properly like the like in poer cats so that's what you need to do no gallbladder why why does she have no gallbladder because she's been eating a lowfat diet your gallbladder stores bile but it concentrates there because you don't necessarily get you know predators don't necessarily eat every day so you have to you have to sort of store this stuff and concentrate it so that you have a lot available so that when you do get food you can absorb a lot of fat you can absorb as much fat as your body needs in that one go and if you just don't eat fat or very little fat it sits there and it gets more and more concentrated and what happens any hyperconcentrated solution at rest forms crystals forms precipitate right that's what bile sludge is that's what gallstones are and so that's why had that you know if you eat enough fat as in as much fat as your body has Bor it's physically impossible to form a gallstone even if you were going to form a stone in one day which you don't that wouldn't be compatible with Life you'd be dead in the womb that that you know even then if you just ate enough fat that you had all the fat that you had bile for every day it still wouldn't form Stones you couldn't do it there is no bile in the gallbladder to form Stone so unfortunately the reason that she doesn't have a gobl anymore is because she's she was following the diet that she is currently following right now and so that hasn't done her any good and I'm sorry to say it probably led to her cancer as well if you have healthy mitochondria you can't get cancer a lot of these plants have have toxins that directly damage the mitochondria and there's a lot of other things as well um there's there's um genetic issues that can cause damage to the mitochondria also other environmental things but also just not being being in a ketogenic metabolic State you you your insulin is high all the time and you can't go about autophagy and replacing your mitochondria as you're getting sort of broken down and broken down and broken down you eventually you need to replace them you say okay well that one's that one's junked we need to scrap it and make a new one right that's called autop that's part of autophagy it's called mitophagy and you don't need to fast to do that you just need to stop eating carbs because it's insulin High insulin blocks autophagy and so if you just get your insulin down you're an autophagy and mitophagy all the time and so in 3 four months on a car on a carnivore diet a ketogenic meat-based diet like a carnivore diet Studies have shown that you'll have four times the number of mitochondria and they're four times as effective so you'll keep your mitochondria healthy you'll keep your body healthy you'll keep your brain healthy and and you generally won't get cancer because you're not you're not doing the things that insult your body to the extent that they're going to get cancer having a gallbladder removed now is still not a problem going carnivore even high fat carnivore because her liver is still making bile it's just that it's making it in a just dripping out constantly so she may have to split up her fatty meals if she get eats a you know more fat and she gets basically loose stools from that that's because her body just wasn't able to absorb that fat and it just comes out fine okay so don't eat as much fat split that up throughout the day but a lot of people form what's called a pseudo bladder which is an out pouching of the common bow duck it works exactly like a a gallbladder does and so she may have that so if she eats a big meal with fat in it and she doesn't get loose stools doesn't like you know running to the toilet you know 30 minutes later then then that's probably what happened and she'll she'll be fine so just just listen to her body but hopefully she hears this and listens to this and gives it a try because I think it will absolutely revolu tionize her health uh Edson Melendez thank you for the"

        "body": "ndful of that Mary Shepard thank you very much for the ndful of that Mary Shepard thank you very much for the Super Chat good to see you um on the sad diet um cholesterol was 218 HDL 62 LDL 129 Tri 130 glucose 129 A1C 58 versus Carnival for 46 days cholesterol um slightly up HDL slightly up LDL slightly up uh triglycerides down glucose down A1C down are these values okay my doctor's gone up is g to poop out a satin uh no I look I think those are those are excellent remember cholesterol was never the cause of heart disease so we we need to stop thinking in that mindset you know we're we're still you know we're still sort of slaves to that idea that the sugar company's pumped out there uh that's complete complete fiction you know it was never it was never the cause of heart disease that was that was it was just blame was cast on it to try to take the blame off of sugar and and to point people's eyes in the different R it was a red herring you know that's it and we know that now you know we know that they that they were pushing this out there just like the tobacco companies were putting out false information and studies to to make it look like tobacco wasn't a problem and smoking wasn't a problem and of course it was and of course sugar is and all this junk food garbage that doesn't belong in the human body and you can oh well these studies I don't give a what your study says were we eating it 50,000 years ago during an Ice Age yes or no if no then don't eat it especially if it wasn't if we weren't eating it 500,000 years ago during an ice age when we were evolving into what we are now you know if we haven't evolved to eat it if we're not biologically designed to eat it you shouldn't eat it it's all there is to it you know so you know just uh um you know I wouldn't um you know I wouldn't uh uh you I I wouldn't eat anything that's not biologically sign for you know you don't do studies you don't ask a bunch of you we don't ask you know 50 Jaguars what they ate last year and you know see what they you just look at what Jaguars eat in the wild you know you don't need a study to tell you that you don't need like a like an experimental data set know you just what the hell Jaguars eat what do what do elephants eat you know you feed them something else do they get sick yes they do okay well don't do that then right so same applies to us that's the only thing you need to know about human nutrition is what have humans been eating the longest and that answer is meat and that's what we do best on and so that's all you need to know about but yeah no you're looking great so total cholesterol is associated with longevity and living over 100 right High total cholesterol um high LDL cholesterol is also associated with longevity as well higher LD HDL and lower triglycerides is associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk and metabolic health so all those things are great and your glucose is right down and that's the M main thing because diabetes increases your risk of of developing heart disease by a th% that's up there with smoking a metabolic syndrome which you would get if you had low HDL and high Tri glycerides and then diabetes and high blood pressure and all these other things that increases it again another 600% right and so even if you had like sdldl and all that sort of stuff would you don't because you have um High HDL and and um and low and lowering triglycerides you know that um you know even if you did that would only increase your risk by 70% right so the hell are we even talking about here you get rid of those other things you get rid of the of the diabetes you get rid of the metabolic syndrome that's what's reducing your risk and you know what the same things that reduce di get rid of diabetes and metabolic syndrome also get rid of the sdldl um you know there's some people out there that are that are just lying and saying that oh the carnivore patients you know raise their sdldl and their blood sugar goes up total and anyone who says that just call them a liar they are absolutely lying um it's just people trying to spread misinformation um you see it right here in your Bloods 46 days and you have exactly the opposite of what these people are lying about and saying and they're saying oh well you should still do an animal- based diet eat a lot of meat but don't have a be carnivore have veggies and this that and whatever the hell they they're pushing out there it's nonsense you know just and and anytime you see that call it out because that's that's really really dangerous misinformation that they're putting out there and it's it's just total lie I I I I absolutely don't believe a single person that says that you there's a guy saying that all my patients they do 100% carnivore 100% of them get you know 100% of my 100% carnivore patients get nutritional deficiencies and uh diabetes and and their sdldl goes up bull anybody who says that is a liar and I'll say that to their face in public in front of their mother they are a liar and an for trying to for trying to spread that sort of Mis information that hurts people and so you know tell them I said that please because that's total you're doing fine um all of your numbers are improving they're going in the right direction um higher LDL I think is beneficial um but it's whatever your body wants it to do that's what it's supposed to be because this is we're talking about eating what you're physiologically designed for your body's going to do what it's physiologically design too LDL goes up a bit that's because it wants it to be go up a bit we're looking at this um from from the lens of cholesterol causes heart disease it doesn't so um you know watch my my you know video on the truth about cholesterol and heart disease I go into a lot of this watch Dr Paul Mason's videos on saturated fat and cholesterol and heart disease and all these sorts of things um oh who is it oh gosh why can't I remember his name U Malcolm Kendrick Dr Malcolm Kendrick in the UK wrote a book called the clot thickens calls all out all this stuff out you know it's it's total crap Dr SRA wrote a book called A statin-free Life calls it all out too it's gar it's absolute garbage and uh you know so don't worry about it too much and at the end of the day you know your doctor obviously well-meaning wants the best for you and we will suggest recommen and recommend medications that he thinks are the best for you but at the end of the day it's your body you don't have to take medication that you don't want to uh legally and and ethically like you just you take what you want to take you take what's right for you and if you talk to your doctor and he makes a case that's conv to you and you say like okay I think this is going to benefit me then that's when you take medication if you don't think it's going to benefit you and you think that it's it's going to be negative for you then you don't take it you definitely don't take it that is um that is not a good idea okay let me see here sorry um I saw Melissa thank you um there we go uh the"
