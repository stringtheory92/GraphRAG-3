    "transcript": "vegetarianism started getting pushed really hard in the 1800s because of the puritanical movement and the temperance movement it's because they thought that women especially shouldn't eat meat because it give them carnal desires you eat of the flesh you'll think of the Flesh and and can't have that you know can't have people reproducing and being healthy and fertile no no no we need to suppress that and so the idea was if you were a virtuous person you would go vegetarian to suppress your sexual urges and any experiment any model and any observation in nature When Animals stop being interested in mating in reproduction they are sick there is something wrong all right hello everyone thank you very much uh for joining my live session today uh very sorry that we had to sort of delay a bit of the times just had some appointments this morning that that ran late so I apologize for that thank you everyone who's still here and people that are joining in and sorry for the people on the east coast of the US because it's pretty late now and probably won't be able to to get much of it uh so I apologize for that but hopefully you'll be able to to catch the replay um I had some uh chats and questions and super chats from earlier that I'm still going to try to get to uh now so we'll start with them anyway the people can ask questions uh I have about two hours today before I have to go uh so that'll be uh 1:30 p.m. my time here in Perth 1:30 a.m. in the east coast so probably not too many people over there but um go for a couple hours anyway and hopefully catch c as many questions as we can so question from Lena thank you for the Super Chat I eat fatty meat and it stops tasting good but I get full before meeting one gram of protein per pound of body weight since the meat is so fatty what to do keep going um I don't I don't think that you have to uh worry too much about that it depends on your body's demands and what what your body's asking for also if you're eating more than once a day that might might be a solution so some people think that they have to eat just once a day that's not necessarily the case especially if you're working out exercising you you will probably be hungrier than that and want to eat more times throughout the day so just listen to your body it it doesn't have to be once a day if you're finding that you can eat two decent sized meals and so it stops tasting good um then then do that um I often find when I'm working out more and obviously my body will have a more higher demand for energy and protein at that time then I will then I will need to eat more than once a day I'll eat usually twice a day if I'm not able to do that I can get leaner I can get stronger but I don't tend to get bulkier and so you you need you know more more meat to put on meat and when I'm able to eat enough and I'm working out I put on muscle very very easily but I have to eat I have to get enough so try eating more than once a day if you don't think you're getting enough but I have no idea how many grams of protein I'm getting per pound of body weight and I'm not too worried about it you know it uh it works out uh either way remember that our bodies are much more complex than than a simple equation like one gram of protein for one gr one gr of pound of body weight you know this is a this is a you know we can give it some people a threshold saying hey let's try to get a minimum and um and that and that has been shown to be beneficial especially when people are undereating protein but if your body's telling you to stop and you're doing well and you're healthy and you're lean and strong and putting on muscle that's really the only thing uh that you need to worry about otherwise it's sort of a guideline to help guide people in the right direction so at least they're not uh you know really missing out on on different nutrients but I think that if you just listen to your body you'll be fine and um if you need to eat more than once a day then that's also part of listening to your body as well so uh do what you can there uh dropping bear Survivor thanks thanks for the Super Chat uh any thoughts on drop bears for people that don't know are koalas supposed to drop down out of the trees and attack you and eat you um but apparently survives so that's good so any thoughts on people with Appo E3 and or four genes being told to avoid saturated fat yeah I'd say nonsense um it doesn't matter what your your genetic idiosyncrasies are you're still a human I mean that that's the only genetic marker you need is are you are you human um if you are then you need to eat what humans are designed to eat which is high fat meat all animals get saturated fat by and large so carnivores 70% of animal species are carnivores and they eat meat they eat meat and fat um and a lot of them eat saturated fat unless you're like you eating fish they may have less saturated fats but you know sharks are eating seals that are high and saturated fats and then obviously lions and other carnivores are eating terrestrial animals that that are uh that contain saturated fat and they get protein and saturated fat that's what they get and then herbivores they break down uh fiber not they but their microbes break down fiber into and may as a waste product produce saturated fat and then those microbes die and get absorbed as protein so pretty much all animals on Earth including humans uh get saturated fat and protein as as major portions of their diet and regardless of their genetics so you this is just this this false vilification of fat and cholesterol in particular and um it's wrong it's just completely backwards and wrong um it's not a it's not a supposition you know this was this is the sugar companies invented the idea that cholesterol was bad for you in order to cast the blame away from their products so these are drug dealers and they've always been drug dealers this is a drug sugar is a drug it is toxic to the body it is addictive to the body and they want to push this on people because they're drug dealers and they want to sell drugs and that's why that you hook kids early on drugs and then you have customers for the rest of of their lives however short they may be um so this is just again with the vilification of fat you look at the Journal of American College of Cardiology in 2020 they looked at saturated fat and it and its uh association with cardiovascular disease for one thing uh and they found absolutely no association between saturated fat consumption and cardiovascular disease in fact and they were looking at randomized control trials metanalyses al randomized control trials all the top tier levels of of of uh evidence and they found absolutely no association between saturated fat and and um heart disease or cardiovascular disease and in fact they found an inverse relationship between saturated fat intake and stroke rate so the more saturated fat people ate the less Strokes they had the less saturated fat they ate the more Strokes they had so we have gotten this wrong well we didn't get this wrong they lied and misrepresented the facts in order to fool us so that they could keep selling their dirty drugs to us and um and that's not me saying that that's their own words saying that published in the journal American Medical Association in 2016 detailing how they paid off various professors from Harvard uh and elsewhere to falsify data and publish fraudulent studies to make it appear as if cholesterol ins saturated fat were the problem when it was much more likely to be sugar and processed foods one of those professors was named head of the USDA he was the one who authored and published the USDA declaration saying that cholesterol cause heart disease saturated fat incase cholesterol bile may stop eating both and they just start blaming everything else and they say oh Alzheimer's g red meat oh diabetes going oh red meat even though we've been we've been reducing our red meat and saturated fat intake for the last 40 years by over a third and the these diseases are going up must be it's just too much red meat you okay we're eating less red meat not less enough okay so how is it how is it that we are that we are getting worse as saturated fat is getting low lower if saturated fat is the cause cause and effect relationship is if you remove the cause the effect goes away but in fact the effect is getting magnified when we are are taking away this supposed cause so Appo E34 LDL c h what it doesn't matter you know Appo doesn't matter these are all just shifting the goalposts and just saying don't eat me don't eat fat this just this is propaganda um and it's garbage so the only genetic factors you need to worry about are you human do your genes say that you're a human being then you should eat what a human being is supposed to eat lions eat what lions eat dolphins eat what dolphins eat cows eat what cows are supposed to eat if they go outside of that they may get hurt uh I don't know of a single animal on Earth that gets harmed by eating meat though even herbivores that we see herbivores opportunistically eating smaller animals all the time you just go on YouTube and and look for elks eating rabbits and ducklings and birds and mice and chickens and all these sorts of things they do it so do horses so do cows um if they have the opportunity to they just munch them up because that's what we need here we need we need protein and fat and we need the nutrients to build and develop meat easiest access to that is meat another animal that has already done the hard work for us so uh nope it's crap I don't I don't worry about any of that stuff so any any anytime just just what about this and saturated fat no saturated fat is what we're designed for we're designed to eat well not just saturated fat but we're designed the animal fats is is more accurate not all of them are saturated fats but the saturated fats in animal fats are not bad for you so eat animals eat animal fats that's how you're going to be the healthiest you're going to be and you avoid all the other things that's how you're going to be the healthiest that you can be hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor cornivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want a nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys Bloom thank you for the super chat um raw eggs is asking about I want to add muscle working out a lot and consuming around 12 to 16 eggs a day how much should I fear sell Manila currently in Argentina how are eggs in Latin America American countries oh that's a good that's a good question you know it really just depends on where you're getting them from I don't know the rates in in Argentina um something that you you probably you know search around on Google for and see what they are you know a lot of people do drink raw eggs I drink raw eggs every now and then um you do run the risk of Sal Manila it's um going to be pretty low risk but it's a real risk and you get salmona you'll you'll freaking know about it um if you're not drinking a lot of water as well though if you have very potent stomach acid lower pH that may offset the risk because that can kill those bugs before they set in if you have higher pH you're eating a whole bunch of things that buffer your stomach a or drinking tons of water or other sorts of foods that can that can buffer that acid that's more of a risk because you're you're going to not have as hostile an environment for those bacteria in your stomach we have a very low stomach pH because our ancestors were scavengers and carnivores and they were they didn't have refrigeration outside of the ice ages probably had natural freezers in the ice ages could just put a a mammoth hunk in the snow bank and come back to it whenever you wanted but um in general we had to contend with a high bacterial load and so that's uh that's one of the major defenses that we have is that is that it's low stomach pH high acidity um so it just depends you know it it it is a risk that you run um so I I I'm not going to recommend anyone drinks raw eggs all I can say is that people do it and it um you know and there are people that have done it safely and there are ways to do it more safely but it is a risk um and as um you know as as any sort of responsible person I need to you know you know discuss those risks quite seriously because you know you get a salmon illan poisy you can die from that you know that's very serious so I have absolutely drank raw milk or raw eggs um you know sort of like a dozen at a time it's usually when I'm just on the go and I'm like okay I'm on call I'm I'm on for 10 minutes and I'm just calling right back in uh haven't eaten all day today it's been 24 hours since I've eaten and I'm going to be in the hospital operating all night and all day in the next day so you know what I'm just going to drink 14 eggs and uh and call it a day you know and so and that's and that's what I've done and I've been fine but yeah you do run the risk you know do check it out you know if you're if you're going from a you know trusted source and you're washing the eggs and things like that as well as you can you know you're going to reduce that risk if you have low stomach pH you know that's going to that's going to help you out too but it is a risk if you just want to cook them cooking cooking works and um but um a lot of people do raw eggs if you want to put on muscle you just eat meat you just work out and you eat meat you have to eat enough so you just have to keep eating till fatty meat stops tasting good you have to do that at least twice a day and eggs are are great you know like Vince Gonda used to say that if if you I think it was over 30 eggs a day uh for you know who knows how big of a person you know probably you know bodybuilder sized people that was the equivalent of had the anabolic effect of of lowd dose steroids so you know there there may be something to that and eggs are eggs are a great addition and quite affordable so um you know just do be careful with the raw part of it because you know that that's a real risk even though uh don't think it's as as great as people think it is but it is real and if people do get sick from salmonella they can die you know so you need just you need to be smart about that sort of thing you know like raw meat from from most countries that's not going to be contaminated you know um and if it is you just sear the outside generally food handling like if someone had dirty hands and they mo move that then you're getting the bacteria eoli whatever from your hands onto the meat but the meat generally doesn't have have that on it because they're very careful especially in in Western countries they're very careful about uh meat that goes out and they check it uh very rigorously and if there's any sort of problem they just do a whole recall they pull it all back so um that I think is is more safe in those situations but um I think eggs are pretty safe too but you do run that risk so just be careful Jesse Driscoll uh says my wife has been dealing with seizures and is on all types of different meds under supervision of doctors could carnivore help bring her off those meds three different meds how uh would she start well you you you start by just starting you know if you if you're really serious about it and you want to just get going with it then you just just throw out all the crap in your house you just just get rid of all the different foods and ingredients uh in your house you give them away to someone that you presumably don't like because you AR don't mind that they get poisoned and you uh you just stock up meat and you just eat high fat meat and water and that's what you do and you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good um I have a number of videos on how to get started so like um you know carnivore uh for beginners carnivore diet for beginners and fiber constipation and diet those sorts of things I have a a playlist called uh getting started on a carnivore diet and that has a lot of things on how to do it but also why to do it why it matters why it makes a difference and why it's a good idea to keep keep keep doing this and especially with things like seizures I mean that that there's a hundred years of clinical data showing that ketogenic diets and general like a carnivore die which should be ketogenic in my opinion um that they they have significant benefits to people with epilepsy and suffering from seizures certainly many forms of seizures in any case so that's um that's something that you should that I would absolutely encourage anyone to try and I I really get pissed off when doctors put people on um seizure medications outside of an acute setting um before discussing and counseling diet you know we have we have patients and we do brain surgery on we're cutting out tumors like that's just that's a a heightened risk for getting seizures you start having seizures you're more likely to have more seizures and so you don't want them to to develop an epileptic uh epileptic disorder and so you you put them on anti medications for a short period of time after surgery that's standard practice I totally agree with that outside of that you know when you have someone coming in they start having new seizures okay fine you put them on medication to to sort of uh prevent further seizures you have that conversation about diet next I think it's completely unethical to just ignore that side of things and just prescribe medications um you know if it's on like a short-term sort of thing like you know you have surgery they're going to be out for seven days fine you don't have time to talk about diet after that fine but um you have someone with with seizure disorder I I think it's it behooves us to discuss this because that's that's a very very strong adjunct to these other treatments in fact it was the treatment for seizures for a very long time before Pharmaceuticals came out so that's how you start um ketogenic is the main thing there uh it just changes your brain energy how your brain runs and functions and uh but the carnivore ketogenic carnivore diet I think is even better because you're removing a lot of different potential triggers for seizures that have nothing to do with carbohydrates insulin and ketones so I think that I think they're all all important so what you do is you definitely work with her doctors you do not come off medications without help of her doctors and you go on a carnivore diet strict ketogenic carnivore diet keep those Ketone levels High so very high fat and um and and higher higher Ketone seems to be uh beneficial for suppressing seizures or really probably you know the other way around is maybe precipitating the seizures again cause an effect you remove something the effect goes away is that part of the cause of this something something you have to think about so uh and then you work with her doctors if she seizure free for for 6 months to a year and she's feeling great you know that's uh that's potentially a time that her doctors may feel comfortable weaning her off one medication partially and seeing how she does she needs someone on board though she needs one of her doctors on board to to be able to um do this safely these things aren't safe to come off uh very quickly you have to do it in very slow uh slow and um Progressive manner but the main thing is is doing the diet and making sure that she's seizure free the longer she seizure free the less likely is she to have another seizure and so that's good so unless she actually stops her seizures obviously you can't consider coming off medications if she's still having seizures every now and then so she has to be ve you know very healthy and seizure free for a very long period of time before you start considering at least six months to a year and then you know talk to her doctor about hey what do we think about this and um and then you know but the thing is those that you know you know ketogenic carnivore diet is going to help anyway she's going to be a lot Health healthier in a lot of other ways so even if she can't come off those medications you she's still going to be better off for it so I would definitely highly encourage that but don't try to come off these meds on your own it's it's it's really unsafe uh so you need help and if her you know current doctor isn't isn't really willing to come off on that you can always get a second opinion from from another neurologist to to try to help her wean off you know there should be someone out there that can help Jason Anthony wilpers says Al always a pleasure to listen to these really enjoy them I like the uh the depth it's a bit like a university lecture in the best possible way thank you so much for uploading well thank you very much I appreciate that I sometimes wonder if I go into too much depth and don't get to enough questions but I think a lot of these questions they need depth you know you can't just sort of just say oh yeah just you know like the last question you know was like oh how do we start that yeah just just start just stop eating plants just only eat meat and uh yeah and then talk to your doctor I mean you I that's essentially what I said but obviously there's much more context to that and I think that's important to go through so at least someone appreciates it thanks for that Rochelle uh Alvis says new here um doing keto and considering carnivore uh thanks to you good can you get enough omega-3 DHA EPA for good brain health from meat and eggs alone I was hoping not to eat salmon or fish oil fear of oxidation yeah you know the fish oil supplements aren't a great great idea um I don't know when it was it was a few years ago I think it's probably done more than once because I've heard this a few times that you independent testing Labs that you know tested fish oil supplements and they just found like 70% of them were oxidized by the time you got they got on the Shelf they're monounsaturated fatty acid so they have that double bond and that that's a point of of attack they can just pop that double bond these other molecules can can break that take that energy and uh they can oxidize and just change change the Dynamics of that molecule it's not the same molecule anymore and so it's um it's important to sort of get this in in in the fish in the meat in in the animal itself because once you take that out just like with seed oils plant oils they oxidize and they they break down into pretty nasty nasty chemicals um they are more stable in the plant they are more stable in the meat so you know yes you're going to get Omega sixes and other sorts of nasty things from eating plants that have you know fats and oils but they they're way worse when you have that liquid extract oil that's sitting there oxidizing and breaking down and getting all nasty especially if you cook with them that rapidly increases the degradation oxidation of these things um same with fish oil you know it's not you're not cooking with it but it is degrading and you know 70% are are oxidized by the time they hit the shelf and those they you have three-month Supply in a bottle what are the odds that they're not going to be completely oxidized uh you know shortly after buying them or halfway through using them even if you put them in the fridge you know know you don't even know if that they were unoxidized in the first place so um I I think it's best to get it from the meat you'll get plenty of DHA and EPA from uh you know terrestrial animals um like cows and and uh deer and sheep and things like that and eggs but you'll get a lot more depending on what that animal a so a beep that's been in a feed lot for over three months some Studies have shown that they don't have much uh Omega-3s at all so definitely grass-fed um and finished is going to have a better omega-3 profile H same with pasteurized eggs pasteurized eggs not pasteurized pasture raised eggs if you just cook them they pasturize um pasture raised eggs uh we just you know it it does matter what the animals eating will most people do brilliantly on grain finish beef absolutely you'll do better on that than basically anything else you're going to eat but there is an objective difference between these nutrients and the omega-3 profiles so if that's something that you you do want to take advantage of then you know grass fed and finished is the way to go the way to figure that out is the fat yellow if the Fat's white probably not grass finished even if it says grass-fed it may not be grass finished any cow can be called grass fed because they live on a pasture they eat grass it's only for the last few months they go into a feed lot so they all get to say grass-fed but it's grass-fed and finished so if the Fat's yellow you that that's actually a good sign that that's been eating grass up in you know up until the end right so uh that's a good way of telling and then you know pasturized eggs things like that are a good good plan as well uh grass-fed butter you know excellent source of of these uh fat soluble nutrients also and healthy fats uh and be ay I think that's how they say it um and says at a comfortable weight do not want to reduce anymore how do I know that my body knows this uh sure others have been in a similar boat yeah it's a bit scary isn't it but you know if if you can under eat on a carnivore diet it's very easy to do that and you can just because you're just not hungry you don't feel hungry in the same way that used to before so you're just you know just like oh I don't need to eat I ate some and I feel that that's enough and that's normally what we we would do in order to say slim and trim and and not it out of shape uh or put on weight you don't do that anymore you eat until fatty meat stops tasting good and you may have to do that twice a day you know I see see people do this all the time I I have to I have to know really encourage my dad every time I go back to see him to to eat more because he is in this Camp I did that for years in my early 20s because no one told me they need of this stuff and I just didn't need for four days in a row because I'm I'm just not hungry I'm just not hungry but it was it was seriously affecting my ability to perform athletically after I mean it took like two years but it happened and eventually I just said okay look I I may not feel hungry but I have to eat I'm clearly not getting enough um and that's what you do so you know like I I told my dad this last time was there is like every day you just need to eat like it's your job your job is to eat food that's what you do now and so you know that's your job you have to eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you do that at least twice a day and uh and you know obviously don't eat anything else um but that's what you have to do too so if if you're if you're eating fatty meat till it stops tasting good and you're not eating anything else you can listen to your body signals there may be outliers out there uh people on medications different medications can alter your your hunger either for or against eating more uh caffeine caffeine is going to going to suppress your hunger and maybe you do eat less than you than you should I'm talking about just eating meat just eating water nothing else to complicate the issue then yes you you should be able to do that uh how do we know this well we don't necessarily know it for sure this is just this has just come from observing the Known World animals in the wild eat until they decide to stop it's not oh they just they're just eating and then they run out of food no that's not that's not the case you know P her pride of lions you know takes down an elephant there are elephant hunting Lions you they have they have food for days you know they're they're not seeing they're just gorging themselves oh my God they choose to stop you know king lion gets to eat as much as he wants before any other lion gets to touch it it's called The Lion Share eats as much as he wants of what he wants and he doesn't just Gorge himself to puking and fat and all these sorts of thing he's not undereating as well he's just eating until something in his body tells him that's enough and he stops and that works and that works for us too and that goes by taste you have to relearn your hunger signals they they are there they're just much more subtle they're very different so just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you'll be you you'll be where your body wants you to be that's what happens for animals in the wild and that's what we've been observing in humans that start to eat their natural diet as well if you're losing a lot more weight you than you think you want you might be undereating so get rid of things that might curb your appetite like caffeine and then and then eat until fatty meat stops tasting good twice a day just to make sure that you're getting enough hey everyone if you need a little extra help getting started on a carnivore diet and my online resources that I have for free aren't enough for you you can go to www w. howto carnivore docomond carnivore challenge where you'll have online Resources Group support weekly Zoom meetings as well as the ability to chat live with myself Simon Lewis and the others in the challenge who can help you and support you and give you extra advice and help you along the way so if that sounds like something that would be beneficial to you then please go to howto carnivore eat fat thanks for good good add-on or good um segue into that eat fat thank you for the Super Chat female friend 34 years old with autoimmune hepatitis takes 9 milligrams of bues buide haven't come across that one before uh have you seen improvements on carnivore or any recommendations thank you um so I mean I I don't treat autoimmune hepatitis or or hepatitis in general but you know any autoimmune issue I I think will be very much affected and benefited by a carnivore diet at least from all the the autoimmune issues that I've seen so far I have yet to see an autoimmune condition that doesn't respond extremely well to a pure red meat and water diet and it really does do best on red meat and water only grass-fed and finished as the ultimate expression of of um of uh the ideal simply because what I think seems to be the case and what the what the evidence shows to me is that the things that we're eating basically the plants and the garbage that are not designed for our bodies our bodies are re reacting to and responding to and these things can glom on to different parts of our body like our you know thyroid and our liver and pancreas and all these other sorts of things and intestines joints all these sort of things they can glom onto these things and start attacking them and the body starts attacking that and you make these specific antibodies towards that plant toxin usually lectins and organ complex that's you get specific antibodies towards towards um towards your organs um but when you stop eating these things we measure these antibodies they go down they go down they go away because the assault is not happening on your body anymore that complex is not there those lectin aren't there and you don't have any problems so I I can tell you with certainty that that would be the case with things like Crohn's disease because we actually have you know uh experimental data in humans showing that uh with elimination diets and removing carbs and fiber and all these sorts of things um that those those improve uh with autoimmune hepatitis I I haven't come across that enough but um I would bet that it would because I've just never seen an autoimmune issue that didn't respond like that and if that's the underlying disease process and and pathology then that's going to apply to any autoimmune disease and I and I'm that's what I feel that is um is the case with with autoimmune diseases in general so it's definitely well worth the well worth the shot uh red meat and water only is going to be her best bet improve sleep reduce stress these things all matter as well but uh definitely the food is I think most important tkm 7211 thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat I appreciate it hi Dr chaffy been carnivore about five years my teeth are quite stained from years of smoking do you have a view on coconut oil pulling thanks for all you do um I don't I don't really know what that is um I I in for context I would imagine that's something to do with using coconut oil to destain your teeth um if that's just something you're applying topically and it's and it's helping pulling out the the stain and you're not swallowing it or drinking it or eating it in any large form I don't I don't see the problem in that um if you have you know you know your dentist has other sorts of treatments that can help with the whitening of your teeth you know I mean it's I'm sure there are reasons not to do this for Optimal Health but you know it's just just a one-off sort of thing and it it helps the staining you know it's probably not that big of a deal I if that's what you're talking about with coconut oil probably not too much of a problem as long as you're not ingesting any of these things um it's just going on to the enamel and not soaking into your mucosa and even if it were it'd be very minimal so uh if that's what you're talking about then I I'd say go for it you know if it's something that can reduce the staining on your teeth I I certainly don't know of any reason why it would be detrimental to your health anyway not that I know of but um like I said I don't I don't actually know what that is so I can't I can't speak too knowledgeably about that but if it's just for standing of the teeth it's probably fine uh comment from darit um Anthony chaffy thank you so much for helping me with the weird symptoms I'm in my 40s um also in my 40s also and finally got a diagnosis of hypermobile EDS thanks to the information you gave me I'm grateful well that's great I'm I'm glad that you got that uh at least know what's going on and also you know EDS ERS D syndrome is uh is something that I've seen people improve remarkably on even by just eating a lot more meat and and getting off the carbs for some reason the carbs seem to screw everything up but um and need a lot more meat people have have found that um it's well at least my patients have found and I you know I've limited number of them with other's downloads but I do have them and um and other people that I've spoken to online that have improved as well that their pain has has largely gone um and their dislocations have have gone when they're eating most meet and when they're not you know then it comes back so again there's that cause and effect relationship you remove the cause the effect should go away unlike cholesterol when you remove cholesterol heart disease and cardiovascular disease mortality goes up so you know that's not that's not what you want um not a good cause and effect relationship there but with Ellis dless there seems to be and so when you remove these things and you start eating more meat people's other downloads get better I would imagine that this is because you're getting in all the substrates necessary to form proper collagen as opposed to allowing you letting your body uh just make denovo collagen uh which is you know if you have genetic reason why you're not making collagen properly and you have to make this from scratch every time yeah you're going to have you know you're going to have poor quality uh collagen and if you're eating collagen and you're eating meat that has collagen has these amino acids then we can use as building blocks for that you don't need to do it to Novo you have all the building blocks there you're just putting them together like a Lego set and I would imagine that that's what's going on that's at least an explanation that that explains the The observed phenomena in any case any small thank you for the Super Chat when fasting and aiming for 72 hours to get the PE atopy benefits do the benefits stop if you break your fast or does it continue for a while even though you have broken the fast well it just it really just depends um on on what you're fasting from um I've never seen evidence that shows that it's the lack of food that c that that stimulates autophagy and stem cell um stem cell production and mitophagy and all these other sorts of beneficial uh phenomenon maybe there is but I just haven't seen it and I've asked a lot of people who are you know quite expert in fasting and um you know is there is there a benefit to just not eating or you on top of being in ketosis already on a ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet is there a benefit on top of that because there are quite a lot of studies looking at fasting mimicking diets they say well fasting has all these benefits and the these studies that show these benefit X and then they say Okay fasting hard and not everybody can do this for long periods of time so what about a diet that mimics the metabolic state of being fasted right so the so-called ketogenic diet right um does that have the same benefit you know does that get you benefit X and the ones I've seen all get benefit X sometimes even get better benefits than than the fasting groups did with less side effects such as hair loss um and so you know minimum of 100 grams of protein a day seems to uh do away with the side some of the side effects you see from long-term fasting of just not eating anything uh such as hair loss so if you're just eating a carnivore diet you're always going to be going through autophagy you're always going to be going through mitophagy you're always going to be turning these cells over you're always going to be in that state because you're always going to be in fasted State and so if you are fasting from a carnivore diet and you start eating meat after that yeah that's going to continue because it never stopped in the first place and it didn't start because you stopped eating meat it stopped when you stopped eating carbs because your insulin went down and Insulin disrupts over a hundred different um metabolic processes in your body shuts down what changes and and and disrupts uh a lot of processes when insulin gets out of balance insulin lowers blood sugar sure that's one of its many effects it has over a 100 different effects in your body and so when you raise it artificially for blood sugar reasons now it's out of balance for every other other reason it doesn't just go oh no this is going to be just for you know just for uh the blood sugar part of it every everyone else just be chill we're doing everything Norm no it goes up it affects everything up at that level if your insulin is at three normally and then you eat carbohydrates and goes up to 16 it's you know it was affecting things at a three all the 100 plus different things it's affecting it a three now it's affecting it a 16 well what the hell's that doing well it's it's getting everything out of balance and there's a lot of people that have much higher insulin levels than that I mean there's there's people that just have fasting insulin of 16 so it never goes below 16 and then when they eat it jumps up to 30 40 50 I had a gentleman that came in a couple weeks ago his fasting insulin was 72 fasting so he had fasted uh and his insulin didn't come down below 72 that's that's serious metabolic distress and harm and um you know so that's you know that's that's a problem that we're working on but guess what carnivore diet just lowers that right down to normal very quickly uh for him it's going to be longer than than other people but uh it'll still happen it'll still happen relatively quickly it took decades for him to get there it's it's going to take weeks for him to get out you know which is a pretty damn good deal uh I'd say well not all the way out it won't be week for all the way out it could be months and years to get all the way out but that insulin will start coming down straight away um and it affects things it affects all these sorts of things so that's what shuts down your stem cells that's what shuts down autophagy that's what shuts down mitophagy so your mitochondria aren't as plentiful and they're not as as as effective efficient and and um they they can beet diseases because your mitochondria really run the show they really run and organize your your cells from the inside out and when they don't work right you don't work right and so um just studies on ketogenic diets just being on a ketogenic diet for three four months you have four times the number of mitochondria and they're four times as effective so obviously this is going on without fasting it's the metabolic State you want to be in not you just not a lack of food altogether if there are benefits of just not eating you know that's possible but I I I I haven't seen any studies that that display that I'm sure people like you know uh Jason fun you know who's way more uh knowledgeable than I am on fasting he he may know of data on that and I'd be very interested in that I mean if it's some something that benefits on top of just eating a carnivore diet then you know I'd be interested in knowing that I mean it's certainly something we're capable of you know Mongol Mongol hord genghiskhan they they would go five days ravaging the countryside and they without eating and then they they'd eat 10 pounds of Hors meat and do it again you know and so you know all predators they have to be able to subsist on their own body fat nutrients for long periods of time between kills that's normal we're definitely set up for that but is that an advantage is it an advantage to not eat to have less access to resources I don't see how that would make too much sense biologically um you know and when when humans were hunting mammoths like you didn't you didn't need to get a mammoth every day you know maybe you got a mammoth or two for the year and your your tribe was eating well every day for the year you know and uh ples Indians and in North America up to the 1800s when they're just doing Buffalo and they're doing Buffalo drops they ate every day all year if they wanted to they had access to pemin all year round so I don't know that there's an advantage I don't know why there would be biologically uh to just not eating as opposed to eating our our requisite diet um but if people know about studies that that suggest that compare ketogenic diets to fasting and have different outcomes please pop it in the chat tag me in it I'm I'm always interested in these sorts of things the one ones that I've seen have you know the same or even better benefits when doing a ketogenic diet we haven't even done it with carnivore yet you know so um that's that's what we want to do is uh is is know if there's an actual difference between eating properly and not eating at all I would bet that um the benefit comes from just eating properly and just not eating the improper things Stags thank you very much for the Super Chat being carnivore uh for three months doctor's concerned yeah some do do get that way total cholesterol is 10.8 triglycerides 0.5 fantastic HDL 1.92 even better LDL is immaterial um and then all the rest of it so you know again cholesterol was never the problem it was a scapegoat by the sugar companies you know that's that's their words not mine and so this was never the problem when we look at total cholesterol then we're looking at LDL then we're looking at ratios and we're looking at Apple it's just shifting the goalpost it was never the damn problem in the first place you go back and you look at the origin the data that was available at the time there was no association whatsoever between cholesterol or LDL and heart disease at all none and in fact things like the Framingham study showed an inverse association between total cholesterol and cardiovascular death and mortality right so the lower your total cholesterol the more people died of heart attacks and strokes so this was just misrepresented this was the the AHA the American Heart Association is a pack of lying something and they have multiple times throughout the last century in in well documented instances been bought and paid for by the Food Industries um such as the sugar companies or people on their boards or in charge of it being on the payroll of the sugar companies the big food companies Proctor and Gamble bought Crisco from the Germans who who invented it as as machine lubricant for tank gears I believe and Proctor and Gamble bought it and said yeah it was just feeded to these idiots and and they paid the American Heart Association $20 million to lie and say that it was better for your heart than animal fats like lard and butter and say it was really good for your heart it's much better than this don't want that you want Crisco this clean wonderful Crisco this clean beautiful machine oil lubricant um it's disgusting you know and this isn't this isn't conjecture this isn't a conspiracy theory it's a it's an historical fact it's on the record it's a matter of record so again um I'm I'm you know I appreciate your doctor's concern but you know that is just not what the evidence shows us what the evidence shows us is that high LDL low triglyceride means you're very metabolically healthy you likely don't have metabolic syndrome you're unlikely to have diabetes and those are the major risk factors um besides smoking and drinking um for um cardiovascular disease and higher LDL is associated with longevity higher total cholesterol is associated with longevity in studies with sorry 12 million people for LDL and um we just see more and more and more data showing that LDL and total cholesterol have absolutely nothing to do with development of heart disease um there have been three studies that I found that show these results but um you know one that I'll mention is a 2009 study out of UCLA where they looked at something like 134,000 people who've had a heart attack in uh I believe it was just in America and 73% had low or ideal LDL cholesterol and about that many had um low HDL as well so HDL is much more predictive of getting a heart attack than LDL was and of course the conclusion of that of these authors were apparently our our threshold for for LDL is uh isn't low enough we need to lower it even more you know um and well if you keep lowering and this is this is actual uh guideline recommendations if you keep lowering your LDL but your patient keeps having heart attacks you just keep lowering that LDL you know there's no there's no lower three you can just get rid of LDL have zero of it it's only poisonous I mean that's why that's why you know our bodies make it um is because it's poison it wants to kill us and we just have to fight nature in order to not die I mean how stupid you have to be to believe that that we have an internal kill switch that that uh you know is just is just killing us from the inside um that's that's ridiculous that's a ridiculous statement for any doctor or biologist serious biologist to to to make um and uh and but that's the recommendations just lower it lower it lower it lower well when are you going to figure out that if you keep lowering LDL and they keep having heart attacks when are you going to figure out the LDL isn't the bloody problem there you know use your damn head you know and but the problem is that people don't you know because they're brainwashed we've been we've been absolutely indoctrinated for a long time and that and that includ and I'm talking about doctors have been indoctrinated by the drug companies for a long time and everyone else as a consequence of that indoctrination so you know think about this way we've had genetically genetically the same so population genetics if you will if you will study population genetics you'll understand that if you have a percentage of Al genes in a in a population regardless of how that population grows or or shrinks expands or shrinks that you will have that same percentage of alals in the population unless there's some Mass you know genocide and die off and Extinction event or a mass migration of people coming in you'll you'll keep that percentage so right now we've had we have the same percentage of of people that have familial hyper cholesterolemia worldwide that we did in the 1800s the first death from heart attack uh confirmed on autopsy in America was in 1912 there wasn't a single case throughout American history or the colonies before that 1912 was the first one I've been able to find exactly case reports of people dying from a heart attack in all of Europe throughout the entire 18th century I'm sure there are more but if that were the most popular killer we were eating more meat in the 1800s than we were in the early 1900s because vegetarianism started getting pushed really hard in the 1800s because of the puritanical movement and the temperance movements because they thought that the women especially shouldn't eat meat because it give them carnal desires you eat of the flesh you'll think of the Flesh and and no can't have that you know can't have people reproducing and being healthy and fertile no no no we need to suppress that and so the idea was if you were a virtuous person you would go vegetarian to suppress your sexual urges in any experiment any model in any observation in nature When Animals stop being interested in mating and reproduction they are sick there is something wrong and that's what we're reproducing that's what they were intentionally reproducing and you see the meat consumption sort of going down throughout the 1800s probably as a consequence of this of this sentiment that you need to eat a vegetarian diet in order to suppress your sexual urges that's certainly what the seventh day Adventists believe and then they codified that in religious Doctrine by saying God said it and then that spread out from there and now you have you know the consequences of that with you know Dr Kelloggs and all the serial companies that that came up as a consequence of Dr kellogs and sanitarian Foods uh you know um um the S Day Adventist like sanitarian Foods who are the major influencers of nutritional studies dietetics the curriculums and um and the studies that are being put out so I mean this is all this just goes crazy but again reading more meat in the 1800s there's exactly eight deaths from heart attacks in the in the literature there's exactly one that I can find in the 1700s with same exact percentage of people have familial hyp cholesterolemia in the 1800 1700s and before as we do right now when this is the number one killer in the world so that that's a there's just LDL equals Death why weren't anyone why wasn't anyone dying then and if you say oh we just didn't notice it you're right we saw eight of them so people didn't know what to look for read a textbook from the uh medical textbook from the 1800s they are insanely detailed William osler's textbook my great-grandfather was a doctor who graduated from Columbia youngest ever graduate from Columbia Medical School to date he was 20 years old when he graduated Columbia Medical School top of his class he has William osler's textbook and it's that big I have it at um at at you know my my family's home in uh America it is so detailed there are so many maladies and pathologies of the heart all these different ways that people can die and then look and what happened oh this is what happen this is not a single damn mention of any you know uh coronary thrombi in in the coronary vessels um why is that it just too stupid to figure it out these guys dissecting everything else about the heart looking at all these different sorts of thing and they totally miss that just totally miss this big blockage that killed off half the heart and it scarred over really you know I mean you you have to be a special kind of stupid or ignorant to uh to believe that um it's wrong it's dead wrong so why is it why is it that the first heart attack you know proven on autopsy was in 1912 in America 10 years later there were many more 10 years after that number one killer in America now it's the number one killer worldwide and there were eight in all of Europe throughout the entire Century of the 1800s why is that is it really because of cholesterol is it really because of meat we're getting more meat 1800s than we were in the 1930s when this was the number one killer in America or became the number one killer in America we're eating more meat in 1912 than we were in 1930 when this became the number one killer in America it was U-shaped curve so we're eating less and less and less throughout the 1800s it dips it's at its trough in the 1920s and 30s when this becomes the number one killer and then it starts slowly coming back up so there isn't even a correlation so sorry I belab belabored that point but it it still really rils me up obviously but watch my video the truth about cholesterol and heart disease this has just killed billions of people I mean do we get that do people understand that like this this has been responsible for the death and disease of billions of people around the world over the past Century billions right so everyone almost everyone on Earth is affected by this by these herble recommendations these outright frauds and lies from these drug pushing  and people have gotten sick they've gotten overweight they've died early they've died in disease and suffering and in in you know having having dementia and Alzheimer's and being enfeebled both mentally and physically by the billions you have 35-year-old uh men and women have heart attacks and dropping dead in front of their children you know they're robbed of their entire life with their kids those kids are robbed from their of their parents for the rest of their life because these you know just wanted to make a a buck you know that pisses me off and everyone should be pissed off by this which oh well you know it doesn't no F you forever putting this up F you for for trying to push this nonsense on people F you for trying to keep propagating this when we have hard evidence it was a con in the first place so people like Dr Alo and these other  who who just push this sort of  probably because they're getting paid off they just want to try to make a name for themselves because they're just they're just desperate to try to be popular like I'm sorry you didn't have friends in school but Jesus Christ don't take it out on the rest of us like no one is benefiting by the nonsense that these people say people are getting hurt and they are suffering and they are dying by the billions because of this garbage that people have been spewing out there and it is just time that this just dies and we just stop doing that and just be like oh but clest is like f off that was a scam not talking about it and I think that's what I'm going to start start doing is just be like look watch my video on it it's a scam don't worry about it because it's a scam it is a scam and uh and we just you know the only reason that this is still alive is because we are keeping it alive by even entertaining the discussion you know oh but you have to do this that's  you're wrong we're not talking about that read a goddamn book you know this was just you know this was they made it up they made it up to push their product and to protect their product it's crap moving on with our lives and that's what we should do uh a bony 814 thank you very much for the super chats very kind of you very generous uh wife and I started carnivore January 1st and together lost nearly 50 pounds that's amazing great job any advice on how to maximize weight loss we are eating mostly fatty meat and the occasional seafood and chicken thank you for all you do well look you just you just do what you're doing man I mean you you don't have to you know if Ain broke don't fix it right you've already lost 50 pounds together um amazing just keep going like that that's going to keep going when was the last time you ate till you you were comfortably full and enjoyed what you were eating and lost 50 pounds in in three months right so just keep going you know you're already doing a great job you know I mean look you can starve yourself into a smaller pant size and dress size you everyone knows that you can go on on the on the Concentration Camp diet but you know that's not going to be healthy the point is not weight loss as a as a main uh objective the point is Health you know Health gain not weight loss you're losing weight you're going to continue to lose weight but you want to do it in a healthy way you want to be as healthy as you can be you know if you starve yourself yeah sure you you'll lose weight for a time and then it'll Plateau because you're you're going to suppress your metabolism and so it it's counterintuitive but you eat less you'll actually lose less and your body will actually stall and you know if you start eating more you're going to put that put that back up again because your because your metabolism is still down we want to support your metabolism you want to encourage your metabolism want to tell your metabolism hey we're not in a family you don't need to preserve all this energy we we can use it it's fine and you do that you're going to be very healthy and you're going to be as healthy as you can be and you're going to improve not only your health but you're going to improve uh your weight loss long term and something that can be sustainable long term because you're eating until you're satisfied every day and then you just keep doing that for the rest of your life so um that's how you do that that you know maybe it doesn't have the the big quick short-term immediate results that are as big and dramatic but the long-term results are going to be far better and you're going to be doing a much healthier way and that's the most important thing I'm not worried about weight loss in and of itself as a doctor I'm worried about health gain and that's the most important thing so that's that's what you want to worry about the most and you know slow and steady wins the race right tortoise in the hair these parables exist for a reason um you keep doing this in the right way you will get farther faster you know Hast makes waste so you you starve yourself you do all these sorts of things yeah you you'll go faster at first but you you you'll bung up the whole journey and it'll end up taking you longer to get there in the end so just keep doing what you're doing eat until fatty meat stops tasting good exercise lift weights do Sprints get good sleep reduce stress those are the things you need to work on um because you already sounds like you got the diet in check so good job on that keep it going Laura Montgomery says can eating carnivore prevent dementia I run the risk of doing a very long answer again but we'll see what we can do um do we have any long-term human data showing one where or the other than a carnivore die can do that not that I know of specifically not a carnivore die we do have ketogenic diets um Interventional trials with ketogenic diets showing that a high fat meat-based ketogenic diet is better treatment for people with active alzheimer's than every medication trial so if something can help someone who has the disease presumably it can help prevent the disease it's not it's not you're not going to be contributing towards that disease process developing in the first place always remember this these are ketogenic diets that's that's the important takeaway that your KET ketogenic diets but the most important thing is what kind of ketogenic diets are they you can do a ketogenic diet with a vegetarian diet vegan diet whatever it's very difficult you're not going to get a lot of energy um it's going to be horribly um difficult to get enough nutrients you're have to supplement heavily um but the main thing is that's not what these studies use they didn't use vegetarian ketogenic diets they use animal based diets they use high fat animal fat animal protein diets they use high fat meat-based diets with a bit of vegetables if you wanted to which I don't right so that's what it is so the most rigorously studied diets for dementia for Alzheimer's for diabetes for thousands of other things there are thousands of highlevel studies with ketogenic diets using a high fat meat-based ketogenic diet so nearly a carnivore diet a carnivore diet with nasty ass vegetables right that's what these are studying it's not vegetarian diet the most rigorously studied diet on Earth is an animal based a whole food animal-based diet that happens to exclude carbs that's what the most studied diet on the world is and we need to start framing our arguments like that oh but vegetarian diet show that those are epidemiological nonsense data that compare apples to oranges they compare eating a processed plant food diet versus a whole food plant-based diet well the best diet shown yet in experimental data to reverse medical issues is an animal-based high fat animal-based diet with a bit of plants so a carnivore diet with some plants with some vegetables that's what that's what the data shows that's what the experimental data shows that's what the high level data shows epidemi epidemiology is not high level data and types of epidemiology that they do for these these plant-based studies are are the worst of the worst because they have um they have you know just survey their survey questionnaire they say what have you eaten in the last two years how would anyone know that you know the nurses study they don't say hey track all the meals you have for the next year and submit that they get an email once a year that says hey what did you eat last year how would anyone know that they're doing this on purpose to man be able to manipulate the data right because they can they know that they're going to get flawed data and they just make it look the any way they want it's so experimental data experimental data that's been done has been done on Carnivore diets with a salad that's how you should frame this in your mind that's how you should frame this to other people that high fat meat-based diets have been shown to be the best best diets and the most beneficial diets for real real world medical outcomes like diabetes and even even um ketogenic metabolic therapy for cancers this is being shown to be beneficial animal based meat-based for for cancers oh but but meat causes cancer no a bloody will doesn't and um so what's the evidence for dementia and carnivore well animals in the wild don't get dementia humans before 1906 didn't get dementia that was Alzheimer's disease was a oneoff case report from Dr Alzheimer's that he presented at a conference said oh look at this this is this weird have this lady had this neurocognitive decline interesting no one paid it much mine they're like who cares it's just it's just a case report um and uh but one person was watching and he was actually really really fascinated by it and he was a very influential guy and he wrote a textbook actually wrote multiple textbooks and the next textbook that he wrote and for neur ological conditions he used that as and he called it Alzheimer's dementia and that's what he he called it so there wasn't anything in the literature before 1906 describing a similar disease process that was by Any Other Name that was the first incidence of it right which is why he has his name on it 1906 right so people weren't getting Alzheimer's before that right not in any great number to the extent that they would you know get it even written up as a case report right um and we are having look at my video with Hal cranmer you know he has a nursing homes down in Arizona and he's reversing terminal dementia and people in his nursing home and he's getting some of them home and the on who don't get home they improve dramatically by going on a high fat animal-based meat-based ketogenic diet or carnivore diet if they can do it you know not not everyone's there you know but eating a lot more meat eating a lot more animal fat those are building blocks for your body and brain getting rid of the carbs getting rid of the sugar getting rid of the alcohol which is detrimental to your brain and your body oh well carbs are Just Energy no they're not sorry to break it to you but it's much more complex than that you have four grams of carbs going through your body four grams of glucose going through your body in any given time that your body makes and that's the physiological maximum load that you can handle one and that covers all the physiological iCal process for your body and brain four grams that's all your body needs at any one time obviously it's replenished one extra gram is a toxic dose to your body one extra gram causes excess glycation to the point that our bodies can't handle it and it builds up to the point that we die diabet this is what kills diabetics that's what they're why they get their toes cut off then their feet then above the ankles then above the knees then their kidneys fail then their heart fails and their life fails right it's because of that one extra gram of of sugar in their body your this is toxic to your body and your body responds to it as a toxin by trying to detoxify it right this is why we know these these plant toxins are toxins a they hurt you and B your body desperately trying to detoxify them and clear them out of your body if it was good and your body want them in your body your body would keep it in your body you know I'm sorry but like these these idiots with theep their epidemiology they're not smarter than your biology they're not smarter than nature or God whoever you you choose to believe uh was responsible for you know where we are right now um so then you see things like um then you see things like um there's studies showing that higher LDL cholesterol is protective against dementia Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and autism right so you know you see these things that that are protective like higher LDL like higher cholesterol like higher saturated fat um ketogenic diets improved and can even reverse Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia um and that animals don't get Dementia in the wild when eating their natural diet but they will if they're eating their an unnatural diet and Dementia or Alzheimer's dementia at the very least didn't exist before 1906 in any real numbers that people would notice and so let's get back to that I mean people weren't even full carnivore back then you know they're just eating less they're eating more meat more animal fat and less garbage um so that's what we need to do and so yeah a carnivore D is just the purest form of that you're getting rid of everything that could potentially cause harm and you're only eating things that are good for your body why would that not be ideal for people you know it's just like like okay well you do what's ideal and you have a every now and then some cigarettes every now and then yeah you could but you'd be better if you didn't right and so that's that's what the carnivore diet is you know does everybody have to do it no does everybody who wants to be optimal have to do it yes absolutely you know like you're not going to be optimal unless you unless you eat what is optimal for your body if you smoke sometimes that's not optimal even if your body can handle it you can deal with it and it doesn't you don't really notice the difference just like if you have you know fruits and vegetables and grains and carbs and sugar every now and then is that as bad as if you did it every day no it's all relative but it it does cause harm these are these things have objective harmful components to them so um you know it's uh it's it's just about optimization you know I I've seen some people say some very strange things about me that I've never said saying that oh everyone has to be carnivore and this that and the other um I've never said that I've I've never said that I said if you want to be optimal you should do that and I just say look this is this is what I think is the best and you want to do other derivation of that fine I I really don't care like I I literally couldn't care less what free individuals want to do with their own life when given the information and choices I just don't want people to think that they should eat in a suboptimal fashion because it's a optimal that eating plants and not eating meat is actually better for their health it's not it is absolutely not so I just want them to have the information and then they can make their own decision if you want to drink I couldn't care less you know I go out with friends of mine they drink and I'm not like oh you shouldn't do it oh I don't care I don't care they know it's not good for them everyone know it's not good for you I don't give a you know I don't care if they want to smoke I just don't want them to smoke around me because I don't want that crap in my lungs right but I just don't care you know I mean I I would like it if they didn't because I I want people to be healthy but it's their decision if they're an adult so you know I have no idea where these people get this stuff from they just everyone just talks trash and says I say things that I don't but um I just want people to know the truth that meat is not bad for you the Fat's not bad for you the cholesterol is not bad for you um this was all a scam and uh meat's good for you it's really important to eat meat and plants do have toxins that's a fact that's a well documented fact in human data Lane um Jesus um you know we see we see negative Health outcomes in the medical literature um all the time all the time with people eating you know various plants and getting poisoned by them uh and you get subclinical or sublethal doses of these of these toxins you get worse and it builds up over time and you remove these things and look at that those diseases go away cause and effect right sort of the theme of today um but that's the thing so uh that's what the that's what the human data shows that people get sick when you eat more plants and you get even more sick when you eat processed plants and sugar and Seed oils those are plants too they're just worse than spinach and lettuce but spinach will kill you you know Liam Hemsworth you know put himself in the hospital with acute spinach uh acute spinach poisoning acute oxalate poisoning from spinach from drinking spinach smoothies for something like three weeks every morning you know you can hurt yourself legitimately you can even kill yourself you know and they say oh well dose makes some poison okay well what's the dose Liam Hemsworth put himself in the bloody hospital with three weeks of spinach smoothie so maybe someone should have told him what that dose was huh you know why don't you actually be responsible if you're giving advice to people you need to be responsible oh you know whatever dose makes Bo it doesn't matter doesn't matter what you eat it damn well does and people have put themselves in the hospital by listening to your idiot advice you know you should be respons you should take responsibility for that um but they don't of course because they're just children but um yeah I figured that was going to take a while to answer that question but uh I believe that yes so carore diet will absolutely prevent most forms of dementia obviously there are going to be other sorts of things that that can play a role but it's at least going to get rid of the the foodborn Toxin and malnutrition reasons for dementia in my opinion there's little Ellie Mary hello everyone hello little Ellie Melly very nice to see you hope you're doing well um what do we got going here hold on let me see how many we have all right why don't we cap the super chats here everyone because I think that that's I think we've got a lot I think and I I want to make sure we get to all of them I need to leave in about 45 minutes so um let's uh yeah let's just try to address the ones we have and and um and hopefully we will get to everyone I will do my very best okay where did that go oh there we go uh so Danica mulic thank you very much for the Super Chat would you recommend eating large amounts of saturated fat for people just stting carnivore diet if their diets prior to this were really low in fat it seems like if we were undernourished before and loading might help well look your your body has a limited capacity to absorb fat based on the amount of bile that you have so you're you're just eat as much fat as you want your body's only going to absorb what it can absorb and what it wants to absorb so you really you really don't run a risk of eating too much fat um if you're not used to eating fat you can just make yourself feel unwell you can just have that psychosomatic sort of response where you're like oh this is supposed to be bad for me and and you get sort of like uh little queasy about it that happened to me even though I knew that fat was good for me I had to retrain myself and and recondition myself decondition myself from thinking that that fat was bad for me um and so if that's happening to you you know you can just ease into it but um your body's gonna have G to absorb what it can absorb so you just eat as much fat as your body uh can tolerate or or just is comfortable for you tastes good to you um and then you can absorb you know if you just want if you're getting dry hard constipated stools you're not eating enough fat by definition that little extra that that spill over valve of fat um is what is what keeps your stool soft a lot more than your body can absorb it's it's going to go out as waste you know it's just going to come out and it's going to come out as you're get diarrhea you can get diarrhea for other reasons too but that's one of them and so uh just eat eat enough fat for your body and it can be that over time your body starts making more bile because it says oh look at this we haven't had access to fat in a while it's an expensive resource bile it doesn't just make it for no reason and so they want to you know it wants to get that fat for a reason or you know it wants to get enough fat and so if it's um If you're sort of exposing yourself to more fat it could be that your body starts making more bile in the future to get more fat but either way you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you eat enough fat so that you have soft stools and if you're doing that then that then your your body will you know uh pick up the deficit it will it will ask for and absorb the amount of fat that it wants to make up that deficit hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own questions please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest of the Q&A Brian Jones thank you for the Super Chat two years carnivore depression anxiety gone and lost 53 pounds fantastic that's absolutely wonderful tried Sol Ado's diet for a month um and anxiety with panic attacks came back I'm back on Carnivore feeling great thanks for all you do well thank you I'm really glad um to hear that you're doing so well and you know thank you for sharing that um so saladino's diet you know Dr saladino uh who one of the early early adopters of of a carnivore diet publicly you know there were people doing this uh for very long time on Facebook groups such as zerocarb health and zeroing in on health like Dana schutz and um uh Charles Washington they sort of run those uh they're both you know great I I need to have them both on on my podcast clearly I've been actually meaning to do that for like two years now but um um uh you know it's just I just need to just need to to get on it but there is a wealth of information been doing this for like nearly 20 years and they've been leading these Facebook groups and and and talking to tens of thousands of people over the years and um you know but but saladino has been doing this for a long time and he was one of the people that that helped you know promote and propagate this he felt that he did does better on with fruit and some honey you know fine if that's how if that's what his body is telling him to do um I definitely don't feel better that way I definitely feel better without any of that stuff and that's what I've noticed with a lot of people as well is that when they're doing that they they feel good they feel a lot better they're getting rid of all this stuff uh but then when they get rid of that and they just go down to meat they do even better which is great especially with things like mental health anxiety and and those sorts of things depression schizophrenia autism all these sorts of things really being in ketosis on a ketogenic state is is actually really important and uh and getting rid of the carbs is actually quite uh beneficial so if people suffer from that probably a good idea to to not do that side of things I get worried because a like I said you know the carbohydrates you know more than four grams of glucose in your body is toxic to your body as we're dumping in hundreds of grams of of glucose into our body a day you know that's hard for your body to deal with and you and you are getting some some residual uh damage from that even if your your insulin is able to get that down it's up for a while and it's causing more gly until your body can bring that down and so I think that that's not not ideal and uh I do see a lot of people that do try that and they get carbon addicted again they sugar addicts and they get you know and they start eating a bit of fruit and a bit of honey then it's a bit more fruit and a bit more honey then it's a lot more fruit and a lot more honey and then it's pizza and soda and other sorts of crap uh and that happens you know I've seen a lot of people go down that pathway they go down this carb hole and they and they don't have uh the ability to stop and it's um it was um oh God who was it I was just I was just watching him he you know he's a funny guy I actually really I really like him and I'm I'm really annoyed that I'm blanking on his name yeah Kevin James um his comedian standup comedian I his his original standup I I actually loved his original standup and obviously he's done a lot of movies and TV shows um you know was like the mall cop uh movies and things like that uh but his standup was great I really liked him as a standup and um as well as as his movies and things like that um but he I just saw a clip of him on Joe Rogan where he was talking about how he's like a compulsive eater like if he gets on like a strict diet like he can do it like he fasted for like 41 days once and lost 60 pounds he could just grit through it but he did a he apparently did a thing on um cheat days he wanted to do like a documentary on cheat days like work out all super hard and had trainer and did all this sort of stuff and then one day a week he just had a cheat day and it just completely disrupted his whole uh it just disrupted his whole things um uh you his gain he just completely sabotaged it and he was saying he's like I don't think people understand just how much I can eat just how much I just Phill pack he's a compulsive eater he said I can't I can't stop you start eating these things they just you just keep going you just keep going like you know people have that compulsion they have these compulsive eating behaviors due to addictions with food because this food is addictive it's designed to be addictive sugar is addictive uh fructose is addictive and fructose is a large portion of the carbohydrate content in fruit and honey you know sweet fruits anyway so that that can hit people really hard and I don't think that it's optimal certainly but it can really be damaging to a lot of people and you know Kevin James is one of these and in fact Joe Rogan said hey if you want to really do something you know just do a carnivore diet you know like that's the best way because you're you're just it just stuffs stuffs down your your compulsion and you're overeating it's just like that's all I want I'm done you know whereas if you have carbs and other things you just keep eating and he's right because there's there's hormonal reasons for that your insulin goes up insulin forces energy into cells it doesn't allow it to come out of cells and so now you've locked down all your fat cells in your body for about 24 hours or more and then you know sometimes less but sometimes more and now you can't mobilize your fat storage to bolster up your blood sugar to bolster up your ketones you don't really have ketones to speak of anymore and now your blood sugar drops and now it drops too low and oh I feel tired I don't have energy because you can't mobilize your energy from your from your gas tank your gas Tank's cut off your fat cells are your gas tank and so then you start eating carbs again insulin goes up and carbs go down and you did get down up and down and up and down you get those swings throughout the day we've all played that that game and it does something more Insidious than that which is it blocks a hormone called leptin which is our satiety hormone it comes from our fat cells predominantly also from our stretch receptors in our stomach you eat a big meal it stretches out leptin gets released which is why in the AES they said eat a whole bunch of fiber they have no calories you get no nutrition from it isn't that great what's the hell the point of eating if there's no nutrition in it and it tricks your body into thinking you're full it sends off this leap in your brain goes great we got plenty of food you don't feel hungry and you don't get anything from it you just lose all this weight yeah how'd that work out the Obesity rate's worse than ever um oh but people aren't doing yes they were you know yes they they were doing that they were moving in that direction and um you know so that that's only such a small part first of all your stomach has receptors in it that ract M macro micronutrients and goes directly to your brain and says hey this is what's in here you you eat a bunch of Styrofoam if you want stretch out your your stomach and leptin will get released and your body will go nothing's in there right um so this blocks leptin which is predominantly from our fat cells it's like a running gas gauge on how much energy your body has and so insulin blocks leptin fructose independently blocks leptin and raises insulin which then blocks leptin further now your brain can't see it letin and so your brain thinks you have zero energy reserves and your blood sugar is dropping and it sends out a panic signal that says if you don't eat now you will die and this is why people are just Panic oh I starving I have to eat I have to eat I have to eat I have to eat and they're compulsively eating because their body is telling them to because their body is telling them they're going to die if they don't fructose also upregulates gin which is the op was the counterpart to leptin in your stretch receptors so when your stomach's empty releases Gin And depending on how much leptin you have it counterbalances your gin your body goes like Oh okay stomach's empty but we're fine or no leptin grin super high and your body goes no we need to eat this is a problem so you overeat right and so so he was right so Joe Rogan was very very right correct in that um and um you know Kevin James um I think he was doing with doul like a dolly diet or something like that and and Dolly doesn't think that carbs are or worry that's fine um but you look at these things from a hormonal point of view from a physiological point of view you see that they actually do cause issues first of all insulin is the fat storage hormone the fat storage hormone right so without insulin you really can't store fat now there are lectins and plant toxins that um that can actually act on and bind to insulin receptors and to leptin as well and compound the issue and make this you know a lot worse even without insulin but but insulin is the fat storage hormone right so people with type 1 diabetes don't make any insulin they they really can't put on fat they just waste away until they die unless they get insulin and then you have people that have an insulin omo which insulin SEC creating tumor they get enormously obese very quickly it doesn't matter what they eat people that inject insulin long term if they're injecting the same SES they they grow fat in those areas they get these big bulbous fat lumps that they just inject in the same spot which is why you have to vary it up where you inject um these are very known well known and well established consequences of insulin and again insulin has over 100 different mechanisms in the body and so you raise your insulin you eat carbs ah doesn't matter it does matter insulin goes up because of the carbs but now it's affecting over 100 different processes in the body at an elevated right level right blocks of conversion of testosterone an estrogen for women you get PCOS blocks the action of growth hormone in both men and women you age faster you have lower igf1 right it screws up Men's testosterone it blocks leptin it makes you overeat screws up your energy Dynamics it takes you out of of a ketogenic state which is our primary metabolic State now you don't have enough ketones to run your brain it has to go to its secondary fuel source glucose same with your heart same with your intestines same with your other organs there's a huge consequence es of eating carbohydrates in order to keep that blood sugar level below four gram it's really important it's really it will kill you this is what kills diabetics high blood sugar chronically elevated high blood sugar causes you know insurmountable burden of glycation AG is Advanced glycation end products right so it actually is a problem you know and maybe you can you can get fit you know and and get lean and get strong and perform as an athlete e in carbs I certainly did it most people have done it in the modern era it's a hell of a lot easier to do it without them and it's a hell of a lot more healthy to do it without them you know in in the 80s and 90s we had marathon runners saying doesn't matter what you eat just as long as you exercise dropping dead of massive coronary heart attacks um you know at 40 right top marathon runners in the world drop dead right right it does matter it really does matter what you eat you can look like you're in shape but you're not necessarily healthy so again this is all about health health is the most important thing and um you know and and so you know weight loss is is you know important to people health is the most important thing the weight will come and um and you know we see here with our friend Brian Jones you know he tried both ways for him at least this this worked better and that's what I see for most people certainly for myself certainly for most my patients and people that I've spoken to um you know if you want to eat some fruit and honey and you find that it benefits you and you feel better and you're objectively improving fine you know that's your business that's your choice do what you want I don't really see it that often you know I've seen a few people like Dr saladino say that they feel better you know but are they better over overall long term I mean you know we'll see but uh I certainly don't see that in in most people um and so you know it's important to try these things out it's important to try out a carnivore diet because I think everyone should try it out just to see what life could be like um and if you want to add in some other stuff and you feel that benefits you just be careful because you're going to have more energy and feel better when you do cocaine every day too right that does not mean that you're you're getting benefit from it or just drinking coffee or taking caffeine like oh I feel better this must be better well no not necessarily what's better long term what gives you better energy long term what keeps you healthier long term those are different things you know so uh and that's that's an argument people make against the carnivore yeah you feel good now yeah your diabetes is going away now yeah your weight is going away now yeah your autoimmunity is going away now yeah you coming out of the Alzheimer's at Elderly Care Facility now yeah you know you don't have cancer now but just wait sure okay well let's wait for that day um but um you know and that that is true just because you're having short-term results doesn't mean that the long-term gains are going to be there but at the same time you know we're seeing every objective marker improving in people's Health they're coming off medications they reversing diseases that were were said to be irreversible even though they've only showed up in the last few decades in any real numbers so obviously there's something going on there that's increasing that you take that away it goes away um you know even then they say oh well you know LDL goes up not for everyone and who cares because wasn't a problem in the first place um but you know and if every marker is going in in the right direction who's to say that LDL going up isn't LDL going in the right direction either think about that why would everything be improving and just there one thing going wrong no I think we're looking at that wrong again we are LDL was not the problem higher LDL is associated with Better Health and longer life and lower rates of cancer lower rates of infectious disease and lower rates of Alzheimer's dementia and aut autism and Parkinson's right so LDL going up is also an objective Improvement in people's biomarkers as well lot of tangents there hopefully that was not not too boring but thank you for your uh thank you for that Brian I appreciate that it's important for people to see how people's experiences with this I appreciate that and thank you for the Super Chat little Ellie Melly nice to see you um elmie says I love how much I learned from you thank you well thank you I appreciate that very kind of you and I'm glad that it's interesting and um informative Brandon winter um let me see here Brandon winter says thank you for the Super Chat first of all I've heard carnivore can help Crohn's but has it helped Crohn's patient with fistulas and healing fistulas uh yes absolutely um your body has to heal those fists it depends on how um how bad they are what they're going into but you know it can it can uh stop the disease process and lower your antibod so your body stops attacking itself and your body has a chance to heal does that mean that you don't need surgery you don't need help absolutely not you need to fists are very very very uh problematic they can heal but you know if they're going into some place that's not supposed to be there you have a cycle fistula you need to get that sorted out I mean you you're going to cause infections and and horrible outcomes if that not treated properly so 100% still you know work with your doctor your surgeon um for those and uh but also do a carnivore diet and really just line diet is the best thing for any autoimmune disease especially cronin's disease you'll see it firsthand you have a pork chop you're going to know about it and um if you just have beef Lam and water you're going to you're going to have the best results um it will just shut down the disease process because it's going to move all the things that your body's reacting to and and and and making antibodies towards and then your body can have a chance to heal this or nasty stuff you got abscesses you have fistulas these sorts of things sometimes you have to have surgery you have to have interventions sometimes they can heal they they will start to heal but you may need help at at the same time so yes they it takes away the cause the root cause of Cronos disease which is your body reacting to these toxins and chem that aren't supposed to be in your body and it also allows your body to heal can your body heal from all damage not every time and so you still need help for a lot of these things too so work with your doctor but also do carnivore absolutely uh amber thank you for the Super Chat thank you for always being generous with your time it does not go unnotice thank you well thank you I really appreciate that and I hope it is helpful to people and that yeah people get get something out of it and yeah it's not it's not too much Jade thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy how can I get rid of athis nigr on my neck thank you um I actually am pretty sure that that's been shown to be directly um related to insulin resistance and so that's one of those things that you know just going on like ketogenic diets in general should help um I I am pretty pretty sure so you know going on like keto like um going on a ketogenic of any form like a cornivore diet should actually help that um it can take time but that actually should reverse that if I'm not mistaken but I'm pretty damn sure that that is um that that has been shown to be a consequence of insulin resistance just like skin tags and um and colon um pops those are highly associated with with insulin resistance and high levels of insulin and our body is just going haywire because again you know over a hundred different mechanisms in our body um has insulin so it's uh that's just one of the consequences of of very high insulin and so you drop the carbs your insulin will come down and those sorts of things start to reverse and I am nearly positive that that's one of them and um yeah that's that that so that should sort itself out given time it can take time so just give it time um Rob MCG g95 thank you very much for the super chat chat I've heard that one should transition to carnivore diet slowly over a number of weeks or microbiome related problems can arise what are your thoughts on this and is this something you've seen I haven't really seen it myself in many people there are some people that get like diarrhea and a bit of you know upset stomach is this because they're having something else it could upset their stomach is this because they're eating a lot more fat or not enough fat maybe um could it also be the microbiome maybe absolutely uh the vast majority of people that I've seen uh do Transition very easily and then they uh and then they go and they check their microbiome before and then three four months after six months after massive improvements in their in their gut microbiome your gut microbiome changes really from day to day depending on what you eat if you're eating a varied diet you're going to support different bacteria based on what you eat because there's just more resources available remember they have a they have a 20 minute turnover they they reproduce every 20 minutes in general you know most bacteria do so they're they're gener they you know uh very very very fast generation rate and so you you can see things populations go up and down and up and down very very quickly um I do know that Professor b k thinks that this is a good thing to do is is transition slowly and um you know I have you know I've you know seen very clearly that if if Professor Kay has you know says something there there's a very good reason behind that and so you know either with his personal experience or or according to the literature um there is a good reason for him to say that and so um you know you could do that and be safe but I've you know I transitioned right away twice um and and most of my I just you know because it's it's difficult to sort of drip someone into something you know they either do it or they don't do it and so when you're when you're trying to help people and just get them going it's sometimes best to strike while the iron's hot and just throw everything out of the house and just get going that day the vast majority of people will be fine doing this um if you want if you want to be a bit more staged about it you can but have a clear and distinct timeline on what you're going to do and how you're going to do it right away you start eating a lot more fatty meat and you drop the carb sugar and alcohol and processed food all that's gone today right and then one week later you mark it on the calendar this day I'm dropping night shades potatoes Tomatoes eggplants Peppers you're already getting rid of tomatoes or potatoes because of the carbs anyway but you get rid of all those then the next week you're getting rid of all high oxalate foods and then next week you're getting rid of all nuts and beans and seeds and legumes and all that sort of crap and then you're just down to like some leafy green salads and meat and then the next week you just drop that crap too right so you have a clear stepwise progression stag process of just getting rid of this crap um and if you don't do that it's you're not going to do it so uh it's very unlikely it's like you know sales people will say if you don't if you don't make the sale on the floor at that time and they say okay well I'll think about it and I'll come back this is why there's like high pressure of like oh well I can do this too oh and I can do this too is because 95% of the time they don't come back and so you know you need to you need to make your sale you need to make your sale right then and there um so the vast majority of my patients do just fine doing that very few of them get got dis disbiosis and when they do it's like a couple weeks of runny stools and then then it goes away um that's been my experience with that anyway and um uh and so I I think that it's it is safeer people to do that um but if you want to be you know careful about it you do that in a stepwise progression like that Ariana isun thank you for the Super Chat uh carnivore 95% Plus for one year macros right now are 132 gram of protein 80 gram of fat less than 10 10 grams of carbs stools are very very loose butter eaters confound me not my goal but please explain uh fat adaptation well it it matters what else you're eating you know what's else is in that 5% if you're having if you're having coffee tea any any non sugar sweeteners any magnesium supplements and multiple medications such as metformin and others all cause loose toools especially on a carb diet when you're not eating a whole bunch of fiber so that can contribute that can add to it um also people seem to think that you have to have just a bucket load of salt with everything that you eat or drink that is not the case that I've definitely seen people get loose stools from adding way too much salt and putting in just like tons of salt in their water and drinking that that's that's a known way of doing a flush a gastric or a colonic flush you drink a whole bunch of salt water and you just get this you just pull out all this moisture out of your intestines and just have uh loose stools so if you're drink if you're us using way too much salt and drinking really salty water you're going to get loose toools um so it depends it depends on what you're doing if you are only eating meat and only drinking water no supplements no nothing anything else and you're still getting loose stools they're very very loose like you say you could be so constipated that you're getting overflow diarrhea that you're having a blockage and you're getting liquid stools around it and you have liquid stools all the time and every now and then you get this Boulder that comes out and then you're back to liquid stools that's called overflow diarrhea or spurious diarrhea and that means you need way more fat than what you're doing um if that's not the case and you're just getting liquidy stools it could be that you're eating too much fat but at at 80132 you're not you're you're really on the underside of that so I would I would actually bet that you're probably getting the Overflow diarrhea if you're not eating all these other things if you're having coffee and all that other sort of stuff um then that's probably what it is when you don't have a bunch of fiber there to block up the pipes things just go faster right um you know so it's um you know it's very possible to get to get loose stools very easily when you when you add even if you're having the same amount of coffee as you always did well now you're not having the same amount of fiber as you always did and that's the difference so at 80 grams of fat I would bet if everything else being equal and you're only eating fat and you're only eating meat I mean um and not doing a whole bunch of salt and crazy things like that or having coffee or artificial sweeteners or magnesium supplements or you art you artificial sweeteners and Metformin and all these other sorts of things if you're not doing that then I would say you're not eating enough fat I would bet that that's what's going on and that you're actually very constipating you probably every now and then get this Rocky Boulder that comes out and then it's liquid otherwise and if that's the pattern you need a lot more fat and if you're eating anything else besides or having anything else besides meat you need to drop it and you need to see what's happening if you're if you're eating those things and you're getting loose stools and you drop it now is rock hard that's what it was and um so that that's what I would do there so definitely um definitely try that so Mona shabir thank you very much for the Super Chat Dr chaffy I'm 40 years old and just started carnivore I'm 160 pounds it's eating one pound of ribey plus a tablespoon one tablespoon of I'm assuming butter fat ghee aloe something um is that enough I'm not hungry after it's not about being hungry it's about going until it stops tasting good because your hunger signals are going to change and so you need to relearn them so you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good if fatty meat tastes good and you're not eating anything else then you can listen to your hunger signals and so you keep eating until it stops tasting good until you get a bite it goes like just sort of bland and uninteresting I don't really want to eat that anymore that's when you stop if it still tastes interesting on your last bite you make another you make some more food uh so that's what you do so a pound of riby could be enough but maybe it's not you need to eat until it stops tasting good and then uh and then you'll be fine um there's a question from Linda on Facebook my husband stopped his nightly drinking after going ketovore why does this help well you know the thing is is that you know we we sometimes we drink because we have these sort of compulsions that we're missing and and issues with dopamine diet fixes that so you don't have to self-medicate anymore you feel good also there are studies with ketogenic diets and people that are getting Det talks from alcohol and but this is in the hospital these are these are you know career alcoholics that are having severe withdrawals they need to be in the hospital while they're withdrawing and um they found that not only did they subjectively improve and say that they didn't have as many cravings and felt better coming off of it but objectively they required less benzo asip Pines and and medication to keep them out of uh the DTs so you know you know a lot of people turn to these sorts of things because you know their their brain chemistry isn't quite working right and they just feel a lot better when they drink and then they feel a lot better just on on their own and they don't need to drink so that can be something there and that's great it sounds really really well it is really good that that he's drinking less and not drinking as much and uh and doing better hopefully in other respects as well Ariana aishen thank you so much for the the next Super Chat uh I think I'm okay but please comment Labs from March 23 um cholesterol is 7.2 triglycerides 1.1 HDL 1.6 ldlc uh 5.1 ratio is what it is hb1c is 5.2 uh new Bloods due Monday those all look great um if you go back to my 15minute rant on um on cholesterol and everything like that you'll see this is just not something to be worried about we just need to stop talking about it I don't check cholesterol in my patients because it's it's a waste of time and money the only thing I'll be looking for is high triglyceride or sorry high LDL sorry High HDL also high LDL and low triglyceride that's what I care about um and I also don't care because if you are eating a carnivore diet if you're eating what you're supposed to be that's what you're going to have you're going to have high or low or normal or abnormal according to who uh LDL um but it's going to be physiological so that's actually going to be normal may not be the norm but it will be normal for your physiology and your body and so I just don't I just don't concern myself with um with cholesterol HB andc is another matter and that's very good 5.2 that's great so that's what you want if you have diabetes if you have elevated hba1 see you're going to increase your your risk of cardiovascular disease you just will so um so you know that's that's a much more beneficial and important marker than any of the cholesterol markers it's a much much more predict it's much more predictive of developing heart disease than any of your cholesterol uh even going through the LDL subfractions um even just having you know pattern B sdldl dominant LDL only increases your risk of develop in cardiovascular disease by 1.7x where type two diabetes is 10x right a th% increase risk and metabolic syndrome is 600% increased risk and the things that you do to reverse diabetes and metabolic syndrome also get rid of your sdldl as well so it all comes part and parcel don't waste your time with with cholesterol H um HB andc sure fasting insulin yes fasting blood sugar yes um and other signs of metabolic syndrome now your HDL and triglyceride give you give you a picture of um your metabolic State and metabolic syndrome so that's important in that context literally no other context I really care about except I want you I want to have higher cholesterol I want to have higher LDL because that's what the studies show is beneficial people that have higher cholesterol have less heart attacks and strokes according to the Framingham study people that have higher LDL cholesterol live longer people that have higher total cholesterol and lower fasting insulin are more likely to live over 100 so good job those all look good so Oaktown girl says I am pissed off I've learned so much from you Dr CH if you don't ever stop I'm spreading the word too I'm pissed too it's it really bothers me and that that whole rant about me being pissed off maybe that's a good clip that we can we can cut off and put as a discreet thing because it just it just pisses me off and you know more people should be pissed off about this as well Frederick Williamson thank you for the super chat um how should prazone be handled for autoimmune while on Carnivore I feel like prazone can keep carnivore diet from working as well yeah well look it it'll it'll raise your blood sugar it mimics cortisol that's the whole point um and and uh yeah just basically give you diabetes but um if you need it at the moment then you know you need it at the moment and then you get off of it as soon as you can you put the Carn diet in place so that you're un you're getting rid of the underlying mechanism so that you know you can you can come off the steroids no one should be on prazone long term that should be a shortterm course if they have you on prazone just for Life get a new doctor like just that that there are extremely limited scenarios where that is appropriate and um and so generally these are short-term courses but for things like Crohn's disease that's has been shown that Elemental like a carnivore diet would be because you're just getting the the the elemental nutrition that you need and nothing else an elemental diet you know they use shakes uh for these experiments um is a better treatment for an acute flare up of Crohn's than prazone right so just not eating certain things is a better treatment than steroids right so don't eat the wrong things and you should be fine um but you know if you're on a course of prazone you know finish the course and and wean off uh as per your doctor because you do need to wean off these things in a in a you know measured respect or you can have problems um and then get off and stay off because hopefully you you won't have flareups anymore that you need prazone after that um and if you're on long-term prazone you need to talk to your doctor or another doctor who has your best interest at heart uh about getting the hell off of that because that's not what you want long term Steve thank you for the Super Chat hey Doc thanks for all the great content is carnivore bad for someone with early stage prostate cancer uh but is not in treatment of any kind cheers well you know any any sort of cancer I think uh I I personally would recommend and do personally ketogenic metabolic therapy which is you know getting your blood sugar uh nice and low and your your Ketone is nice and high and this has been shown in in in Pre clinical and clinical studies to improve outcomes improve cancer outcomes for various different kinds of cancer prostate cancer um is I think even and prostate issues again are largely um sensitive to like insulin sensitivity insulin resistance and so on so you know any sort of cancer I would be very very aggressive with ketogenic metabolic therapy getting my gki down the glucose Ketone index down below two or one with you know limited food in carnivore diet of limited food intake very high fat two grams of fat to one gram of protein so 80% calories from fat 20 from protein and organs because if you're eating less you need more nutrients you need more of these micronutrients because you're just you you it's calorie restricted ketogenic diets have always been shown to be uh the best outcome on ketogenic metabolics uh therapy so you limit the amount that you eat but obviously you need these nutrients so you need more organs in there as well all right and um and if that's not enough to get your gki below two uh on average for the week then you know you have periods of fasting as well so that's what I would do I would be pretty aggressive with that sort of thing I wouldn't F around I mean I don't F around now I mean probably my gki is pretty in that in that um that you know that that therapeutic range always you know but I would make sure if I if I had cancer and I probably just eat once a day and uh to try to keep that that gki nice and low that's what I would do and um uh you know you don't have to be on treatment some of these things you know the you know some of these things are very slow growing and there're something like sometimes people die with prostate cancer as opposed to from prostate cancer but people die from prostate cancer too so you know it can metastasize your your spine and and other parts of your body you know it uh it's it's not something you want to mess around with so you know I would personally treat myself with ketogenic metabolic therapy even if the doctor doesn't think that it's it's uh necessary to do any other interventions yeah I would just do that anyway Julie R thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy my son is 15 uh htl 42 triglycerides 106 he is a competitive athlete would you recommend carnivore at his hey you appreciate all you do I I would recommend carnivore diet for everyone at every age and every medical condition in situation because that's optimal diet for for human beings but especially for uh kids growing up they're still developing they need proper perfect nutrition or they're not going to develop to their genetic potential they're not going to be as tall he's not going to as tall he's not going to be have as big of a brain as well-developed neurological uh um system and uh he's not going to be athletic he's not going to have the same athletic performance um so yes I would absolutely say especially because he's a competitive young athlete that this is very important for him to get on he'll have a massive advantage over all of his competition and um and will be able to train harder and longer and get more out of it than everyone else and be be able to play harder and train and and then just absolutely kill it so I know this because I did this as a professional athlete for five years and I have never my life performed or felt better and um and I know many many many International athletes people going to the Olympics people playing professional rugby International Rugby uh that do this now and do carnivore and they're like I have never felt better in my entire life and um and other former pro athletes that are like where the hell was this when I played I I feel better now in my late 40s than I did in my 20s you know playing for you know the wallabies the the Australian um International um rugby team so in fact I may be inter interviewing uh one of these guys that that was a former wabby and is doing carnivore now and just feels like a superhero because you do so doing this at his age he's going to get even more benefits he's going to grow taller he's going to grow stronger he's going to have a healthier bone density he's going to have a bigger brain and more developed neurological um uh structures in his body and so he's going to be more Dynamic athletic fast uh and and um ath and agile you know so yes I definitely would recommend it for him and his HDO will go up and his triglycerides will come down and he'll do great and you know let us know let us know how that goes if he tries it how does he do I mean look at this way I I I've got I've got pro athletes that I that I've uh helped and they've gone carnivore and they double their testosterone at 25 you know as a professional athlete you know what I mean no medications and they get tested because oh well that's a big jump and the league goes okay or the NCAA goes oh okay let's check it out they check their their other hormones like their FH and LH FSH and LH and they're in Perfect Balance they like yeah this is just your body doing this good job and um what's that going to do to a 15-year-old I had a 19-year-old kid his testosterone was that of an 85-year-old sick man right he goes carnivore for two months and it triples right so this is going to dramatically improve your son's health and and life in general and certainly his athletic performance but his health and his longevity and um so I would definitely encourage him to do that um if he does let us know how he how how he's doing and um you know you know let us know in the chats or on on something somewhere let us know how he does uh Red Top rich thank you for the Super Chat been off and on keto for the last two years uh 14 days online diet and attempt um this time I'm locked in and feel great thanks for all you do and the videos well thank you very much I appreciate that and you're very welcome and I I'm glad that you're giving it a try I mean you know just you know keto is going to be doing good things for your body and you're going to get less of the crap and more of the meat and the fat that you need and lion diets you know probably the best of all so um good job with that and I hope you're feeling good and um and that you just keep getting the longer you go the better you feel you have multi months you have four times the number of mitochondria they're four times as effective after two years you have even more and they work better you know all these different autophagy and uh and processes and turning on stem cells you literally age backwards and your hormones all optimized so it's it's an amazing experience and I'm really excited for you because you're just getting into that really amazing phase now after 14 days you're going to start feeling like a superhero and uh that's that's that's always good to see the carnivore Odyssey thank you so much for the Super Chat good to see you uh hey Doc I'm coming out of a cold that lasted three weeks I'm sorry to hear that I stood my ground and kept eating meat man it was hard 19 kgs since January 1st great job that's really great um well look it it probably wasn't a cold let's be realistic you know cold just don't they just they just bounce off the armor at this point but uh so it's probably like a bad flu or something like that that just sort of felt more like a cold that didn't go away because your immune system is stronger but you know also remember that that stress and poor sleep can definitely damage your immune system and make it so that you know you you are more susceptible able to these sorts of uh issues and and you can get sick unfortunately so uh you know do take care of yourself get plenty of sleep plenty of rest plenty of water and try not to be um stressed out as much as you can and um hopefully that's the last last illness that you see for a long time uh Kenneth uh mathena very kind comment says hi Dr cha you're totally awesome thank you so for helping so many people all over the world well you're very welcome and thank you very much for comment that's very kind of you dark sky thank you for the Super Chat b k says that we should continually be continually psyching in and out of K ketosis when we eat enough protein uh to get a necessary bump of insulin thoughts what he's saying is that you do that not that you have to do that or you have to orchestrate it in some fashion that that's just naturally what happens and so if you're just eating a lot of meat you're eating like a big bis of meet and one go that that will happen um and that that's and that's and that covers everything because people do say like oh you need to have your you need to have a fluctuation of your insulin and that may or may not be true but what what Professor Kay is pointing out is that that happens anyway and so you don't need to eat carbs in order to get that insulin cycle so that's the point that that he's making um you know I'm I'm I'm I'm on board you know whatever happens when we eat a whole bunch of meat and only meat is what's supposed to happen so if we're in and out of ketosis if our insulin goes up or down that's what's supposed to happen that's that's the the underlying message here that's the that's the core principle of our biology that we have been eating meat in exclusion for much of our existence as humans and prehuman and so our our biology is set up for that and so if we're eating just meat and we're eating until our and we're eating the the amount that our bodies want and need then our body's going to do what it's supposed to do and if we are in and out of ketosis then we're in and out of in or out of ketosis fine whatever um it's neither here nor there you know it's just it just is what it is and so yeah absolutely like um you know so your body may do that but what what uh Bart was saying was it's not that oh you need to do this this is important for you to do that um he was count ing Dr saladino's contention that you have to eat carbs in order to you know upcycle your insulin because your insulin has to go up to do certain things and he's saying no you don't have to do that because when you just eat a whole bunch of meat your insulin goes up anyway and you come out of ketosis transiently and you come back into it and so he's saying that that's that that happens anyway um and either way it's it's supposed to happen whatever is happening it's supposed to happen because this is how we're made uh swisha the fish uh thanks for the Super Chat looks like it didn't get added on but looks like there's one down here um thank you for the super chat again um swisa says thank you for taking us out of the Matrix through food uh so much of the world is so stuck and uh this is a great start thank you for your time doc well thank you I appreciate that and it does feel like it does feel like the Matrix doesn't it uh we just locked into this whole strange fantasy that doesn't line up with with what we see on a daily basis and people say no no no don't believe your own eyes don't believe the fact that you're getting better and getting healthier and everyone else is getting fatter and sicker and you're not you're the one that's sick it's gaslighting on a on a global scale um and so yeah it's uh it's it's very easy to spot the and uh when you start spotting it you start getting really good at spotting it and you start seeing it more and more and more uh which is why a lot of people are coming to carnivore from all different aspects and they spot some nonsense over here and they go like okay okay what else are they lying about they start digging into it and they find like and now we're not even supposed to eat Kellogg cereals godamn it you know like okay so you know uh it's um just more and more people are waking up thankfully and and taking the red pill and and um you know hopefully we can just keep this train going I mean the cat's out of the bag at this point you know they can't just they can't just I mean they can silence me but you know my videos are out there they're all on Rumble you you know all of these go to rumble automatically so that's permanent and I've got them all so they they take my YouTube channel down I'll just put them up somewhere else um but the information is out there I mean it's just so widespread now and and my interviews on other people's channels are all over the place too they're not going to take all these things down there's too much and there's too many people even if if I'm Gone the the information is out there now and people know what to look for and so you know more and more people have more and more channels so you know someone say it's like a game of whack-a-mole like you're not going to get all of us and um they might try I mean you know but I think cats out of the bag I mean enough people know people personally that are doing this and having a great result that is just going to continue by word of mouth and so you know I think we're in a good position at the moment to to um get people healthy and um and and get away from this this uh weird weird stage of humanity and existence where we've been completely screwed over and uh and hurt extensively um and our families have been hurt and our parents and grandparents have all gotten sick and died too young and that's really really really really anchors me um so that's why I do it so you're very welcome thank you very much for your support I'm more than happy to do this because it is important to and it pisses me off so that's why I do it head boxer one thank you for the Super Chat hello I have been feeling tired does that mean I have to consume more fat given that I work out twice a day weightlifting and boxing so there are a lot of reasons why someone can be uh tired on a carnivore diet um if you only sort of come to a carnivore diet more recently your body may take longer to adapt you you can you full keto adaption can take a while sometimes you usually for performance uh purposes usually in a couple weeks just feel fantastic and uh but some people you know full adaptation is going to take months um but for for like you shouldn't see a real dip in your in your um in your energy levels after a couple weeks anyway but as far as um getting tired goes if if you've been on it for a long time you're s of getting tired if you're eating before uh you're working out you're going to be tired you're going to have a terrible workout so always eat after your workouts your last workouts so if you train in the morning you can eat something after that and but then you need big long five six seven hour break in between eating um before your your next workout you know or else you're just going to have crappy workout and um if you're not eating enough if you're not eating enough fat yeah definitely that can that can uh drag you down a bit if you're not getting enough water that can drag you down a bit um there's a lot of different things I did do a video on uh you know getting tired on a carnivore diet and U that's pretty cool quick it's like 9 minutes long or something like that and it sort of goes through most those are those are the main ones um and uh you can sort of troubleshoot those and just sort of go down the list and um you know if you sort of troubleshoot all these sorts of things and and that's not enough uh you just give it time you know and uh and see how you go but but eating at the wrong time is is definitely something that can um that can get you tired yeah and not eating enough so uh set egg thank you for the Super Chat 30 years alcoholic want to do carnivore more than anything but haven't had appetite or taste for three years Force everything down any advice yeah just just do that but what you force down is you force down fatty meat and you try to start weaning yourself off off the alcohol and usually on in a state of ketosis on a ketogenic state that can be easier you know I mentioned those studies before if you've been a 30-year alcoholic you may actually need medical support to to come off of that um and so you know do talk to your doctor about that you know if you're getting shaky and jittery you know you might you might need help you know you might need B vitamins and thiamine and and uh B12 and other sorts of things to support you or even you know things like Librium and benzo diazines that that will settle down the shakes and um and help you get through the DTs but a carnivore D can help that too um and you can always slowly wean off and uh and you shouldn't have those withdrawals um but yeah I would I would definitely when you eat you only eat fatty meat that's it or eggs that's it and um and you just you do try to eat at least once a day and you try to get something down you know and um and uh and you just sort of try to try to build that up and build that up and reduce the alcohol but you just cut out everything else just cut out everything else and only eat meat and um you know and then just try to build up your appetite again it'll it'll come it'll definitely come and especially when you're getting away from everything else and you're eating really good fatty meat your body will start looking at that and going o yep that's what we need and um yeah that can definitely help talk to your doctor about different sorts of B vitamins and different things you may be missing or depleting from your body because of the alcohol uh thyine a major one you can get like warik kees um and copath um which is permanent you know and then so you don't you don't want that to even begin um or can be permanent anyway but um yeah well good luck with that um and just when you eat just eat fatty meat and do try to eat every day get something down and um and and start start building building up and weaning down off the off the alcohol and hopefully hopefully you get there uh Salo 1985 thank you for for the Super Chat my leukemia doctor said leukemia feeds on um asparagine meat is high in this amino acid according to an asparagine calculator what are your thoughts um not that I know up that leukemia feeds on glucose and glutamine meat does have glutamine but so do plants you know um you're not going to avoid glutamine because of that um cancers period feed on glucose and glutamine not asparagine from my understanding um but either way I mean you're you're you're um well it's good that there you're your oncologist is at least thinking about food um I I like that but um no you're you're you're you shouldn't avoid meat I mean you have these amino acids that are in Plants anyway like glutamine um and so you know how do you avoid glutamine well you don't really because you make glutamine and um and so it's uh it's not really possible to avoid it you know if you cook these things glutamine Cooks out it denatures so you can do that but um really what what it comes down to is disrupting glutamine metabolism or fasting you if you fast you're going to limit the amount of glucose and glutamine that get in your body and asperene that gets in your body and you're going to limit the amount of available energy fuel sources for your cancer cells and I you know that's news to me about the asperene um you know I haven't I haven't heard that and certainly not something that I've come across before I'd be interested to see where where he got that from or she um but it's great that they're thinking about that maybe maybe show them my interview with Professor Thomas SE freed and show them his work on glutamine and glucose feeding cancer cells and uh and and if he's willing to sort of address things in that regard you know depending on your leukemia it may be more glycolytic or maybe more reliant on glutamine and if it is more um reliant on glutamine you know would your your doctor be willing to put you on something like Dawn uh d n it's um you know can't recall the whole chemical name at the moment but um it's in that video anyway and um uh that was actually originally um prescribed for Leukemia and Lymphoma patient one or the other uh in any case so it may actually be very well uh very possible for you to get that a lot of other people with Cancers are desperately trying to get their hands on this stuff because things like GBM are are you know they they have like 75% of their energy comes from glutamine so you really do do much better disrupting the glutamine and there are other things that disrupt GL glutamine that have been published on such as Fen bendol and mebendazol but you know you need to work with your doctor if that's if that's right with you and you have someone who treats leukemia and Dawn is a leukemia drug I believe that or lymphoma so maybe that you can get these sorts of things you attacking with ketogenic metabolic therapy as well as something like Dawn or similar and you um you know do the requisite chemo um or or radiation as per your your oncologist and your your decision with the team um and and hopefully that gives you a very good result and outcome but uh never heard of asperene being a problem um but fasting does the exact same thing either way and um I think the same thing is is true uh regardless is that you approach this in that ketogenic metabolic therapy which is that's where the clinical data and pre-clinical data comes from showing that this improves cancer outcomes uh in humans and animals by you know stopping the carbs limiting the amount of food coming in and disrupting glutamine nadima thank you very much for the very generous super chats very kind of you um they say thank you so much for your content it changed my life beef makes me feel like a superhuman I just eat steak and raw cow's milk are the carbs from the milk going to wreck my weight loss long term I have three to four cups a day uh 36 to 48 grams of carbohydrates well first of all you're very very welcome and I'm really glad that um it has been helpful um I personally do avoid milk even raw milk even though it's bloody delicious that's partly why I avoid it because it's I sort of feel compelled to drink it and there's that sort of compulsion like I want this right and so that to me is a drug I don't want that right so I don't want to be compelled to eat something I want something that has negative feedback when I eat more fatty meat it tastes good at first but it tastes less good and less good and less good until finally it doesn't taste good at all milk always tastes good I mean I I just dump down two gallons of that stuff a day and I I would drink more if there was there and I didn't feel like I shouldn't you know um but I would you know I mean I grew up drinking a gallon of milk every day growing up it was skin milk unfortunately and it was pasteurized unfortunately but it um you know that that's what I did as a kid you know as as an adult I drink more than that sometimes I just chug this stuff down I would have my own bottle of milk in the fridge and I just I just I just drink out because I'd finish a gallon a day right and so um I do avoid carbs now or the milk now because of the carbs and um you know I drink a glass of milk and I'm you know once every year or two I'll get my hands on some raw milk or something like that I'll just be like oh okay you know um have some of that and I have a glass and it's just amazing and I'll sit down on the couch like an hour later I'm like passing out on the couch in the middle of the day you know it raises your insulin and then you get reactive hypoglycemia and you're and you pass out so uh that can you know that can happen and then I found myself okay well I'm sort of getting a bit tired and I really want another glass okay I'll have another glass and hour later oh I want another glass I'll have another glass I just do that throughout the day and then I'm chasing carbs you know you you're down that rabbit hole again of you're just you're getting cars and it comes down you want to get more cars and it comes down and so it's that thing so I'm I'm just I'm just out of that rat race and um and so that's why I do that so you know just do an experiment you know drop the milk for a month see how you feel you know I think you'll feel better you know I think you'll do better I think you'll have more consistent energy throughout the day and um and I think you'll get get better uh fat loss as a result of that as well Dairy is a huge um fat loss stall and while it's extremely nutritious and if people are are nutritionally deprived or they have a nutritionally deficient diet raw milk and liver are your best friends right because they're very nutrient-dense and you can you can catch up on a lot of things it's like this is like the it's Nature's supplement and um so that's great but if you're already eating a top-notch diet then you you don't necessarily need it because you're getting all those nutrients already uh so those are sort of my thoughts on it if you feel that that's of benefit to you then great but you know try it and see the contrast and see see how you go and what you think and what works best for your body bruh thanks for the Super Chat thanks bruh uh hey chaffy I am 136 kg dude who's uh going to the gym a lot I just started sprinting last week awesome I just wondered what ratio of grams between fat and protein I should have normally at 50/50 uh you know that's fairly good you know and if you're working out a lot you may need well you will need a bit more amino acids and things like that for muscle uh growth and hypertrophy um so I I still think you listen to your body you try to get enough fat that you that so the thing is it's not really about the ratio it's more about you need enough fat and you need enough protein for your body uh body's demands and so you need enough fat so that you're not getting constipated if you're getting constipated you're not eating enough fat so however much fat you have if you're eating two to one grams of fat to protein and you're getting constipated you're not eating enough fat you still need to eat more um maybe you need to eat more protein too but you definitely need to eat more fat as well and so you eat fat until you have soft stools as long as you're not eating anything else then drinking anything else or subjecting yourself to anything else like a medicine or a supplement that can cause diarrhea or or loosening of the stools and quickening of the vowels um and then you just eat you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good if you add in butter and it tastes better go for it you know if you finish that steak and it's like w that was still tasting good eat more and um and if you're eating more lean meat you you it gets boring pretty quick you add butter to it tastes good again you go for it you just eat a piece of butter and that's really good that's a good sign that your body wants more of it um and and the conservation thing is a big one um quite often one: one grams of fat to protein to two to one grams of fat to protein is where people balance out and it depends on the person the individual you might need a little bit more of one or the other and so that ratio might change a bit but it's not as important about the ratio as getting enough grams of each that's what you need you just need enough of these things and generally people need more grams of fat than they need grams of protein that's how that usually usually tends to run but just you know do it listen your body you're sort of in that range anyway now just adjust to your body's demands and and specifically their fat content to your stools and um if you're taking a whole bunch of protein powders because you're in the gym a lot I probably wouldn't and I especially wouldn't if they have artificial sweeteners because they'll cause loose stools and other sorts of problems disruption they could disrupt your insulin and um yeah so I I would cut all those things out so all things being even you're only eating meat and only drinking water um then you just adjust according to your body and if you're eating anything else drop it momentum fourth um thank you for the Super Chat I I'm not seeing a question attached I'm not seeing one below so um I don't know but thank you very much in the any case and then um Saka guy uh says uh bro so much respect uh you're you're a good person uh Planet uh planet's better because you're here oh thank you very much that's really nice of you to say um it's very kind of you um okay well I think that that might do it I think we got through the super chats pretty well and um and uh we went a bit over time but that that's okay so um yeah so if you see here everyone this is the we're having a generate Health Summit that's coming up on April 21st so I'll be speaking there uh there'll be a number of other people speaking there um that are you know absolutely fantastic so my friend Natalie West will be there um um Charles arnet will be there like AR its um crackers and things like that you know big ran here and he's a big regenerative farmer uh here in Australia so he um he's going to be talking there and um and a number of other people um that that that are going to be great to listen to as well so if you guys want to go there you can go to the regenerate o.com so regenerate a us.com um there's a link in the chat as it says there you see the sort of thing up on the screen and um and that tickets are still available but they they are they are uh you know selling out so you if you do want to go to that please do and um and I will see you guys there so it'll it' be really fun time we had a great time last year was perfect the food was amazing it was all just super carnivore stuff just amazing amazing like regenerative farmed meat and high fat and just great it was awesome bun of brisket and and uh different sorts of um meat dish like literally my mouth is watering right now thinking about it it was like the best spread at a um at a conference that I I had been to um uh so far and so hopefully we can hopefully we can do again uh uh as well this time as well um all right

Thursdays um for new premieres because I've got I've got a number of episodes in backlog that I need to that I need to get out and uh so people aren't waiting too long to see these things and get them published so I'll be doing them two twice a week for the moment and then two lives a week on Wednesdays and Fridays and um so lots of stuff lots of content and hopefully see you all at the premieres it's really great to get a lot of people at the live so thank you all for joining sorry for the delays today uh and to the premieres as well that really makes a big difference in getting these things out there uh because the more people that come to the premiere the more people are commenting and being active in it the more this pumps it out on the algorithm and it gets uh just better and better and better exposure so that's really helpful so thank you all very much for that hopefully you all can join me uh for the next uh well for all the premieres and all the lives so thank you all very
