        "body": "h and then not have as much room so yeah um okay so uh h and then not have as much room so yeah um okay so uh Super Chat from nap thank you very much you say lower fat intake if you get diarrhea during carnivore but aren't you supposed to wait and let your body get fat adapted um so this is one of two uh there we go and if you do lower your fat intake wouldn't that mess up the fat to protein ratio that you need to get assuming you were um getting the right ratio initially so the thing is it's not necessarily about the ratio that's important it's about getting enough protein for your needs and enough fat for your needs as well that tends to get a ratio of about 1 to one grams of fat to protein to two to one grams of fat to Protein that's just something that we've observed but you still just need enough fat and enough protein if you're if if all else is if you are only eating meat and only drinking water and you're not taking any medications that can cause loose stools you're not drinking coffee or tea you're not taking in any artificial sweeteners you're not taking any magnesium supplements those all can all uh loosen up your stools if you're not doing any of that and you're only drinking water and you're only eating meat and you're getting loose stools it can be that you're not absorbing all that fat because your body has a limited capacity to absorb fat and when your body's happy and satisfied with that it just goes out it's like a spillover valve this is why people say like well you don't want to eat too much fat it's not a thing you really can't because physiologically you can't absorb more than your body has a a bile for unless you're doing something like taking Ox spot or something like that which I would not recommend uh in almost every situation ever so that would force your body to absorb more fat than you need other than that it just spills over and it goes out so a little bit extra keeps your stool sof soft so that's how you know that you're ex you're meeting that demand for your body to get enough fat and then a little extra right and after that you can get a lot more fat than your body can absorb you can get loose stools and so then then that's fine you don't have to reduce the amount of fat but you're not absorbing uh all of it right and or or you can go on the other side where you're so constipated that you're get pseudoobstruction you get the liquid stool squirting around that and you get watery diarrhea intermixed with hard constipated stools and so if you're getting that pattern then you need a lot more fat but if it's just the normal loose stools from eating more fat than your body can absorb then you can just pull back because it's not about it's not unsafe it's not an infection there's not know something wrong um happening it's just inconvenience and so you know that that can be a problem for people especially if they add in magnesium or coffee or something like that they can you know as Joe Rogan calls it you get disaster pants for for three weeks as you're starting this when you're getting more used to eating fat your body can potentially increase the amount of bile that it produces in the day and so you can end up absorbing more fat but eventually you're you're either way you have a limited capacity to absorb that so you just try to meet your body's demands and so and that still tends to be around one to two grams of fat per one gram of protein but it varies for people in different situations so you just try you get enough protein and you get enough fat and enough fat is just stopping shy of the point that you get diarrhea you know so that's that's the idea there and that may increase that may decrease so you know just you just meet your body's demands at where they are but that's how you sort of figure that out um trying to got this weird sort of stuff here I'm getting I'm going to have to s try to get the um the [Music] Instagram um Instagram thing up again unfortunately it's not really working properly I'm just going to try this here just have to redo the code here real quick very sorry about this stream key there we go and and there all right if it doesn't work this time we'll just can it o kay so this is one of the questions from last week was"

        "body": "kay so this is one of the questions from last week was kay so this is one of the questions from last week was super chat from Kylie kiddle thank you for that Kylie uh everyone gets diarrhea but I haven't so I think I'm doing something wrong uh no you're just you're just sort of meeting that um that you know that that that right amount of fat that your body is getting alternatively if you're having coffee or tea or some of those things that I mentioned um and you're very constipated it could just be offsetting that constipation so you may need more fat but that that's that's true for everybody if you're if you're taking in those things it can just mask how much fat you're actually getting or or exacerbate how much you're getting um based on your stool so just you know just do nothing else except fatty meat and water for a few weeks and then adjust the fat intake for you know your stools and and you should be fine so no you're not doing anything wrong um you just uh got lucky and uh and didn't it didn't jump into um you didn't uh you know head dive into you know the wrong amount of fat potentially unless you're taking um one of these sorts of things so uh no not everybody gets diarrhea um not everybody gets loose stools when they're transitioning or later on um so it's U but it is common enough mostly because most people drink coffee on this planet and then they go carnivore and well not giving up my coffee and so now when you have fiber blocking up your pipes you know a little bit of laxative effects probably a good idea get that stuff moving through you get rid of all that fiber and now it's just liquefied meat is just going and it's getting fire hosed out the other end so you know that's obviously not what you want and so oh but I'm still drinking the same amount of coffee yeah but you're not eating fiber now so it's very different so so that's why most people get um loose stools from what I can see is they still drink coffee or artificial sweeteners or put the artificial sweeteners in the coffee because it tastes disgusting and they have to do something to it that's usually why but yeah a lot of people when they don't do that they're just eating meat and water actually don't get that so good glad you're not there's another"

girl and her mother say uh that it's immoral to eat meat I told them it's part of human nature they say it's evil to kill how do you deal with these people well you you can you can point out you just ask them it's like okay do we get rid of all the all the predators in the world 70% of all animal species are carnivores and they're predators and say okay so we get rid of them you know we kill all the fish kill all the whales kill all the birds kill all the dolphins kill all the lions kill all the hyenas and the and the foxes and wolves and all these sorts of things and the Bears and they'll just say no well that's just part of nature it's like well yes we're part of nature too we don't exist outside of Nature and also you kill 25 times more sentient animals sentient animals than um than you do eating meat by by eating crops to grow one pound of plant-based protein you have to kill 25 times the number of sentient animals than to grow one pound of animal-based protein from from large livestock animals like cows and sheep so uh no you know there's no such thing as a bloodless meal and um you know they may remove them have be one step removed you know from that killing but that doesn't mean there's not killing involved and say well you know it's incidental if you're driving on a you hear all these stupid scenarios no something died and you're responsible for that death and so you own up for it and you own it and just say yes you know we did and I respect this animal I'm respect their life and I'm going to give them as as good a life as possible as clean a death as as there can be and um and and respect them and appre appreciate them as opposed to just you know putting my fingers in my ears and and and pretending that this isn't happening because it is you know when you grow a single crop you necessarily have to destroy an entire ecosystem you have to kill every plant and every animal that's in that area and grow one crop you destroy the soil you destroy the the soil's microbiome you kill all the plants you kill all the the weeds that come up you kill all the insects that are trying to eat it in America alone with the spraying of pesticides and insecticides we kill over one quadrillion insects every year that's just in America that's the base of the food chain so how many billions of birds and lizards and other sorts of smaller animals that rely on those bugs and insects for for food and life die out starve to death or don't exist in the first place because their parents couldn't get enough food to then support babies and eggs right um you're using those those pesticides insecticides that that hurts and injures 700 billion Birds a year just in America and um was it billions million yeah uh 7 700 million birds in America and about a tenth of those die so you know around 68 million Birds die every year from these pesticides that we spray on crops um we shoot the deer and the pigs and the moose and the other animals that come in the big Harvest um Harvesters just chew up and rip apart all the little animals that are in the crops and you know all the the bunnies and the squirrels and the mice and the snakes and the even deer that are out there in the corn field just get just chewed up and mowed down and Cho to Pieces um you know in these big combine Harvesters and and um you know it's pretty you know it's pretty it's pretty wild it's pretty uh destructive um 55% of borneo's rainforests were bulldozed for Palm crops palm seed oil crops so they killed all the orangutans all the snakes all the birds everything they destroyed this entire habitat and they bulldoze these things and there videos and pictures of these orangutans falling out of these trees they bulldo these trees rants fall out and crash and just shatter themselves break their spine and just suffer and just die slowly over the next few days you know it's just disgusting you know what they're they're doing um for these these crops and then you the vegans will say well no but you yes you you you destroyed this whole you know virgin rainforest but then they replac it with trees so you know same same no it's not same same that's a monocrop that's not an ecosystem and all the and all those animals are dead now you've killed them and then the animals try to move in and and eat that crop because that's why they're there um they get shot right because they're messing with these people's money so uh no it's it's actually extremely immoral to grow crops it's dreme extremely destructive to grow crops it's immoral you're killing 25 times the number of sentient animals you're destroying the E the ecological base of the food chain and and killing quadrillions tens 50 you know you know dozens of quadrillions of uh insects all around the world and and you are um responsible for losing 27.5 billion tons of top soil every single year it takes 500 years to grow a centimeter of top soil right that is a Vanishing resource you know Screw oil like top soil is what's going to run out next right and um you know and we're just and we're pretending that this isn't the case it's already been calculated that we probably only have about 50 growing Cycles left on planet Earth and we're trying to go more plant-based and speed that up right that's dumb right animals regenerate the land they regenerate the nutrients in the land they make top soil and you can run them on arable land which is 4% of the Earth's surface including water but you can also run them on Range land and Forest land which makes up another 25% of the Earth's surface right you can't grow crops on rangeland or Forest land and you don't need to tear down the forest to put animals through it you can just you just run them through and they just eat what they eat right so and it's the animals that replenish the nutrients in the soil actually makes the the land more fertile in the first place you cannot have plant agriculture without animal agriculture you have to have it you have to have those nutrients coming from those animals you can't get away from that and and plant agriculture destroys the planet destroys the um the ecosystem destroys the uh animals so no it's actually evil and disgusting to eat plants and you should uh tell them that that they sicken you and uh you don't want to hear anything from morally bankrupt people that are trying to destroy the planet maybe leave that last part out do what you want um it's a question from Thomas or Tomas maybe um 3619 from last week how important is it to eat antibio antibiotic free meat something I need to look more into but from from my understanding they give antibiotics long before they're slaughtered so they should be long out of their system uh by the time that you get them and certainly you're not going to like eat a steak and have that be a week's worth of antibiotics or something silly like that because you give them a shot goes throughout their entire body so you're not going to get that whole shot worth in each steak that's going to be distributed out between two years worth of meat right so how much is actually in there I don't I don't uh I don't know but I'm not too sure it's um it's all that significant I haven't looked closely into it that yet but just working on that principle that like well this is this is a certain amount but it's diluted over a whole cow and they're not doing like here's your antibiotic now here's the slaughter house that doesn't make any sense it's a waste of money they give that to them at the beginning of the slaughter house of the feed lot experience because it's an unnatural environment they're packed in tighter with with other cows they're eating an unhealthy diet so they they're more susceptible to uh infections um and so that's another thing too you you're getting just wild grass-fed animals um they don't eat antibiotics right U it's only when they go into feed lots and they're being fed things that they're not designed to eat that they end up needing these sorts of things but they're given that early on so that they don't get sick and lose weight and die in the feed lot so they can they can get them to Market um so you know realistically I think it's probably well out of their system by the time we get them but um other people say you know seem to have a problem with them I know Dr lustig um you know thinks that there's a problem with them I have a lot of respect for Dr lustig but I'm just not convinced that there's much of it left in the meat by the time you get to it but you know that there there are ways to avoid it too um if that's something you're worried about then then certainly by all means uh avoid it um"

        "body": "u very much Joseph for that um Tom carnivore uh from a u very much Joseph for that um Tom carnivore uh from a super chat last week uh thank you very much for that wife in pain uh every menstrual cycle because of endo endometriosis uh doctor solution is the pill what is your take I can't get her full carnivore as well but she is keto since the diagnosis so you know keto is going to help you know I do know uh I don't know if if um you know my girlfriend L is in the the chat but her um menstrual pain disappeared when she went full carnivore but it was it was that last step to full meat and water that actually did it you know she was still getting uh menstrual pain when she would have little cheats or little things here and there and she wasn't she was mostly eating meat pretty much keto most of the time every now and then she'd have some other stuff um but most of the time she was really good and then when she made that full switch to just meat and water gone she had no menstrual pain and in fact I bought her this thing she was you know dropping um several UNS subtle hints about this thing that she wanted uh to sort of like a warming pack you know on her abdomen and pelvis to sort of heat up and warm when she had um period pain she had menstrual pain and I got this for her at at sort of the exact time she started doing just full-on meat and water and had never had menual pain after that so thing's just sitting in the in the closets has never been used um so that was funny because she she really wanted that she' wanted that for a while and I ended up getting it for her and um doesn't need it anymore so you know U I'm not a big fan of the pill for anybody in any situation really because it's uh it actually really really screws up your hormones and actually can can um cause mental issues as well it causes women to actually think differently and think differently about their Partners as well um that's that we're getting more long-term data on this Decades of of data on this women who are on the pill end up choosing different partners in different ways for different reasons and they come off the pill and they changes their mindset hormones are really really important for your health and your and your brain and so I don't think that that's a good oh yeah just just put her on the pill no why would you want to mess up her hormones uh like that I mean that that has all these unintended consequences that are just really not not a good idea so you know start with keto eat a lot of fat get your ketones up ketones are going to suppress inflammation that can help with pain as well try to get rid of the most inflammatory plants such as um such as night shades so potatoes Tomatoes eggplants Peppers try to get low oxalate ones as well and then mix up the veggies it shouldn't have the same veggies every single day because they have the same toxins every single day and they build up and so if you're going to have these plants you just mix them up you have a smaller amount and you mix them around and um and that's that's uh gives your body a chance to sort of detoxify these things a little better but um full carnivore would help it would absolutely help i' I've see this again and again people saying they have a significant Improvement in their menstrual cycle maybe people in the live chat or in the comments watching this um after the fact and watching the recording maybe comment below and just say and say their experiences with that and if they've had Improvement in their menstrual cycle or if they haven't you know if you've gone but you know with the caveat that if you have gone full carnivore just meet and water how has that affected your your menstrual cycle um because that's that's what sort of what we want to know but also you know if you've done sort of you know half-hearted um carnivore at least you know just say that you just say hey I wasn't 100% but you know I still had coffee or something like that and it helped my menstrual pain but it didn't quite get rid of it that's good information as well or maybe some people went close to it and got rid of all of it or maybe it's just like no you really have to go 100% so you know please do let people know what your experiences with it is and how strict you were with it so that people know that as well and um you know good luck to your wife hopefully the keto helps a lot um and and uh and really calms this down so she can avoid taking nasty hormones um also heard Lugal iodine can help is that from Tom the carnivore I'm not too sure but I don't know but if that's in the context of of um menstrual pain then um I don't know one way or the other so uh yeah I'm not the best ask on that one uh so Beth radam marker thank you very much this again from last week uh congrats on 300K well thank you very much question um is it okay to eat the same cut of beef all the time I sure hope so because that's what exact what I do or are there different nutrients and different cuts that we need to switch up not not so much I mean there's going to be a different ratio of fat cholesterol and protein in the different cuts um so as long as you're getting your you know that sort of balance properly you know should be fine you know the thing is is that like you know different organs will definitely have different uh nutrient profiles and so if you're having uh the organs you're having a bit of a couple of different ones probably good idea if you're having a lot of liver all the time those things are going to build up and the the the water soluble ones probably not a big deal because you'll just you'll just wash those out um unless you're really overdoing it but the the fat soluble ones or the you know the metals like copper and things like that they stick around longer and so you do have to be mindful of that uh but no you should should be able to eat the sameeh cut of beef uh especially beef If you're sort of eating chicken all the time you're probably not going to get all the nutrients you want a lot of people that eat a lot of beef they eat chicken like oh this is just Bland even the dark meat isn't all that fun to eat because you just it doesn't have the same nutrient density and profile so uh but beef generally just eat eat beef I mean there are people that have like the Andersons they've been doing carnivore for like 25 years at this point raise all their kids on it uh they've just eaten ribey the whole time this is what they eat they eat ribe eyes and um you know good for them so uh yeah you can you can definitely do that some people need a bit of organs you know people with MTHFR may need a bit more uh folate and b12 than than other people do and so they might need a bit of Li most people don't but um if um you know you're in that category where you do you do need a bit more of this stuff also the I mean the food that we're eating the meat that we're eating it's not Wild game right the Wild game has way more nutrients in it and micronutrients and so you if you aren't able to get regeneratively raised grass-fed and finished beef and lamb you know the the store-bought stuff is still great but it does have less micronutrients it just does and so it might be that you need a bit of organs for that so keep that in mind um bit of liver every now and then is not going to kill you a lot of organs uh and liver you know might be a problem but you know a small amount a few times a week you know it's not it's not going to hurt you in fact it'll be pretty good for you uh it doesn't taste that bad the less you cook meat the better it tastes that's a that's a pro tip right there so um that's what I would suggest so Beth Roker thank you again for the"

        "body": "normal people not a problem uh Ellie thank you for the normal people not a problem uh Ellie thank you for the super chat um hi Dr C I am a serious fan well thank you very much that's very nice of you is it necessary to drink water every one two three hours Etc or does the length of time between drinks not matter I don't think no I don't think you have to just constantly drink water you know think about what you're doing in nature you know where we've been able to store water in containers and bring them with us um but we you know generally animals you you get you get to you know watering hole and you you sort of drink a lot of water they may not drink for a few days after that or they might drink every day but they might just drink once a day you know water's pretty dangerous in nature in a lot of areas there's usually you know something trying to you know you bring your face down to the water and there's something all of a sudden well bite your face and pull you into the water so um it's um it's it's not just be you AR just going to just drinking every couple hours or every hour uh so I don't think you need to do that I didn't just drink to thirst I I tend to camel up so I'll drink you know a lot of water in one go and then I'll just go you know go to work and and work pretty much all day and I I don't I don't take breaks I don't take lunch I don't take anything um because I don't need to you know so I just see patience and I just keep going and you know when I'm at the hospital there's no there's no breaks to take it's just like you giv you go and you desperately try to eat something whenever you can if you have to but for me it generally don't have to and you just drink water when you can but sometimes you know I don't I won't drink I'll drink water in the morning when I before I leave for work and I'll drink water at night when I get back from work and um that's the opportunities that I have to to get water so no I don't I don't think you have to just drink every every hour the hour or anything like that just just drink a reasonable amount of water for you and just make sure you're getting enough make sure you're not getting dehydrated and um and that's it you know I don't I don't think it it matters um how much you drink at a time I don't think you have to just keep sipping throughout the day and there there are medical reasons why you would need to do that um I've heard um Andrew huberman talk about how it doesn't matter how much you drink at night before you go to bed bed if you drink it faster the rate of how fast you drink it that that will make you more or less likely to need to get up and pee interesting I haven't seen the the study or the full discussion on that um but that was something that I saw sort of in a clip whereas if you sort of chug water you're more likely to need to pee in the middle of the night whereas if you sort of drank that more slowly over several minutes or something like that uh but again I didn't see the full thing um either way I just sort of drink a lot of water when I have access to it and then don't worry about it after that but do make sure you get enough water um Ellie I think this is one of the last um ones from last week so made made some good progress uh Ellie thank you very much and [Music] um [Music] um and um I have checked the super chats so I don't know what's going on there anyway or the private chat um so uh Ellie says uh when you can't or don't eat um but you're hungry how long would it be before your body thinks um it's a famine and slows down the metabolism thanks again um it would take a while you know if you if you've been you just eating consistently um you know your body's going to yeah and you miss miss a meal I mean that's pretty that's pretty common for animals to miss a meal in in the wild and so um um you know so that we're well used to that it's it's going to be the prolong you know you know day after day after day after day of of getting less than your body requires that your your body's going to say like oh okay we need to shut this down you if you look at like the Minnesota starvation studies um by our good friend the uh evil um the sort of the the the the mad scientist Anil keys they starved the hell out of these people to see what it' be like to if we everyone had to be on rationing or or concentration camps and things like that and um and they lost you know a lot of weight at first but then it plateaued and then they didn't really lose much weight at all even though we're basically eating nothing um you know very very um very very small of food so um you know it does it does take some time but then it goes down slows down it stays down and then when you start eating again it it um you you will put on fat because your body's saying we need to store this we need to survive because maybe we got a cash of food now but doesn't mean we're out of the famine we're not necessarily getting consistent meals we're not necessarily going to get consistent meals and so it needs to needs to uh protect you so that you can survive I I don't promote fasting in people I have seen people that use a carnivore diet and um you know if they want to sort of help accelerate fat loss or when they're getting ready for like a competition or something like that they may fast one day a week otherwise you're doing like sort of in aitt one meal a day and um but actually seen a lot of people that say that if they stretch that out to two days or do two days a week separated by a few days that actually can actually slow down weight loss and you start seeing that metabolism start coming down they start getting uh eating they eating less or actually losing less too and they might actually start going back the other way so just be mindful of that um you know if you if you skip a meal out of out of necessity you're just traveling and there's nothing good to eat I mean it's better to not eat than than eat something bad for you I think unless you're actually starving but none of us are uh and so you know skipping a meal or skipping a day of meals you know your body can handle that it's not going to cause too much of a problem and then you you'll sort of get back into the routine and your body will be fine you know even if you even if you fast for a few days for whatever reason you know someone's treating cancer or other sort of medical issue and they want to do a medical fast then you know great um you know do that but um uh your body will sort of recover you might put on a bit of fat and sort of stabilize and all that sort of stuff when you're when you have a Cancer and you're fasting you need refeeds like you don't want to lose too much weight um you want to you want to maintain healthy weight so um you know it takes a bit a bit of time but you know if you're you just skip a meal or a day or two you know you shouldn't you shouldn't do that and your body will recover and metabolism will go back up you know within a few days or a week anyway so it should be fine it's just those prolonged uh periods of of chronically undereating that that's the problem this is a chat from Ellie Melly thank you very much for saying hi says I'm I'm here just got on um yes my period pain went away so it's in refer reference to the last uh one of those last questions that period pain went away I also have the copper coil for contraception and it's meant uh to make period pain very bad um but don't get it all anymore yeah so that's actually a good point is that um those sorts of iuds are are typically make things much more painful and um and and more uncomfortable so so it's uh uh you know that's that's getting rid of that sort of increased pain then that's a really good sign as well um I'm going to see there's actually quite a l ot of questions so this from Lena um thank you for the"

says no treatment um and says non I I'm not seeing oh here we go um Dr says I have fibro fibromuscular dysplasia he says no treatment and diet won't help because it's non-inflammatory disease can carnivore help well it's not going to hurt anyway and um you know the thing is is that we never we've never T tested these these diets against these diseases um some of them we have you know ketogenic sort of diets there's tons of of studies on ketogenic diets I don't know if there's any on fibromuscular dysplasia but you can look into that uh ketogenic diets replace carbohydrates with fat and protein from animals from meat they're animal-based diets um and that's what they they use in the study so if you find something if you go on PubMed or Google Scholar and you look up fibromuscular dysplasia and ketogenic diet you may find studies that have been done on that and it may or may not have helped if it um if it is the case that it's helped that applies to a carnivore diet because carnivore diets are animal-based ketogenic diets and that's what people don't don't realize that this is this is a the a very well-studied diet with a lot of long-term evidence on it so um so take a look for that I don't know um I don't know myself um if that's going to be something that's going to help I don't really have any patients with fibromuscular displasia I can't really think of people that I've spoken to that have had that but maybe someone here in the comments you know there's there's you know 1,200 people watching at the moment so I mean let's see you know someone here um has had that please you know leave that in the comments and or someone watching the re replay if that's something that you've have have experience with you know please do uh let us know so that uh Ron can take a look at that and um other people can know as well either way it's not it's not going to hurt you it's not going to make it worse it could make it better we don't know I don't know anyway but it will help you in a thousand other ways that will make it very much worth your while to do and and who knows people are people are reversing things or improving things that their doctors said no absolutely incurable there's nothing you can do all that sort of stuff fine you know that's that that's our knowledge based at the moment or his knowledge based at the moment or their knowledge based at the moment fine but you know that doesn't mean that you're not going to get benefit from doing this and we are seeing people do this and and you know reverse Auto diseases no one thought autoimmune diseases were reversible reversing diabetes no one thought diabetes was reversible all these sorts of things that everyone thought no no no you can't reverse that that's just you're just stuck with it that's just it uh that's it for you wrong okay so this could be one of those things they were wrong about as well I've seen so many other things just uh uh completely go away that no one thought possible and so this could very well be one of those as well don't know give it a try try you're going to improve a lot anyway and you may as well uh see what it what it does and it could could very well help you so good luck with that Mike's uh Mike Ox Falin interesting name haven't come across that before uh how bad is eating spiced pork rinds uh lime in water drinking tea pepper coffee my mom thinks these are no big deal what would you tell her well you know it's it's it's a smaller amount and if you're if you're only using those and not having absolutely anything else and you're just eating meat and water otherwise you you're still going to be doing better than 99.999% of people out there in the world right and that's great right but I think it would be worth just doing a self- experiment of just trying to come off of it for 30 days and just see how you go right just come off of that I think you find it makes a massive difference it makes a massive difference even people just coming off coffee you know they they a lot of people people find that that makes them gives them much better energy reduces their inflammation significantly and they feel a lot better and so you know taking out those sorts of things I mean they do have toxins in them they do and um it's a it's a big drop off off that Cliff you know you're just doing perfect red you know meat and water and you just add a little bit of stuff in it's a big drop it's a big drop down just that first step off so um I would you know just just encourage you to just H try for a month it's not that long 30 days it's nothing grand scheme of things if this is can radically improve your life why not try it out at least you know then you cut all that stuff out you just go meat and water whatever meat that you choose and whatever you enjoy and just see how you feel you want to try to add those things back in add them back in but pay close attention to how it makes you feel pay close attention to how you feel and how it makes you feel after when you add those in most people don't want it after that and because they feel so m uch better so I'd give that a try TT thank you for the"

        "body": "o do so good job ice cold motivation thank you for the o do so good job ice cold motivation thank you for the super chat um doctor how long does it does nerve damage take to heal I have multiple sclerosis uh I've been three months on Carnivore symptoms going down slowly but not sure if they will eventually Plateau it takes a long time nerves take months and months and months to heal and regrow and it certainly depends on the extent of the damage that you have but even if your if your symptoms are going down at all you know they're going down like that's amazing you know nothing else does this right so just be just be very thankful for that eat very high fat very high fat don't eat anything else except beef and lamb only drink water and you'll have the best results also check your things like B12 because B12 is required for the myelination of your axons most people are low on B12 even when they go on Carnivore because they start out at a very deficient state in America you want to be between 1100 and 1,600 and that's way off the charts for for most Labs right it'll say oh my God you're too high it's not too high it's exactly where you want to be it's that everybody else is too low and that's why the reference range is too low in Australia in Europe it's um you want to be between 800 and 12200 right so I would take B12 you know or maybe just add in some liver things like that check your B12 uh most people are so low on B 12 and they don't know it because it's in that reference range but they're actually in a point of critical deficiency where they can actually get demyelination because their B12 is so low and they have no idea because it's in that normal reference range the doctor goes oh yeah no that's fine [\u00a0__\u00a0] you know oh the reference range oh that's good that's what you want no that's the average for the patient population at that lab and that's why every single lab on Earth has a different reference range because it's a different sample of people that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] I mean that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life so just because everyone's nutritionally deficient now no one is sorry they are and so you know we we're masking all these deficiencies and these diseases and issues disorders should say by by just changing the reference range it's stupid it's really stupid and so that just needs that that needs to go away so you need to use reference ranges that actually denote actual good health and the actual ranges for actual good health in America for B12 is 1100 to 1600 in Australia and and Europe it's 800 to 12200 right so that's what you want and and uh and vitamin D no one has enough vitamin D unless they're eating a lot of animal fat especially grass-fed fat grass-fed butter they're getting out in the sun so um you want enough vitamin D you want enough B12 I would just probably just get an injection just to top you up add a bit of liver in a couple days a week at least and uh take some vitamin D you know 8 to 10,000 I use vitamin D um Sometimes they come in combination with K2 totally fine and just um and just uh you know take that for a couple months and just get get your levels up make sure that they're up and then you keep them up with your your diet almost everybody's deficient when they start a cornivore diet and especially when you have a health issue like Ms you need to get up to a proper level ASAP it can take a while even on a proper diet uh especially if you're not eating liver and organs so just keep that in mind um you can check those whatever it says whatever that reference range says you want to be higher than that basically um or at least on the upper end of that for B12 you want to be above it 100% but um vitamin D sometimes it goes into the into the correct ranges but you want to be on the upper edge of that if not a little higher for almost all nutrients basically um so yeah keep that in mind but good luck with it you know you're already getting better so that's fantastic be really strict you want be pure pure pure red meat and water and get enough B12 get enough vitamin D and um and you'll do as well as you can a nd good luck with that Morgan French thank you for the"

limbs for the past few years could going cornivore worsen my muscle deterioration I couldn't imagine how it would worsen it um it's uh may not help it because we don't know what's causing it but it is definitely worth trying there are a lot of things uh causing proximal muscle weakness that can get get help such as um thyroid issues and things like that um but I would I would check it out I mean if you you know it's undiagnosed but you know work with your doctor to see if you can get a diagnosis uh starting cornival diet is not going to hurt that um I can't think of anything that a cornival diet would hurt except maybe your doctor's pride and not uh not understanding how helpful This was um so it would definitely be worth a try can it help maybe it depends on what's causing it so good luck with that hopefully that helps another thing too muscle deterioration so we're talking about um muscular distrophy this is something that that I've been sort of harping on about but it's really important muscular distrophy exists in cows it's the same exact disease presents in exact same ways but they were able to figure out that it's actually not a genetic disorder gentic predisposition but the environmental trigger is a selenium deficiency so it's actually called nutritional muscular distrophy in cows has anyone ever asked if our muscular distrophy was a a um was a a nutritional deficiency or selenium def no one checks selenium no one checks selenium so you know guarantee they haven't checked in these kids and have they checked other nutrients as well maybe it's something else but maybe it's selenium why aren't we checking this um I don't treat muscular distrophy so I don't have any any kids with muscular distrophy but you know I just just a scatter blast out there to all the pediatricians or people that work with pediatricians or know a pediatrician uh or have kids with muscular distrophy please check you know check their nutritional status and start seeing check selenium check you know these other micronutrients magnesium and zinc and D and B and everything like just check everything and and check their panels uh understand that the average reference that the reference ranges are an average for the community and they're not indicative of good health so oh yeah oh selenium's fine it may not be figure out look up what the proper uh reference ranges are for these things I I talk about them a lot but um you know they're different for different things right so um you know you know depending on what you're looking for obviously there's going to be different reference ranges but you you try to find the optimal reference ranges basically high for this for whatever the reference range is and a little higher too high is actually toxic insum so you don't want to go too high but higher than their their reference range most likely um but you know whatever the hell the reference ranges you guys use in your units it's going to be different so in any case check if anyone treats this please check if anyone has has a family member or is a pediatrician please write in the comments your experience with this and please get on people about this because I'm so I'm I'm I'll be very curious to find out if if there were nutritional deficiencies because you know dogs and cats get diabetes for the same damn reason humans do they get lupus and autoimmunity for the same reason humans do they're eating the wrong thing and you start giving other animals and zoos and elsewhere same wrong things they get the same wrong things happening to their body that we call diseases so it's not all that far-fetched that not having enough selenium in a cow causing muscular distrophy not having enough selenium in humans could potentially cause muscular distrophy and certainly in the genetically susceptible so just putting that out there if anybody works with these people um in this this patient cohort or works with pediatricians or is a pediatrician please ask that question please encourage that investigation and um you know because that that I mean how great would that be if we just s sort that out you K start developing that done and they don't have to suffer and die and have have horrible horrible lives U muscular distri is nasty it's absolutely nasty um so please ask that question and hopefully someone is able to look into that u i don't have those patience I wish I did if I did I'd be all over it but um you know we'll see see what people can do okay uh thank you Dr chaffy for uh doing this great work uh 62-year-old male two months into carnivore uh just meat eggs butter recently feeling dizzy getting up so could very well be that you're on uh blood pressure medication if you're on blood pressure medication um it could be too strong now so uh two months is about that time that you start seeing improvements in blood pressure and those sorts of things and so if you're if you're on blood pressure medication most 62 year olds are on blood pressure medication unless they're carnivore uh could very well be that you're on too much so check your blood pressure when you get those dizzy spells if it's low or normal there's your answer work with your doctor on coming down off of that um and drink more water you know could just be dehydration as well if you're not on blood pressure medication or even if you are on blood pressure medication uh dehydration can exacerbate that and cause you to get dizzy um when you when you stand up that's very common very common is just that that transient drop in your blood pressure uh that can be due to dehydration or over medication so uh that's that's probabl y what's happening okay so uh Robert thank you for the"

        "body": "tter to eat just meat sjck thank you very much for the tter to eat just meat sjck thank you very much for the Super Chat hi doc can you think of any reason why I have more fat on the right side of my body also all joints are clicking pain dysfunction on the right side PS thank you for everything I feel like you saved me well well that's very good to hear I'm really glad to hear that thank you you're very welcome I'm glad that you know my videos are helping people and I'm certainly glad that they helped you and and um you know I you I don't know I don't know what what it saved you from but I'm I'm very appreciative that that uh my advice was able to to help you with whatever your situation was um as far as the fat more fat on the right side no that's actually that's actually quite unique you know sometimes you have like a bit of asymmetry you know maybe like a love handle that's bigger than the other or something like that but if it's sort of all over the right side that's a bit that's a bit interesting um you know your your neurological system is is is completely demarcated just is a line down the middle of you and just like this is controlled by one side that's controlled by the other side so is there's some sort of like neurological sort of issue none that I've heard of um so it may just be you know how your body's reacting to things and it may not be that it's all that much different but you know may even out in the course of time as well but um uh pain and um dysfunction on the right side I mean that sort of joints clicking I mean that's sort of totally separate I would think but the pain and dysfunction you you sort of Wonder is there something neurologically happening with the left side of the brain affecting the right side of the body um again then very unlikely but you know it's it's that sort of makes you wonder if there's something going on there um but you know the joints clicking that that shouldn't be that really shouldn't be affected by anything neurological and certainly not at the level of your brain um so any sort of dysfunction it does depend on what sort of CA kind of dysfunction um where the pain is you know is that pain just down your arm is it just all over your right side of your body including your face well that's sort of concerning that it might be more of a central concern if it's just down your arm or just down your leg well that could be something more down on the spinal root level and be a bit more explained so um you know if you're having these sorts of problems it's certainly not anything to do with uh just eating meat that I can think of but you know if you're having sort of weird sort of issues and sort of you know demarcation on just the right side of the body in such a way that it's like well maybe there is something neurological going on uh people can have underlying issues that they that they need to be addressed so you know the the most you know most reasonable thing to do would be to you know go to your doctor go to your primary care physician your GP and and discuss it with them and they can do a proper history in an exam and see if they think there's any sort of neurological any sort of neurological involvement or anything else that they can think of it's you know getting it sort of deep into things in the con consultation setting uh you can get you going list a lot more information you can do a physical exam and see like okay this is what I think it is and if they think there's something concerning they can always get an MRI of your head see what's going on but you know I I would doubt that there's anything that that needs to be done but you never know so you know just go talk to your doctor and uh see what they think and uh hopefully it's just you know just something weird and that it's just settles d own on its own and goes away can Joy thank you for the"

        "body": "own on its own and goes away can Joy thank you for the own on its own and goes away can Joy thank you for the Super Chat history of APs used heprin during pregnancy um diagnosed um AO oaso Osteo maybe in 30s after compound fracture hiking so osteoporosis I would say uh after compound fracture from hiking and kickboxing calcium and vitamin D are a concern any thoughts on bone health um yeah well my thoughts are that that generally people's bone health improves and so I've seen people with osteoporosis in their late 30s 40s and elderly adults actually reverse their osteoporosis I just had a patient come in a couple weeks ago and she had osteoporosis when she started carnivore now she does not have osteoporosis it's been like eight months right and she's in that normal range for bone density and she went into her clinic and the and the osteoporosis nurse uh was super excited she got a results she said oh my God this is amazing what drug did they put you on you know what what did this and and she said nothing I'm not on any drugs and they said well how did you do this then I mean drugs have to do this nothing your body just doesn't do this your body your body can't heal uh it needs drugs and um so she said no I'm just I'm just basically just eating a lot of meat in fact I'm just only eating meat and this happened and the nurse was just like wow I've never seen that happen that's amazing so it's um it is something that I've seen again and again I had a um a lady on the podcast um Claire who had been anorexic and vegan sort of synonymous in a lot of cases um and she was oste had osteoporosis like profound osteoporosis BMI of like nine um and so you know it um it uh you know got to the point that she actually arrested in the hospital and almost died was uh uh was basically forced to eat meat after that like no you have to eat properly you're going to die and then she ended up you know just sort of surviving for a year but eating some meat but you know not all that much and then she went carnivore and now she's thriving she put back on uh all the weight she put on a lot of weight and she you know reversed her osteoporosis amazing aming amazing that your body can do that so uh just eat fatty meat um until it stops tasting good sometimes when people are deficient like she was eating 8,000 calories of ribi every day right it's more than I eat and but her body needed it her body was recovering and and repairing and growing like like a kid would right and so she needed a lot of that she needed a lot of those nutrients and so you know if you if you feel you're deficient in things like vitamin D or calcium you could try taking that I would maybe take vitamin D and K2 before I took calcium um just start eating a lot of meat you get enough calcium from that women taking calcium can actually increase your well there are studies that that have uh reported a correlation in increased cardiovascular disease um by 15% in women who take uh calcium supplements so maybe not something you want to do um and uh so yeah so just just um I would just you know just eat fatty meat and if you're deficient in vitamin D or you're deficient in calcium like sure maybe take the supplement but you know when you get up to a normal level stop um and uh vitamin D you can take vitamin D very safely to try to catch up to where you're at and then fatty meat and a bit of liver will will sort you out the rest of the way um so yeah and and resistance training resistance exercises strength training that stimulates the bones to grow and to build and put down more uh bone tissue and density the majority of bone is collagen so that's what you need you need collagen from meat and you'll get plenty of calcium from the meat that you're eating think about it this way when uh um mammals or kids they drink milk there's a lot of calcium in milk where did the mom get the calcium from their food so a lion is getting calcium from meat to make calcium rich milk for their babies right right but then those babies wean off the mother's milk onto the mother's diet which is meat right there's still kittens at that point right now they're eating meat and that's where the most the majority of the bone growth is is happening is is when um they come off and start eating uh the adult diet and so there has to be enough calcium in there it's a matter it's a matter of how how your body uses that calcium and are you eating a whole bunch of oxalates and Ates and all these other sorts of antinutrients that are going to strip out the calcium and make you need an overwhelming abundance of calcium to get the job done in the first place that's a question you have to ask so good luck with that just eat meat and be happy lift weights and you'll be healthy good luck with it uh nav thank you for the"

        "body": "be healthy good luck with it uh nav thank you for the be healthy good luck with it uh nav thank you for the super chat um I think we already did this uh that was that was a question from earlier you say say you change fat intake if you have diarrhea on a carnivore but uh the advice I usually find is weight because you're getting fat adapted um well no if you're if you're not absorbing it you're not absorbing it um so you don't necessarily need to have that um the fat adaption people mean a lot of different things by that really what fat adaption means is your body's getting used to running on ketones and getting more efficient at running on ketones it's not fat adapted as and you can absorb fat you can absorb fat that's not a problem it's just you have a limited capacity to absorb fat because the amount of bile that you have that you make and so if you are making a certain amount of bile your body's going to absorb a certain amount of fat if you need a lot more fat than that it's going to go out it's going to give you loose toools and so you don't have to do that you know eventually you you might make more bile and so you want more fat and so adjust the amount of fat that you're getting for that time um but also if you're drinking coffee or tea or artificial sweeteners or magnesium supplements or uh medications like metformin or others that can cause loose stools as well when you stop eating fiber that can shove this stuff through very quickly and cause loose stools and so that can mask that so that's not that you wouldn't reduce your fat content in that situation you would eliminate out all those other things you only reduce your fat content if you are not eating anything else eating or drinking anything else besides meat and water and then if you're so uh constipated that you are um that you are um that you are getting a bit um of over you know sort of a pseudo obstruction you get an overflow diarrhea and you get liquid stools with hard stools every now and then and that means you need a lot more fat um so yeah but I answer that also before but that 's the the quick one as well um there Kenny put down a"
