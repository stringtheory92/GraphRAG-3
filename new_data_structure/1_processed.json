    "body": "thank you so much for the very generous Super Chat uh they say Dr jaffy asking for my friend Rhonda female late 30s family line of kidney problems with a fatality I'm very sorry to hear that she caught covid now has kidney damage and doctor said plants only and meet twice a week at most will carnivore hurt or help please advise no I think it will it will definitely help um you know I mean I I don't know why that doctor is saying that I don't know why any doctor says that I think that's pretty strange that they would say that because what exactly are implants that are going to help your kidneys nothing well things that they can be nutritious implants but they come with a whole host of other things that are negative and some of those things are actually directly nephrotoxic such as oxalate meaning that they directly damage the kidneys so that's not what you want um it's probably they want her to be low protein and you want to avoid meat for that reason thinking that protein makes kidney problems worse that's completely false that's um you know that probably they just haven't actually looked at the literature on the subject this is just something that gets passed around you have to understand that that in medical school and as doctors if you've just heard something just sort of have a belief based on something your mom told you when you were six now that you're a doctor it's codified and law that's what you believe and that is what's true and a lot of a lot of doctors have that mentality which is really bad and so if they've grown up hearing that oh you have to if you eat too much protein if you eat too much meat that's bad for your kidneys you know you challenge them and say you know are there studies that show that I guarantee you they don't know any I guarantee you that this isn't coming from their learned experience or studies that they've read and research that they've come across I guarantee you that this is just a Prejudice that they've had going back years and decades and it just solidified now that they're a doctor and by gosh they're an expert and so therefore uh whatever they think is true and it's not true so a lot of people are actually improving their kidney function by going on a cornivore diet and removing all plants and people actually reversing chronic kidney disease very Advanced chronic kidney disease and um and so I would I would recommend that as well I would recommend it to anybody eating our biologically appropriate diet is is going to be beneficial it's not going to be harmful uh to Ronda or or anybody else"
