    "transcript": "higher LDL cholesterol actually corresponds with longevity you live longer if your LDL is higher it is the case that your brain runs better on ketones and you're getting rid of things and brain fog and all these other sorts of things that impede the normal functioning of your brain I don't think you necessarily need to fast unless you uh have a cancer diagnosis and then that that can be uh that can be beneficial for that there's a study out of Sweden just this past year with 44,000 people looking at the best power markers to predict living over 100 and they found [Music] okay hello everyone uh today's live is for January 11th and that's in the US and then 12th in Australia thank you everyone for joining I think that there was a bit of a mixup with the um the dates and time just because I was I was traveling and so it didn't um I I don't think you got the time zones right so uh sorry about that for everyone who sort of signed on earlier but anyway uh glad to see everyone here thank you so much for coming on um we'll start with a question here is from Aurora Mata says hello Dr chaffy how to reverse Parkinson's um what are your specific recommendations and advice on this well unfortunately I don't I don't know of any way to actually reverse Parkinson's and to make it go away um the best thing to do is is try to prevent it we don't really know the best ways do that either however there are some studies that could give shed some light on that which are some that show that higher LDL cholesterol over the course of your life is protective against things like Parkinson's as well as Alzheimer's and so you know not not buying into the whole cholesterol fraud theory of of heart disease um could help you you know we've been we've been strategically and aggressively trying to lower cholesterol through diet lifestyle and medications for the last 40 years 50 years and yet heart disease rates are going up you know some fraudulent Bad actors who want to mislead you will try to then switch the argument and say well you know cardiac related deaths or cardiovascular deaths peaked in the 60s and 70s and then started to decline after we started you know doing all these interventions and that's not what we just said we said the rates are going up so first time heart attacks are going up the prevalence and incidence is going up and so just because we are surviving them more because we have better interventions and actually a lot of people stop smoking a lot of people stop smoking in this time too and yet rates are still going up deaths have gone down rates are going up and so if cholesterol were the endol Beall cause of heart disease then the rates should go down but they don't so if you don't buy into that that could potentially be helpful in preventing could also if anything is able to help prevent something it's a potential that it could improve symptoms when you actually have the issue as well so that's something that to think about there's also a study out of I believe Denmark that looked at over something like 25 years of people who got their vas nerve re section so they they cut that off it's called vagotomy and they had a theory that lectins from plant toxins could actually track up the Vegas nerve and this has actually been shown on uh on Imaging this actually shown that can actually track up your Vegas nerve up into your brain and so they thought you know is this is this something that could damage your brain is this something that could be related to Parkinson's and they found that if in people that they cut this in over 25 years that they had a 66% reduction in their rates of parkinsonism as compared to the rest of the population so it's interesting so what does that mean that means that if you eat what you're supposed to eat and your cholesterol is what it's supposed to be you know you may be protected or it may help you in your in your Parkinson's Journey or not eating a bunch of plants with a bunch of plant toxins that are bad for your brain and neurotoxic and can track up your Vagas nerve and kill damage and damage parts of your brain that that may help as well so the brain is also made out of largely fat as well as cholesterol and so if we're talking about damage to the brain if we're talking about trying to heal the brain we talking about having the brain function as well as possible you need specific animal fats like DHA and EPA 20% of your brain is DHA so the physical structures of the brain are DHA a lot of them and a lot of the physical structures are also made out of cholesterol so I think roughly 50% % of your a of the myelination of your axons is cholesterol so if you don't have enough cholesterol this can be a problem you can get demolation or poor myelination of your neurons and then you don't you don't run properly and so you know this only comes from animal fats this only comes from meat does not come from plants no matter what anyone tells you and so that is something that you you would benefit by and then being in a state of ketosis where you have an AB of ketones because that's your brain's primary energy source for a large majority of your brain um that's going to let your brain work better and so hopefully that can help improve symptoms it will improve people's lives in many many many other ways it may help slow down progression it may even stop progression it just depends on the individual there are other factors that go on there are certainly other causes of parkinsonism most likely we don't know them all but I have seen people at least helped by going on what is our natural diet the carnivore diet a high fat animal diet meat-based diet so you're getting a lot of fat you're getting a lot of Omega-3s and you're cutting out all those other things that can harm your brain like carbohydrates like sugar like alcohol and like plant toxins we don't know all the ones that are neurotoxic because there's a million of them that we know about and so you know you know playing odds and just being safe you just avoid all of them and then then you're on safer ground you don't need any of them we know that right there's entire civilizations going back till forever that have never eaten a plant or rarely eaten a plant or couldn't eat a plant because they're in the Arctic Circle on an ice flow during an ice age and there are no plants so the idea that you have to have plants is is absurd on its face and I would argue that you don't want it so uh I I do think that a carnivore diet is I mean it's like a broken record I'm just going to tell you to eat meat but I do think that it would help um I don't have any more hard data than that um after that you just have to you just have to sort of you know try it out and hope for the best I have seen this help people my my own father included and um and I have um you know and I and it will help in so many other ways as well that even if it doesn't change the parkinsonism it will just improve their life in many dramatic ways and the parkinsonism won't be as much of a pain to deal with and so you know it's always going to be a benefit anyway so hopefully that helps Rogue K9 uh says hello Dr cha you can a carnivore diet cure reactive hypoglycemia thanks uh yeah well it it it does really because it it normalizes your blood sugar it normalizes your insulin and so you're you you will maintain a very low blood sugar level or low insulin level and you'll make all the blood sugar and glycogen that you need and that will maintain a very very steady solid state of um of your glucose levels if you're on medication if you're taking insulin obviously this is a bit more of a balancing act but if if you don't have any of those sorts of issues then no you won't get you won't get reactive hypoglycemia reactive hypoglycemia means that you take in carbohydrates or some other sort of thing I mean and and artificial sweeteners um have actually you know been shown in some studies to cause reactive hypoglycemia and other ones you know suggest that they don't but there are people who do get that so it's a potential it's a possibility where you get a rise in your blood sugar if you're taking in carbohydrates or sugar you have a corresponding rise in your insulin which stays up because there's a longer it's a much longer halflife on insulin and that drives the insulin down your body treats this as a toxicity you have four grams of glucose in your body at any given time and as little as five grams of glucose is is a toxic dose and can eventually be a lethal dose over time and your body responds to it as a toxin by trying to detox it right raises insulin gets that down below four gr and that's and then it goes too low now it goes lower than you want and that's reactive hypoglycemia so if you just don't e carbohydrates in the first place you don't take in artificial sweeteners you you're you're just stepped out of that whole that whole scenario so you won't you won't get that no RB thank you very much for the generous Super Chat that's very kind of you um RB says hello Dr chaffy I'm N9 months carnivore and recently recently uh in the past two weeks my fingers go numb when I hold my phone and other stuff above chest level even for just a minute um yeah that's interesting I I don't think that that's anything to do with a carnivore di generally that if you're you know if if it's a specific position that you're holding your phone and it's sort of it's reproducible that's generally you're just something's happening you're sort of pinching on it could be that you know this this is new and you've done this before and you've lost weight during this time that now the the nerves in your arm are just a bit more exposed and just happens to be how you're holding it just sort of putting a bit of pressure on that nerve that would be my guess um I can't think of anything to do with the cornival D apart from weight loss expose you know making the the nerve more accessible um that would that would predispose you to do that uh the main thing would be you know try to hold your phone in a different position try to hold it in a different way um the you know the things that you would you would expect to get neuropathy from if it was an ongoing neuropathy you would expect it to be more or less constant it wouldn't be reproducible due to position if you're if it's reproducible due to position it's it's generally down to you know physical disruption where you're putting pressure UND pressure on the nerves and so that sounds like what that's going on you're doing a similar motion you're holding your hand in a similar way and that's giving a similar response and when you don't do that it it goes away so that that would be my uh that would be what I would expect to be most likely in that case I mean there are things you know that you can get you know disruption of your B vitamins and things like that you can take you know if someone's taking a lot of different B vitamins or a specific B vitamin that can give a relative deficit and other B vitamins which can can elicit um uh a neuropathy because you you need your B vitamins in balance and so if you're getting out of balance one is way out of balance the other ones are relatively low and now that it acts like they're low and so but that's not what's Happening Here U because that would be a a constant um issue that you would have whereas this is a reproducible issue with the same positional um you with the same putting your hand in the same position the the B vitamins as well you wouldn't expect that certainly not from a carnivore diet because a carnivore diet has a has a has a very balanced set profile of of B vitamin so it's not like I mean if you were taking a you know specific B vitamin you know and just just that B vitamin you could you could potentially get a problem but you know this is certainly not in that in your question where you've mentioned that if you are taking specific supplements and vitamins you could always try stopping those um you will generally get everything you need just for meat you know it's not we're not eating wild meat anymore it's not as nutritious as it used to be or as as grass-fed or Wild game or uh you regeneratively raised animals uh but it's really damn good and almost everybody will be able to get everything they need just from skeletal muscle meat from you know just the the normal Safeway beef and if it's not enough you add in a bit of liver you add in a bit of organs and that's that's the only supplement that that we need as carnivores is just uh is just the bit of the organs and and that should cover it and that's a perfect balance of all the B's and all the vitamins and everything like that that you need so um good luck with that I I would expect that that's just more of a positional thing as opposed to any sort of problems um that you're having with you know like a medical issue uh I am darit thank you very much for the Super Chat uh thank you so much um for uh I'm assuming ell Danos syndrome bringing um the I'm assuming the L zos um PDF to my doctor um in what looks like probably March 14th um I hope I'm reading that right well it if if it's if it's not I apologize but the you know ERS Danos that's just something that um is is um seems to be affected and benefit well everything's affected and benefited by your your your nutrition optimal nutrition but um it's something that you we think is just yeah um that we think is um just genetic you know it's just a just a collagen issue and you don't make collagen properly and therefore you don't have you don't have con you know proper connective tissue you get hypermobility and then um you know and that's just it that's your life but we've been seeing more and more people with hypermobility and Elder St syndrome that that seem to improve not even full carnivore but just just closer and then eating a lot more meat and getting rid of carbs for some reason you know carbs seem to disrupt um you know the proper collagen production as well I have I've theory on this you know is just that you know just like with vitamin C you know you don't if you're getting enough collagen or you're getting enough precursors to collagen by eating collagen and you don't need to hydrolyze Proline and lysine you have enough hydroline and hydroly available you can make proper um collagen you know scurvy is a connective tissue disorder right ERS Danos is a connective tissue disorder so you're not making collagen properly okay well just like with scurvy if you take in enough of proper aminos and proteins you don't need the vitamin C to make it denovo and could that be the same with ell stos you know if you're tasked with making your own collagen it's not going to work too well but if you don't have to then then it comes across uh you as normal could be you know that that seems to fit the The observed phenomena anyway but at the end of the day you eat more meat and you stop eating everything else largely it seems to improve and I have I have three patients that I've seen in my clinic who all have um hypermobility ERS downlo syndrome normally getting a lot of joint dislocations and and other sorts of symptoms pain and um and it and it helps it helps significantly and the more the closer they they get to you know just eating meat and water and nothing else the better their symptoms the better they do as well and um so yeah so that's great hopefully your doctor uh hopefully your doctor you know listens and thinks about it because U you know the more the more clinicians we get that are treating this that understand this and they treat them properly you know the sooner this goes away or becomes much less of an issue hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own questions please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest of the Q&A promo Mike Primal Mike uh has a question how is the thyroid function different on Carnivore versus sad diet should the thyroid blood markers be any different well you know it's it's going to be multifactoral but you're you're going to get rid of a lot of a lot of barriers in the way of of normal thyroid function and and so this this is going to open up um this is going to open up you know just normal functioning so what we see is we see people with with borderline low or or marketly low thyroid function improve and so their TSH comes down their um fre3 fre4 goes up their reverse T3 goes down they get symptom resolution things like that or at least Improvement um there are many many many different causes of thyroid dysfunction so it's it's hard to sort of say you know just a just a you know sort of oneid fits-all answer to that but even in the autoimmune side of things like Hashimoto or even Graves disease it simply reduces the the auto antibodies right and so you stop damaging your thyroid and so people with Graves disease and I have a couple patients with Graves disease that improve on uh a carnivore diet there you and and Hashimoto I mean I don't even know probably close to a 100 patients at our Clinic with Hashimoto is a is a wildly underdiagnosed um disease and the the reason that we pick it up more is because we don't just look at the TSH like oh yeah it's under four so that's fine under four is not fine uh under two is fine under 1.5 is a lot better and so we catch things a bit earlier and so we look at this and and and other sort of markers in the thyroid and say okay well look this is a little off you're symptomatic and you know not markedly so but there's like you know there's there's definitely symptoms there why is your thyroid a little off you check your antibodies lo and behold you have Hashimoto's antibodies it is wildly underdiagnosed and and that's because no one diagnoses it or even looks for it until it's a it's a bloody catastrophe and their TSA H is 13 and you know they barely have any thyroid function and then they go oh okay well what could be causing let's check Hashimoto well well you know it's in the thousands your antibodies are in the thousands um that's that's you know that's a little late to pick that up you know there were signs before that generally those people have been going to their doctor for the last several years saying hey I feel like crap I feel like crap I feel like crap oh but your thyroid is is fine you know it's not fine it's just we're looking at these these reference ranges as if they were indicative of good health instead of indicative of of the average of a sick population so those improve uh and I think what you're asking is if if thyroid function Goes Down And if that's okay I generally see it go up I've have seen in a few isolated cases that um some of the thyroid hormone like free T4 3t3 over time will come down a bit but also the TSH comes down a bit which means the brain's happy with what's going on and the and the reverse T3 comes down as well so the ratio between free T3 and reverse T3 is good and is improving even though the fre T3 actually came down a bit and the free T4 actually came down a bit but the TSH came down a significant amount so that sort of you know that sort of would would support um Professor Steve finny's idea that when you're in a state of ketosis you don't need as much thyroid hormone as you would in in a normal state of of non- ketosis you know of of you know on a standard American diet you need an abundance of thyroid hormone just to get the same job done and um but you know I I honestly see that occasionally but a lot of times I just see all of those things improved the 3 T4 freet T3 reverse T3 improving and TSH improving sometimes I see the TSH go down you know drop below two I I I literally had a patient yesterday who had you know TSH of you know 4.54 3.5 and then all of a sudden it went down boom 1.9 but the free T4 and free T3 you know dropped by you know 02 or something like that very small amount um but interesting you know it was it did go down and the TSH dropped in half right so the so the body was happy with that and so that's sometimes that what you can see so you have to sort of be a bit more um you know in tune with things and and look a little closer there's there's a number of different markers uh that that signify thyroid health and also just how you feel you are your symptoms improving you know do you have more energy through skin and hair better there all sorts of things that that can improve and if that's the case and you're symptomatically improving and you know you're seeing these other sort of signs that it's like okay well that number went down but you know these other ones improved interesting you know then then overall you're saying okay things are getting better so it's it's largely the same so the thyroid blood markers you know largely will improve there are some some cases where you'll see that sort of example where the the you know raw numbers like the free T4 fre T3 might go down a bit but the TSH goes down as well so it's interesting so it's it's likely in that case that the body's actually doing exactly what Professor finny says which is not needing as much thyroid hormone and and your body's working just fine Annabelle the happy carnivore thank you very much for the Super Chat thank you Dr chaffy for everything you do well thank you I appreciate that and hopefully that this is helpful you know it's um you know I do try to make all my videos available and I I want people just to have access to them and and get helped by them and and these you know question and answer things um are fun to do and and keeps me on my toes as well and and sometimes presents me with with new scenarios and and issues and situations that you know I wasn't necessarily aware of and it makes me think about it which is always good as well so hopefully people find this useful and yeah we just got to keep moving you know this is this is a Grassroots movement that is actually catching you know C some traction you know and we're getting you know more mainstream attention even if it's just to call us crazy but not as many are calling crazy you know the Daily Mail for some reason is picking up a number of carnivore success stories they called me crazy they say look at this what this this crazy doctors saying on 60 Minutes Australia uh that's wild and then after that there were a number of people that went on it and and we're like hey look you know I improved my life this went all better and it was actually a positive piece which is very interesting so you know we're we're seeing more of that and so just keep doing what you're doing there's more and more evidence every day that what we're doing is correct and um more and more people are improving their lives we're not getting swaths of people saying wow this this ruined my health by any stretch of the imagination the only people that I've seen that say well you know it didn't work for me um didn't say wow it hurt my health and I was damaged they said yeah you know I I you know carnivore didn't work for me that's really a shame because you know I couldn't lose weight however you know my autoimmune issues got better I came off my medications my blood pressure was better I slept better I had better energy this was better that was better and to me that sounds like it was working really really well it just wasn't the you know working in the way that second that you wanted to which was focused on weight loss which was the main reason some people you know do come to this and you know it it is the case that some it takes a little longer for some people to lose weight and there there's a lot of hormonal reasons and physiological reasons metabolic reasons for that and sometimes you know those things need to heal and correct before you're going to be able to lose lose much weight but your health is improving and that's the main thing and so if you stay on it and you just say hey look my health is getting better I'm feeling better I'm going to trust the process and just just see this through like Kelly Hogan did where she actually gained weight for six months and then she was like no these people are telling me they've been doing this for 20 years know some 50 years and this is what they see you know you don't necessarily lose weight right away a lot of people do but not everybody and so your body has to heal your hormones have to your leptin has to come down some people have massively elevated leptin it is extremely hard to lose weight by any measure by any means to uh if you have elevated like massively elevated leptin when that leptin comes down which it will on a carnivore diet you start losing weight and she did and so she stuck with it she said I'm just going to trust her process and just keep going and what do you know she lost a bunch of weight she kept it off she's very very healthy so stick with it and focus on your health DWP D wbp qf PG thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat I don't know if that is short for something or if that's just um just for fun but uh they say uh Hey Dr chaffy I've been carnivore since June uh 2023 in 2014 I suffered a depression skull fracture subdural hematoma and had a craniotomy very sorry to hear that that sounds um awful how capable is a brain of healing from uh that kind of trauma um and is that why my appetite is still massive that's a very good question you know the the literature on this um you know says that if you if you go on a ketogenic diet this you know early on this will this will improve recovery from a traumatic brain injury um I don't think they've had any studies on uh you know long distant traumatic brain injuries but we do have studies on traumatic brain injuries recovering from them in the acute phase and that shows Improvement that shows marked improvement on a ketogenic diet which makes sense your brain needs fat it needs ketones those ketones run your brain there optimal energy for your brain while it's healing this clearly what you want and then those ketones cross a blood brain barrier reconstitute into fatty acids and help rebuild the physical structures of your brain and you have enough cholesterol on Omega-3s presumably and hopefully to help rebuild the physical structures of your brain we also have studies in concussion that if you are in ketosis at the point of concussion that this massively reduces the amount of inflammation and damage that the concussion confers on your brain you want High ketones uh this helps reduce inflammation this helps obviously heal the brain um you know speaking with Dr Paul Mason who's who's the expert in this he said that you know it's not enough to go start a ketogenic diet once you have the concussion because it can take a couple days before you get into you know true ketos and the first 48 hour period is the most important part so you could take exogenous ketones but you'd have to take them sort of every two hours on the hour and that's very difficult to do you know sort of after 48 Hours you know might not be helpful but you know it's worth look if I was in that situation and I wasn't in ketosis and I had a a big concussion you know and I had access to I mean Amazon's not going to get the ketos to you um quick enough so you'd have to have them on hand anyway but you know if you had them on hand and you just I would just might as well you know um and do the best you can take take as take these things um when you can you know and at least it might it might mitigate things might be better than than nothing but you know we we have these sorts of studies and creatine creatine has been shown to help recover from brain injuries as well especially in the postconcussion phase post-traumatic brain injury phase and the in the subsequent weeks and months um high does creatine I think it was I believe in this study and people should should look this up but I believe it was 60 grams of creatine a day for like five days or something like that don't quote me on that that's not a prescription it's just what my memory is of the study um that um that Dr Mason told me about uh was uh was very beneficial you know and this this really helped helped the brain creatine in general good for the brain at all times and you know red meat especially has a lot of creatine so you know if you're eating just red meat all day you're going to get about five grams of creatine a day which is you know the the normal dose people take uh when they're bodybuilding so these are all in the acute phase and so you know is that going to help people after the fact well the the traditional teaching is no that after about 2 years the amount you your brain is going to heal as much as it's going to heal but that is not what I've seen I have seen people with long-standing brain injuries neurological injuries spinal cord injuries make dramatic improvements decades after their injury you know a very good example is uh my friend Dave Mack who came on my podcast he had a stroke 30 years ago and he did keto he did Atkins he did all these sorts of things and he's and he still had right-sided weakness and significant balance issues very difficult for him to go up and downstairs he had to he had to cling onto the rail with his left hand which was his good hand and sort of work his way up the stairs for 30 years and then he went carnivore and I think it was like in two months his his wife sort of mentioned to him he like hey you know you're not you're not limping you're walking normally and he's like wait what really you know you know film me and she filmed on the camera and he he just like yeah I'm walking normal like this is crazy and now he can he said he's he's running up and downstairs so that's 30 years after a subarachnoid hemorrhage which which damaged his his brain and gave him right-sided weakness persistent right-sided weakness in his arm and leg um so that's pretty amazing I've seen people with other neurological issues I mean you know radiculopathy pain and weakness um uh that that have been going on for you know I mean go people go to my uh video on chronic pain and fibromyalgia look in the comments there are hundreds of people there that have improved their their chronic pain sciatica radiculopathy fibromyalgia after you know a decade of being on opiates they say there like after a month on Carnivore I came off my opiates for the first time in 12 years that was one of the comments there and so you know this this seems to make a massive Improvement and especially in neurological recovery I you know I don't know the mechanism yet I don't know exactly what's going on apart from you're getting ketones into the brain you're getting ketones into the nervous system and you know your brain and nervous system like that you're getting fat and cholesterol in there and it's it's just allowing your metabolism and body to work normally and affect some changes so I I can't say that this is going to help you I would be very hopeful that it would I've certainly seen it help other people in traumatic ways cystic um cerebral paly patients have come to me and told me that their um symptoms have improved that their spasticity they have very locked up tight um muscles because you you have this lesion in the brain and and the definition of cerebral paly is a stable lesion of generally unknown ideology that does not change it's there from birth and it doesn't change you're born with it it's never going to get better it's never going to get worse it's just there right so presumably there's some sort of injury in utero or during delivery that just damaged a bit of brain that just wasn't able to recover and yet people are recovering as adults with cereal policy um not completely but you know it's improving their spasticity it's improving that so if you have an upper upper uh motor neuron lesion you know you know you so the the motor control motor cortex of the brain if that part is damaged you get really stiff muscles right for the for the muscles that they control you get a lower motor you cut the peripheral nerve or something like that it's flaccid paralysis so you get paralysis within the permon neuron Legion right so that's what they get so they're very tight and it can be painful and it's not comfortable it's not it's not nice and so they have to get like botox injections in those muscles and force them to relax and yet just going on a carnivore diet seem to help these individuals with that spasticity so I I'm just not going to Discount anything I'm not going to say Ad all that's never going to work because frankly I've just seen so many things that you wouldn't expect to work work or at least improve um I can't say that this is going to improve dramatically I can't say it's going to improve at all but I hope that it does and I've seen other people improve like Dave Mack who had a stroke 30 years ago and had weakness for 30 years and is improved um you know I think from what he was telling me there is still some weakness there but not not so as you notice it he's he's completely functional whereas he wasn't before and so hopefully this helps you it certainly helps in the acute phase and apparently it helps in um the the long the long distant postacute phase as well so hopefully it does for you and I and uh well please let me know I mean it's um it would be great to see how what your experiences with it is and and um you know that that can help guide you know other people and and give you know better advice you know the more people that come forward and say hey this was my experience good or bad or neutral um you know the more information that we have and and the better we can advise other people asking the same question in the future but again like everything else it's going to improve your life in a thousand other ways anyway and so even if it doesn't improve those specific neurological symptoms it will be well worth doing doing it and and I hope it is so good luck with that and and just so everybody knows I again have work today so I've got uh 45 minutes before I have to go um and I'll have to have to make a break at that point but I will get to as many questions as I can in those 45 [Music] minutes Isaac udson thank you very much for the Super Chat uh what role does nutrition play in adult intelligence levels is it possible to heal your brain and raise IQ with a proper human diet so in a well look we have no data on this that I'm aware of but it um you know is is it is the case that your brain runs better on ketones and you're taking getting rid of things and brain fog and all these other sorts of things that um that impede the normal functioning of your brain and so I certainly find myself much more clear of thought much more calm and uh and that's very helpful in a lot of ways and so obviously it's best to to start this in utero preconception uh Mother's diet you know being optimal is going to optimize their baby and being you know carnivore during pregnancy breastfeeding and then the rest of the kids's life is going to optimize that child's life and development including their brain you we know that pre agriculture the brain average brain size was 11% larger in adult males and 177% larger in adult females and so that was immediate that wasn't hundreds or thousands of years that was immediate and that's persistent until today so you know that's developmental that's nutritional so that makes a massive difference obviously and that is also you know even though you're an adult and you don't have you're not not developing and growing your brain growing more bigger larger you know brain cells and loes and things like that it is the case that you are going you can optimize its function increase the number of connections the more connections a neuron has the more functional it is the more it influences and the more connections are inherent in your brain the better your brain works and so yes it is it is possible that you could increase your IQ you can increase the functionality of your brain and nervous system and we've seen that people improve their neurology and so if you're if you're you know playing the piano or the violin or or playing you know Sports and rugby and darts and all these sorts of things that take fine motor control or or uh you know large motor control it's it's it can be improved and you know your brain can be improved in its functionality uh even if it doesn't improve in its size so there's no actual studies that I know of because I mean I don't think anyone's really asked that question and tried to test it but it would be interesting wouldn't it you you get you know 100 people a thousand people if you could um do an IQ test and then put them on Carnivore diet for a year test their IQ at the end of it I mean there's going to be so many other factors as well you don't know but if you sort of randomize and controller and had enough people you could get some good information but that would be interesting my my guess would be yes you know just from a from a mechanistic point of view you're going to make more connections you're going to optimize your brain in a lot of ways which will make you in inherently more intelligent and so uh yes I think that's the case and also you're not doing things to your body that can detract from it you know there's Oxford study in 2008 that showed that vegans after five years shrink their brain by 5% brain volume okay oh this is so great so you're literally shrinking your brain and you know we see this in neurosurgery as well that people's spinal cords atrophy and get thinned out because of the demolation from uh their their um poor horrible miserable diet and um and so you know you're not doing that you know so you're not going to have that atrophy you're not going to have that damage you're you're avoiding the these various causes that um you know can damage someone's brain and neurology if they go on a on a vegan plant-based horrible miserable diet so uh it'll stop things from damaging your brain just taking off that anchor is always going to be a good thing and then you know adding adding further development is going to improve it as well so I would I would guess yes on that but you we don't have studies that I know of hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want a nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnival bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys uh Sixt time thank you very much for the Super Chat whole beef loin would like more info on how long to age in a package before opening and cutting into staks and roasts opening carve right away or better to delay thanks for all you do well it depends you know if you if you leave it in the package and it's sealed it's not broken that seal is not broken the sort of vacuum sealed thing on the loin it it is called wet aging and so the enzymes just start breaking you know the cells down from the inside and I guess pre-digested to a minor extent you know it's not like soupy by the time you get it out of there but that's called wet aging and so you go to these really nice steak houses and they say you know this steak was 30-day wet ageed and 30-day dry age and it's delicious that's the wet aging part of that and then you know you know leave it you know in as much a 30 day I've left it I've left beef as much as six weeks before don't try it with pork I tried that with a pork shoulder once it's left for a couple of weeks it was ghastly when that that thing was opened up and um so yeah so so can't do that with pork but or at least I couldn't at least that one didn't work um but with with beef it it works just fine and um you know might be might be better to maybe just do about the four- week Mark um and I've done it as much as six weeks and that that was fine for me I probably wouldn't wouldn't uh want to do it more than that I'd be a bit nervous about that but uh uh you do it as much as you want leave it for a couple weeks it's going to be more tender the thought is is that wet aging makes it more tender and dry aging makes it more flavorful and I certainly find that and so when I when I wet age it'll be just a nicer texture and consistency and then I cut it up into big old steaks put it on drying racks on a on a wire rack on a cooking sheet in the refrigerator all of this is in the refrigerator by the way you know you don't you don't have to freeze it but you do have to refrigerate it and um and so I have that in there and it just dries out it just sort of dehydrates it a bit dries it out a bit and it concentrates that flavor you know gives get rid of some of this excess water that you don't really need stops it from browning properly and it gets a nice crispy brown crust it gets Browns it much better tastes much better it's much more concentrated flavor if you want to put if you use salt I don't really use salt anymore but if you do you just you like you put the amount of salt on that piece of meat that you would want on that size of meat everyone's different tastes great that so salt just soaks in through the meat and it's it's delicious so um yeah so you don't have to do it at all you can open up right away but if you do wait a couple weeks it actually does taste better so I buy it sort of in bulk so I'll get like three of these big loins at a time and I'll you know open one up and put that into stakes and then the others are just resting and then it takes you know 10 days or so to get through that big loin uh if it's just me and then open up the next one and then the next one you know so it ends up being about you know 30 days or so by the time I open the last packet potentially and uh and taste great so yeah that's that's something you can do Mona shabir thank you very much for the Super Chat I've been diagnosed with gliosis and keala in my gyrus recti have you had experience with this condition does line diet help uh yes that is something I've um you know I we have had um patients uh with that sort of issue in the past I haven't seen anybody on a carnivore diet with it but you know the same sort of principles apply to any sort of neurological recovery which is you want the proper nutrition which is ketones for your brain and you want to be able to have a lot of fat and cholesterol available to help heal your brain uh there's different causes for you know different things and there can be many causes for the same thing and so it just depends on that I I don't know in particular I Haven seen someone with your condition actually try a carnivore diet unfortunately but I would expect things to get better in other ways obviously and I've seen a lot of neurological recovery and Improvement and at least you're putting yourself in a position you in with your your best foot forward for any sort of healing that your body might be able to do you know you're giving your body the proper nutrition you're putting in the proper metabolic state with ketones as opposed to glucose which it doesn't work as well on and you will take away some of the the roadblocks and barriers to your brain healing and recovering so I you know like the traumatic brain injury question early I would I would hope that at this point that it would help um but I haven't seen anyone in that you know particularly with with gliosis and a cal malatia try a carnivore diet as of yet so I can't really give you even anecdotal um sort of Clues but mechanistically this is something that improves the brain in neurology anyway and will improve your health in a lot of other ways as well and I hope that that helps and please do uh let me know let us know how that goes if you do indeed try a line diet or a cornivore diet uh and uh and if it helps or if it doesn't help it's good to know it's good to know what um you know what this can can help with so good luck with that younglo teret tarot I'd say thank you for the Super Chat hey Doc jumped right into strip carnivore pretty quick got a huge and Troublesome keto rash two months in it should go away but my body went into great shock and stress because of it what to do uh well I'm very sorry to hear that that's that's that's um you know that's not fun you know speaking to a dermatologist in Canada who reached out to me um actually one of these lives um he he thought that these sort of Keto rashes were actually just from releasing you know builtup toxins that are in the adapost tissue and the fat tissue and so when people lose weight they sort of release these these fat soluble toxins that our body sort of sequestered in our fat to S keep it out of our general circulation and systemic um circulation and that that obviously when you're releasing these toxins they have these these sorts of effect your body needs to detoxify them and get rid of them and so yes it should be temporary it should go away um the other issue is you know like oxalate dumping that's the that's an idea as well that can cause manifestation in any organ um and uh but that too you know should pass you know if it if it were just getting worse and worse and worse you know uh Sally Norton um has has set out a protocol where if you add in a people think oh take high dose oxalates and that that don't do that low oxalate a little bit of oxalate like 50 milligrams 100 milligrams of oxalates and that will sort of stop it from dumping and releasing all these oxalates to such a large degree that's the idea and so you don't want massively a massive ingestion of of oxalates you want a small tiny little bit of oxalates and that sort of slows down your body's dumping of the oxalates if you are dumping oxalates and you have high oxalates as a result last thing you want to do is take in high oxalates and then you just have the same problem maybe it stops you from dumping the oxalates but your oxalates are still up and high you know because you just introduced them through your diet so um hopefully that goes away if it is you know from you know just the stored little toxins that that will just take time to work out and uh hopefully that it stops being as as horrible and I mean if you're going into shock I mean that uh s true shock is you know dropping your blood pressure because you can't you can't peruse your your tissue uh or you know to the point that you can't peruse your tissue so hopefully that's not the shock that you're talking about but stress certainly and being upset by it is very understandable I'm sorry to hear that hopefully that settles down hopefully that improves and hopefully that doesn't um last too much longer if it keeps going keeps going keeps going keeps going maybe think about you know oxalates and doing like a very low oxalate sort of tea or something like that uh maybe but you can take a look at Sally Norton's work for more on that but hopefully this is just like you say just a bit of a keto rash um that that would be just from dumping these sort of toxins that will just clear itself up and go away on its own and that seems to be what a lot of people experience is they get these weird rashes weird symptoms weird joint pain and it goes away and it doesn't come back which is which is ideal Apple Core thank you very much for the Super Chat carnivore diet a few months male 47 5 fo8 150 PBS about 10% body fat very good shape my lipid panel came back with HDL 100 triglycerides 89 LDL uh 515 the rest of my blood work was good thoughts on the LDL why I think that's good too I don't don't think LDL is a problem I don't think LDL is has ever been the uh culprit in heart disease that was a fraud perpetrated by the sugar companies and that's a hard fact we know that that's in the published in the Journal of American Medical Association in 2016 their own memos their own words their own documents stating how it was a fraud and how they paid off various professors from Harvard and elsewhere to falsify data and publish fraudulent studies to make it appear as if cholesterol caus disease when in their opinion it was more likely sugar and then to exonerate Sugar and say that it was safe because they had to oh we have to protect our product I mean that's just evil you know that's just ridiculous ridiculously evil  and so I don't know the best you know way to to to temper against that you know they weren't supposed to um you know make these claims as independent researchers you know they were being paid by the sugar companies and they were supposed to disclose that that's illegal not to do that and so um you know but they they did and it wasn't until gosh you know nearly 50 years later that we found that out so it was just you know so they got away with it bastards and so you know we just have to remember that and just you know just don't don't trust any of these so um your track RS are great your HDL is great um there there are studies showing with what 11 million people that higher LDL cholesterol actually you know corresponds with longevity you live longer if your LDL is higher there's a study out of Sweden just this past year um with 44,000 uh people showing uh looking at the the biomark the best biomarkers to predict living over 100 and they found the best biomarkers to predict if you were going to live over 100 low insulin low fasting insulin High total cholesterol so what the hell are we doing here um I don't think that that's a problem problem I I I long for the day that uh we just just stop even asking and worrying about cholesterol I never test cholesterol unless someone specifically ask for it I think it's a waste of time um there are useful things that you can find from that you know the LDL being low is not one of them you know except for the fact that it predisposes you to infectious disease death from cancer and shorter lifespan so that's bad you know don't want that um I don't think that it's it's um a positive thing to get your LDL cholesterol down artificial I mean you're just forcing your body like your physiology is is putting your LDL up when you go when you just don't eat for three days your LDL will go up exactly the same amount as you do there it's it's a metabolic State change and when you exercise your LDL changes when you have sex your LDL changes you know when you fast or when you eat you know if you fast for 10 hours as opposed to 12 hours your LDL is going to be different if you fast for 16 hours is going to be higher than it would be at 12 hours or 10 hours this is stupid you know like we are not we are we are going out of our way to ignore what LDL is actually doing which is transporting and carrying fat energy to your liver and your body for an actual function and you know the longer you fast the longer you don't eat carbohydrates the more fat is going to be produced the more uh you know the more Ketone fat energy is going to be mobilized Tak to your liver to you know go through glucano Genesis and make blood sugar and glycogen and you know so the more you're going to need you know so you eat carbohydrates your liver doesn't need to make carbohydrates in fact it's doing everything it can to desperately lower your carbohydrates you stop eating carbohydrates well your body starts making carbohydrates your body's supposed to make carbohydrates that's its normal Natural State that's a normal natural state of nearly all life on Earth and so you need to mobilize your energy from your fat to your liver what carries fat to your liver is your LDL it's a carrier molecule that's it it does not cause heart disease period it never did it it never did the studies that said that were fraudulent you look back at their own data it doesn't even show a correlation between higher cholesterol higher LDL cholesterol in fact some of them showed an inverse correlation with it so I don't I just don't worry about it you know and um you know I would I would encourage you to look up um you know Dave Felman and um and um you know Dave felman's work on the lean mass hyperresponders and um you know he's been doing a lot of work with um you know Dr Nick norwitz who's you know PhD um out of Oxford he's he's completing his MD at Harvard at the moment and he's involved in a lot of This research because he he spotted the too they all Spott the more and more people are spotting that this is  and they're putting out a lot of you know great information and studies so look up the lean mass hyper responder uh trials that data that have just been published you're you're in that category you know and you're sort you're you a lean fit uh person who um you know has this big spike in their LDL mine I mine is probably similar couldn't care less my my HDL is triple my triglycerides and I feel great and I you know I'm I'm not having any sort of medical issues as a result of this I've been doing this for six years now and I did for five years in my early 20s when I had never been in better shape never been um able to to perform as well athletically or intellectually um or physically so it's just um it's just a con it's just a bloody con and it needs to go away Annabella the happy carnivore thank you very much for the Super Chat my butchers gave me two kilos of Parson's noses the hell is that I feel I've gotten the next level carnivore do you think that if I ate only Parson's noses that that it would um that it would a fat fast I don't I don't maybe be a fat fast um I don't know what a Parson's nose is is that the nose of some sort of animal named a Parson I don't I don't know um but that is um creepy as hell I don't know I'm sure it's good though like it may be very fatty I don't know you look if it's if it's a part of an animal's body that we would normally eat and doesn't have a poison Sack or something like that then I think it's fine you know as long as it's got enough you know sort of you know fat and and and you know protein and and nutrients and things like that um uh Pop's nose Parson's nose or Sultan's nose is the fleshy protuberance at the rear end of a bird ah okay usually a chicken duck turkey in a culinary ah gotcha okay yeah that's what the little fatty stump that tail feathers come off gotcha um super weird never heard that before okay um yeah a lot of fat there um you know if you want to do a fat fast I mean you can you just do it with butter you could do it with that um you know I I I don't I don't necessarily recommend people fast at all I don't I don't know that you have to or need to if you want to you know that that probably would work just fine it is very fatty and there's really not much meat in there um so yeah so if you wanted to do a sort of a fat fast that could could probably uh be fine um but I don't think you necessarily need to fast unless you uh have a cancer diagnosis and then that that can be uh that can be beneficial for that but uh I don't I don't know that um uh but yeah it would be fine but if you wanted to you you certainly could I don't I don't fast myself I don't think that's necessary unless you you are a um you know then you specific medical conditions like like cancer that can be beneficial okay we're sort of probably let me see here how many more questions we have I think we've got probably enough to get through in the next 20 minutes before I have to go so why don't we um not do any more Super chats everyone I'll try to get through these ones and um and then we'll go from there um so cyber Goose thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy for how long does it take uh the body to reach normal levels uh statin-free body after quitting statins I stopped taking statins 5 days ago thanks a lot oh that's a good question I mean it goes by the halflife you know if you're if you're taking a Statin every single day presumably you know you build up to you know you build up to um your your normal serum levels that you want after five uh Half-Life cycles and so you have to take these things at certain intervals in order to build that up and so you know it should be you know you should be fairly well out of this um you know have that s fairly well out of you after you know you know five days or so a few days week or something like that be fairly soon anyway I don't know the exact halflife on on statins and exactly how long it would take but you know any sort of medication you take daily would have you know a shorter halflife that would get out of your system in in a number of days so that should be that should be uh you should pretty much be there at this point yeah Louise Kelly um L actually went to medical school with someone named Lis Kelly doubt this is that person though been on Carnivore now for 42 days I'm 6 yeah definitely not definitely not the Louis Kelly went to school which she wasn't in her 60s um or in her 50s at that time um been on Carnivore uh now for 42 days I'm 69 with chronic kidney disease um 3B type 2 diabetes heart bypass and heart problems my sugar was great but have a kidney infection and now sugar has gone up why um well that's a good question um you know depends on your infection I mean I I it that's a good question [Music] um I I don't know exactly why your your sugar levels would go up with um your kidney infection unless it's just you know your body's trying to you know just mobilize more energy to sort of fight the infection I mean generally the bacterial infections do better with um you know higher blood sugar so that's not great um type two diabetes you know if you're on medication it could just be that some medication that you're on for the infection is interrupting your diabetes or interrupting your uh your diabetes medication if you were put on steroids that would definitely make your blood sugar go up um you know but if you had you know a lot of you know inflammation in the kidneys and they wanted to sort of preserve that you know sort of a tricky situation getting some of steroids in in the context of an infection but it is done sometimes um but I don't I don't know if they would do that for a kidney infection so could be medication related could be medication that you're on could be medication that you've been put on that can derange your your blood sugar um or interacting with your um with your previous you know your diabetes medication I wouldn't worry about it tooo much you know this is something that is is a short-term acute issue so you know whatever's happening should should get hopefully resolved kidney infections are are trouble and so you know you need to you know treat that aggressively you know with the help of your doctors and um you know uh kidney infections you know pontis is is one step away one short step away from sepsis you know it's it's a it's a big deal you need to be on top of this uh once that's done you know your your blood sugar and everything like that should go back to normal if this is medication related or infection related uh it'll it'll go away once that infection goes away once that medication goes away so I wouldn't worry too much about that it's not it's not the end of the world if if your blood sugar goes up a little bit you know if it's some sort of medication issue and something that that some sort of interference that you can sort of stop great but you know if you need to be on certain medication that medication is causing your blood sugar to go up I would just listen to your doctors and and clear this kidney infection then go back to doing what you were doing before it'll your blood sugar will get back to normal things will get back to normal it'll be fine absolutely relative thank you for the Super Chat I am the one who had headaches and uh blamed on chewing your advice on SBG s butter gal to watch my being hydrated helped uh very good thank you down 75 pounds in 11 months uh uh female 52 that's awesome really really really great job um you know probably uh some of the people that that haven't had dramatic weight loss uh early on you know can get frustrated seeing that but just know that it it can happen it does happen and So eventually it'll it'll it'll get there your body just takes a long time to heal and you'll get there and you know uh really well done um on on the weight loss and the health improvements and I'm glad that that advice helped agk thank you for the Super Chat is it safe for me to do the carnivore diet if I have phemia minor it's a blood disorder I am worried about iron overload due to large amounts of red meat consumed in diet no I don't think there's any sort of issue you know it's it doesn't matter what your particular genetics are particular you know genetic traits are the only genetics that you need to worry about is is are you human if you're genetic satisfied that criteria yes carnivore diet is for you because that is what we're designed for um I've seen people I've had patients who have had you know markedly elevated um you know iron levels to the point that they would have to get regular blood they would have to you know give blood regularly to keep their iron levels down they they didn't even have hemrom hemrom hemocromatosis tongue tie today um you know they didn't even have hemocromatosis and so it's um it it was just they they functionally had it you know because they had to they had to give blood to get their blood blood levels down and then they went carnivore and they said okay well let's let's see what happens they didn't give blood for five months we checked there and normally they would give it every sort of two three months and checked uh his blood and his iron levels actually came down on its own actually came down sort of to a more normal level better than what he normally would achieve with blood donation so no I would not expect you to get have a problem with that it's not just about how much iron is coming in it's about how you metabolize iron it's how your body uses iron and and and properly uses iron so uh no I would not expect you to get iron overload I would expect your um your your individual you know genetic issues to be optimized in fact you know buy this you may still have problems you know people with hemocromatosis may still have problems but I but largely what what happens is they improve maybe they don't improve all the way and they don't have any problems anymore but they improve that has been my experience with this and so I would not expect you to have any problems with doing carnivore with phemia minor and in fact I have patients with with phemia various phas uh and and they do fantastic so that that is actually something I have personal experience with and no they don't have any problem they they do very very well Matthew trap thank you so much for the Super Chat I'm a 31-year-old male with extremely poor circulation constantly cold hands and feet even in warm temperatures um temp temperature environments uh will carnivore help this well it certainly can help your circulation um cold hands and feet can be from circulation it can be from thyroid issues it can be from a number of things um it should help circulation depends on what the cause of your circulation is but people with vasculitis seem to improve on this people with um uh with thyroid issues improve on this and so you know there's there's a number of different you know potential causes or you know for your your symptoms that you're describing so it's hard to say you know is carnivore going to help that because there can be a number of different things you know causing it so it depends on the cause depends on what's causing your issue but there are certainly a lot of uh issues that you know can present like that and cause those sorts of symptoms that do improve on a cornav diet so hopefully that helps but it depends on your your particular issues but it's well worth the try and um I would again expect you to improve in a thousand other ways as well along with that so even if it doesn't help that you're going to you're going to be you know very thankful that you did this uh Lisa Marabella thank you for the Super Chat not seeing a question attached though but maybe further down uh there's one Phillip freay tag thank you for the Super Chat I have bad uh tentis or tentis I have have people found carnivore helpful Yes actually so that seems to be an inflammation you know of your auditory nerves and this can be reduced with a a keto cornivore diet ketones up spread uh you know inflammation down and U and you remove out other sorts of things that can cause inflammation and irritation to th those nerves and others and so yes a lot of people have improved uh their tentis with a carnivore diets so good luck with that be as as close to Pure red meat and water as you can for best results fatty a lot of fat a lot lot more fat than you're used to eating you know I tell people you eat a lot of fat oh I'm definitely eating enough fat and they're horribly constipated and having symptoms uh that you would normally see when people aren't eating enough fat is okay well you need to eat enough fat well I'm definitely eating enough fat no you're eating more you're eating a lot more fat than you've ever eaten in your life but that's not actually enough fat you need even more so tons of fat one to two grams of fat for every one gram of protein aim for that and adjust from there for your own body's needs Pete Mayer thank you very much for the super chat chat two blood clots in the past 10 years lots of tests but all inconclusive as to the root cause on eloquest for years we call carnivore diet help me get off this n um the problem is you don't you don't have a diagnosis and so you you just have unexplained blood clots so there's no real telling you know what what can be done here and if carnivore can help that you know if you don't have any sort of specific genetic issue that they' found it could be just you know a a constellation of issues that have all just sort of added up to the you know Perfect Storm to give you some blood clots um but either way you seem to have a propensity for them um and the only way to really know if a carnivore diet is helping is if you went on a carnivore diet for a period of time few months at least and then stop the elquist and then just roll those Dice and see if you get a blood clot again which I would not recommend doing I don't think that's a very safe idea could very well be that you'd be fine but it's a complete guess it's an utter guess and so you know if you've had two blood clots those can be deadly those can kill you you get a blood clot in your legs go up to your lungs the pulmonary embolism people die from that it's a very serious condition H you can get um you know uh people have have other sorts of um issues such as you know like an atral defect a little hole in the SE in the septum wall uh those cloths can travel over to you know the left side of the heart get into your um arterial circulation cause a massive stroke you know and then and and very serious problems from that so I don't think that would be a safe thing to do and I don't think there'd be any other way to tell if you are um if you're safe from that it could very well be the body improves in in many many different ways and it could very well be that this is one way that it would improve as well however we don't know that and so it is taking a risk with your life and your health which isn't a great idea but that of course is ultimately up to you but that is that is the only way I can think of that you could you could show that one way or the other is if you went on a carnivore diet stayed on a carnivore diet and then stopped your eloquest and just you know see what happens um I probably wouldn't do that myself though but I'm not in that situation maybe I would feel differently about it depending on how uh how much I did not like taking eloquest you know it's um it is it is it does predispose you for risks uh in other in other ways you know it's it's it's a difficult thing to contend with when you're a you know trauma surgeon and dealing with you know 2 am car accident with someone who has cracked their head open and bleeding profusely inside their skull and you need to do surgery and they're on one of these these um you know these noax these these um you know these anti um you know anti-coagulant so you know there there are tradeoffs but that would sort of be the way to do it and I I wouldn't really recommend that because that's that's a that's a big risk Donald farmer thank you for the Super Chat I bought a deep fryer nice filled it with beef Tallow from the butcher even nicer um you can sued stakes in a Tallow at 140 degrees no plastic necessary Game Changer no kidding that's a great idea um yeah I actually wondered about just deep frying things because like you know when when I have my my pen I have like a cast iron skillet and I'll put like you know half an inch of fat down there like Tallow and I have sort of one of those silicone cones that come off of it so you don't get a bunch of splatter everywhere but I like sort of you know fry each side and it's almost sort of deep frying that edge at any given time but obviously i' thought about you know just dunking things in a deep fryer uh which would be great but yeah but I mean getting it at the exact temperature you would that's that's a great idea and um yeah and you could do it you could do su at at 140 you could do it a little lower I I often like things a bit more rare than that but obviously you know people can sort of figure out exactly where they want that but that's a great idea you know or even just like a higher temperature and really getting really super crispy on the outside and um and uh you know and then cooked however you want on the inside that's a that's a great idea I should probably do that I always worry about grease fires and problems with that but um you know people do this stuff all the time and as long as you're s you know care careful and safe with it uh it's it's it's pretty safe so great idea thank you for sharing that that's damn it that's gonna all right now I want that okay thanks for that uh Tyler venor thank you very much for the Super Chat does eating sugar carbs and vegetables inhibit child from reaching maximum height what is your guess for potential Max height for carnivore child uh with two five foot6 parents yes it does 100% I have no doubt in my mind that it it inhibits your child from reaching their maximum height and brain capacity um intelligence and physical capacity no doubt in my mind why is that because every single population in history when eating a um when switching from a hunter carniv carnivorous uh lifestyle to an agrarian lifestyle with with plants not even processed crap with the sugar and  that we're eating today but just plants you know like grains and things like that uh you know those those people have dropped dramatically in height so pre- agriculture average person was 5 foot n and those were in the populations that were sort of the hunter gatherer populations that we're already using plants and said hey actually we could plant these seeds and actually you know make it a bit easier on ourselves we don't have to have to go looking for this stuff this is just going to be here and um and they dropped from 5 foot n down to like 5'4 5 foot4 5 foot5 brains got smaller by 11% in adult males women uh by 177% and you know Jaws got smaller teeth got crowded crooked bad cavities poor wound healing signs of infection like tuberculosis in their spines which was not seen before that and um and there's a there's an image on pinned to the top of my Instagram Channel just Anthony chmd on Instagram and it um and it shows that it's a tech it's a page of a textbook um from a I believe a professor at Cambridge and um I'll show it sort of here and those are those are two different skeletons you know the bigger one is pre- agriculture and then there's post- agriculture very very clear and it says at the bottom when when populations around the globe started turning to to agriculture around 10,000 years ago regardless of their location and regardless of the type of crop a similar Trend occurred the height and health of the people declined skeletal analysis suggests that these Neolithic peoples experience greater physiological stress due to undernutrition and infectious disease okay that's what's happening to your kid that's what's happening to your kid and our kids and all of us you know you're 5 foot6 you should have been six foot tall sorry or more because the thing is this has generational KnockOn effects and we know from pottinger cats that they fed them uh group of cats raw meat they were extremely healthy if you fed them cooked meat just cooked meat not even this that we're feeding them now it's kibble crap that's not food that's garbage and they had them cooked meat instead of raw meat and they weren't as healthy they weren't as vibrant they still had kids but those kids were smaller smaller brains smaller uh less developed cheekbones and then uh and less bone mineral uh mineralization the Next Generation even worse even smaller even worse bone moralization lots of fractures smaller brains and uh and they weren't healthy they weren't able to reproduce after that and then giving them raw meat though third generation cats got better and were able to reproduce they were healthier and then all of a sudden you you will reproduce and then next Generation you expect okay they're back to normal no it took four generations to to breed back to what they had um in that just the whole time generation after generation with the raw meat so there are epigenetic multigen generational KnockOn effects to uh eating diet so we're screwed uh you know we're we're that you know we're that third generation of of pot Anders cats that are just you smaller weaker and Dumber and um our kids are going to be better and if we do carnivore their kids will our kids will be better and if they stay carnivore their whole life their kids will be better than them and maybe even the next generation will be better than them and then you get back to where we're supposed to be because in their pre- agriculture Hunter gather they were 5' n but on average but you go back to when they were just hunting meapa because this is again this is after megap died out already you go back to when they're just hunting megap they're just hunting Mammoth they could be anywhere from you know 5 foot 10 to 6'4 on average right so you know these are big big dudes and we saw this in real time with the Native Americans the native Australians the N the Plains Indians the Native Americans that were just eating bison before the Bison were wiped out um you know by the by the American government which is a terrible thing to do um they they this was a study shown in 2001 showed that they the Native Americans that were eating just bison there's high fat carnivores nothing else generally that they were the tallest population of human beings on Earth and people say oh even taller than the Dutch yes even taller than the Dutch the tallest human beings on Earth they are not that anymore and so that we saw that in real time we saw their height and health decline dramatically and now they have a far higher rate of obesity diabetes heart disease cancer autoimmunity than the rest of the American population eating the same crap that everyone else is eating because they haven't had 10,000 years 8,000 years 5,000 years to adapt to this species inappropriate diet this food that does not belong in our body and so um I would say that you know your kids you know could be 6 foot and above if they if they're just eating meat if you're eating meat if um you know your wife is just eating meat throughout you know preconception during pregnancy and breastfeeding those kids are going to be well above six feet I would say and and potentially you know their kids would be even taller than that um you know my you know look looking back you know my my great-grandfather on my mother's side you know the guy was uh you know much taller than me um different accounts there was some accounts saying he was like 6 foot6 other ones he was like 6'4 but you know whatever he he was a tall guy he was born in 1875 he died in 1975 oh but people only live 30 years you're an idiot if you believe that I'm sorry that's just dumb that's average life expectancy from birth and anyone who pushes that is is either uh you know you know has has not had spent one moment thinking about this or is lying and trying to mislead people and either way you know just don't listen to them um and my my father you know is 6'4 his brothers are like 6'5 and 6' 7 and their father was like 6'4 6'5 his brothers were all pushing seven feet they were born at the beginning of the 19th century you know or 1900s 19th century 20th century in the 1900s and um you know so you know the massive massive massive people and and we've just shrunk generation after generation right so we're just looking at real life pot Anders cats with people because we're eating worse and worse things okay I'm gonna have to I'm GNA have to rush some of these guys because I've still got a lot of um super chats coming in and and I don't have time for all of them unfortunately um the rabbits uh the rabbit hole. wi um thank you for the Super Chat 30-year-old male 190 lbs fit diagnosed with uh cptsd debilitating brain fall can carnivore on Carnivore for three weeks familiar with Dr Palmer uh any words of Hope um well yes you know I mean this is this is something a lot I mean brain fog in particular this is um this is something that that a lot of people improve on you know just having your brain run on ketones getting rid of other sorts of things that can that can slow down your brain it helps so you know things with like you know PTSD it um you know it it's still it's still sort of virging ground you know but there are more and more people that you know they come to a carnivore diet ketogenic diet like you know you know uh the work of Dr Palmer shows um and just just anecdotally people are finding that this is helping PTSD and uh you know sufferers from PTSD and so yes I think that it's very favorable it's very positive it's going to improve your life in a lot of ways improve your health in a lot of ways and is very powerful for mental health issues you know of any description like you're just going to feel better you know it's not going to erase past harm and trauma but it can help you uh deal with it better and it can help you be in a position that you're you know that you are in a in a you know more sanguin state that you can at least you know heal from this and and um and be in a position that it doesn't control your life as much as it did so uh I hope that it helps I I would expect it to just keep going with it and you know what the thing is is that you know you're going to improve in a lot of ways anyway so just look forward to that you know let this heal your body heal your brain and just enjoy your life you know it's going to improve your life in a lot of ways and hopefully you can get back to just enjoying life and and uh you know finding happiness and I hope you do and good luck with that I'm only going to be able to do a couple more questionss guys because I I've got to get uh to the clinic as I've got patients coming in the next sort of 20 minutes uh you thank you for the Super Chat in addition to a carnivore diet are there other lifestyle suggestions uh to reduce exposure to toxins ET personal care products many are plant-based uh kind of water to drink cleaning products laundry difficult right there's so many different things I mean you use you shouldn't use those little tide pod things they have these Plastics that gets in your clothes that sort of get on your skin not what you want to do and this sort of material of shirt probably isn't a good idea either um type of water to drink I would drink filtered water certainly uh you know if you're if you're you if you're out in the country or something like that you have really good quality tap water you know fine um but you know when they add a whole bunch of chlorine and you know um fluoride and garbage to the water and it could have radium I mean I was in Tucson they were talking about how radium in the water and people like oh no it's fine they had I swear to God they had commercials from the state government saying this oh yeah I just I just boil the water if I'm going to drink it you know I was like boiling water doesn't get rid of radium and I was like what the hell are you talking about and um you know so filter the water get a good water filter get all that crap out of there personal care products yeah I don't use um you know many of them you know I use you know Tallow for skin moisturizer with no sense and nothing else I use Tallow soap with no sense you know I that's why I teamed up with um with my friend Asher from Stone and spear Tallow you know to as a brand ambassador because like he makes a lot of these Tallow products that that are great you know some of them have scents you don't have to get the ones with scents I I don't I just get the the normal soap and the and things like that and there's like a you know shampoo sort of Tallow version things like that and it's just you know that's what I use I keep it very simple and I use Tallow on my skin and it's great you will never find a better better skin moisturizer than than Tallow so yes I think it is important to sort of reduce those things as well um you're you're very correct okay I'm going to do yeah we'll see how many much times I have but maybe one or two more so uh Lenard thank you very much for the Super Chat on Carnivore for 2.5 months and feel great I found out that I may have Gilbert Syndrome uh my bill Billy Rubin is is for plus and I have high fertin hemoglobin is slightly elevated what do you suggest I do same thing you know I don't think that you know Gilbert Syndrome isn't uh first of all it's not really symptomatic it doesn't cause problems it just you have elevated Billy Rubin that doesn't really do anything and it's not caused by a blockage or anything like that so it's just it's just something to know about your Billy Rubin is just going to be a bit higher it's just going to probably stay that way may improve it may not um I I don't know um I know of a lot of people you know who have had Gilbert Syndrome done fine on a carnivore diet I haven't really tracked their their liver markers to know um you know because they haven't been my direct patient uh you know if that if that sort of improves but you know it doesn't doesn't need to it doesn't really cause a problem uh High fertin um and hemoglobin you know that's that's not a problem you know I mean having a bit higher hemoglobin can be for a number of different reasons people through smoke have a little higher people in elevation uh have a little higher uh hemoglobin and people who are healthy have higher hemoglobin so I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about that the high fertin sort of you know it depends on what you mean it's high fertin is also an acute phase reactant that can go up just because you know you you are sort of a bit sick that day or or just being exposed to something so I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about that I just you know you keep it keeping track of these things and um you know if your fertin is just going higher and higher and higher and higher okay maybe we think about what's going on check your the rest of your iron studies maybe that you need a blood transfusion or something like that I would highly doubt that though because even people with with normally who need blood transfusion they go on a carnivore diet and it actually improves their energy or their iron metabolism so I would expect you to just be fine um just something to keep track of get multiple data points you know just one set of blood test it's just a snapshot in time we don't know what direction things are going in or if they're even changing at all so just you know every couple months check your Bloods again if things are starting to go in a bad Trend then you investigate them uh let's see um okay I think that's all that I can do today guys I I've got to I've got to make a break uh for work or I'm going to be late um thank you very much everyone uh for coming on sorry I didn't didn't get to all the questions might be able to uh put some of them in the description and I'll try to answer them in the in the comments but thank you all very much for coming on and um please be here for the premiere uh my next premiere of my podcast episode on YouTube on um Sunday should be at 5:00 pm on Sunday PST Pacific Standard time so 9:00 am in Perth and um people can figure out their times elsewhere and uh and that that really helps you know get this out there the more people that come to the premiere uh the you know I get to chat with them we get to sort of answer questions and things like that as it going so that can be fun and it also just really helps the algorithm sort of get this out to more people and that's all was helpful too so if people can come to that if you're available I would appreciate it thanks everyone and also have more lives and q&as more direct q&as with um you know uh my patreon group it's just Anthony chaffy MD and we do weekly lives like this but you get your your dedicated questions through and get to talk and interactive so it's more sort of uh more more face-to-face sort of experience over zoom and um so people want to do that they can they can sign up uh for that at patreon okay thanks everyone we'll see you next time"
