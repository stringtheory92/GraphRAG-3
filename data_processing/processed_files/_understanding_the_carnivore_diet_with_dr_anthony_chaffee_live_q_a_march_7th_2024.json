        "body": "all right hello and good morning um sorry is just running a bit late but thank you everyone for being patient um so today we're live on March 8th 2024 for me and March 7th for most everyone else thanks everyone for joining um today I have about two hours so that should be a good amount of time try to answer as many questions as I can um probably hour in we'll ask people to stop doing um super chats and things like that just to make sure I can I can get to everything um so great all right so we'll start with the first question here from Sunshine kiss she says hi hi my favorite doctor thank you very much 5'7 135 lbs lift weights every day carnivore 6 months added fat started gaining fatweight uh what are the right protein fat ratios then well um for most people um you want you know quite high fat you want to try to get as much fat as your body is asking you for and can absorb your body makes a certain amount of bile and that's how much fat you can absorb after that it's very difficult for your body to absorb fat absorbs a very small amount um and the rest goes out so you sort of have this fill over mechanism your body has a limited capacity to absorb fat and so I don't believe there's such a thing as being able to eat too much fat because it's not really physiologically possible to absorb more fat than your body wants so I think you try to get that much fat and you try to get a corresponding amount of protein that um is right for your body if you're eating very lean meats then you're going to need to eat more I you know I see this all the time where people will eat twice as much pounds of food if they're eating very lean their body just needs these different nutrients that are in that are in fat and it's sort of chasing that and the people that are just eating very very lean they're just eating eating eating all the time and they're uh and and they're not as satiated as other people that are eating more fat as well um you also need to make sure that um the weight that you're gaining is actually fat you know is it fat or is it muscle because you're going to gain muscle it's going to be much easier to gain muscle on a carnivore diet than basically any other diet you care to do and um you'll be putting on lean body mass and so you're lifting weights every day you know you're going to be putting on muscle which is great so you can get a body composition score either dexa scan or you can just get calipers and sort of test your body fat and see see where you're at there um if you are putting on fat it could potentially be that you just eating far too much lean meat and your body's just trying to eat more and eat more and eat more to try to get enough uh of the fat and nutrients that you need your body chases nutrients it doesn't Chase calories and so you're going to increase the amount of food that you're eating if you're still deficient on some calories so give that a try um let's see here [Music] and I saw little el el Marie in the chat so I want to say hello little El Marie it's nice to see you here Copper's kitchen carnivore from 808 bear my neighbor is now um my neighbor is now low platelets can carnivore boost that she is low on iron too well it can certainly help with the iron it can help with other sorts of things it depends on what's causing her low platelets U there can be a lot of reasons for that and obviously she needs to work with her doctor for that um to that end it can certainly help with iron it can certainly help with all the other essential nutrients and and vitamin B12 and other sorts of things that are necessary to make new blood cells there you know there's a certain kind of anemia that you can get from low iron you get low low red blood cells but from low B12 B12 is required for DNA synthesis and when you're making new cell lines you're having cell turnover like your your blood cells and your immune cells because these things have a high turnover rate you have to keep making these things constantly and if you have low B12 then you're not going to be able to turn these things over properly so that's another thing too I'm not saying that's what's causing this I'm just giving that as an example that there can be other nutrients that um that will be addressed by a carnivore diet that can help in these sorts of things but it certainly matters what's causing low platelets a lot of things can cause low platelets certain diseases can cause low platelets medications can cause low platelets and um and nutritional deficiencies can also cause low platelets and so then other exposures things like that so there's a lot of different things that that can be um it's going to help her with the iron and a lot of other things anyway can't say it's what what it's going to do with the platelets because I don't know what's causing the pl the low platelets um so she needs to see her doctor about that but um you know the diet is only going to help anyway musel chowri thank you for the question hi Dr chaffy one and a half months carnivore two meals a day um 168 uh ratio on uh eating so I'm saying 16 hours fasting 8 hours eating why am I putting so much fat on in my belly uh am I having too much protein I follow you as you said eat up to taste and uh tastes good and exercise three days a week so yeah well it very well could be you know another thing some people do is they they take Ox bile which I you know I'm you know you probably aren't you know you haven't mentioned that but some do and they think that that helps them you know digest fat better and you know in a way it does but it also forces your body to absorb more fat than it actually wants and of course it's you're going to store that so um so don't do that almost no one needs to do that or should shouldn't do that um there there may be some rare exceptions here and there but in general no no one should need to do that um as far as you if you're not taking Ox bile or anything like that it could be that you're having more lean meat than than your body wants and so again you're chasing the more nutrients from fat and and so you're just body just eating more than it needs to um you know also you know we're sort of assuming here that you're only eating meat and only drinking water if you're having Dairy that can people put on weight with that they just they eat more Dairy than they necessarily need it's just sort of a compulsion to eating dairy too and people tend to eat the exact same amount of meat regardless of the amount of dairy they eat so they'll eat a lot of dairy and then they'll eat the exact same amount of meat because her body wants those nutrients from meat and then it just has a whole bunch of dairy too and so that can be too much for you and then um you know if you're having artificial sweeteners if you're having a little bits of something here and there or some alcohol here and there or uh anything else outside of just meat and water you know monk fruit sugar a lot of people you know I talked to you say well I'm having trouble with weight loss or I'm putting on weight or something like that and I've done carnivore and it helped all these other problems reverse my autoimmune diseases caught off all these medications but unfortunately it didn't work for me so I had to stop well first of all it sounded like it's working great for you it's reversing all these health issues and that's the main thing um the weight comes you know it's just if you do it um long enough that you know the weight weight will will take care of itself but um you know then you ask them okay what exactly are you eating and they're eating you know different things outside of the meat and they are also using things like fruit sugar I see that very commonly um that that people use a re fruit tall mon fruit sugar and they think well it's natural and so you know that's fine well I mean Sugar's natural you know Ste is natural arsenic's natural and so just make sure you're not eating any of those things just red you know just meat and water that's it high fat um make sure you're getting enough fat so you're not getting constipated don't drink coffee tea artificial sweeteners magnesium supplements um you know medications all these things can can speed up your your uh bowel motility and so you can sort of cover up if you're getting um constipated and having too little fat and so um you want to sort of get down to just a baseline we're not doing any of that and then you judge how much fat you're getting in by whether or not you're getting constipated or loose stools or normal stools and if you're doing that then you know how much fat you're supposed to be getting in so yeah there's a few few things there um but and and again you're saying you're saying you're getting F on your belly you know another thing too people need to think about is stress and poor sleep you can absolutely put on belly fat particular or intraabdominal fat specifically from that from these high stress levels High adrenaline levels and cortisol levels and that increases um fat deposition in those areas so um you know make sure your stress is down this goes for the previous question as well make sure your stress is down that you're you're relaxed and as much as possible or you're doing things that make you uh be able to relax and and optimize sleep prioritize sleep um there was something that I saw um Dr Tony Hampton say the the other day which was um if you get you know four to five hours of sleep at night uh for a week straight for seven days straight you'll actually get pre-diabetes you'll become pre-diabetic in just those seven days and by sleeping 7even to eight hours for seven days in a row you'll reverse that so it makes a big difference and um and so you need to you need to address that as well it's not it's not just what you're eating it's other things to obviously can play a sign can roll Jenny Edwards says 9-year-old daughter has cyclical nausea vomiting diarrhea weekly blood work uh MCV 79.9 MCH 26 platelets 428 tp8 doc prescrib zrin I want to go dietary roote cut gluten treto certainly I mean you know the thing is you know you need to make sure well you need you need to know what's what's causing the the nausea and diarrhea and vomiting and all these sorts of things but food is is definitely something that that can upset people's stomach we have I mean you just look at the there tens of thousands hundreds of thousands at this point testimonials from people who have suffered their with their whole life with GI upset and nausea and and bloating and pain in their stomach and you know IBS and IBD then um that they completely reverse these things just by stopping plants and so and just eating a lot of fatty meat and it just and just sorts them out so yeah she could absolutely be reacting to something that she's eating and if she's eating a normal diet there's a lot to to react to negatively especially in in the modern era because this processed food is just it's just so awful um so yeah I would definitely try to clean up her diet and just get her onto Whole Foods first and foremost try to cut down car as much as possible keto you know certainly got out gluten and Ketone and um and getting to into keto ketogenic diet if you can me cut down carbs significantly uh get rid of grains seeds beans legumes all these sorts of things can be really hard on the body and the stomach in particular and uh and cause leaky gut and other sorts of problems fiber can cause uh gut problems as well so yeah I mean the closest you can get closest you can get her to just a whole food meat based diet I think the better that she'll do so yeah I would I would definitely recommend that question from Lisa uh fingernails are getting ridges am I lacking calcium uh it depends on on The Ridges so there me a lot of different uh fingernail signs and you can you can look these up you can just you know go onto um onto the internet and look up images for you know uh you know nail CH finger nail changes G fingernail CH changes iron fingernail changes B12 there's a lot of very specific changes so it depends on what that is but um um I'm trying to I'm trying to think back I certainly know that there's fingernail changes for for things like low iron and and uh B12 and things like that I'm trying can't really remember about calcium though um but not to say that there aren't but just you know trying to think back to like first year IAL school for the fingernail changes and if if calcium makes fingernail changes um but either way you can you can look that up and you can always check your calcium levels you know um also are you doing just a carnivore diet if you're doing a carnivore diet you're not going to be low in calcium you're not going to be low um on on anything if you're doing it long term you know if you if you were low in calcium before you started you know you can be low calcium as you go along it takes it can take months to get back up to you know more normal levels but you know you would would have presumably had some of these changes at that point anyway so you know if you're if you're worried about deficiencies and certain things and certainly check them you know check your blood work and see you know if you're if you're extraordinarily low in things then then you can always supplement you can always take something but um you know it's uh it's it's something that that will be addressed if you just fix your diet and if you just eat a proper human diet as my friend Ken Barry says uh but it's just a biologically appropriate diet you know what we what we're meant to eat you know people say well there's not enough calcium in meat like who told you that know this um think about it this way all mammals drink milk wow there all a lot of calcium milk that's where all their calcium comes in for all their bones really so so animals don't stop nursing until they're full grown adults and have completely grown all their bones right no they stop when they're pretty young pretty small the vast majority of the bone growth that animals do all mammals do happens after they're weaned off of their mother's milk and they start eating the food of their mothers and 70% of animals are carnivores so lions and humans you look at the Inu they're not nursing until they're 17 I hope um and lions you know they'll they'll wean off as as you know Young Lions and then they'll start eating meat and then they get the calcium from the meat and you know um you don't need all that much calcium uh because most of the bone bone growth and Bone tissue is actually amino acids and collagen it's just mineralized collagen and that's what strengthens the collagen but the you know the structure is collagen and amino acids so that's majority of what you need and then you just need proper regulation of that calcium and the and and osteoclast and osteoblast whereas when you're eating a whole bunch of plants and oxalates and things like that that strips out calcium it binds out calcium stops you from absorbing it stops you from utilizing it and um and then you just need more and more and more and more and more calcium to to cover your gaps you're not doing that when you're not eating those plants you're just eating meat so just like a lion they're going to get all the calcium they need from meat and where does a mother lion get her milk where does she get the calcium to make concentrated breast milk with a lot of calcium in it for her baby she gets it from the meat that she's eating you know she's not nursing from something else and who's nursing from something else who's nursing from something else is just this like a robber us you know they just sort of you know there just everything's nursing each other and they're just passing around the calcium so you get it from the meat um if you are low on something you know if you're very low on something you want to supplement early on you know go for it but you know meat will will get you there in in the end it may take a bit longer than if you were to supplement if you give you were like extremely low on B12 I'm like getting a B12 shot's a great idea you know if you're very low you know because it can be dangerous you know and so you know but in a few weeks few months you know you're going to be you're going to be up at a better level anyway uh especially if you include you know a bit of organs and things like that if you're very deficient or if you're someone who doesn't methylate these things properly um then you can you can um um then you you might be able to um uh you know then then you know if you if you want to sort of play catch up quickly you can just um you know get a shot or take you know calcium supplement or something like that I don't think people on a cornivore diet need to take a calcium supplement certainly not long term um and um especially in women there are some studies that show that if you take calcium supplements at you know very normal doses something like 900 to 1,000 milligrams a day um increase es your your um risk of developing heart disease or cardiovascular disease by 15 uh 15% for women so you don't need it unless you're actually deficient so get that checked and um see how you go okay so question from Rudy um I would sorry I would believe carnivore is good for an anemic but would it be enough iron for someone who's had portions of small and large intestine removed supplementation needed depends on how much removed it depends on if the parts of your of your intestine that have the The receptors for absorbing iron have been removed or largely removed um you know meat heem iron um you know and meat red meat and particular uh liver especially the organs especially they're going to have the most bioavailable iron that's that's there the heem iron so it's it's over three times uh as bioavailable uh than than the iron that's available in in plants for example so when you're getting an abundance of very bioavailable iron then you're going to have an easier time absorbing it and so most people should be fine if you are if you are in this situation when you've had large parts of your small bowel and you absorb the stuff in the in the small bowel that then you know you might have difficulty and you you may have to supplement you can try supplement I mean liver is a supplement you know it's going to have a lot of heum iron in it um if it's not quite enough you can you can try you know uh taking taking tablets you know and and iron supplement tablets and see how you go it could be that you've you've had such a large amount taken out that sorry about that that that you've had so so much taken out that you might have to basically get trans fusions um hopefully not though so give that a try just uh you know prioritize red meat and uh liver see how you go if that's not enough and add in a add in a tablet they can cause different constipation and sort of you know upset stomach and things like that so just just so you know it's it's better to get it from your food but um you know and if the the supplements aren't working then you you know you might have to be you just might be in a situation unfortunately that uh that you'll have to use um transfusions every now and then but hopefully not hopefully hope the meat and liver just do it for you lur rer thank you very much for the"

        "body": "just do it for you lur rer thank you very much for the just do it for you lur rer thank you very much for the Super Chat worried last week about um March 6 Endocrinology appointment and refusing a Statin she was fine with it okay but wouldn't order fasting insulin U it's fine she did order C peptide that's good um I'm not diabetic is this an okay compromise yeah it's fine you know it's um it's um it's it's honestly it's academic too if you're doing a carnivore diet you know because you're you're fasting insulin is going to go down your fasting glucose is going to go down I mean the reason you look at fasting insulin in in the normal population or or C peptide and these sorts of things you're looking for earlier signs of of insulin dependency and resistance and you're looking for an increased demand of insulin to get the same effect in blood sugar control um you know often termed insulin resistance but you'll see this these numbers go up right and so you'll generally find elevated fasting insulin 10 to 15 years before you'll ever see blood sugar getting getting above the above into the pre-diabetic range so I would really consider that pre-diabetes you know your body is compensating but it's working extra hard it's there you're already having compromise to your system it's not working smoothly and flawlessly it's uh the the cracks are starting to show so I'd say that's pre-diabetes and then when your body can't even with this massively elevated insulin can't control your blood sugar then um you know then that's that's sort of fulminant diabetes like your body is is now not able to handle the glucose load that you're bringing into it um regardless of the amount of insulin that it makes and it's going to start burning out its ability to produce insulin and um you're going to be in trouble you're going to be in big trouble so I think by the time that you sort of get into the pre-diabetic range with your blood sugar right that's 10 to 15 years past when we should have done something and so that's why I think it's important to chest fasing insulin the C peptide um gives you similar information and and either way it's academic because what do you do you stop eating carb seed oils alcohol sugar and you just eat an ancestrally appropriate diet where diabetes didn't exist so um that's what I would do if you're if you're just doing fatty meat and water your insulin's going to come down it's going to be low and um and you're going to be fine you know you're not going to have to worry about about that sort of thing as long as you're sleeping well as long as your stress levels are low and and um and also just don't do chronic crazy amounts of cardio uh do sprinting high-intensity exercises hit training or uh weightlifting it doesn't have to be sprinting it can be it can be other sorts of high-intensity exercise which you is want to be anerobic so you want to be able to do something so hard that eventually you just build up so much laic acid your body just has to stop and um you know so those things can really help reduce cortisol and uh and improve your health in other ways so uh that's what I would do and if you're doing that you don't don't worry about all your blood fasting insul in and things like that Tyler Viller thank you for the"

        "body": "hose things in mind uh Peter top off thank you for the hose things in mind uh Peter top off thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr uh Dr Anthony I am a big fan not a diet question was just told by my doctor that my three-year-old needs his adenoids removed his he mouth breathes and snores at night is is surgery the way to go or is there other solution well the I mean so mouth breathing is isn't great for facial development so you want to try to encourage nasal breathing through uh during the day and you can try taping his mouth at night putting mouth tape on at night so forces him to breathe through his nose while he's sleeping so normally sometimes it just breathe through their mouth and it's just not it's not good for you uh and you get sort of this um you actually get difference you know changes in the facial structure as well and uh and other health issues you know if you're not breathing through your nose actually makes a difference if the air goes through your nose as opposed through your your in through your mouth it seems so you breing through your nose you you release more nitric oxide um which is good for you in a number of different ways and it also seems that it um you know it it warms and and circulates in in the nasal cavities your nasal in scienes are actually massive you know this whole part of your face is just Hollow and um and so it's uh you know there's a lot going on there and then so trying to encourage nasal breathing through during the day and then um taping you know mouth taping at night you know it could be that horse is out of the barn and sort of there's a lot of tissue there and and it may not be possible for him to breath through his nose now because of that I don't know but I would try that anyway and hopefully that can that can reverse that I mean if he's really just can't breathe through his nose and obviously it's not safe to tape his mouth you know because he's you know he's gonna be um it's not GNA be possible for him to breathe through his nose and so you know you're sort of sort of stuck at that point but that I I'd at least try that and hopefully um that would help and also is the on a carnivore diet you know is that that's going to help him develop his facial structure and his proper oral cavity and nasal cavity properly and then the soft and hard pallet are going to be uh better able to to form and develop properly as as well and that's going to help his breathing that's going to widen out the the the air um the passageways for his um for nasal breathing and um and could help quite a lot so think about that too Betty Rice hello um I'm 60 79 years old and have lost 35 pounds eating meat that's great but having a lot of pain under my left breath I'm wondering if it can be uh hard on your heart no it's not hard on your heart um if you have some sort of pain and you're concerned about it certainly go see your doctor if it's pain that you can press on it makes it worse that's generally costocondritis or some sort of pain in the muscular sceletal sort of pain that you're sort of pushing on and reproducible if you push on your ribs and your ribs hurt it's probably your ribs if you're going to push on your ribs and there's a pain it's not going to be your heart you're not it's not going to hurt your heart so you know is it reproducible pain you know does it get worse when you sort of push on it um and um and if so then that's that's more reassuring sharp pains can be from issues with your lungs or it can be issues with the ribs or the muscular you know muscular scal uh tissue uh it can be a lot of things but it's it's often not um to do with your heart just just chest pain sharp chest pain is isn't typically the heart but it you know could be so you know if you're worried about it you know definitely get your doctor to check it out carnivore do is not going to be hard on your heart in fact it's very helpful for the heart I see more and more people improve their ejection fraction um with their heart so they're they're coming out of heart failure um and they they improve their health in many other ways but do do see your doctor get it checked out make sure that that's okay uh but a carnivore di et won't hurt your heart no vibe 714 thank you for the"

anxiety is at an all-time high biochemically what explains this glucan Genesis um well that's H that's that's yeah that's that's not good I'm very sorry to hear that um it could just be a transition period that's going to be transient and hopefully this this goes away long term you're going to get more mitochondrial turnover mitophagy um and uh sort of the turnover the mitochondria and then you're going to have proliferation of the mitochondria it's going to make your your brain work better your your neurons work better um sometimes people get get anxiety from just weird things like like um microbiome turnover these these bacteria in your gut are getting starved out and they're freaking out and they're sending up a whole bunch of signals up through your gut into your brain um as as my friend Dr pran yogan said um you know people talk about the gut and all the the neurons and ganglion gangli and things like that in and around your gut you know people talk about this as the as the second brain and he said that's actually your first brain that um evolutionarily that was what was first developed you have this this very complex neural network around you know the digestive tube and the elementary track and then the um you know our our our brain is is actually secondary to that that that actually develops secondarily as an offshoot of the gut brain which is interesting so it you know it's going to have a lot of effect you know the vast majority of your serotonin is made in those in those nerve cells in your in your gut so having a screwed up microbiome could potentially do that and that's something that sometimes people say they get very anxious massive cravings and they're just desperate to eat carbohydrates and they have other sorts of problems so if that's the case and you're having that that issue or you're thinking that it might be a microbiome issue you can always try having a bit of plain Greek yogurt with very low carb or no carb put on a piece of meat chewed up swallowed together see how you go um and um and and just give it time I think I think this is something that that you know maybe it's getting a bit worse before it gets better but I think it will get better um just make sure you're just cutting out everything else besides meat and water apart from a bit of you know plain Greek yogurt if you want to go down that route um and then just everything else all artificial sweeteners monk fruit sugar Stevia everything um you know some people take you know powders and mixes and things like that that have these these artificial sweeteners in them and I I don't think that's a good idea um they can also cause disbiosis gut disbiosis they can cause a change in your gut biome and breed you know a gut backacter that you don't want so um you know good luck with that I'm very sorry to hear that I I do think that this will will pull through maybe try some of those things um up your fat if you think it's you know something else is going on biochemically just you know up your fat you'll still be you'll still be doing good things for your mitochondria and your biochemistry either way but you know do make sure you're getting enough fat do make sure you're getting enough protein do make sure you're getting enough food do make sure you're only eating that and nothing else and then you can hopefully get through this and um get to the other side and hopefully it'll be a lot better on the other side and potentially gut microbiome issue too so think about that as well here's my good friend Dr Robert Kilz great to see you doc uh thank you very much for joining that's great and another special guest is Bill KN thank you very much for joining it's good to see you uh Bill KN is our friend up in Alaska who has uh his channel he's hasing and he's going to be in Carrie man's um healing Humanity um documentary that he's making and um Bill's doing a great job U losing quite a significant amount of weight and um has been stuck indoors for many years and uh he's working on uh getting getting reversing his his fortunes and getting out of there so great job with that bill um uh he's great Channel and a lot of great great updates and very inspiring uh for people that are that are on this journey pinball 79 um do you ever eat a plant no um do not even garlic on beef sometimes or even ginger tea when you have the flu certainly not the ginger tea um I I don't think it's going to help you I think it's going to make you worse honestly and you know people putting honey and you know lemon and water I I don't think that helps your throat I think that just makes gives you an excuse to have some sugar water um uh no I don't put I don't put any seasonings on on meat um except for occasional salt but I don't really even use salt anymore um I don't like I don't like using them you know I'm I don't get too bent out of shape if I'm at a restaurant or traveling and they they have some spices or something like that on it I mean I generally ask for them not to have it and I try to avoid it if at all possible um but you know I don't have massive autoimmune issues where it's just like that is not an option um I just don't feel great and so if there's spices if someone else puts spices on it as long as there not too much you know I'll you know I might have it I might try to you scrape off as much as I can uh and I certainly won't add it I I never add plants and I certainly wouldn't have like a bloody salad or something awful like that I just never even wanted to anyway and so I'm I'm glad I don't have to eat them now uh but no I actually think that garlic you know while I used to like garlic I I don't like it anymore I don't like those strong flavors covering up the taste of meat I like the taste of meat meat tastes good to me and I want that I don't want a bunch of seasonings and rubs to cover up the uh the flavor of the meat I just want the meat so yeah no I don't I don't do any of that stuff but I don't get too anal if someone else has added it to it and and uh but I just don't like it because I don't I don't feel the best I you know get a bit of brain fog I just don't feel great you know I get even more stuff you nose you know I've broken my nose so many times in rugby that it just doesn't work properly and so you know even just a bit of spices makes it not work even more and so you know that's not what I want so I I avoid that um as much as possible and I certainly don't add it myself okay Patricia Williams thank you for the"

        "body": "add it myself okay Patricia Williams thank you for the add it myself okay Patricia Williams thank you for the Super Chat looks like the question is down here so Patricia says I'm 5 feet and 69 years old and I'm on a carnivore diet and I'm not losing weight I walk 8 to 10 kilometers a day and I like to know what I'm doing wrong well first of all you're not doing anything wrong you're doing great so you're you're actively trying to better your health um you know it it's it's something that you need to um you know it's it it can be hard for some people a lot of people come to this specifically for weight loss and not everybody loses weight right away and not everybody loses all the weight that they want to want to lose some people get down to they lose weight down to a certain point their body just says no that's where you're staying and there be a lot of reasons for this you know if we come to this after a certain point it may be that our body just isn't going to heal past a certain point uh and we don't know why but the main thing is your health how you're feeling how you're doing and um from a health perspective the the scale is really uh should be a a tertiary consideration your health first and foremost your body composition distance second and then your weight really not at all because if you're putting on lean body mass and you're losing fat you're staying the same weight so we don't know what your body composition is based on the scale so the scale is is what we use typically but you know when people go on OIC they lose a lot of weight but you know what a lot of that weight is lean muscle mass and bone density you you don't you know that's terrible to lose that weight right and then after two years uh people tend to gain back more weight than they lost but they but they're not gaining back lean muscle mass they're gaining back fat so they've lost lean body tissue they've lost lean T muscle mass they've lost lean bone density and now they put on more fat than than the muscle they lost you know what I mean so like this is this is this is not good so weight is not of what's what should be most important I know that it is very important to a lot of people um they like look I have to lose weight but the thing is is that you can improve your health dramatically long before your weight starts to shift and there are a lot of reasons why your weight doesn't doesn't just plummet down straight away so this is for health this isn't just for weight loss weight loss will happen but your health needs to improve your body needs to heal you need your hormones need to heal your hormones need to go into balance you if you have left in resistance and insulin resistance you are going to find it difficult to lose weight you just are and so until that insulin comes down until that leptin comes down it's going to be difficult to lose weight but on a carnivore diet it will and you'll see this over the months these numbers come down and I I I do check these in my patients and I see it directly and I can reassure them I know what's going to happen but they need that Vis visual like hey you know what's happening to my body okay these numbers are improving okay all the all the things that you said were going to happen they're happening okay I can you know I can be fully invested in this and so that's that's why that's why we do this but um the weight is not the most important thing so look at Kelly Hogan um she does a lot of videos on uh on everything really but you know she has done videos on losing weight or not losing weight um on a carnivore diet At first she didn't lose weight at first she actually put on weight for the first six months and you know that uh that's scary but her health was improving and she improving all so much and she was in these carnivore for forums called zerocarb forums like zeroing in on health and zero carb Health which I still think are great on Facebook and um and they're all saying don't look at the scale trust the process this is the best thing for your body your body's healing it needs time to heal and when it does that then you'll start losing the weight and sure enough after six months the weight started dropping off but it's scary you know it's scary if you're actually putting on weight um and it can take longer than that I've seen people go you know over a year um having um you know having having you know stalled weight and and and all these sorts of things also make sure you're not eating any artificial sweeteners and don't and cut out Dairy except for butter because these things can can stall weight loss so you cut out absolutely everything else besides fatty meat and water you make sure you're eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good you're drinking enough water walking is great higher intensity exercises are really good too they they really stimulate your body to improve your metabolism and your health and and and burn fat as well so that's what I would do and good luck with it but just you know focus on your health and you know you you'll get there eventually you know just stick with it you'll you'll you'll see good things but focus on the health issues focus on the health improvements and um and that that can keep you motivated going forward to say look if even if I don't lose any weight I just feel amazing and I'm coming off all my meds and all these things are getting better and so it's worth it anyway um and uh and eventually you will lose weight motivational Misfit I'm just going to say everyone um probably need to cut off the super chats now um because I've got about uh an hour before I have to um oh actually is 11 oh actually no I don't have to do it now we can have another for yeah we can have another sort of 15 15 20 minutes let me see how much are there should be fine yeah because I I sort of I forgot I have a I actually have a bit more time than that so maybe we'll stop in 20 minutes or or stop um super chats in 20 minutes and then we'll go an hour after that so motivational Misfit says um my A1C went from 4.8 to 5.5 on one year carnivore any ideas so the ideas here um are that you could be getting healthier red blood cells so if you're if you're eating plant oils and things like that they have plant cholesterol which is called plant sterols they're close enough to our our cholesterol that they um that our body stops making cholesterol our body thinks it has enough cholesterol and doesn't make it but we don't actually use the plant steril like we do our own cholesterol so we can't make you know hormones and vitamin D and all that sort of stuff and cholesterol mixes up the cell membrane of all our cells and so now all of a sudden the plant sterols do get used in those in those cell walls and they're just not good they're not as good and they get these stiff rigid cells in the cell membranes and um and that's not good for red blood cells because if they and when they get stiff and they can't fold and bend properly bend around these little tiny Corners uh your body has to take them out because otherwise they're going to get stuck and cause a little mini strokes and things like that so can't have that and so your body plucks these suckers out um so you can get an artificially low A1C if you if you have plant steril in your system and then when you um when you go on a carnivore diet your your some memories can can you know be healthier um most people are eating plants and having oils and all that sort of stuff so most people are going to have uh steriles plant steriles in their in their body so that 3month average that we assume people's red blood cells live because that's what normally red blood cells live on that's in the normal population eating a normal diet you're not eating a normal diet you're not getting any plant sterols and so your your cell membranes could be much more healthy and they could be living longer than um than 3 months so you're comparing a three and a half month average to a 3-month average or a 4mth average to uh 3 month mon average obviously those numbers are going to be skewed check your blood sugar check your you're fasting blood sugar a couple times a day you know right in the morning and then before you know main meal at night just see see what your your um your levels are and if that's if that's just not not lining up at all with your A1C then you know then then that's probably what's happening um and that happens a lot of people find that they have a the CGM constant glucose monitor they're like these numbers are not lining up with my A1C and their spot testing and their cgmc seems to be accurate um the other idea um is that if you're eating a lot more lean muscle mass than fat then you know you're not going to store that protein and you're going to turn that into glucose and then you're going to convert that into fat for storage and um and so that can sort of artificially bump up your numbers as well so um think about that if you're you know s so you can bump up your fat content and um and remember that uh that your red blood cells may be living longer and so it's not necessarily um indicative of what your blood sugar is so check your blood sugar and see what it is if it's nice and normal and and and good in a g ood range don't worry about it Paula thank you for the"

        "body": "text at all uh riam Mooney thank you very much for the text at all uh riam Mooney thank you very much for the Super Chat well Anthony love the channel well thank you very much uh with regards to your uh male patient that you male patients that you've worked with did all their testosterone increase without fail uh the ones I've checked yeah I have not seen people's um testosterone fall when I've checked them the um caveat to that is I have seen people who've said that their testosterones have fallen on online or in chats or or things like that but you know I I always ask them okay what when did you take your blood test when did you take your testosterone test what were the circumstances around it and they're like oh I I I took my blood test after work it's always going to be lower later in the day you make testosterone in the morning get this spike in the morning and then it goes down right so by the time you hit the afternoon your testosterone level are way lower so it's not just your testosterone is not just here you're not just pumping out testosterone constantly you hit big peak in the morning and then it goes down um and so you get your your your testosterone tested first thing in the morning and um you get it first thing in the morning between 800 and 9:00 a.m. you do it fasted from the night before 900 p.m. um you just drink water after that you don't drink water in the morning you don't take any pills or supplements or or medications or coffee or tea or any of that sort of stuff keep your stress levels down you don't get pissed off in traffic on the way to the the um the the clinic um and you don't don't do exercise or sexual activity the morning of the day before and you keep your stress levels down uh you all those things are going to affect your testosterone levels they're all going to affect your hormone levels and your cholesterol levels and all your other levels uh they matter if you take U B vitamins um biotin is a B vitamin taking biotin supplements will disrupt your results from many blood tests including your hormones so you need to do these things in a consistent pattern and so I have my patients do these things in a very consistent pattern I get more reliable results and so in those cases yes I invariably see their testosterones go up I I really can't think of an example of one that did not um on a carnivore diet so uh so far so good anyway you know I'm sure there's going to be an exception to that rule there are going to be people that just don't have the capacity to to make much more testosterone but the thing is is that our our testosterone levels are lower and going lower because we're impeding our body's own production of them um you know and we get we get put on medications way too easily way too easily so you know you have a 19-year-old kid and their testosterone levels 120 and you know they come into the doctor oh that's not good well we'll check it again we'll check a couple more times get consistently low you're like look you know your balls just don't work so you're just going to need to be on trt the rest of your life um that's doing a real disservice to that to that young man because um you you just change their diet and and it will almost certainly change now there could be something that that damaged that you know some sort of injury or illness you know MPS damage the the testicles and so um there are things that can that can permanently damage the your your testicles and production of testosterone your adrenals make testosterone too but you know um your Testo a lot of it comes from your testicles and your DHD T will largely come from your testicles as well and um and that's more active than your normal testosterone also but it's um you know it is I I've had that patient you know I've had that that 19-year-old kid 20-year old kid come in with 120 180 uh test level on his testosterone I put him on a carnivore diet two months later um bounced up to 400 you know so this is this is something that that um you know that you need to try first you know I have 70y old men that double or even triple their testosterone levels up to up to what you'd expect for a 25y old you know in good health so uh yeah I that is what I see um and so if you're taking your testosterone consistently at the same time in the same conditions if you get pissed off if you get angry if you do a heavy workout the day before if you have sex that morning or the night before you will get different results so you need to do it in a consistent pattern because if you take your your test testosterone in the morning then you go carnivore and 3 months later you test your um testosterone in the afternoon you will have lower results but that's not actually accurate because you know uh because you spiked in the morning and now it's and now it's down so just remember that and uh yeah so far so far so good with my patie nt population anyway Benjamin Farney thank you for the"

gets terrible stomach problems after eating meat without greens any idea what to do just ease into it um often times people will have sort of psychosomatic sort of uh reactions to just eating meat because oh meat's bad I'm supposed to eat greens and you can give yourself an upset stomach you know just have a have a bit um having a having no gallbladder um means that she might have to split up her fatty meals throughout the day because she's not going to be able to absorb as much that's not going to cause upset stomach that would cause diarrhea if anything um many people will form a pseudo gallbladder and that's an outpouching of a common B duct that acts pretty much exactly like a gallbladder I think they can even get Stones so you know you just have that problem again but um you know you won't have that problem if you eat enough fat because you won't have bile sitting there uh and and concentrating and turning into Stones so um maybe just ease into it you know if this is new for her you know just sort of just just try eating a little bit at a time a little bit at a time and just sort of getting a bit more used to it and more used to it um if she feels she really needs to eat greens maybe she has has a bit just for her own psychological health and um and sort of try reducing that down and increasing the meat and reducing the greens and increasing the meat you know we are all designed to eat meat you know she's not it's not going to harm her to eat meat um so this is generally people just not used to eating meat and they just sort of get so worried they can give themselves an upset stomach that's usually what's happening so but that can be unlearned you know those these same patterns of learning can be unlearned so uh hopefully she's able to do that baral Grandma uh thank you very much for the super sticker that's very kind of you it thank you very much for the Super Test very generous of you I recently started back on Carnivore I have I'm H I was having a hard time uh getting enough fat was eating mostly ribe eyes I started doing pot roasts feel better with the fat um is there a nutritional downside to slow cooking I don't think so um you know the argument could be that you know you're cooking things you're well done that's so you're you're denaturing certain things like torine um glutamine and other sorts of things that are heat sensitive but at the same time you're making other things more bioavailable you're slow cooking things and you're breaking down you know the collagen tendons Ive tissue so you're going to absorb that more and you're going to get better bioavailability and absorption of those sorts of things which are typically harder to absorb so you know you lose some things you gain some others and again we've been cooking meat for at least 800,000 years so I think that you know we're probably pretty used to uh cooking meat um Mor torine is good but we it's not technically essential for most people now there's going to be some people that probably do need torine in their diet just like there are people that do need carnitine in their diet um they say oh that's not that's not an essential amino acid yeah it is to onethird of human Humanity so you know only 70% of people make enough carnitine for um our basic needs and more carnitine is better just like more torine is better so I think if you're not e if you're not eating um you know the slow cooked completely well done meat all the time and you're getting less cooked meat sometimes as well I think that's that's fine um so yeah and just go with how you feel if you feel good then you feel good and don't worry about it Joseph sorya thank you very much for the super sticker I really appreciate that and there's a couple other questions here from uh there's one from Margaret o' Conor uh is it true the Italian National Rugby team is all carnivore I don't know actually I hadn't heard that I know that there are several All Blacks uh New Zealand All Blacks that are that are carnivore I believe well I was told anyway that the Frank Brothers on the All Blacks are are carnivore you know one's a prop he's 38 and he's just still kicking ass and just got signed to the Crusaders you know at at 38 you know for a very very high impact high-intensity position at at front row um you know I mean most people's bodies just don't last that long uh in that sort of environment so you know that's like that's like an NFL lineman you know um you know playing like like an offensive uh or defensive lineman uh you know at at you know 38 you know getting you know going to the going to the Pro Bowl every year you know that's a that's that's that's a serious accomplishment um and that's a testament you know to his to his health and his determination and his uh and his diet really so and there are a lot there are more and more uh professional rugby players especially coming to a cornivore diet and in rugby league and Rugby Union and um you know in the US and New Zealand and Australia and uh and around the world so I hadn't heard that about the Italian national team but that'd be really cool I know that there's some top uh soccer players in the world that are um carnivore now as well and just just absolutely loving it too so it's uh it's growing you know people are are getting on to this and they're they're figuring it out and that it's um that it's uh something that can really help them in their health and their performance so yeah it's good to see um if someone knows if that's about the Italian rugby team definitely let me know and put that in the chats and tag me uh because that'd be really cool and Ancient One says for sure this is one of the coolest Chats on YouTube oh well thank you very much I appreciate that um I think it's just one more sort of chat here is popped up by feral Grandma so many carnivore rugby players we need to round them up and challenge to the vegans I don't know if there'd be enough vegan uh vegan rugby players but could always do that you know I'm sure there are a few we put some put some competitions together for sure um all right everyone that's uh that's the last of the of the super chats um well just one question popped up here what are your thoughts on garlic and spices while adapting to carnivore uh you know if if it helps you do it if it helps you get through uh the adaptation phase and and stick with it then you know go for it if you know at some point you know it's worth stopping and and seeing how you feel without it I feel much better without the stuff and so I I definitely prefer not having it but uh if it helps you sort of you know get to the goal line and and just get only on meat then that's great um you know just uh you know just at some point maybe try coming off of it uh but if it helps you just eat only meat then then then that's fine you know it's a lesser of two evils you're taking out thousands of other things that you really don't want and so uh that's definitely a net a Net game okay all right everyone I think uh we'll stop there so I can I can get ready and go uh to work so I got patients coming in uh thank you all very much I really appreciate you coming on and joining the the live um I'll I'll be trying to do TW two of these a week I don't know when I'll be able to do my Wednesday one next week I have I actually have a um I actually have a uh um a a debate there's some vegan activists here in Perth and they're going to do that on sort of like a it's not really a TV show it would be sort of web based but sort of that that setup um apparently they did one of these before with some Farmers here in in um Perth and or you know Western Australia and uh some of these same vegan activists and it it went very viral they got something like a total of like 90 million views um on all platforms which is pretty crazy um and um well thank you all for all the all the thanks that's very nice and um and so you know so we're doing that now and uh a couple friends of mine here that are that are carnivore doctors here in Perth are going to be joining with me to go and and butt heads with the uh with the uh the vegans um I was going to say buttheads with the buttheads but that's not nice um they they could very well be very nice people um from their online profiles I don't get that impression though but we'll see we'll see what it's like um so anyway uh that's what I'll be doing next week Wednesday so I may not be able to do a live then however um I'll try maybe I'll try to do one sort of later in the day or or something like that we'll see we'll see what we can do if not anyway we'll be here next Friday and we'll be here on um Friday for me Thursday for America next week um so Tuesday Wednesday next week is going to be that is that um uh debate and then Sunday for the the new premiere for this week so every every Sunday we'll have a new Premiere um for my channel for a new episode and um and that will be Monday morning for Australia and Sunday night for for the US and I might start because I have I have sort of a lot of episodes backed up in the queue I might start adding a second a second one during the week as well just to so there's not so much delay and doing these these uh these episodes and getting them out so in any case thank you all very much I really appreciate it hopefully I can see you all at the live the YouTube Premiere uh of my new episode coming up this Sunday us Monday morning in um Australia and people are on thank you for joining on Facebook and Twitter SLX as well as on YouTube we had a very good turnout here as well um the premiere for my uh episode will be on YouTube this Sunday in America Monday morning in Australia so if people can join me there on my YouTube

try to coordinate things through those um through those different platforms to to get get everything out and if people haven't seen my Lane Norton rebuttal that is up now uh that one up live yesterday and so that's my full rebuttal to his absurd statements and claims which were fictitious false and um verifiably so you know he said that he provided rcts there wasn't a single damn randomized control trial there he just assumes people don't read uh the studies that he posts and he's just been banking on that and it's high time people called him out um it's not to say he gets everything wrong but he definitely got this wrong and he's so AR about it so aggressive about it you know there's no business for that I mean if you're going to be if you're going to be a dick about it you should at least have the decency of being correct and not lying and saying you're giving randomized control trials when you're not um and uh you know maybe studies that actually have anything to do with the subject matter at hand so anyway if people want to see that they can and um otherwise I will see you for the premiere thank you all very much I really appreciate it good seeing you all and thank you for joining"
