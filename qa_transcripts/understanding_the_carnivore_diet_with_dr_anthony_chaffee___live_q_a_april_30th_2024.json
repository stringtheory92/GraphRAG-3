    "transcript": "all right hello everyone thank you very much for joining sorry I was on the call with my mom so I had to stay on the call with my mom uh so sorry for everybody that was waiting but thank you very much for being patient and great to see you all so I'm on uh with YouTube X and uh Instagram again today so thank you everyone for joining on all the different spots um I I tend to not be able to see all that many uh questions from Instagram or X um although my my very friendly moderators do try to help bring some of those questions over and try to answer those when I can but if you um if you do want to to to come in and get uh more chats or do a super chat or something like that um on YouTube which will make it easier to see um YouTube is probably the best place to do that but um anybody can watch from anywhere anyway all right so first question from uh Tom carnivore uh congratulations on uh 313,000 subscribers well thank you very much I appreciate that it's pretty exciting and and very humbling I didn't surprise anyone uh or that many people really care what I have to say um love how fast your channel is growing so many lives improved and imagine the ripple effect uh we have cheers uh well thank you very much I really appreciate that it is it is pretty pretty exciting that um you know this is growing message and and more and more people are are coming around to this and getting interested in it and at least trying it out for themselves because that's really what it comes down to uh you know like well how do we know you know who's right about what it's just like try it you see what happens and you know if I'm saying if they're saying oh meat's gonna cause disease and meat's gonna cause um diabetes and meat's going to cause autoimmunity and meat's going to cause you to gain weight and oh my gosh then you just eat meat in exclusion right and the opposite happens well clearly meat's not actually doing any harm is it and uh it's it's the other things that are causing harm that you now got rid of so that's great um and that's really all it comes down to it doesn't matter what they say it doesn't matter what any study says it doesn't matter what I say what matters is what happens when you do it so just give it a try go for 30 days go for 90 days even better and and you'll see dramatic differences dramatic improvements some people take a bit longer most people see a significant Improvement in just 30 days and there's nothing to buy there's no product I'm not selling anything you know so it's not like oh hey try my supplements for 30 days money back guarantee it's like no money involved you just do it you just stop eating plants that saves money because you don't have to buy those stupid rotten vegetables and um and then you know you see and then you know and you will see because it makes a massive difference so thank you very much for that and um thank you for the super chat um Beth ramoner thank you for the Super Chat eating Tallow cold is solid as a way of added fat uh yes yeah you can absolutely do that El really likes uh the taste of um just the the lard we there's you buy a block of lard and we use that in cooking and she just she just likes how it tastes she says it tastes like chocolate cake to her great um I like butter I think butter tastes like ice cream and Ian it's just it's delicious so yeah if you if you want to eat that stuff you can um but just getting it in in the meat just having the meat be fatty that's that's usually the best way or having getting trimmings fat trimmings from the butcher um and you can just sort of fry those up and have a little pile of fat next to your steak as well melting Tallow or grass-fed butter if you tolerate it or and enjoy it onto onto the steak and onto the meat that's also another way that you can increase the fat content or just get your to make you know ground beef mince you know it's everybody in America knows that but mince like mince meat that's that's uh what the rest of the world calls ground beef uh or ground meat so you can get your your butcher to make that with extra fat and that can be a good way of doing it too and then you just don't cook it well done because that'll render out all the fat and you know just sort of no point at that point it tastes amazing um it's much more juicy and flavorful uh when it has more fat like that easy mode RL thank you for the Super Chat I've stopped salting my meat I've started adding more salt to my water I kind of feel like my body is actually craving salt not food what's your opinion uh you know if I I don't know I just wonder why you're salting your water instead of your of your meat you know if your body wants some salt I think I think that's fine to salt um just salt your meat you know put the salt that you want on on the meat and just drink water you know um drinking sea water is is a bad idea you end up dehydrating yourself and dying so you know I don't I don't know I don't think that's a great idea but just add add the salt that that you uh you know just enjoy on your meat your body sort of craving salt you know that's that's fine um usually that's early on usually that's early on when your body's adjusting and and that will settle down I salted pretty liberally in the beginning and U especially salted the meat and then put it in the fridge and let that salt soak in and and uh help dry out the meat which is amazing tasted fantastic after that and then I just started using less and less and less and now I don't really salt much at all and I think it tastes great without salt so just salt to taste I I don't know if you need to to put salt in your water though um he's saying I'm also drinking a lot of reverse osmosis water which is great that gets out all the nastiness um sometimes they don't put anything back in sometimes they do put um they do put minerals back in um so you know if you have the REM mineralization version of that you probably don't need to add salt and um but yeah I I would probably just salt to taste and and unless you're unless you're getting low blood pressure and things like that and feeling pretty wretched if you don't add more salt I would probably leave the salt out of your water Ellie thank you for the Super Chat I can eat a huge amount of both meat and fat in one sitting I can tell I'm getting enough fat if you know you know but I'm simultaneously eating but am I simultaneously eating too much protein protein meat tastes good for longer uh thanks um no that's fine you know you're your body should be able to tell you and um I'm sure there are going to be exceptions out there but um the vast majority of people should be able to listen to their their body signals and their natural signals just like every other creature on earth is able to do that and self-regulate so if you're eating what you're designed to eat your body's going to work the way it's designed to work you're going to get the hunger signals and satiety signals that you're supposed to get and um obviously that precludes any any sort of medications and things like that that could that could upset AC that um or medical conditions as well there are a few but no in in normal circumstances for you know the the vast vast majority of people um you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and and you should be good and so yeah so you're getting enough fat that's great and just keep eating till it stops tasting good and uh and and you'll be fine and just see how you do and you'll do good uh so again from Ellie thank you very much lean meat is cheaper is it all right to buy lean meat and add fat on the side or is it best to eat only the fat contained within the meat thanks again no you can you can uh add fat on the side it's um I guess it depends on where you're getting it I mean generally the fattier meat used to be cheaper it's just like things like riy is expensive but Chuck isn't brisket is not and um you know get like a rump steak with a big fat cap on it usually pretty cheap too and and the ground beef or the mints as other people call it um they uh you know the fattier versions of that are are generally cheaper so it just depends but yeah if you whatever whatever is Affordable for you um just uh get that and and if it's not enough fat then you can add it so you can add Tallow you can add uh grass-fed butter uh you can get your ask your butcher to give you the fat trimmings and then you cook those up and just have a little pile of fat next to the meat and that and then you get the whole uh you tissue the fat tissue as opposed to just the rendered fat so yeah so those are all options that you can definitely do and I buy them you know I work with Stockman Stakes now they've started um they've started uh sponsoring the show and so they have uh grassfed and finished pasture raised beef and animals and they and they'll sell packs of fat so it it sort of looks it says Tallow but it's it's really packs of fat and uh they're good and they're like dark yellow very yellow anyway which makes you know that that actually was out on grass um its whole life and um tastes great and so you just sort of cut that up in little squares and fried it up in a pan just have that little pile next to your meat it's fantastic uh Sue thank you for the Super Chat what are the makers or markers I need to check for my metabolism I have a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ton to lose but I'm gaining on Lion I'm also trying to sleep better yeah so there's a lot of things um that that go into that um your metabolism can be very low and and just a marker of that is if you're eating a lion diet and you're not eating anything else and you're reducing stress and you're optimizing and maximizing sleep then yeah there's a metabolic issue and you are and likely your metab ism is very low and you need to just give it time to heal and watch Kelly Hogan for that she went through that herself she's dealt with that a lot herself and and people that she's helped and uh she has a she has videos on that like we talked about it on our interview uh when she was on my channel and she also did a a video dedicated to that with Charles Washington who's been you know carnivore for like I don't know 15 years 20 years something like that long time and and they talk about it and just it just takes time for some people and there can be a lot of reasons for that some which you can measure and some which not really easy to measure and um and some we may not even know about but yeah you can definitely check for things you check your thyroid check your TSH free T4 and free T3 because the free T3 is what actually does the job so it doesn't matter what your TSH and T4 are if your T3 is low you're low and so you want to look at that whole picture um and and even that it's not it's not 100% accurate so there's other so if you're symptomatic for low thyroid probably would improve with a bit of bit of thyroid medication um but that can affect your metabolism also fasting insulin is very important and leptin is very very important if people have elevated leptin it can be very difficult to lose weight until that leptin comes down and that's generally a sign of a damaged and slowed metabolism and so if you have that if you have elevated leptin just just understand okay well that's where my body that's where my body is right now and and that's just going to come down on a carnivore diet on a line diet it will come down but it takes time it can take months and so that just needs to come down down down down down that gets to a nice low level or back to normal you will you will have a very quick turnover and you'll start losing weight and and that's um and there's other things that are going to be involved there too but as that leptin comes down these other things start to improve as well so I've seen that to be a very useful marker of of metabolism and and uh understanding slow weight loss or even a bit of weight gain also remember that if you're working out if you're lifting weights if you're doing sprinting which I encourage people to do if they're able to um that this will make you put on muscle and bone and those all have weight and so you offset the amount of fat that you're losing you may even gain weight but your body composition is Chang so it's not as useful to look at the scale the scale is not really important your health is number one important your body composition is very distant second and SCA the scale does not make make the chart right so you can just take pictures once a month uh we're we're coming up to the first of the month we're the first of the month in in Australia so just take a picture today and you know and uh you know being able to see your body as much as possible take a picture in the mirror now and then just do your thing don't get on the scale don't do anything like that just focus on how you feel and your health and then next month on the 1 take another picture and then next month take another picture and just just wait just be patient it will happen you'll do fine if you want to check your blood results that's fine you can also check you know your B12 vitamin D zinc magnesium almost everybody is going to be low on that and if you haven't been on a cornivore DI for a long time you will be um to the extent that the reference ranges are now too low as well because the reference ranges just the average for the local community uh that they've tested that's why every lab has a different uh reference range and so um if you're in the normal range for all those things you're low right you need to be up at the upper edge of that even a bit above the reference range for B12 you have to be above the reference range if you're not high on if your B12 isn't High you're low that's all there is to it so in Australia and most of the world it's in Europe Etc it's um 800 to 12200 is where you want to be for B12 and that should be pea moles per liter and um and Below 400 is a critical deficiency where you can actually get brain shrinkage and neurological damage and Nerf damage so and that's you know the range here is like 130 to 650 in England and in much of Europe it's like 130 to 540 so the majority of that range is is you're getting brain damage and so like so one of the world has gone mad um uh no one's brain works anymore and um you know in America it's um 1100 to 1600 is where you want to be it's going to be way higher than whatever their range is and Below 540 is is a critical deficiency where you can get brain drink and nerve damage so you check all those things just make sure you're you're doing well you know early on you know may be that you need a bit more liver to to boost those things up you may need to take a bit of supplements to sort of get you up there quicker and your body can heal faster um but eventually with just meat and especially with a bit of organs like liver and even kidney and heart but liver has a ton of B12 folate and everything else um you'll you'll catch you'll catch up quicker and then they organs are nature's multivitamin so you don't need to take supplements but if you don't want to take um organs then you should probably take a bit of supplements but you don't need much you just in the beginning generally people need to catch up and then after that you can just sort of maintain eventually you'll get you'll catch up anyway uh most people some people have nutritional absorption issues malabsorption issues but just see how you go just test see where you're at and see what you need to do and adjust accordingly Lena thank you for the Super Chat should I do a 7-Day fast for weight loss I gained a ton on Carnivore because I let myself go crazy I don't do any artificial sweeteners or coffee um well I don't know what you mean by um going crazy on Carnivore um because you should just be eating meat as as as your body dictates and um so you know I don't know uh what you mean by that but I would just I would just eat meat you know if you if you if you do a 7-Day fast I don't recommend fasting for people um the main benefit you get from fasting is just not eating the wrong things and you're not eating the wrong things on Carnivore and so you're you're going to let your body heal um but if you fast especially for significant periods of time you're going to actually suppress your metabolism you're telling your body you're in a famine and you're just like NOP we got to we've got to survive this famine and um and so it's going to actually lower your metabolism so you'll lose a bit of weight you will lose weight at first and then you'll gain it back when you start eating again and you'll yo-yo die right so what we don't we don't want to suppress your metabolism we want to encourage your metabolism by eating proper food and eating a proper amount and so you let your body tell you and then you're showing your body hey look we're not in a famine we have an abundance of energy we have everything available and it can take time um you check again you can check your fasting insulin your fast and your leptin and other sorts of markers uh like I discussed earlier and um and see where you're at and and um but eventually your body will heal it will get better and you'll lose weight and again you know look at Kelly Hogan and um and her videos on that because she addresses that directly most people do lose weight uh straight away some people don't and there's a reason for that but eventually they do you just need to give it time um I really only recommend fasting or or you know dis discuss fasting at all in the context of cancer you know and that that can be a useful tool but you know people like Sophia Clemens from paleo medicina she doesn't she likes to do basically calorie restricted uh lion diet with organs or cornivore Diet with organs um very strict carnivore diet with organs um and then you just limit the amount that you're bringing in every day but she doesn't fast she doesn't doesn't want people fasting um so you know I don't I don't think it's necessary certainly for uh just everyday people um if you're going to use it for like medical interventions like cancer that's one thing but everyone else I think you just eat meat I think you just listen to your body and and eat that and just let let your body get on with it it's a bit scary when you're putting on weight and everyone else isn't but as long as you are just eating fatty meat and you're eating until it it stops tasting good and you're not on medications uh that are going to make you overeat like prazone hydrocortisone those sorts of things um then you just let your body get on with it and um you know it'll it'll sort itself out and watched Kelly Hogan for for um for more information on that and and some encouragement because it you know it is a thing um and it and you will get through it so good luck with that Ellie thank you for the Super Chat how you know if actually hungry or just want to eat yeah good question if um you know some people just get bored and just they're just used to snacking and just like oh well I'm watching TV obviously I need to eat something um if if you try to eat meat and it doesn't really taste good you're not hungry you know so you know if you if you're feeling snacky or something like that you know try eating meat if it tastes good okay you're hungry you just keep eating until it stops tasting good uh it's sort of during the day and you don't want to be lethargic for the rest of the day then you know then you just want to um eat like sort of a half meal and and not so much that you get tired um but if it's at later in the day and you don't have you know to work out or finish working for the day then just eat eat until it stops tasting good and um and if you are just s of being like oh maybe I should eat and you start eating something you're like I'm not really enjoying the meat then uh then you're not hungry drink some water fill up your stomach sometimes you just your stomach's empty and people are just they're used to like oh my stomach's empty so that means I have to eat my stomach has to be constantly full it doesn't actually and so um you know just just go on that and that's how you tell if you're you're sort of bored or hungry uh Chris Christian Atkins thank you for the Super Chat thanks Dr chaffy uh you changing lives do you think that it is worthwhile testing or treating for parasites well thank you very much I really appreciate that um as as to parasites not necessarily I mean you it looks like you're from Australia so um the the you know unless you're eating Wild game uh the the meat here and in in the rest of the western world and you know other places that this is um regulated like this uh almost non-existent parasites um like even in pigs in in domesticated pigs in America I don't think there's been a parasite infection or trinos um found in domesticated pigs for um 25 years now something like that so it's been pretty pretty well eradicated in the domestic uh animal population but if you're having GI issues and um and they're just sort of ongoing or you're having other sorts of symptoms that you're worried about parasites uh then you you certainly can you know you can get like a you stool send off a stool um sample for a test um and uh and just see what happens if you're but if you're concerned about a parasite you know talk to your doctor and and tell them why you're concerned and um and see and see what they think and they'll ask you appropriate questions and try to get to the bottom of it and um you know I don't I don't see people on Carnivore getting a whole bunch of parasite problems i' I've seen people that come to carnivore who have already had parasite problems but you know I mean there there are plenty of worm eggs in in dirt and you're good luck getting all the dirt off of vegetables and produce and fruit and things like that um they're they're highly contaminated um the the majority of food poisoning cases uh in America and elsewhere come from produce items not from meat and from the meat it's from food handlers or someone didn't wash their hands and then made your hamburger or something like that it was not from the meat itself um it's never from the meat itself really I mean like I guess you know not processing chicken properly and and having some raw chicken sort of get on things you can you probably have some problems but not from bee for lamb um and U as long as you're you're preparing it properly and not contaminating it yourself me's not going to cause any of this problem any of these problems and um so and certainly not parasites but um you know just if you're concerned about it then just have a chat with your doctor and and let them know why and they can they can do the appropriate investigations but I I don't think as a main stay that every person on Carnivore needs to check for parasites if they're if if they're not symptomatic s thank you very much for the the extremely generous Super Chat thank you so much uh s says got covid last year had severe concussion and depression for three months I'm very sorry to hear that tried two to three days of water fast uh sun exposure grounding for four months and reduced my symptoms but gained five kilos and one inch on my waist how to stop weight gain and alleviate symptoms further Ketone uh possibly Ketone supplements thank you well first of all I'm very sorry to hear that um concussion uh can be quite devastating there is there is uh research out there say showing that high dose creatine can be helpful for a short period of time you know like a couple days so you're taking I think it was up to 60 grams but uh you know you know look look for the study and the protocol on that because it's not something that i' I've used in my patient population it's just something that I've um You Know spoken to Dr Paul Mason about and um he should have videos on that but U from what I remember him telling me it was 60 60 grams of creatine a day for like five days or something like that and that could really help with concussion and um and recovering from a head injury um it might be a little you know after the fact you know that you that you've had this concussion um and it may not do all that much but you know there's there is a lot of creatine in meat and if you're eating predominantly red meat you'll get about five grams of creatine a day for the average red meat consumer and obviously that goes up and down depending on how much you eat and the weight gain um is interesting I I don't know how long you've been doing it doesn't actually specifically say you're on Carnivore but I sort of assume you are because you're here and asking me questions uh but if you're not do that uh that can help I mean yeah you know doing fasting is is is fine for certain circumstances but remember that if you fast for a long time you are going to slow down your metabolism and you will um your your body will want to put back on that fat afterwards if your metabolism is low so you want to encourage your your metabolism you want to eat fatty meat and nothing else and then you're telling your body hey look we have all this nutrition we're fine and um and then your metabolism actually ramps up and you can uh tend to lose weight you probably don't need to take Ketone supplements if you're not eating any carbohydrates because you you'll be in a ketogentic state and you you'll always be making ketones in in that state so you probably don't need to do that and and I mean as far as as far as the symptoms of depression I mean a lot of people are are are just finding it just by by doing these dietary interventions these dietary changes uh that can significantly help their depression you know from like Co if you're if you're concerned that you have long covid you know sometimes they have you know these um Spike proteins just stay in your body and they can cause uh damage ongoing to your your brain and cause you know horrible symptoms of depression and all these sorts of things and um there's a Dr Peter McCulla who I saw uh had a protocol and it's like a published protocol on how to try to get this stuff out of your system so that's something you can think about doing as well and um that probably has some herbs and other sorts of things that I normally would never take but again it's medicinal right so you can take plants medically but you don't take medicine every day on the off chance that something might come up right you don't take antibiotics every day because well they have good antibiotic effects they're good against bacteria I like okay well if you don't have a bacterial infection you probably not a good idea to take antibiotics right and so the same thing goes with plants that have antimicrobial properties right because they're like well no you need microbes you know we're we're we're half microb you know they're they have a lot of oral gut microbi microbes that uh that are actually important important to have and then you're taking in garlic and that's killing them that's actually causing harm so I would just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good I would encourage your metabolism I wouldn't worry about fasting I would take a look at Peter mulla's uh protocol and see if that's something that that you think would help with you and I would continue the sun exposure I would continue getting out in the sun in the morning you know getting out U and and sort of getting your skin exposed to the Sun as much as possible getting light in your eyes sort of looking in the direction of the Sun not at the sun don't hurt your eyes and um don't put on sunscreen or wear sunglasses just let your body be in the Sun and uh you know grounding too I don't know much about grounding you know from people I've spoken to sounds like a good idea but um you know do it if you want to and um uh not hurt anyway you know um unless you're in some sort of endemic area where there's like little hookworms and they go up into your feet but that's not most of the world so and it's not in a it's not in most places in Australia I don't I don't believe so I would just continue doing that you've seen improvements um by doing those things keep doing those things but I I probably wouldn't wouldn't think that the fasting is is as helpful as just eating properly so just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good good uh focus on just ruminant meat that's going to most people will do best on ruminant meat um you could try adding in a bit of of creatine if you don't want to do 60 grams you can do a smaller amount just like normal five grams a day or something like that and just make sure your body has an ample supply of this stuff and and then yeah just eat properly and um your body will sort itself out as long as you're not on medications that are going to make you gain weight as well because that can people can take an um these psychoactive drugs that that are for depression anxiety and other sorts of problems that we face and they can absolutely make you gain weight as well and so if you're on those medications and you and they might be a culprit for weight gain you talk to your doctor about how to safely come off if that's appropriate for you and uh but otherwise if every if you're not on any medications you don't have a particular reason why um you would inappropriately gain weight like Cushings Disease or something like that that then uh then just do all of that just eat fatty red meat until it stops tasting good and let your body let your body heal give it a chance to heal and just like the last two people that we discussed sometimes people do gain weight before they start losing weight and they just need to let their body heal and so it will eventually just give it time and um you know good luck with that I hope it feel I hope you feel better soon and Terry thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat as well it's very kind of you hi Dr jaffy could you speak about meat being acidic Dr James uh Nicol Antonio did a video the other day stating that we need to be supplementing potassium and sodium bicarbonate with a meat heavy diet I'm confused thanks well I I haven't seen his video on that so I I can't really comment um uh but no no um uh I this this is so funny to me you know people saying oh it's acidic and you have to what's acidic about meat you know is it is it does it burn your mouth when you eat it no so it goes in your body and and produces acid okay where why and how and uh and what does that do is it going to change your pH in your blood not likely because if your blood pH goes out of the very narrow range of 7.35 7.45 you die right so you get very sick first and then you die if that doesn't correct uh so no uh meat does not cause any of this any of this sort of nonsense it's is not acidic it's not going to burn your mouth it's not going to burn your stomach it's not going to lower your blood pH I have not taken sodium or potassium I don't even use salt anymore um and I only eat meat and I certainly don't take sodium bicarb and um I'm still here you know and um my blood pH is still normal you know how I know because I am still here and I'm not dead um and you do die if your blood pH goes just a 7.3 that doesn't change you're dead um so no I don't believe that for one second I don't know what he was discussing on that or the context of that so I don't know but the whole idea of it being acidic and then it was say we just eat plants instead there's actually there's actual acid in Plants citric acid why have vegans ever heard of this thing you know ascorbic acid all these sorts of things these are acids they're actual acids and um you know and then you eat carbohydrates and that actually increases the acid production in your stomach oh that's good H so now it's too acidic and you get reflux and gastritis and all these sorts of things so uh no no the problem comes when you eat things besides meat that's a problem we've been eating meat as a species since we've been a species the whole time and uh didn't have a whole bunch of sodium bicarb available didn't have a GNC to go pop down and you know methusa wasn't going down to you know the local supplement market and the nutrients you know Market art to to to get this sort of crap you you just ate food you know uh Lions don't need it either oh my God it's so acidic and that's why 70% of all animal species on Earth are carnivores a good thing for sodium bicarb good thing that Lions go down to the you know the lion supplement store and get their sodium bicarbon potassium uh no I don't I don't think for a second that that any of that is true uh we have uh examples right now of people living in the Arctic Circle who have no access to plants and and certainly no access to supplements and they exclusively eat meat or near exclusively eat meat and certainly ex exclusively ate meat uh historically like the Inuit and nette and others still alive and kicking and uh no supplements and all of our ancestors going through the ice ages what what are you what are you eating in the Arctic Circle during an Ice Age besides me what what is there to eat um and uh for the people to say no no no everyone was running away towards the equator that's where all the fruit and berries were nonsense the fossil record is very clear that we went up into the ice when the ice shells were coming down we were going up homohabilis did that two million years ago two plus million years ago and uh and there were a lot of other examples of uh of humans in the Arctic Circle during the ice ages going back quite a far away I just actually just reading articles um that uh that humans were in the Arctic Circle a lot earlier than people thought uh previously we're finding more and more records of what of chopped up butchered Mammoth bones that were clearly eaten by humans because they're using stone tools and things like that to cut them up and and eat them so you know uh no I don't I don't think for a second that meat is doing anything un toward in our body and certainly not making us acidic there are no acids uh to speak or meat is not acidic I should say and um and it's not going to make your body more acidic than it's supposed to be it's our physiological diet that's that's what we're supposed to eat so um again can't can't speak to to what James said I have no idea what he said so could very well been you know a nuanced uh discussion that you know mean something else but uh no you're not going to get hurt eating meat and you you don't need supplements um besides just the the nutrients that you are already deficient in leading into this like if you're if you're B12 is at 200 you should get a shot you know you should take supplements that is critically low and um you know eventually you'll catch up just eating meat some people have absorption issues uh some people have damaged themselves with autoimmunity and and and won't get all this stuff in and so that's the only thing you need to supplement with um and generally you just get that from a bit of liver to catch you up and then you just maintain after several years on Carnivore diet I checked my blood them all my my vitamin and mineral levels were all ideal you know and that was and I I was never eating liver or anything like that I mean a couple times you know some people you know may need a bit more because they're not going to process this as well they're not going to absorb it as well so liver is a great idea but you know in in in an appropriate amount uh and especially when you're starting out you're going to be deficient you just are and so you know you you want to catch up with either supplements or nature supplements which is um you know organs and I don't think you need to take the desiccated stuff certainly not advocating for those just eat organs you know because they're hell of a lot cheaper you have a whole bottle of of desiccated liver and uh it's like 60 bucks and it's a piece of liver that big you know in all those pills so it's just like just eat liver uh it's it's good for you and um you know it's a lot cheaper to do it that way it doesn't taste that bad stop being a baby just do it uh th had a question uh mom is trying to come off insulin gradually uh basically keto working out almost 75 sugars dropped to 67 last night what should she do when that happens well she needs to work with her diabetic nurse she needs to work with her uh Diabetic Care team um and so that's really important and um so you know she needs to be able to to modulate her sugars in a way that uh you know that she you know if her sugars are that low you know insulin uh can come down you know because uh she's gonna she's making her own blood sugar now and now it's just a matter of having enough insulin to to get it in her body with insulin resistance um it sounds like um and so it sounds like it's a type two situation diabetes type two as opposed to type one so um you know 67 isn't all that low that's not like a critical emergency if she has ketones you can always get it like a little Ketone monitor thing she has ketones brain's running on ketones you know so 67 is okay as long as she's feeling okay you know you don't need to do anything if if she actually does take too much insulin and she is feeling off you know drink some milk drink some whole milk there's there's carbs in there you know um and uh you know that's that's probably better than whatever but you know any port in a storm you know if you don't have access to that you know just and she's actually sick from having taken too much insulin you know then uh then um you know whatever you got to do you got to do for that instance and then you get back on track um but you know just work with she needs to work with her doctor and her diabetes nurse and uh and their team in order to reduce this down just say hey I'm I'm I've changed my diet I've cleaned it up and I don't need as much insulin and I'm my my insulin levels are dropping lower I go okay well this is what you do in those circumstances um so basically you're just you're just weaning yourself off and so you you know you you keep your blood sugar in a in a normal range and an actual normal range because some studies say like oh no you don't want diabetics to actually have good blood sugar control because that could that could be dangerous for them um that comes from a study that used aggressive insulin therapy to to lower uh hb1c and blood sugar and keep it under control all the time but people were just eating anything they were like yeah eat whatever you want but just eat take a buttload of insulin to make sure that that keeps it down and she giving these people massive quantities of insulin and and people were dying the people that had better blood sugar control actually were dying and uh and getting sick and so that's not because their blood sugar was under control that was because they were getting way too much insulin and that's damaging their body so aim for a good optimal blood sugar range and just adjust insulin into that regard with the care of her team because that I can't stress that enough you know she needs to have do this under doctor's supervision she's on she's on medication that uh if Tak it inappropriately you know can can cause harm even coma and death uh in extreme circumstances so this is something that has to be done under medical supervision so definitely talk to her team about that um it it's a patriot it's something Patriot anyway Mr Patriot or Mrs Patriot um thanks Dr chaffy for all you do we appreciate these lives and the time you give to the movement oh well thank you very much I appreciate that it's very kind of you um yeah well thank you I I you know I I like doing it too it's nice to talk about these things otherwise I'm just uh you know boring L to tears and and upsetting her so it's probably good that I have an outlet to talk about with other people too so thank you I'm glad to appreciate it speaking of of little El Marie she gave a Super Chat as well it's nice to see you all um L says hello everyone hello Dr chaffy very formal again um oh there's a little um Accent on it so chff um I'm so grateful for you I have to watch the replay because I'm working thank you for everything you do well thank you very much for for stopping by and saying hello and um yeah than it's very nice to see you too I hope you like the replay and the and the bits that you get to see Alan uh D denado thank you for the Super Chat uh carnivore for four months and I just had lab work doctor said I'm iron deficient he ordered new labs new Labs came back showing the same thing he's prescribed iron what uh might be happening um just there be a lot of things um you know Iron studies are a bit a bit tricky uh because they have a number of different sorts of parts of that iron studies that could show that you have enough iron but you're like sequestering iron or you just don't have enough iron and your body's using it in different ways um that um that uh you know may may make it appear as if you have low iron or functionally have low iron but there's something there and there's something else going on but people can have absorption issues certainly and it can take a long time to come back from these things four months is actually pretty good um as long as you're actually your carnivore carnivore and you're not taking that with anything else a lot of plants have anti-nutrients and so if you're having things like you know bits of salad and all these other sorts of things you know that that can buy and block out the absorption of iron and lower your iron levels so as long as you're not doing that as long as you're actually carnivore as opposed to keto or or or animal-based you know you're actually just eating meat and only drinking water uh then then that's fine um if you are a bit deficient could be that you have an absorption issue U meat you know from heem Iron definitely has the most bioavailable form of iron and so that can definitely help red meat's going to have more of that than the other meats and and um liver is going to have basically probably the best amount of that go for the Messi you can drink blood that would be get ton of iron that way um probably get Molina as well but who knows maybe you wouldn't and um uh you could take an iron supplement too you know it's uh you know you want you do want to get enough iron so whatever reason it's probably an absorption issue and um and so just having more bioavailable iron is is good you know if you add in liver and you add in an iron supplement and you're still low then you might actually be have like an actual serious uh disorder that you can't absorb iron properly and you have a a serious malabsorption issue at which case you might you might need a transfusion you I mean there are medical conditions that that happen even to carnivores and so if that's the case then you know just you know your doctor's on top of it from the sounds of it saying hey let's start with a supplement if you take a supplement you're eating carnivore adding in liver and uh that brings it up great job done don't worry about it uh if it doesn't then there's clearly a malabsorption issue and you're not going to be able to get a sufficient amount of of iron from your diet and you probably would need a transfusion at least in the short term just to bump you up and hopefully keep you there but keep an eye on it excuse me so um so just you know focus on red meat add in liver add in the supplement as well see you go in a couple months and just take it from there but yeah sounds like a Mal malabsorption issue uh Co D thank you for the Super Chat you say HGH is released when we sleep and Insulin Spike reduces this well glass of milk before bed cause enough of a spike to be a problem 21 grabs and carbs total yeah you know it's not going to help and so um you know some people some people do take a bit of of carbs in from milk uh or elsewhere I would prefer milk myself uh to help sleep I sleep great I've never slept better in my life uh when I've done this especially with like a sleep mask that I wear I'm like God it's amazing different and the blue blocking glasses those actually those actually make a big difference too and um but some people do say that they feel better with carbs and then I talked to other people that say that uh they they need a bit of carbs to go to sleep and then they just they abstain and they get away from it and after a while they actually end up sleeping fine so it could be a transition period that you can go through and feel better but um yeah it's not going to it's not going to do [Music] um as much as if you had like a whole plate of pasta and a bunch of bread but it will raise your insulin a bit and it will it will uh reduce the efficacy of growth hormone because it is it it blocks the action of growth hormone so it's not as active it's not as useful it's not going to stimulate as much igf-1 and that's not going to let it do its job either so um yeah you go if you if you absolutely have to get some milk and and a bit of carbs to to go to sleep fine but I have seen people that that eventually they get away from that and as long as they just don't they just don't take any for a while you know after a week or two they're able to to go to sleep pretty normally so that would be ideal you know if if not then it's still you know a lot better than what most people are doing and a lot better than what you've probably done before and so you'll still be in in a good shape you know uh in a lot of ways so um yeah you go but um I I don't do that anyway and um that's one of many reasons I mean insulin insulin affects over a hundred different things including your growth hormone but over a hundred other things too and so when that insulin goes up it's affecting all those things at an elevated rate elevated level and it's out of balance and it's not necessarily what you want so I just I would just keep that in mind uh also everyone um I I need to be gone gone uh how do here by by 12:00 because I have an appointment and um so let me see um Sheila and I'm not seeing a message from Sheila but thank you for the Super Chat Sheila um let me see how many super chats do I have a number of them why don't we turn off super chats for now and uh try to get through all of these and if I still have a bit of time we can open up a bit again and answer some questions at the end but um this is this is a good chunk of of um of uh of of questions to get get going on anyway okay so Rosco Patterson thank you for the Super Chat uh friend has Alpha gal syndrome what should they do uh yeah so just avoid red meats just to eat the meats that don't have um the uh what is it Alpha galactose that um is the carbohydrate on red meat that they react to um but you can eat other meats you can eat white meat you can eat chicken I believe you can eat pork uh and fish and eggs I believe so you can you can still eat meat um it's just like the ruminant Meats like the red meats are things that you probably can't do um but from speaking to other people like Dr Barry and others uh apparently it uh it does go away eventually so after you know six months or so or year uh who knows I don't I don't know but um but they were saying sort of like several months down the track six months or so down the track uh that that that that sensitivity goes away so hopefully that is the case but you can absolutely still do carnivore you just have to avoid the red meats so just avoid the meats that that they react to um you can look that up you can look up what has the the little uh carb that they're reacting to and which which Meats don't have that and then you just eat those but yeah it's usually it's usually the red meats that you have to avoid and the rest should be okay good luck to your friend hopefully hopefully they do well and um and get back to eating steaks because Stakes are great Susie Chanel says uh hello Dr C love your videos it's been uh eye opening I've been a carnivore for a year now and show massive improvements in my health any thoughts about what is the cause of getting lots of dandruff thank you uh dandruff can usually be from like a local fungal infection um so sometimes you can use like something that has like fluconazol and just soaks in and and sort of just gets it that little little thing sometimes you know people have other skin issues you know ex Simon psoriasis and things like that they can get on their scalp but usually after a year on a carnivore diet it usually gets better especially if you're on just a lion diet so just red meat and water does pretty well um but yeah usually it's just a bit of a local local dryness from just a bit of a local fungal infection and you can um yeah also use you know different moisturizers things like that it's sort of hard to put Tallow and emu oil in your hair but you know people have been doing it for thousands of years they used to put oils in the hairs and that was very healthy for it and um but yeah I would I would sort of maybe see if you're having some sort of skin issue making sure that you're just on line diet getting enough fat and um maybe use one of those medicated shampoos to take care of any little fungal infections you have to sort of let them soak in there for five or 10 minutes and then um do that sort of every day for a while and and hopefully that helps too so good luck with that um the marketing bloke thank you for the Super Chat any advice for hemocromatosis on Carnivore well I just I'd still do it um I have seen people improve their iron levels and because it it's not about getting too much iron it's about how your body metabolizes the iron that's coming in right because even when people like just avoid eating iron like the plague their levels still go up because they just accumulate this stuff and so generally people need to give blood every now and then periodically to to lower down their hemoglobin and then they use iron to make more hemoglobin and that sort of lowers their their iron levels as well so um still do that uh as needed but I have seen people on Carnivore who have stopped having to uh give blood I don't know if that's going to be for everybody this is just a few isolated examples that I've seen but I have seen it and so this is this is somehow allowing your body to you know you're just getting out of your body's way to so it can run properly and it's and it's now um appropriately uh metabolizing your your iron so uh that can definitely happen um but just keep doing what you're doing right you need to get your your blood test every now then check your iron levels if they get too high you give blood same thing keep doing that if you're able to reduce the frequency of of blood draws great uh if you're able to eliminate them even better but either way you just keep doing what you're doing and you eat a carnivore diet and you end up getting all the benefits from from the carnivore diet of of uh excellent health and optimizing your health and and Longevity and all these different sorts of ways and hopefully improving your hemocromatosis but if it doesn't then you just keep dealing with it the same way I've always dealt with it and um and then you get all the other benefits on top of it which makes life with hemocromatosis a hell of a lot easier to deal with too so uh yeah that would be my advice uh Mia dime thank you for the Super Chat I very I really appreciate it uh greetings from the UK lamb and beef only finally bones painfree after 45 years of pain that's amazing uh thank you for everything you do well that's fantastic me I I really uh I'm really glad to hear that and thank you very much for sharing that and and so generously giving a Super Chat to share that that's absolutely fantastic and that's it's always great to hear these these wonderful success stories um because they're just it's just there's a lot of them but they they never get old they're just it's always so amazing to see what the body can do and just see these these issues that people have their whole life and they they suffer their whole life needlessly it's it's it's needless human suffering I mean this is is an actual crime against humanity I mean that's we have we have we have you know treaties International treaties to reduce and criminalize you know wanting uh human suffering and um and that's and that's just staple and and now we're reversing this you know things that people say oh no no you can't do that and they say now do oh well that's just from losing weight from a calorie deficit okay idiot you don't you don't reverse Crohn's disease from a calorie deficit and losing weight morons like you just don't you know you don't reverse these diseases like that you know and a lot of times even when people you know a lot of people don't have weight to lose they're already at a normal BMI and they and then they have all these diseases and they're eating you know a clean omnivorous diet or even a plant-based diet and they have massive health issues they drop the plants what do you know all the problems go away so no it has it is not because they've lost weight or in a caloric deficit a lot of people are you know eating more calories than they were before I certainly was um I was I was limiting the hell out of what I was eating and um I was constantly hungry didn't feel good wasn't losing weight and and then I started and just dropped the veggies and started quintupled the amount of calories I was taking in and lost 23 pounds in in two weeks right and then my body just you know was transforming so no it's complete nonsense what those people saying and you're living proof of that so you know you had 45 years of pain doing what they told you to do and oh well you just have pain that's just your life that's just what it is no that's not what it is that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] so you know good job you know taking the taking the plunge and trying this for yourself and um and reversing 45 years of pain that's really good to hear thank you so much for that and you know they can they can just lie and Gaslight all they want people aren't listening you know they're trying this for themselves and they're seeing the proof of it and they're okay it doesn't matter what that idiot says Unfortunately they are convincing some people uh and that's really sad because those people are getting hurt because of that and that that bothers me but you know what you know not you so that's good and um and hopefully not not the rest of you either because it works and you want to see the proof of that try it do it for a month do it for three months you'll get better you know if your if your primary out outcome is weight loss you know that happens for most people right away other people it takes longer uh but but you should look at your health first and foremost and so you know People's Health improved dramatically pretty early on and so you know if you give this you give this a shot your health will improve your life will improve some people do take a bit longer the vast majority of people feel a lot better very quickly so you focus on those good things you focus on the improvements even if it's not your main end point that's improving yet look at all the things that are improving and that can give you motivation to keep going because eventually you will H your main end point um you know for your health I mean there's some things that that diet's not going to fix you know like you you know lost a limb or something like that's not going to regrow you know but there are and so there are real things that really happen to people that don't have anything to do with nutrition but nutrition deals with a lot a lot and so um you you'd be surprised so you'll get a lot of benefit and so just do that and uh you will feel better and um just focus on that and you'll do great okay uh so there's a question from from Sheila from earlier from her Super Chat so thank you Sheila onee carnivore but now I got dandr for my scalp is super dry um I think yeah we we spoke about that um with a with another question uh yeah we did and so yeah I would just um I would just you try conditioner you try uh different emu oil things like that you if you don't want your hair greasy then you maybe just some some uh conditioners that you might use um and uh and if you're getting dandruff things like that you know just remember that it could be a bit of a of a fungal infection that um that you should you know use medicated shampoo for and um so you know think about that and and if you have like a bit of eimo or psorasis in your scalp or something like that just go red meat and water and then I would put Tallow or em oil on that as well because that can really help with h those skin conditions Steve oh hey buddy where's little cat oh didn't know he was even in here hey little guy okay so um Steve lar thank you for the super chat um hi doctor I'm confused on fat intake one pound of rii has 98 grams of fat and 108 grams of protein how do I get two to one grams of fat uh to protein ratio well not everybody needs to um but you yeah it's it's a lot isn't it um egg yolk just on their own have that 2 to one fat protein ratio um with egg whites it's less than one to one less than one gram of fat to one gram of protein and then so you can have a riye you can melt butter into that if that's not enough but if that's enough if your if your stools are soft and you're absorbing you know you're absorbing all this and there's a bit extra to keep your stool soft you know and you're not doing anything else so no coffee tea artificial sweeteners uh um you magnesium supplements metformin or other medications like that then um you know then uh then you know your body has enough fat you know you can add butter to that grass-fed butter to that you can also add um trim fat trimmings from uh from The Butcher and get that and um dice it up fry it up and put it uh put it with the meat and that can help too but just get the uh the fat that's right for you you know a lot of people riy is perfect um if you think that you need a bit more if you're getting a bit constipated or bit harder stools you know add fat in one of those ways and and you should be good okay so Gunther SB thank you very much for the generous Super Chat it's very um I appreciate it thank you very much hi Dr chaffy uh if doing lion um if I can't get organs or much sunlight is it okay to take a consumer lab tested and approved daily multivitamin the specific one I had in mind is pure encapsulations one multivitamin um so I'm not I'm not familiar with that so I I don't know what's in that um but sure you know you know if you think that you you're not quite getting enough you know most people don't need that you know if you're just doing alian diet most people will get um what they need from that you can always test so you can test your your vitamin D B12 uh folate uh magnesium zinc things like that you can check selenium almost no one checks selenium uh but it matters you don't want too much selenium because that can be harmful as well having too much of that uh but too little causes muscular distrophy in cows so what the hell is it doing to us at too low of a level um bet you it's not good so you can do that you may not need to do that I haven't taken multivitamins I don't worry about taking multivitamins if you're just starting out on a carnivore diet sure you know you can you can take something for a while but I don't think you need to do that for a long time my patients that that I put on a carnivore diet newly um I tell them that same thing I said look early on you're going to be deficient we check them and say look you are deficient on all these things you know so you know let's top those up I mean take these for a couple months and then we test you again look you're in good levels come off of those check you again in a few months look you're still in the good levels don't need to do anything if you are if you do that and you find that coming off the supplements as you sort of drooping down a bit and you don't want to do organs or you can't get them um and then adding in in you know some uh multivitamins you know that's fine if you want to boost that up a bit if your body needs that if you need just a bit more than meat provides just red meat good quality red meat is is going to do that for most people even just you know Safeway beef you know Costco beef you should should have um you know an abundance of these nutrients but they aren't the wild animals that we grew up eating and so the wild animals and the regeneratively raised grass-fed and finished animals tend to have more nutrients more micronutrients four to five times as much right and you know drinking you know Creek Water and things like that and have more minerals and and nutrients and Giardia and those sorts of things as well and um you know so so it may be that that just eating that meat is not good enough for everybody or it's not optimal for everybody so in that circumstance organs make a big difference and if you can't get organs then you know a a multi vitamin is is certainly uh reasonable if it if it as long as it as long as you need it you know most people don't though but if you do you do that's it's not a big deal as long as you're not getting too much and actually getting getting a problem there too remember that so Dez uh Dez H had a question says been carnivore for four years diagnosed with colitis three weeks ago um immediately dropped coffee cream and cheese have now been eating eggs fatty beef and water Dr Salsbury said no fat your opinion uh well well Salsbury did eat fatty added butter back in as well but the way they sort of ground the beef it sort of removed out the gristle and the fat comes with the gristle so I you could just take a steak and just sort of cut off the the the fat and then cut off and cut out the gristle and have the soft fat and the soft meat you'll absorb nearly 100% of that you know if you want to go even even more and basically have zero residue then you just have the the lean muscle meat with butter but you still need the fat you know it's just that when that comes with gristle and more tissue some of that tissue is not going to get fully absorbed and broken down and um and so that's going to come out and waste and so you'll have a very small amount of waste but it'll they'll still be some whereas if you're doing the sberry method it's like nothing's coming out and so you completely rest your bell um so I guess I guess it depends on what kind of colitis that you have um but uh you know if if we're talking about ulcerative colitis like an autoimmune condition um you know in you know sort of inflammatory reaction um or autoimmune reaction then uh yeah I would just I would just do beef and water i' even drop the eggs really and uh you just go red meat and water and that that usually sorts that out and then your antibodies just go straight down and we measure we can measure these things in a lot of autoimmune conditions and I see those all the time they just going right down but you need to be very strict just red meat and water and um grass-fed and finished is even better than that but i' I maybe come across one person that that um had to had to stick to Grass ven finished uh with autoimmune issues everybody else I've ever come across said they did AB fantastic and uh on on just store-bought um grain finished beef as well so uh yeah so that would be my opinion you know you just want to be on red meat and water and um you know and that that's going to reduce your um you know if you filter out all the gristle and and all that sort of stuff then you're going to have very low residue um but I read an article by Salsbury where someone was a newspaper said said oh this is how you do a sberry steak and he actually wrote in and say hey no that's not how you do it you have to do this in this very special way to filter out what it's called the fiber of the of the meat uh which is the gristle the you know the more fibrous thick connective tissue stuff that you don't really break down as much uh that like slow cooking will break that that down and then you absorb all of that um so it also depends on how you're cooking it but um and he said no this is really important because you have to rest the bowel they really can't handle anything coming out because some people they're their guts are just in such a bad State because they have just fluid you know ultr colitis or Crohn's diseases been they've been untreated their whole life and they're just I mean they're just bleeding copiously and they they just cannot handle anything coming out the other end right so that's when you need to do that just with collides in general if you're not in that state then just it's just strict red meat and water that's what you need to do but the main thing is is getting is that if you reduce the gristle you reduce your your output and so you'll just have you'll have much less waste coming out as um as a result and so you have much lower it'll be much just a much lower residue diet and um that's what that's for Leslie Shriver thank you for the Super Chat 55 year old uh female on HRT carnivore for 9 months A1C 5.6 now 6.1 possible side effect of progesterone uh raising blood sugar not sure what to do thanks for all you do well first of all a lot of people when they go on a carnivore diet uh women your age they actually you know feel a lot better and they don't necessarily need HRT so something to think about I do have patients your age who started menopause and and stopped having their periods in their late 40s who actually started having their periods again and um and so it's um it's uh it's you're in that that age range that that you could actually start uh you know go back into being fertile again so he ay be careful and um and so just think about that if you're feeling good and you're feeling great you you may not actually need to be on the HRT so think about that and think about that with your doctor and um and if it's causing other sorts of problems then uh maybe it's something you don't you don't want um A1C can fluctuate for a couple different reasons as well though um sometimes it doesn't line up perfectly with your actual blood sugar on the day it's supposed to be an average for three months but it's it's a very blunt instrument you know we don't really know what's going on on a day-to-day basis we don't even know if that's fully accurate because that assumes that your uh your red blood cells are living the exact ex act same amount as the other average person the average person's red blood cells probably aren't living as long as yours and there are a lot of reasons for that if you're eating plant fats they have plant sterols that gets that mimics cholesterol is close enough to cholesterol your body makes less cholesterol and then those sterols get used in the cell membranes of your red blood cells they're more stiff and they're more clunky and they don't live as long because if they're too stiff and they can't bend around corners your body just has to kill them take them out or else they'll cause blockages and so you know if your if your red blood cells are living three and a half months and it's being compared against the average person who only lives two and a half months then you're going to have an artificially higher hba1c someone's eating you know more plant-based diet with a lot of plant fats and they're only living two months as opposed to two and a half three months they're going to have an artificially low hba1c and it's not going to line up with your day-to-day measurements and so that's what you want to do you want to take your day-to-day measurements and if your blood sugar is in a normal range hb1c is uh not accurate it's not an accurate depiction of what's actually happening so I would just remember that as well and uh but yes absolutely medications can affect these things and so uh you know do think about you know do you want to be on all of these medications or are there some that you might want to come off so that's a something to think about Sharon Burns thank you very much for the super chat 65-year-old female very active strict carnivore for 8 months been lifting weights uh for three months lifting heavy to failure but minimal soreness building good muscle all muscle groups uh bil all good muscle all muscle group seems odd is that normal uh yeah yeah you don't get sore you really don't get sore on a carnivore diet if you're drinking coffee you'll get a little sore uh most people won't uh if they aren't eating anything U apart from meat and water so yeah that's totally normal um um so yeah I mean you're doing great um yeah it's funny you know um but yeah it seems odd that you're not getting sore and you're doing well but that's that's the thing you know it's it's normal that we feel sore because normally people are sick and they're eating the wrong thing um you're not supposed to be sore sore means something's wrong and um and we just don't realize that because it's just it's been normal it's like you know Romans with lead pipes are just yeah it's just normal your hair is supposed to bleed it's like no no it's not and you're not supposed to get sore after you work out either unless you've injured yourself so uh yeah so just keep going you know you know the cleaner you are on Carnivore um the less you'll be sore I don't get sore at all I mean I can tell when you know my muscles have done something you know I was in the gym yesterday and just like yeah okay yeah my muscles feel like they did something they're not sore they're not stiff they don't ache there nothing wrong um and uh you know so yeah so just enjoy it you know your body's working how it's supposed to work now which is a hell of a lot better than any of our bodies have worked before so good job uh jono uh Quintana thank you for the Super Chat how long to go uh back into it if I fell off um yeah so if you fall off you just you just hop right back on you know that that's fine you know it's uh uh people slip up it's not a big deal you know if you you know the quicker you get back on the easier it is you know as they say you know if you fall off a horse you have to get right back on you know because the longer you wait before you go up the more hesitant you are the and and the harder it is to get back going and and get your confidence back and so um you know just get right back on you fall off you just get right back on you're like okay you go out like oh I had something to Ste like oh crap now I'm going to feel like crap for the next couple days but that's okay I'm just going to I'll get through it and just get back on and you just use that you know when you when you eat something and it makes you feel bad uh because it will so you know focus on that see what what it does to you and think like okay I don't I don't like that you know I don't want to feel like that if you don't I don't certainly and that's and that's something that if if you're doing this for a reason think about those reasons like okay I don't feel good when I eat this stuff I ate this stuff that made me not feel good I don't want to do that I'm going to stay over here and U and you can use that to reinforce your behavior next time and and you'll be less likely to slip off the next time but if you do slip off you just get back on and so you know you know as they say um the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago and the second best time is right now so um you know it's best to not fall off at all but if you do fall off you get right back on and the best time to get back on is right away and the second best time is right now so just yeah just hop back on and uh it's okay you don't have to wean into it you can just drop the drop the junk and just start eating fatty meat and water you'll be fine um uh Bachelor Jr thank you for the Super Chat uh Dr C thank you for taking time with us oh well thank you I appreciate that it's um and thank you for taking the time to to watch you know it's like it's uh it's great to have you guys all here it's a it's a really good Community you know and everyone chatting and talking has been uh has been a lot of fun too and um uh and you know a lot of uh it's it's sort of fun to see all the conversations that people are having and sort of separate to all this as well so that's great Audra compol Longo thank you for the Super Chat I'm sorry if I mispronounced your name I'm sure I did hi there currently on um buproprion 300 milligrams and FX uh or for5 milligrams 29 days carnivore will I be able to get off the meds thank you it depends on what you're taking them for but um generally people significantly improve their depression anxiety mental health issues those sorts of things um and uh buproprion is is I mean sometimes used for um smoking sensation so I don't know what you're on those for but um most people can if we're if this is you know depression anxiety and those sorts of mood disorders uh yeah a lot of people do come off of that uh after after a month or so a lot of people feel a lot better after a couple months a lot a lot better because you have much stronger better more active and more mitochondria and uh and that helps your brain function properly and and so people don't feel as as um as down and they don't have as the same mental health issues anxiety depression OCD bipolar even schizophrenia ADHD autism all these things improve so that's uh that's great and um so when you feel good and you feel like hey I I feel fine maybe I don't need these anymore talk to your doctor about coming off of them um some of these things need to be weaned off I'm not sure about these two because I don't prescribe them um but I you know I you know I wouldn't want to tell you to just come off something uh if it if uh it's not appropriate to you so do talk to your doctor and um and and make sure that that you can you know how to how to come off in a in in a safe manner uh but when you're feeling good and you're feeling like you're like hey I feel healthy I feel happy everything's great you know that's when you start thinking of coming off your medications and uh and and I you know I would be very confident that you can and and will be able to so uh good luck with that and I hope it goes well uh Vash 06 thank you for the Super Chat any tips for trying to bulk on a carnivore diet well obviously you need to stimulate your muscle so you need to work out you need to work out to failure and and then you just need to eat enough um people say well you need a caloric Surplus a surplus means uh Surplus to demand means you store fat not muscle if you if you have enough food enough protein enough fat enough meat then you're going to build muscle just because you have more substrate doesn't mean you'll get more building you'll only you'll only build to what your body wants to build and then whatever's Surplus is Superfluous right it's extra and it gets stored as fat so don't listen to the the uneducated St eings of the world who only got a physique because he took massive amounts of steroids guy doesn't know what the hell he's talking about because he only knows things in the context of taking massive amounts of steroids um and so you know these sorts of people they they bulk up like crazy and they put on a lot of fat with their muscle and then they have to lose the fat and oh you have to lose muscle too that's non sense you're not putting on muscle in the first place you're only storing fat you're storing intramuscular fats called myosteatosis see this on MRIs every day you know so you know those people that don't look at MRIs every day they're not doctors they don't know what the hell they're talking about they're just going to say whatever the hell they're going to say and you know you can just safely ignore them um if it's a surplus then it's Surplus right so you need enough you need to eat enough so you eat enough meat you eat enough fat and then your body puts on weight and you'll put on muscle and you'll find on a carnivore diet it's never you'll never find it easier to put on lean body mass than on a carnivore diet you just need to lift weights you need to work out you need to Sprint and you need to eat a lot so you try to eat at least twice a day you eat until fatty meat stops tasting good you get to the point where you take a bite and it tastes like cardboard and you just go I'm done and then you're done you know your body knows how to do this you know not stand eorting stand eorting doesn't know anything um so you know this is um if you eat carbs and you bulk up like that yeah you'll put on weight but you won't put on muscle so do you want bulk do you want weight or do you want lean body mass do you want muscle mass because the way to do that is by eating meat and eating protein and so uh if you want to eat carbs you'll put on weight but it'll be fat your muscles will look bigger they'll be swellen because they'll have glycogen and every molecule of glycogen will take in draw in two molecules of water and you'll also lay down intramuscular fat like marbling on a on a steak that's how they get marbling in a steak they give them carbs right so you give them a bunch of grains that gets stored in as intramuscular fat myosteatosis uh which is just everywhere I mean anytime you look at an average person on a on an MRI they they're they're crippled with myosis and so that's what you're getting you're putting in intramuscular fat you're putting in glycogen you're putting in water weight and then so when you when you're doing your cut phase you're just losing all that fat water and glycogen that's it you never had the muscle in the first place so you will and you can check this with with dexa scans you know I mean the thing is dexa scans you know some of these body composition scores they'll actually um count water as as muscle mass so if you have more water in your muscles they'll say oh you have more muscle mass it's just water you know and so you will only get lean body mass by by eating uh um a carnivore diet if you eat carbohydrates you'll get some lean body mass you'll get a lot more fat though and so yeah just work out and um and uh and eat meat and that's it and you eat until it stops tasting good you make sure you're getting enough and you will put all muscle very quickly and very easily easier than you've ever done it before anyway so good luck with that uh John Paul Gonzalez thank you for the Super Chat do cheap cuts of meat like bottom round beef give the same healthy results if I was to buy a ribeye or something a better quality cut yeah it's the same it's the same animal yeah so what you want is you want the meat you want the fat so as long as you're getting enough fat absolutely it doesn't matter what cut just get the ones that you enjoy that you can afford but uh yeah cow is cow so you'll be fine I mean there's slight differences in the amount of protein and fat and cholesterol but it's it's it's not enough to make a big difference so you know the reason that riy is more expensive is because it's more tender and it's more flavorful than a lot of other Cuts but you can have a lot of really flavorful cuts that are very fatty like in the four quarters and the Chuck and all these sorts of things uh they're far less expensive they're just a bit more tough so it's that that's why the riy is is more expensive is because of that nutritional quality uh it's the same so yeah just e eat those those cuts that's perfect uh sky at thank you for the Super Chat hey I'm 27 severely underweight my entire life 49 kilos I want to go carnivore mostly for health benefits how do I gain weight on this diet so yeah so just like like the last one who was trying to bulk you just need to eat enough and so you know when you're underweight your body's going to have a high demand for food and so you don't go by your hunger or like oh I feel I could stop you go by taste you go by when you want to stop so you don't go by when you could stop you go by when you want to stop you keep eating tastes good it tastes tastes good it tastes good and then you finally get to B it's like it doesn't really taste good anymore that's when you want to stop so you do that you do that at least twice a day if your body's telling you to eat more than that you do more than that when you're underweight and your body wants to put on weight it it needs more and so I I interviewed a lady named Claire who was anorexic for um a number of years vegan and uh um an anorexic there sort of a lot of times that can be uh some Anonymous and she used veganism as a as a as a smoke screen for her anorexia oh there's nothing vegan here I can't eat no sorry I'm not going to eat because there's nothing vegan here and um I was okay I just won't eat and that's you know she was you know happy about that um so when she started going carnivore first of all her an anorexia went away and all her other health issues went away and uh she stopped being Osteo stopped having osteoporosis and she has normal bone density now um and so people oh you're going to get acidic and you're eating meat acidic is going to strip the calcium out of your bones like couldn't be more wrong if they tried and so she was eating like 8,000 calories a day at first right so she's a small person she she weighed less than you so um you know she needed a lot and her body was just so Mal nervous for so long that she just desperately needed all this nutrients all these nutrients so uh just eat what your body's telling you to eat and eat until it stops tasting good at least twice a day if your body's telling you more then do more and and you'll catch up and you'll put on weight and you put on healthy weight and that's the important thing love yourself lightly uh thank you for the Super Chat uh thank you for sharing your knowledge uh what are your thoughts on hi apple b on a carnivore diet LDL 194 insulin low glucose low feeling great yeah I would I would watch the um video that Dr Paul Mason has out U it's not on his channel someone else sort of took a clip of Paul Mason and put it out uh but it's like four minutes long and it's on Appo so just put put in uh YouTube Paul Mason spelled as it sounds and apple and it'll come up it's little four minute clip and I think it's on the channels like doctors to trust or something like that it's it's an it's a good Channel it takes little clips from from different people that are you know very uh uh you know important and power little Clips just like that and he talks about how Apple B test is is you're not testing for what you think you are there is healthy apple be on healthy cholesterol that that aren't a problem that's a normal surface marker and um and that's how your your liver uh recognizes it and draws it in and get and uses it and so you know if you get glycation and oxidative stress and you're stripping that off and you're damaging it um that's what people are saying oh well that's bad okay well you can't with that test it doesn't differentiate out between the ones that are healthy and the ones that are not healthy and so you don't know you have no idea if your LDL goes up your Apple is going to go up because there's apple b on LDL and so even if those are healthy your your apple b is going to go up um and um there are studies actually that I saw that like saturated fat higher saturated fat diets actually reduce apple and and raise um or sorry um what was it well I'm gonna I'm going to look that back up again because I don't want to I don't want to misquote the study but um either way it's not it's not an accurate test and also it's just shifting the goalpost they said oh it's the you know the sugar companies made up the idea that cholesterol caused heart disease they invented that and then they paid off people to say it they never came up with that themselves the sugar companies invented that as a scapegoat and then they pushed it and they paid off [\u00a0__\u00a0] like anel keys and and his Confederates over at Harvard those bastards and the only only reason I'm I'm I'm not happy that those people are dead now so that we can't put them on trial for crimes against humanity and execute them I I really feel strongly about this they they are responsible for more suffering and death than Hitler Stalin and Ma combined I mean it's absolutely disgusting what these people have done to the world um so you know and then we say okay well total cholesterol oh and then well that's not quite right it's LDL oh well there's like hundred different kind kind of LDL oh well it's sdldl well even then you know it's pretty weak Association and metabolic syndrome and diabetes are far stronger like oh it's zob oh it's just just shut up it's just shut up it's just not cholesterol that's what it is um so you know people well is can your LDL get too high probably but it's not ever going to cause heart disease because it's just not associated with it it's just not the culprit here um and so I think there a way of time looking at all these sorts of things but you can watch Dr Mason's video on that and he he explains why it's a it's a it's a Wast of time test to take uh Sojourner thank you for the super chat or super sticker that's very kind of you [Music] um uh Trader monkey thank you for the Super Chat I have blue eyes and developed yellow in the virus around the pupil I think you mean Iris around the pupil over decades blue is back yellow is gone after carnivore what is that thanks I don't know that's very interesting though I mean I have multicolored eyes they they are blue and green and the inside's green the outside's blue and then when they um when I'm in different moods or something like that they'll be more blue or they might be more green um just kind of cool I don't I don't know why the irises do that uh but it's kind of fun and U but certainly you know you're eating certain things and that can affect you know different nutrients can affect uh pigmentation and so it sounds like that's what's happening and then you start eating more healthy diet uh sort of reverse that out to what what you're supposed to be so uh I don't know the exact answer to that but that's really interesting and pretty cool that that's happened s thank you for the Super Chat for the very generous Super Chat it's very kind of you uh follow-up question uh on top of your other very generous Super Chat uh thank you follow-up question I'm I've been on Carnivore for three plus years and now carnivore um I've been keto for three plus years sorry and carnivore for two plus years and love it I really think the multiple day fasting caused my weight game but unfortunately it helps with my neurological symptoms brought on by covid yeah that's fair enough you know because yeah the the the fasting can like I said you know drop your metabolism and then you get a rebound right but that that should undo you know once you you're eating properly it it should uh then raise your metabolism and you should lose the weight so you know if you wanted to do periods of of fasting because that helped your neurological issues you know then that that's that's sort of a medical intervention that you sort of comes with consequences it comes with and as long as you're doing it responsibly and safely you should be able to do it uh well and uh and then when you're when you're back eating normally your metabolism should normalize and you should lose that weight again um but it doing just a lion diet is generally extremely uh healthy and very helpful and generally has very similar results to fasting as well you're just getting rid of everything that your body is reacting negatively to so maybe give that a try too you know try just the red meat and water and and hopefully that that helps and you know then you may not even need to fast and then try the other protocol potentially from uh uh Dr um uh Peter Mulla yeah blanked on his name sorry about that uh but yeah good luck with that um okay um so low carb low drama thank you very much for the Super Chat what are your thoughts on whether sdldl is the new lipid distraction uh now that ldlc theory uh has been debunked or is there something to it yeah so that that was that was exactly what I was saying before it's just shifting the goal post so sdldl is your small dense uh uh LDL molecules that comes from glycation oxidative stress from seed oils from sugar from alcohol um and high blood sugar you know so whether or not sdldl causes anything and they don't cause anything uh they may be used in some fashion but they're they're they're not I don't think that they're a direct cause uh I don't think there's a cause and effect relationship between those things um but even if they are used um in in development of atherosclerosis they don't exist if you don't eat carbs sugar alcohol or seed oils right so it's not it's not a problem with your cholesterol it's a problem with what you've done to your cholesterol right so the problem still isn't cholesterol it's still not meat it's still not saturated fat it's still carbohydrates sugar alcohol seed oils and those sorts of things right and plants in general filthy nasty plants and um and so yeah it's Just sh Shifting the gold post so if you have high sdldl which you won't on a carnivore diet if you're as long as you're sleeping properly and not completely stressed out to hell I've seen one person who wasn't sleeping well and was extraordinarily stressed out with his job and even on a carnivore diet he had elevated sdldl and as soon as his his job circumstances uh moved gone right everybody else I've never seen anybody's sdldl go up ever I I've never seen that I've only spoken to one person online about it and that's what they it was already after the fact they'd already they'd already seen um an improvement after their stressful job situation resolved but my patient population I've never seen that um and it's just yeah so I I think it's um uh it's yeah it's just a waste of time really honestly it's all just a bit of a distraction but if you do have high sdl LDL that increases your risk for development AOS sclerosis by 1.7 times so that's 70% increased risk metabolic syndrome increases your risk by 600% so it's 6X six times as likely diabetes is a th% right um 70% just doesn't make the bored right and doing the things that address diabetes and metabolic syndrome namely going on a ketogenic carnivore diet uh will reverse both of those and will also reverse your sdldl so you know it's it's a it's smoke it's not the fire it's an ancillary warning sign that your body's getting a bit disrupted metabolically and so you're damaging your body that's just one side hb1c is is a is another sign of that your HB andc is is 13 you're damaging your body and guess what you're going to have sdldl because the the glycation has not only damaged your hemoglobin it's damaging your cholesterol and everything else in your body as well so that's just a sign of that so sdldl is really just like HDL or or hba1c it's just a marker of damage in your body right so same thing remove that stuff and you stop having damage in your body sldl goes away so yeah it is a distraction it's just shifting the goalpost Tristan Zeman thank you very much for the Super Chat any advice for a 300 pound guy who has a Spartan in three months and is inspired by David Goggins I just jogged nine miles I'm down 85 pounds amazing I feel amazing but I just want to do a pull-up look you know this is going to take time man but you know you've already down 85 pounds doing the right thing do strict as hell carnivore diet don't eat anything else don't look at anything else just eat high fat red meat only drink water eggs are fine cut out everything else right everything else have some liver that's fine too it's not going to kill you not too much uh not not a small amount anyway and um and then just keep working out sprinting is going to is going to get you pay a lot more dividends in your health Fitness and uh body fat percentage than jogging and um maybe you do it on a bike you know if you if you if you can't handle that but you just do as hard as you can to wear yourself out either on the bike or on the street or at a park and you lift weights you know and if you can't do a pullup you do lat pull downs and you build up and you build your muscles and you start using your muscles that starts using more of your fat you start stimulating his fat loss and you'll get there um in 3 months that's that's plenty of time are you going to be down at an ideal weight in that time only one way to find out but you'll be a lot better off and you'll be a lot healthier so you just train you train for that Spartan and you lift weights and you sprint and you eat exclusively fatty meat and you'll do great and please do uh uh come back and let us know uh how you do and how you go and and and your results because you will get there and you'll do you will do a very good job and you'll eventually lose everything you want you'll get down to an ideal weight and fitness level but G thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat this very kind of you uh carnivore since January um Coming was five uh years keto I have a big appetite and um big appetite eat up to 200 grams of protein a day averaging about 170 gram 7030 ratio I've gained 4 pounds I eat until it doesn't taste good could I be eating too much 45y old female 172 pounds um well you know it it it's potential you know if you're eating if you're taking medications or other sorts of things that um that uh you know could increase your appetite maybe but a lot of people uh just need um just need to just eat what their body's telling them to eat and um and just allow their body to heal from different metabol metabolic issues and other sorts of issues and then you might gain weight at first but then you eventually reduce it down sometimes when people aren't eating enough fat actually that can that can trigger things uh 170 grams is uh plenty of protein 200 grams is a lot um it may be that you don't need all that much protein maybe increase the fat a bit and see if that makes you more satiated if you're eating more lean meat um then even if it's very fatty but if it's it's more lean then your body wants more the fat and wants more nutrients on that end of things you'll end up eating more and um and so you know if you increase the fat sometimes that reduces the amount that your body actually wants because that's what your body was going for so it's telling you to eat more meat in general because that's it needs more fat and it's taking the protein along with it because it wants the fat so maybe try increasing the fat and um and that can reduce the the total amount that you eat uh and potentially that can that can sort you out uh Frank thank you for the super chat um Frank says um Grant uh 150 gamma GT 92 um LDH LDH maybe LDL 374 a uh 256 um so I'm just going to sort of just go through I'm not going to read all of these out um and um yeah B12 is good F's good and um with in four egfr result so I don't know what that last little bit uh meant I don't know if there's any more to this question I don't know where the question is on that um or what the question is but if it's just to sort of say like you what what's going on here um me your liver has obviously very elevated numbers um I don't know what what they were before that when you're on a carnivore diet and you remove all these things out that tends to improve liver function you can have liver dysfunction like an infection parasite uh medications that can all negatively affect it but if you're carnivore long term that will at least eliminate out the the uh dietary causes of uh liver dysfunction and so there's that uh gamma GT is very Sensi is very specific for uh alcohol and sugar and so if you're off that if you're just on Carnivore and you're not taking in uh sugar and alcohol that should start coming down your other um thing uh liver function tests uh can will come down also if you cut out all those sorts of things but if there's other sorts of dysfunctional problems um you know it's uh you know there's other things that that um uh that can happen so it's um but at least the carnivore diet will eliminate out those things creatinine being up you need to drink more water um and so unless you're on like fluid restriction from your doctor for some reason you need more water and um but your B12 is actually really good 997 um is very good I don't know where you are in the world um looks like Australia uh but that's great you want to be 800 to 1200 folate is great too uh so that's fantastic your HDL is is is fantastic your triglycerides are fantastic so to me there are a lot of very good they're very positives from there glucose is it you want that below five it looks like you're probably coming from a diabetic or pre-diabetic past which makes sense with your your liver function tests being a bit off as well um and that um and that um oh that is LDH okay and um and so you know it's just going to take time it's going to take time to heal so I just keep doing what you're doing drink more water definitely and then make sure you get everything out of your system that's that may be damaging your liver um so I don't I don't know if that was your question but that's um that those are my thoughts on those the blood tests anyway uh Fatima Ali uh Dr chaffy thank you for saving me and my family's life uh oh you're God sent to us I've never felt like this well that's amazing I well thank you very much and I'm really glad to hear that you and your family are doing so well it's really really sweet of you to to say that and uh and thank you for sharing that and hopefully you know that that inspires others and please you know if you're if you're able to maybe say what some of the things were that that uh were helped and you know maybe some other people looking at the comments I see that and oh well that's similar to what I have and so maybe that can help me too and and and it will very likely will okay thank you very much and then big chungus thank you for the super sticker uh Tick Tock Galore thank you for the super sticker very kind of you and and Christy Chris thank you for the super CH sticker also uh and thank you all for coming
