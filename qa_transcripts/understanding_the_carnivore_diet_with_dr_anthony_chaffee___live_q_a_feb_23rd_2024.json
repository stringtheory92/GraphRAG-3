    "title": "\ud83d\udd34Understanding The Carnivore Diet with Dr Anthony Chaffee | LIVE Q&A Feb 23rd 2024",
    "transcript": "all right hello everyone thanks for joining my live for what is this Friday the 23rd of February or Thursday the 22nd of February depending on what part of the world you're in um so thank you all very much it's nice to see everybody okay so um yes we'll get started with some questions first is from albino rhino uh is there anything wrong with eating smoked meat on the cornerboard diet pellet smoker charcoal Etc um certainly I don't think there's anything wrong with doing it occasionally and um probably not even all that much wrong with they doing it more often than that you know we've been we've been cooking with fire for at least 800,000 years possibly more probably more um because there was evidence some people were using ovens 800,000 years ago and so you know we're going to get a lot of smoke in our food now is that the same as as having something in a smoker no it's not um but I don't think there's a problem with you know sort of cooking and having that sort of open fire sort of cook um so I don't I don't think that um there's much of an issue having Smoked Meats at least uh you know on the on an occasion and I still think it's better than any of the Alternatives um probably best not to make it the only thing that you eat um just uh just because you don't want to buildup of of these different sorts of products but you know the the issues with with um cooked meat anyway or the little burnt particulates you know the studies looking at that were pretty weak and so you know I don't I don't know if we can really go uh go off much of those as well but you know uh I wouldn't make it as a main stay but every now and then i' I'd say it's fine Bruce Lynch thank you for the Super Chat is MCT oil okay and healthy on Carnivore also does does any animal fats cross the blood brain barrier if so how does that work been on cornivore a month um so as far as MCT oil that's generally derived from coconut oil and I don't think there's necessarily well I don't know any problems specifically with MCT oil if you're getting it from coconut oil um it may have the plant sterols which are the plants cholesterol which mimic our cholesterol they're close enough to our cholesterol that that it that our body stops making enough of our own cholesterol and then we don't have enough substrate for our hormones for vitamin D for our cell membranes for bile for our brains things like that um potentially brains you you know the it's thought that cholesterol doesn't cross the blood brain barrier so the brain makes its own cholesterol now the brain definitely does make its own cholesterol but there are studies showing um biochemical Pathways that could potentially have cholesterol crossing the blood brain barrier and it seems to be evidence that there is and it sort of breaks down into smaller molecules crosses the barrier and then reconstitutes into cholesterol um in and out of the brain so um so I've certainly seen studies like that that that suggest that this process is happening things are crossing in and out so I don't know how plant stero affect that in the brain anyway but um in any case you know I I have no idea if these plant stero are getting in the MCT oil and that's the that's what I that's what I worry about and so it's just you know I mean there there are MCTS in in animal fats as well it's not like you don't get them um but you just don't get the plant sterols as well so that's I think that's the main thing with anything plant derived um even if it's even if it's like an MCT well it's not omega sixes and linic acid and all that sort of stuff um is that it's um it's uh you know it's got plant stero also you know anything at room temperature uh anything liquid at room temperature is going to be a bit less stable and so it's it can you know because these things are going to be unsaturated so they can break down into into other problems um you know oxidize and things like that uh as to animal fats crossing the blood brain barrier depends on the fat like I just said there is there is a proposed mechanism for cholesterol crossing the bloodb brain barrier ketones cross the blood brain barrier and ketones can reconstitute into fatty acids and be used as as the building blocks of materials um things like DHA EPA those those get into the brain as well because the brain is largely made from DHA and EPA um about 20% is made out of DHA and uh a lot of it's from cholesterol as well although a lot of that is manufactured in the brain as well so because DHA isn't we don't make enough of it we have to get that in our diet then obviously it h would if it's being used to make a large portion of our brain it's required to make a large portion of our brain from our dietary DHA then it would have to get into the brain I don't know the exact mechanism um I've also spoken to doctors and researchers uh such as Dr George Eid who talks about how you really don't want to have any lenic acid in your diet at all or if you do very little that's one of the omega-6s uh that is very common in uh plant fats plant oils and that's not the one we need we need a arachadonic acid but that comes from meat ala or sorry lenic acid La can be turned into a arachadonic acid but you don't need it to turn into arachadonic acid unless you're just getting no arachadonic acid from your meat so la is um is really unstable it oxidizes very quickly it sends off free radicals and can actually get in your brain your brain can't really use it as a structural component doesn't really know what to do with it so it starts breaking it down for energy and it's and it's a very inefficient energy and starts causing a lot of oxidative stress um according to Dr Eid and so she was saying that from a mental health point of view this stuff was really really damaging to the brain and so uh not to use it but yeah so fats can get into the brain uh certainly chol cholesterol seems to be able to we know ketones can and reconstitute into fatty acids and um and then the the Omega-3s because they're used to build a brain so uh yeah I don't know all the mechanisms for those though but uh that they definitely are some that can Amber thank you for the Super Chat what do you think about fat protein when doing uh when trying to build muscle and strength uh not looking to be a bodybuilder just uh really good strength uh so I think it's the same same for anybody in any other situation you need enough fat you need enough protein right so you need to have enough uh you know enough of all these essential nutrients so fat isn't just a calorie Source it's they essential fatty acids that you have to have or you won't be as healthy as you can be you could potentially get very sick or die they're essential fat soluble nutrients that you have to have or you not going to be as healthy as you could be and you could get sick or die so it's very important to get enough of both and so you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you try to get as much fat as your body's asking you for so that you're not constipated your body has a limited capacity to absorb fat and then you have a spillover mechanism you you have bile and that allows you to absorb fat after that it's very small percentage can actually can actually um absorb you know absorb in your gut without bile so the rest of it goes out and so you know people say oh you don't want to eat too much fat I mean that that's just a hold over to vilification of fat I I really don't think that you can overeat fat or over absorb fat uh physiologically because you just you're just not going to absorb it and if you take a bunch of ox pile and sure yeah you'll absorb too much fat so don't do that right um but when you're talking about just being healthy and whether that's building muscle or or just sitting on your ass it's just you want to eat up as much uh fatty meat as your body's asking you for and so if you do that your body will tell you your body will tell you how much meat to get how much fat to get how much protein to get and you just go by taste and so when I'm working out if I want to put on muscle I need to make sure I'm eating enough if normally I just eat once a day one big steak a day and that's fine for me if I'm I'm lifting weights I'll I'll probably be hungry for for that sort of level of a meal twice a day not once a day and and so that and that's when I I see really good muscle growth if I'm just still eating the same amount like I'll get more toned I'll get more defined I'll uh get a bit leaner and more cut and I'll feel better and I'll get stronger but I won't I won't put on the mass unless I eat more food very simple you know you need these you need these atoms to build up the structures in your body and your muscles so that's it really just um just eat enough and work out and you should be fine so I saw a question here on Instagram from assai tley I don't know I hope that's somewhat right so they they know who I'm talking about says hi Anthony what recommendations you have for someone Castro Prius so this is this is a uh this is an important one because when gastroparesis is when your stomach isn't going to be pushing and moving and opening up and moving things through properly it's just sort of a bit more static paresis it's paralyzed right that's sort of what the name suggests and so it's not um as as easy to eat large meals and it doesn't and it takes longer to digest and and move this through and so what you need to do is don't drink water around Meal Time first and foremost because you want all that space available for food and so you eat fatty meat again in just until your comfortably full or until it stops tasting good um it could be that you're going to need to eat multiple times a day just to get enough food in um because of how your stomach's working and uh and not really working properly and U and that's it so just just eat fatty meat until you're full or it stops tasting good um and then do that as many times during the day as taste good to you to meet your your biological demands and then drink water outside of that I give it i' I'd probably not drink water for at least you know an hour or two before you eat a large meal probably two hours if you're if you're if you can and um and then just space it out hopefully this is something that is transient and by getting proper nutrition your body can heal a bit and and move this on but that is how I would deal with it um if not okay sunshine kiss thank you for the Super Chat Nathan Bryan States we need nitrates leafy veggies to boost nitric oxide expand blood vessels lower BP uh how to get nitrates on on a carnivore diet so I mean okay I mean that that's that's nice that he says that but I mean what evidence does he have that we have to get it from leafy greens breathe through your nose and you you'll produce more nitric oxide go into the Sun and get UVA light on your skin and you'll produce more nitric oxide and why would it be that for millions of years we've been eating meat and during the ice ages we had no leafy green vegetables available uh really for most people and they were just eating meat and animals and things like that and yet you know seem to have the right amount of nitric oxide for whatever the hell we were doing and um you know well maybe it wasn't optimal well maybe it wasn't optimal but it's really hard to get through an ice when you're when you're not optimal um because you can't just barely make it through an ice age right you either Thrive or you die you go extinct I mean there there's there's no two options there there's extremely harsh conditions and you know death is around the corner for everybody at all times so if you're just sort of barely making it you're not making it and so if you were deficient in nitric oxide it's not going to happen and think about it this way when you're up in the Arctic Circle the Inuit they're not getting a lot of UV light either um UVA is more penetrative it can get through the atmosphere a bit better but the but the angles of the of of the sun are so oblique that barely any rays are getting there and this is is above the tree line a lot of these people above the tree line but what what that is is it's a certain latitude that above that the angle of the sun is so oblique that trees cannot grow you get little shrubs and bushes and then nothing no plant life can grow even if it was even if it were in the summer and not horribly uh cold and harsh and and um and impossible to grow anyway so you know they're not getting nitric oxide from from the Sun you know presumably they're breathing through their nose at some point most animals breathe through their nose we seem to be a bunch of mouth breathers but uh you shouldn't be you should breathe through your nose and um and and who's to say we're not getting this from meat who's to say that we're not getting this in the exact right proportions from what we're eating and also you know if you're taking something you know with with leafy greens you're getting everything else that comes with leafy greens you're getting something from I mean this is this is the cherry picking the things that you want from from this and then just leaving the rest you know so I mean leafy greens have toxins they have defense chemicals so do those does the nitric oxide outweigh those defense chemicals most green leaves leafy greens uh will kill you you know like Hemlock that'll kill you and so you know it's it is absolutely not um you know it is it is you not proven by any stretch of the imagination that you have to have leafy green vegetables to get Nitric a nitric oxide or anything else um and so this is just supposition on his part or just say oh you have to have it and so maybe this is a good thing maybe saying he's arguing that you should eat these because you get more nitric oxide well do you I don't know you know has anyone compared that has anyone compared you know the Inuit only eating their natural diet of meat and you know someone who eats a whole bunch of kale you know have they have they studied that have they said well yes these people have more nitric oxide than the other person and does that matter does that make a difference in their health outcomes so you know a lot of these things are assuming a fact that's not in evidence they're making a statement saying you need nitric oxide and and a best source of a as leafy green vegetables well who says that we are deficient in nitric oxide where does where does it say that you we're deficient in B12 as a as a people as a population you can see that because the reference ranges for B12 are getting lower and lower and lower because those are averages for the community so we can see that more and more people are getting deficient um and uh getting lowering our our testosterone and estrogen levels infertility is is through the roof you know so there's a lot of problems that we're having um haven't heard it uh that nitric oxide was the main driver of all that um testosterone levels are like in the 2000s in 25 girl and men in their 20s had half the testosterone levels of the average man in uh the 70s right or or who was in their 60s in 1970s right so you know testosterone levels have just come right down and it's worse now so testosterone levels are in the tank nutritional levels are in the tank nutrient levels are in the tank um infertility is Skyhigh um non-communicable diseases is are the number one killer in the world about 80% of issues that that doctors treat now are non-communicable diseases these so-called chronic diseases that didn't exist in any large number before the 20th century must have been because of all you know lack of nitric oxide I guess so Jim Mell thank you for the Super Chat can you talk about Brown fat where is it on the body and how cold skin activates the burning of it thanks um I don't think it's it's about burning of the brown fat that's that's the issue the brown fat has a lot of mitochondria in it and that's why it looks Brown uh babies have a lot of brown fat and this what keeps them warm so they the mitochondria just generating a lot of energy as heat energy in order to stay warm and keep the baby warm so it doesn't die and um and we have brown fat as well and so when you're going to a cold plunge or you get cold as hell and your body starts shivering and all that sort of stuff you'll stimulate your brown fat and the mitochondria in there to start producing heat to keep you alive and keep you from freezing to death and um I'm not an expert in that I think that um there is some in interesting research out there and I've seen some interesting um Talks by different people and uh Ben bman talks about uh the brown fat as well how this can actually stimulate more thyroid uh hormone production um so if you get really cold and you're like shivering this can cause your your thyroid production to ramp up by like 50% and so obviously that's a again you're increasing your metabolism you're trying to burn more energy so that you you stay warm and you survive this cold attack so that's that's basically as much as I know about Brown fat um uh but Ben bman has a lot of things on it as well and he's a you know Professor from biochemistry at BYU so um you know he's got a lot of a lot of uh you know very interesting things uh to do with uh just metabolism and how that works and this this would be part of that so Karen uh Caitlyn thank you so much for the Super Chat I'm not seeing a question along with it but maybe maybe down the chain we'll take a look H oh sorry I'm just going to take a look here goodness okay Bloom thank you very much for the super chats very kind of you um they say parents think that strict carnivore is bad father is late 60s is too skinny it's on Statin thoughts on that effects on the brain keto for him if he won't do carnivore question mark how much fat intake he needs more muscle and healthy body way yeah look if the if um it's understandable I mean this goes against a lot of people what people have been saying for the last sort of 50 years however it goes exactly in accordance with what doctors and researchers have been saying for thousands and thousands of years meat's very important it's very healthy it's very it's very critical to have for Optimal Health and Longevity and um and we did not have the chronic diseases and alimer that we've had uh previously or that that we've had recently so oh W people just didn't live long enough stupid stupid statement uh of course we did uh Socrates was 76 when he was when he was terrorizing Athens with his intellect 2 200 years ago or so um when they killed him with a plant by the way they made him drink Hemlock and um and so you know where was his Alzheimer's you know and there wasn't there was nothing in you know in Plato or anybody's writing was was like oh my God he was just the oldest guy in the world I mean oh this just amazing I we had PHD programs you know going back how many hundreds of years I mean it's just just a thousand years you know and you have uh you know people that were you know finishing their education in their late 20s and then going on in their career and they only lived 10 more years after that pretty foolish to to waste your time getting a PhD an advanced degree and going in Academia if you're just going to just like work your ass off and then die 10 years later I mean this is stupid um you know just look at look at the ages of the founding fathers America and when they died my great-grandfather was born in 1875 he died in 1975 at home fully Compass menst um this is stupid so Alzheimer's was first described at a it was a it was a oneoff case report from Dr Alzheimer's that he presented at a conference in 1906 and it was brand new no one had ever seen this before that's why he presented this w wow look at this weird new case and and then it got coined Alzheimer's dementia and now it's extremely prevalent and deaths from Alzheimer's is is on the rise even when adjusting for age so no this isn't this isn't something that's been going on forever and we just didn't notice it or people weren't living long enough to get it um that's foolish that's someone who's never looked at the statistics never looked at the modal age it's the difference between average life expectancy from birth and modal age modal age is how how you know what's the average age of people actually die at how old do people get to if they die of you know of old age those are different things then you know how long people live if they if they don't get killed by something is and and modal age how long people tend to live um when they live to adulthood and average life expectancy from birth very different things you know infant mortality was like three out of five right so you know You' had to have those other two people living a very long time a lot of people died in wars and famines in early age and then so that basically that one in five had to live a hell of a lot longer just to pull that average up to 36 38 um I think it was 38 average life expectancy from birth was 38 in in 1850 but if you lived to 10 years old it was 60 and if lived to 20 it was longer and you lived to 30 it was longer right so if you if you got through those kill points in early age people lived a very long time right so no that's ridiculous but um keto has been shown keto is the most studied diet ever and um as uh Rob uh Dr Rob CIS said uh in our interview the other days that'll be coming out in the next couple weeks really interesting guy um and uh he was saying you know I sort of mentioned that he was just like it's the only diet that's been studied because the other diets are just you know have a have a questionnaire you know you get the nurse's study and you give them you give them a questionnaire once a year and you say hey what did you eat in the last year how the hell would you know that with any accuracy you know I mean it's just ridiculous and and so that's that's the quality of data on these other diets ketogenic diets have randomized controlled trials and large numbers with multiple Health out outcomes and end points by the thousands right so this is this is really the only really well studied diet certainly the most rigorously studied diet ever and those Studies have shown that a KET high fat meat-based ketogenic diet is a better treatment for Alzheimer's than every medication for Alzheimer's ever Tri that's what the Studies have shown um people are reversing Alzheimer's and if you're going to reverse it you can certainly prevent it by going on ketogenic diet it's like a carnivore diet doesn't even necessarily have to be carnivore but you just need to eat more meat more fat that's what your brain is made out of like we were talking about before and you go you're in ketosis so your brain is getting ketones it's running on its optimal fuel source it's getting ketones in there to reconstruct into fatty acids and rebuild the structures of the brain and you're getting nutrients like B12 that are integral for for myelination of your axons which will actually give bulk to your brain um and there was a study in 2008 out of Oxford that looked at um part of it was looking at vegans they followed them for five years looked them on MRI and found that their brain shrank by 5% volume and they thought this was likely due to their critically low B12 which was 180 190 and that's that's that's in the normal ranges now uh for B12 well because again we're just so deficient just people are oh plant-based everyone's plant-based people don't realize oh you need to go plant-based you're already plant-based the average the average Western diet is plant-based it's like 70 80% plants right and so you know it's just processed plants there's barely any meat in there it's not the meat that's doing that it's all the other plants and garbage that they're putting in it seed oils sugars all this crap and um you know so that's that's that's what the problem is um so be on Statin stattin you know why do we need to be on statins to lower LDL okay well is LDL actually a problem I don't think it is I think the evidence is very clear that this was just a scapegoat there's no serious scientist actually independently said oh I think I think cholesterol is a really big problem here it was the sugar companies who came up with that and then they found people like Ansel keys and other other professors three from Harvard in particular one became the head of the USDA who they could buy off and say hey you need to push this we want we want to get this out there that cholesterol causes heart disease and they're like sure my my Integrity is non-existent I'll I'll be happy to and um and so they they did that and um and we we know they did that because we have their contracts we have the internal memal from the sugar companies saying that they did this and so you know this is this is a matter of record it's not a it's not a conjecture it's not up for debate you don't need a study or a flyer or a survey from nurses once a year to figure that out we have this documented this is this is a known entity and so uh cholesterol was never the problem you know and they keep Shifting the goalpost they said oh total cholesterol that's the problem then you have all these different kinds of cholesterol like okay there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol and that didn't really work out either there 100 different kinds of chol LDL cholesterol oh okay well maybe this one maybe that one no no no they're all bad and oh maybe this and and now they're like okay well that's not really holding up either because people with higher cholesterol LDL cholesterol of any description live longer like okay and there's inverse correlations in some studies with total cholesterol and cardiovascular death like the Framingham study that's what they their actual data showed but it was misreported by the AHA American Heart Association who is being paid off by the sugar companies to lie and say that it was the opposite and that higher cholesterol higher cardiovascular mortality rate in fact it was the opposite lower total cholesterol higher cardiovascular mortality rate um and so they went oh okay well that's not well now it's Appo oh Appo oh my God it's just they just they're just banging the same drum and every time you just show how full of they are they just they just move to the next thing move to the next thing you know it's just classic misdirection they're just trying to it's just red herrings they're just trying to keep you looking over here don't mind the man behind the curtain just look over here look over here uh it's nonsense and and the sooner we just get away from this and just say look it's it was always it's now we're not talking about it the sooner this goes away if we keep just playing this game and keep and they keep say well but it's this well but it's this well but it's this we're never going to get anywhere right so we just stop talking to these people about it the first heart attack in America First death by heart attack on autopsy in America was in 1912 first all case of all was 1906 right so where was this before that oh we just didn't notice before that  doctors were doing thousands of autopsies and dissections over their career and you had thousands of people doing thousands of autopsies in you know any given country and More in some countries that were bigger and uh not a single damn thing in the literature before 1912 except for one obscure reference and somebody tried to say it's like oh well you know there's this reference here in the lake L 1700s and they presented at a conference saying that oh wow isn't this weird we saw this thrombus in the in the coronary vessel was like isn't isn't that strange we've never seen that before they're like that's your proof that this was happening all the time that this is the number one killer in the world by this one obscure reference 130 years before it's ever seen again great job buddy and um so you know you have to deal with less than intelligent people when you when you talk about these things because they're just trying to defend an ideology they they're convinced of something because they're they think that they're smart they're the smartest person that they know and that they say oh well if I think it it must be true um and so they're just desperately trying to defend why they are not wrong uh so again 130 years absolutely zero heart attacks were eating more meat and fat in the 1800s than we were in the early 1900s when this became the number one killer in America first heart attack first death by heart attack um proven on autopsy in 19112 20 years later it's the number one killer in America you do the math this is at the time where we're eating the least amount of meat in 200 years U-shaped curve beginning 1800s a lot of meat slowly coming down slowly coming down big vegetarian push from the puritanical and the and the temperance movements because they're saying meat sinful it makes you lustful and makes you want to have sex and oh my gosh how could we possibly want to procreate and Advance the the human race and then we get down to the 1920s and 30s it's at the trough the lowest point in meat consumption in America in America for 200 years that's when it becomes the number one killer in America and then it sort of comes up from there uh so it's not even Associated there isn't even association with this so and and the thing you have to realize too for the people that you know saw Peter aa's talk about how fam familial hypercholesteremia proves and you know all these other things prove that um LDL is causitive okay well if it were causitive why is it that the people with familial hypercholesterolemia in the 1800s didn't die of heart attacks it's not what they died of because there isn't a single case reported in the literature but if people study population genetics you'll know that the exact same percentage of genes and Leal that exist in the population stay in that population regardless of time and expansion of of the population as a whole uh unless there's a mass extinction event or a mass migration event so but if we're talking world population or at least in America at least in Europe where we can look at these things and check these things unless we're saying that you know just people from third world countries are the ones getting heart attacks and theyve moved into different countries and now they started getting picked up very unlikely um but you know in in these Western countries you'd have the exact same amount of people having familial hyp cholesterolemia now is then right and yet no heart attacks right so if high LDL will kill you and your body just makes the the you know the the the product of its own demise then you know why weren't we seeing that before 1912 why was there just one obscure reference in the late 1700s people obviously could see it these were smart people and they knew the H they these people did more dissections than any surgeon alive today any of them you know like an anatomist maybe you know that spends all day in a lab but that's what these people were doing they spent all their most of their days they're just in the lab doing dissections doing dissections they go out treat some people you know deliver some babies go back in uh that's when semov viice actually figured out that there's you know the microbial infections and things like that because people were doing dissections on cadavers and doing autopsies and because that's what people did and then they go and deliver a baby not wash their hands go back in and start cutting up dead bodies again and the infection rate was through the roof on these on these mothers so people were always doing dissections that was a major part of what you did as a doctor in those days in the 1800s and um you know I mean these people figured out the the circulatory system hundreds of years ago with no Imaging um you know they figured out how to calculate the number of atoms of gas in a in a container before you had any way of measuring it with advanced Advanced Equipment and it was right right so you know these people were a hell of a lot smarter than most people alive now because they had to be they didn't have they couldn't rely on technology you know and um and certainly a hell of a lot smarter than anybody who made makes the statement that oh they just wouldn't have noticed it because they're stupid yeah Da Vinci who invented a helicopter hundreds of years ago as a and even though he did thousands of dissections I'm sure he just just wouldn't have noticed a big ass clot in the heart and a big dead chunk of heart muscle yeah just the guy was a you just you just can't trust these people so pretty on a bit of a tangent there um but uh look Statin like you don't you what do we need those for uh you know you took lower lower LDL cholesterol but why are we lowering LDL cholesterol it was a con it was a farce in the first place I did a um a video called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease and I I just go into the the actual studies that completely run counter to that and so people people want to check that out they can um hopefully your dad eats more meat more fat it's good for him um should really think about you know what he's trying to accomplish with the satins um I I I don't I don't I'm there may be some application outside of lowering LDL but you know that they have but um you don't want a lower LDL LDL higher LDL is um is associated with longevity and lower all cause mortality in studies with 12 million participants and uh total cholesterol was shown in another study with 44,000 um you of Sweden last year that the two most important biomarkers to predict living over 100 was low fasting insulin and high total cholesterol so why would you want to lower your cholesterol I I don't I think that's exactly what we're supposed to do maybe people you people that go on a cornivore diet ketogenic carnivore diets they get this massive elevation of LDL oh my gosh it's up there with people with familial hypercholesterolemia or maybe that's not the aberration maybe maybe they're protected against eating crappy food and lowering their LDL to a suboptimal state maybe we're supposed to be there maybe that's a better place to be and maybe when you eat what you're designed to eat and your body works the way it's designed to work and your cholesterol does that maybe you should think and say hey maybe that's where it's supposed to be maybe that's where we're designed to be biologically maybe we've been eating meat in this you know and sometimes in exclusion for thousands of years during ice ages in the Arctic Circle or people like the Inu who stayed up there you know they've been eating that way for Millennia and their cholesterol is likely going to be like that so maybe that's what we're supposed to be maybe that's what's normal maybe when you eat a bunch of carbs and sugar and crap and your cholesterol comes down maybe that's the aberration maybe that's bad and maybe the people with familiar hyp cholesterolemia are protected from that and your body says nope we're keeping it up here because that's where it's supposed to be I think that's how you should think about it you you should question these sorts of things we should we should not just be spoonfed uh you know answers from people that did not that that had their own interests at heart they're they're protect they're trying to sell something they're trying to push a product and they're trying to protect their product because their product is toxic to people and why are we listening to them why are we listening to their advice and the advice of the paid shills that um that they they were bought off by them not great not great idea so yeah keto is certainly better than any than uh the alternative if he's not doesn't want to do carnivore uh just eat more fat eat more meat and you'll put on muscle you know stimulate it go for walks try to do some exercises and resistance and should be right should be right and Tomahawk Skipper um says chronic kidney failure is carnivore diet contraindicated no absolutely not in fact higher um protein intake has been shown to improve kidney function not make it worse so that's a myth that needs to die as well and I've seen quite a lot of people with ckd4 ckd5 uh improve and um and and go away from the um you know potential needs for uh dialysis and and renal transplant polycystic kidney disease in fact has been shown to be benefited by ketogenic diet specifically in a series of of um papers that have come out recently as well so no it is definitely not contraindicated in fact like everything else it's uh indicated uh any any issue that you have eating a biologically appropriate diet is indicated and this is certainly one of them J Smith um thank you for the Super Chat mail 68 5'8 135 lbs carnivore for 4 months my stools were very little now they are large and a lot I can't seem to gain weight I eat two RI eyes 2 pounds of burger uh six eggs daily am I not absorbing potentially I mean it's um you know if you're eating anything else along with it make sure that you cut those out um just eat until it stops tasting good that may be enough for you it may not be it definitely seems like a lot but um you know just keep eating until it stops tasting good if you're having if you think you're having uh dig absorption issues um there may be a reason why that you may have to you know get get checked out by your doctor infection other sorts of things um medications um if you're not eating if you're eating anything else besides just meat eggs and water get rid of it and um yeah and just keep eating until it stops tasting good the gaining weight part you know if that's where your body wants you to be then that's where it wants you to be you need to stimulate your body to grow in positive ways so if you want to gain healthy you know lean body mass you need to exercise you need to do uh resistance training to failure and you need to do sprinting either you know on the ground or on a stationary bicycle where you're like an assault bike or something like that where you crank up the resistance and you just Sprint as hard as you can um for as long as you can then you you stop and so and if you can go longer than a minute you're not going hard enough so and until you get into very good shape so that's what you need to do you need to stimulate your body and then you need to eat enough for your body to grow and repair could be that you've been undereating and malnourished for a long time and your body's trying to catch up and you're not you're not gaining weight because your body's just trying to rebuild and repair but um that's the way to find out is stimulate your body and then eat until it stops tasting good so that looks like a lot but is that enough for you that's the question and um yeah the the more stools is a bit is a bit strange I mean that does sort of suggest you're not absorbing things as much things with gristle you're not going to absorb as much of the gristle um eggs you should absorb pretty damn easily so if you just wanted to eat the hell out of some eggs um and that's what what people used to do before there's a whole bunch of anabolic steroids and things like that they would just take a bunch of eggs it be like 36 eggs a day uh would would get um uh a mild anabolic effect um Vince gond it's called The Iron Guru he said that I think it was over 30 eggs a day for most men would be um equivalent to a a lowd dose anabolic steroid uh so you know see how you go with that eggs are very easily absorbed and so if you're not absorbing those then you probably need to get that checked out see what the hell's going on um but yeah just see what what you can do on on that end and uh yeah good luck with it int intros spectris thank you for the Super Chat can carnivore help with uh sin1 and HPV 58 many women online claiming they cleared it naturally with plant-based diets and supplements hoping to avoid uh lets uh pure carnivore since January uh female 39 thank you well you know people people can claim whatever the hell they want but you know the thing is is that you know if you go on any sort of Clean Diet and by that I mean you know just drop all the processed food sugar alcohol cakes and candies you know you're going to improve all of those things are plant-based right so they were already plant-based they just cut out certain plants and they just happen to throw the baby out with the bath water and throw out the meat with it so that's not to say that cutting out meat was the benefit cutting out the sugar and the processed crap that was the benefit and um you know and you know sin one two three go up and down you know all the time and they you have that and there's there's a certain percentage of of sin three that will just resolve and go away and you won't won't need any treatment so um it just gets less likely you know the more advanced it gets so you know it could just be that that just happened and um and it was a coincidence that they they they did that or it could have been that it was helped by uh cutting out all the processed garbage uh on a carnivore diet you will cut out the processed garbage and you will improve your mitochondrial function which is the basis of um cellular dysfunction that can precipitate cancer so HPV that's going to be in your body forever it's not going to go away but your immune system can suppress it and the Damage that it does to the mitochondria cause that can later precipitate cancer can be mitigated by the improvements that you put on your cellular health and the and the the stimulation of producing more mitochondria and replacing old damaged dirty dysfunctional mitochondria and so this is why ketogenic metabolic therapy um has been shown in clinical trials to be extremely efficacious uh in Cancers and treating cancers and so and assumably the prevention of cancers and so that would be applicable here as well and um and again like you what what randomized control trials do we have or clinical trials or Interventional trials do we have showing that plant-based diets whatever that means because Oreo cookies and heroin are plant-based McDonald's without without the meat Patty is is plant well McDonald's is plant-based um and um you know and and without the bun it's vegan basically or without the burger the Patty it's vegan basically one little Patty and this burger fries and Shake you know all of that is plant-based except that one little thin measly miserable piece of meat that they have in there yeah yeah it's the meat's fault I'm sure so uh it could potentially help that um there are plenty of people that have that have uh reversed that um but there are people that have that have it's just gone away anyway so you know can we say that it's from one thing or the other I would you know just knowing the biochemistry knowing the biology the cancer biology I would say that yes it would help um but I don't know of any studies that have shown that but you can look up on PubMed or even Google Scholar it's a pretty pretty accessible resource you can just look up you know uh cian and um and ketogenic diets someone has probably looked at that there are thousands of studies on ketogenic diets and and multiple different um Health outcomes so you can check that you can you can also go on the Facebook groups the larger older Facebook groups like uh zeroc carb health and zeroing in on health those are on Facebook and uh you join those you go in the search function and you look up exactly that you look up HPV look up sin uh 2 one3 whatever and there will be people that have spoken about it I mean there's tens of thousands of people in there from all over the world and it's been going on for over a decade well over a decade 20 years some of these things and so you know there's a lot of information there and there's a lot of a lot of people's um uh accounts of what of of what they've been able to accomplish and so that's a really good resource as well Jake thank you for the Super Chat Dr jaffy can you touch on male pattern baldness what causes it and if cornivore diet would help or make it worse well there there I'm not a expert on that um but I I do understand that that a lot of it can actually be driven by insulin resistance you're getting high insulin levels over time insulin has a lot of roles to play in the body it's it has over a hundred different things that it does besides lowering blood sugar right so when you're when you eat a bunch of carbs and your blood sugar goes up and your insulin goes up correspondingly it's lowering the blood sugar but it's also doing 100 plus other things in your body body out of balance and so it can really mess you up and so that was something that I've seen that insulin resistance um can be can be implicated in in in that sort of thing and so you know a lot of people when they go carnivore they get thicker nicer hair and um you know I I know a lot of people that that did that um and you you look at look at um a TED Talk that Jordan Peterson did before he was Jordan Peterson um he was much more over he was overweight and he had very thinning hair and um he's a very different man now obviously and and that's when he went keto carnivore and now been carnivore for a long time and uh big thick hair and uh you know very slender so you know that's something that that we do see a lot of people improve their not only their hairline but their hair thickness um if when the follicles die they're dead but they can be damaged to the point that they don't produce a hair anymore and can still be alive and still be salvageable and so that's that's um that's a potential so you know the other side of things is you know is a DHD dihydro testosterone you know seems to damage certain hair follicles some are resistant some are not and Soh that's that's sort of that that thought of that that um the uh the male pattern of that is that you know you have more dihydro testosterone you're going to kill those certain follicles in that certain area but you know a lot of these things happen they don't happen in a vacuum you know there's a lot of other things going on there so that was something that Dr kenberry said that like basically if you start going bald Before 40 it's very likely to be due to insulin resistance and pre-diabetes and things like that as opposed to uh just your genetics so something to think about anyway a lot of people do find that they get thicker hair some people have a Fallout phase and so they were like oh my God I'm losing my hair but you're not as long as you're eating enough eating enough fat and protein um you can trigger a Fallout phase but then it grows back and it grows back thicker you know my brother was um was um you know he wasn't like going bald but you know it was a bit thinner and then um after a few months on Carnivore it was like he just th was like a teenager again he was like had like hair model hair it was like just out of nowhere so you know the thing is is that this this can really really turn things around for a lot of people and has um but it's not going to regrow dead hair you know like if those folicles are dead that's they're dead um and um so that's something to think about as well so obviously want to be healthy first that doesn't mean that if you go carnivore you're not going to go bald there's other things that are going on there but that's that's at least one thing to remember is that it can actually be from high blood sugar high insulin sort of things and that can that can cause damage Patrice Tomas thank you so much for the super chat um not seeing not seeing a question but maybe there's one down the chat uh down the line Aken thank you for the Super Chat uh it's a concern uh OV wants us to eat even less meat who is advising the decision makers it's bad news for General Health probably the special interests such as the the Food and Drug companies who profit off of us being us eating their plant-based crap and uh then getting sick from it and that's something that c means has shown he's a whistleblower for uh you know had previously worked in you know high level uh aspect of you know executive level sort of um roles and consultancies in uh the big food and uh drug companies and he said that the food companies know that their food is making us sick it's destroying our metabolism our metabolic Health they're making us sicker and I know and then they're selling us a whole bunch of pills and things like that to keep us going along he said I know they know this because I was in the boardroom meetings with them while they spoke about it so those are the people holding the holding the the strings that control the polic politicians and um you know they're and they're they have all these little dummy corporations and dummy Charities that are all about Children's Health and pushing plant-based vegan crap in the schools especially in Australia I mean there's there are entire schools uh entire schools that say it's plant-based you can't send meat in with your child it's like not sending my child to your school that's what's gonna happen so um yeah it's uh it's pretty bad and that's why we have to push back that's why people in Australia and us and elsewhere you need to write your politician you just say hey this is this is important to me and this is  and um and we're not we're not going to take this and we're not going to vote for you if you uh if you support this and that's all there is to it and if enough people do that they'll start paying attention you know because the the the first second and third priorities that politicians have are reelection reelection and and re-election that's all they care about and so if you threaten that reelection that is when they will listen to you never you will never ever catch them listen to you otherwise if it's something they can help them in their career then they'll then they'll back it there are very few um politicians that are actually there trying to help people very few they exist but it's it's very few and the thing is is that they're re electable because people see that wow this guy really cares but or or woman really cares but um you know all the other ones pretend to be that person oh I really oh I care oh I care so much we'll find out if they care write to them and say listen this is a big issue for me this has reversed my health issues never been healthier my mom's out of a nursing home and she's back living at home and you know I'm productive I'm doing this I'm able to pay taxes now instead of being a drain on society you know this is not only important for me it's important for the country um you know you need to support this you need to support you know people eating meat and not U driving out uh the most healthy source of nutrition that has ever existed for humans so or any animals um even herbivores eat opportunistically eat other animals when they can because it's perfect nutrition they don't have to work for it um it's very easy to turn animal tissue into animal tissue it's very difficult to turn plant tissue into plant into animal tissue so you know I mean this is this is basic biology guys you know people that deny that are just denying reality or they just really don't know they're just ignorant they just don't they don't understand basic principles in biology um so yeah you need to talk to your politician and you need to make noise the more noise we make the more we're going to be listened to the squeaky wheel gets the grease you know the hippies back in the 60s they're like oh there's all these protests all over the country it was the same damn people traveling around the country it's the same people it wasn't like oh every now California and now New York and now that no it was the same people just going around they were just traveling around the country protesting the same damn people but it looked like a much bigger thing than it actually was so squeaky wheel gets the grease right um and uh so you know make noise and make your voice heard you know write your politician phone in write a letter write emails you get emails they they get counted as oh this this this is how serious this is you call in it's more serious because you're taking more time if you write a letter that's that tends to be the most uh the most you know heavily weighted form of communication like if you actually take time to sit down and put pen to paper um or type something up and send it in no one does that anymore you know so they're going to think that you know this is this is actually more know people more people are going to worry about that that was something I heard years ago I don't know if that's true everywhere but that's that's what I've heard so we just got to make make your voices heard and just be like hey no I I will not vote for you if you don't if you don't protect my my interests here and um enough people do that they'll start paying attention because they'll start saying O we really can't get away with this if it's just a if it's just a few flies on the wall who get a it doesn't matter if they get squashed um and um yeah so that that's what you do but that's where it's coming from is is the people that are that profit from our illness okay de Jason thank you for the Super Chat uh my friend has polycystic kidney disease with 10% kidney function considering getting on transplant list is it safe for her to try carnivore and could it help fix her issues thanks yeah well as I mentioned before higher protein diets improve kidney function and specifically polycystic uh kidney disease and polycystic ovarian disease syndrome um has been shown to improve on ketogenic diets that's that's that's recent research that's come out just within the last year um and so yes I think it would help um and it's certainly not going to hurt it is certainly safe um and I I would hope that it would help hopefully it will get her kidney function back um I've seen three people come off dialysis which is nuts that's not supposed to happen and one one gentleman that I'm working with now he's vegan for a long time destroyed his kidneys destroyed his uh neurological system um almost died and um from years and years and years on a vegan diet then raw food vegan then raw fruitarian and um and and then went wow my diet's killing me and went flipped to carnivore right then his body just massive recovery he's on dialysis but he's making more urine so that's very promising that doesn't mean that he'll be able to recover enough there's such a thing as damage done and may not be able to recover enough but it's improving which it's not supposed to do um and so uh that's very promising and so it's not going to hurt her um if she ends up need eating a transplant it was not going to be because she went carnivore it's going to be in spite of the carnivore and um hopefully knock on would that she she doesn't need that and uh this can help reverse that generally a polycystic kidney disease it's a it's a it's a One Direction event um so you know eventually she's going to need some serious overhaul on her kidneys anyway and um you know this is at least something that is is you know is possible that could help and hopefully it does and hopefully she doesn't need uh transplant as a result Roman tu ma thank you for the Super Chat hey Doc I have a stage for dsrct cancer watched your SE readed interview and want to try metabolic therapy I can't find anyone doing it in New Zealand any suggestions 300 days carnivore love your work doc um there is a neurologist in Hamilton named Dr Matthew Phillips he's not an oncologist and so he specifically works with like GBM cancers U but he does this and he's and he's publishing works on it as well specifically in GBM it it might be possible for you to get in touch with him and at least get get someone or or maybe he has contacts with someone who um on the in the oncology side of things things that are that are uh uh familiar with this and and willing to do it um so that's what that's what I would try um but you know this is something that you can do independently uh in conjunction with your normal oncologist you can just do this and you just keep your gki down as low as possible you try to keep below two below one if you can uh with combinations of carnivore diet and fasting um and so really high fat two to one uh grams of fat to grams of protein so you want 80% of your calories coming from fat so like ground beef you want 65% lean 35% fat that's two to one right so really fat as fat as you can get add butter to that and then you keep your ketones um your your gki down so ketones up blood sugar down there's different ways of doing this most powerful ways are just eating that way and then periods of fasting potentially and you sort of just just track that and you have to have periods of refeeds you don't want to lose too much weight you know if you have extra weight on you then you know you you have a bit of a cushion but you don't want to keep losing weight losing weight because that can that can really hurt you as well um those are the main tenants and um you know there are a few other caveats there sometimes medications and things like that you know help lower your blood sugar more um you know like you know metformin can is sometimes prescribed for these sorts of things but that those just help chemo and radiation as well so even if you're going through standard of care uh this can make make the Chone radiation more effective and more safe for you and it doesn't damage your body as much so um good I really good luck with that you can try Dr Phillips uh Dr Matthew Phillips over in Hamilton um but again he's a neurologist and so he may not be be able to help you but he may at least know someone in uh uh in oncology who can and either way you can you can do this yourself um and uh you just keep your gki down on average and it doesn't have to be down all the time under two it's just on average over the course of the week you want that below two right and that's sort of a therapeutic range you can also look into paleo medicina over in Hungary and they may be able to do distance sort of um uh calls with you and uh and help coach you with that and they have a lot of experience with this they've been doing this for like 15 years now so um and they have very good results with with their cancer patients so good luck with that hopefully you uh you beat this and you you make it through with flying colors and and um are able to to to get on the other side and and help other people Inspire them to do it as well okay just taking a look at this guys I think I've got a ton of um a ton of questions so I think we just cap it here I'm going to try to get through all these if I can but I'm actually flying out today for a conference in um in uh Sydney so um I'll be speaking at a conference this weekend and um and so I have to pack get to the airport so I I sort of have about another half an hour and I'll try to get through as many of those as I can so Terry thank you for the Super Chat hi I did a double take at the grocery store when I saw familiar docon magazine I bought it congratulations well thank you very much that's very sweet of you to say that um uh yeah so I was on the cover of of Women's Health Magazine and um they did a piece on cornivore which was really cool and so if people see that you can you can support them or get that or or not but um yeah it was it was sort of fun it was um first time i' sort of been asked to do something like that which was nice it was it was um yeah it was sort of out of the blue I didn't um thankfully I saw that email I missed so many emails but um caught that one and uh yeah and uh so they sent a photographer over to the house and took some pictures and then did a phone interview and they wrote it up so it was It was kind of fun so people can check that out if they're interested did a a story about it with the just the cover didn't have the Insight on it um but yeah people can check that out if they're interested thank you very much Terry I appreciate it prod lb thank you for the Super Chat hey Doc at the rare on the rare occasion that you drink alcohol what do you drink thanks for converting me to carnivore and internal health well you're very welcome I'm glad you you were open-minded enough to give it a try uh I mean once every two years or so I might drink uh but then I regret it for the rest of the month because I don't get my energy levels back for a month and um so something has to be really you know worth me you know not feeling my best for a month not I feel hung over or anything like that I just don't have good energy and and I don't feel my best and I like feeling my best but when I do drink it would just be like pure spirits like clear Spirits like um vodka you know do like a vodka you know soda water like that's it you know no no uh mixers or anything like that just just vodka and water um you know you potentially do things like whiskey but they'll have more you know impurities in it you know that's what gives it the weird the brown colors just stuff from the oak is soaking in there and and that gets in your body and uh make you feel a bit worse but um yeah that's what I drink and then uh and then I regret it for a month but at least it's cleaner than all the other things you're not getting all the other you're getting alcohol and that's bad we know that that's a known poison but at least you're not getting all the other unknown poisons or at least um little known poisons that that come along with it so that's what I do JB thanks for the Super Chat female 65 lots of burping uh for 10 minutes after 12 months carnivore perfectly uh or particularly when driving just uh beef butter bacon and eggs was 35 years on antis psychotics uh zero for six months uh please help um well first of all congratulations getting off of the antis psychotics that's amazing you know you've been off those for six months that's that's absolutely fantastic um I I don't know what could be causing your burping um I've seen that a couple other times I It generally just goes away if it's been sort of 12 months and you're still doing it is it because of the carnivore is it because of something else um don't know what you can do is you can get a a diary like a just a little food journal on um and a symptom journal and so you you write down what you've eaten and how much you've eaten and um and [Music] um there's um yeah so how much you've eaten what you've eaten when you've eaten it and then whatever symptoms you get after that it may be connected to certain things maybe there's certain foods certain meats that don't you eat eggs and you're just burping after you eat eggs or something like that and you just sort of see if there's any sort of pattern if it's uh or you can see that there is no pattern it's completely unrelated to what you're eating which is also good information and then it's just like all right well you know at least it's not something that I'm doing to myself it's just something weird um but that that's what I would do sometimes you can see those patterns and you can see uh if something's triggering it so Lena thank you for the Super Chat when you do one meal a day do you stay full all day well that's the only reason I would do one meal a day is if that were enough for me to eat that day or because I didn't have time to if I was you know working a lot and didn't have a chance uh but I find if I'm eating fatty meat um you know like RI eyes with butter on it then I don't need and I eat until it stops tasting good then I find that I generally don't need to eat more than once a day if I'm just doing normal stuff if I'm working out a lot I'm regularly in the gym that's twice a day uh so I would need more and if I need more I need more and if I need more I eat more and so um it's uh that's that's why I would do it so I don't I don't fast and I don't do Ohad I'm not I'm only going to eat once a day I I tend to eat once a day just because that's how much my body needs and I eat maximally during that one meal and so when you do that that um you know you eating more high density food you're eating you don't need to eat as much or as often and so it just naturally turns out that I end up eating about once a day but if I'm hungrier than that because I've been working out or much more active then I I eat more often than that but it's usually twice a day at most Marshall n thank you for the super chat um 15 to 30 days uh with a long fast 13 to uh 15 Jesus 15 to 30 days help with loose skin uh I would get a doctor to monitor weekly I've lost 120 pounds I live about 20 minutes from Dr kenberry and was thinking of uh trying to see him um I don't I don't know if he's seeing patients he has uh he he know he's been in practice for like 20 some years and so he has um other patients that he sort of keeps a track track of but he sort of does that uh just as a as you know just just being nice so I don't know if he he takes on any new patients but um hey buddy but um you know I don't I don't know for sure that it would you I mean there are people that have you know lost a lot of weight but done it you know with fasting and with um you know carnivore and things like that and lost a lot of weight and their skin shrunk down with them and um and um you know some people some people um you know will will not get that tightening of the skin so it's hard to say um I you know I don't know you know any any sort of Hard Answers to tell you for that on on whether it would or it wouldn't um that's a long fast you know and if you're not if you don't have cancer I don't really recommend that for people I don't really recommend fasting for you know people out outside of of a specific medical condition that it could help um you generally get most of the benefits of fasting just from not eating the wrong things if you're eating correctly then you're going to be in the right metabolic State your body's going to work correctly as well so you could try it that's a long fast though um and um you know so you want to be careful and then you have have to De like refeeding you know slowly you know eating introd using food again but doing it a very slow and careful way so you don't get sick um but I can't really say one way or the other and so if that's something you feel that is important for you to try I would just you know ask you to please be safe with it and be careful I mean we're we're designed to weather famines and to not eat for a while and survive it um but you still need to be careful so just keep that in mind um and if you were to try fasting maybe start with shorter duration fast and see how that goes um but you know just make sure you're healthy um that's the most important thing there are people that have done much longer fast than that and it you can do it but you just need to be careful about it okay so just if you know like you said you know checking with a doctor good uh that's a good a good first step but you need to be very careful on refeeding and making sure that you're what you need to to um I'm not a big expert in in fasting because I'm not a big proponent of fasting so I think you need to look into how to do it safely and uh make sure you're not hurting yourself but I I don't know if it would help with that either way so uh it's up to you on whether you want to try that agk thank you for the Super Chat I feel satiated easily with beef I'm tall and skinny and lose fat when I want to gain weight Force feeding myself made me grow out how long until my body craves more meat for a caloric Surplus so the thing is is that you're not going to force that you know if you want if you force yourself to eat you'll just gain fat you're not going to put on muscle you might put on might make your muscles look a bit more plump because youve put in glycogen and intramuscular fat called myosteatosis um which um is is something we see on MRI all the time and um so you know and that's just you know that's how that's how you get marbling in uh cattle you feed them a bunch of carbs and they just put on a bunch of fat right but they put on fat in their muscles and that's how you get that marbling so human marbling is is happens from the same thing and that comes from um it's called myosteatosis so it's um you may look a bit bigger but you're not actually gaining lean muscle mass so what you need to do is you need to to lift weights and you need to stimulate your body you need to Sprint you need to work maximally and then you need to eat until it stops tasting good and you know where that is you so you get grossed out yeah that happens your body's telling you stop eating we don't need this we don't want it and so um you need when you work out and when you lift weights then you'll stimulate your body to grow and when you do that your body will need more food and so you'll be able to eat a lot more and in fact you'll want to eat a lot more and as long as you are and you get to that point where it stops tasting good you don't have to be grossed out you just have to keep eating as long as it tastes good and you get to a bite that's just Bland and not interesting you I don't really want to eat anymore that's what you need to do try that at least twice a day but the workout is is the main thing so people have different body types and compositions you're not just going to put put on muscle for asking right you need to you need to put in the work and um and then you need to give your body enough food to to put on the muscle after that uh and the idea of a caloric Surplus um that you you have to force your body to take in more calories than it wants and that's going to make you grow muscles is is broscience idiocy you know that's like the way of stand efforting and and those clowns he's a clown I mean like the guy's just has no freaking clue but you just saying oh you just have to force feed yourself all this sort of that's how you put on fat that's not how you put on muscle so you know if you're eating what you're designed to eat and you're stimulating your body you're going to put on muscle if you give your body enough food if your body is screaming at you don't eat you  um you know and you keep eating you're not going to put on more muscle okay I guess I'll just you know I guess we'll just you know uh put on muscle because you asked no if that's not how it works that's going to that's going to turn into fat and if you're eating a whole bunch of carbohydrates it changes your metabolism it it spikes your insulin it starts forcing intramuscular fat intramuscular glycogen which pulls in water so you look bigger oh look at look at me I'm getting so bulky and then you stop doing that it all goes away and this is why these big Mass monsters like like that clown you know would bulk up and bulk up and bulk up and then they'd lose like 80 pounds as they're shredding down for competition that they did not lose 880 pounds of muscle they lost 80 pounds of fat and water you know or however much they lose and so you know it's uh if you want to actually put on lean body mass and not have to lose fat afterwards this is how you do it so Nicholas uh vosis peros don't know how to pronounce your name I'm sorry but uh thank you for the Super Chat that question can you use a carnivore diet to reverse heart conditions as a result of partially blocked arteries like if you are high risk of heart attack can you reverse this condition um it's anecdotal at the moment uh there are case reports of people doing that there are uh people that I've seen that have done that um but we don't have like big studies showing that ex I think the closest one would be the lean mass hyperresponders data that came out with Dave Feldman Nick norwitz earlier this year that showed that people on a high fat meat-based keto or carnivore diet carore diet is a keto diet uh with this very elevated LDL but also it's elevated to them um you know to other people perfectly fine and normal from my point of view because that's physiological that's what your body's supposed to do your body's doing it on purpose why the hell that is that something that's if it's doing that normally physiologically why would that be a problem it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense your body just has an inbuilt kill switch like that you know that that species design would suck and it would not make it in in nature and they would just be extinct so maybe that happens somewhere they're not here anymore um that does not confer a survival Advantage so the person that got that that disease Gene um they wouldn't do very well you know and they certainly wouldn't outs survive the other people their group so in any case um the lean mass hyber responders they had people on high fat meat-based ketogenic diets with um what they what was traditionally considered markedly elevated LDL and they had no progression in their atherosclerosis and in fact the trend was to reverse atherosclerosis and so we are seeing that and so we're seeing those in those studies and uh that patient cooh and um and there are individuals that are coming out saying hey you know I've opened up you know one one gentleman in my patreon group uh Chip he he had 100% occlusion of his right cored artery now it's patent it's not completely open but it's blood is passing through it now right it's just you know severely limited but it's not 100% uded that's a massive Improvement they're not supposed to do that but it Rec canulated right like that's crazy so you know it's um you know the highway is not open yet but the rock slide has been cleared enough for cars to go through you know so that's a big deal that is a big big deal so I think that eventually the the data is going to show yes that this will do exactly that but right now it's it's very preliminary but it's if it's not going to make it worse and it's going to help you in a thousand other ways as well so even if it doesn't reverse that um you know it's still worth doing and then Shan omara Dr sha omara has been showing that you can that you're opening up vessels in the brain and elsewhere when you're getting rid of visceral fat you get fat around the the heart as well and you found that it's the areas the fat on the heart this fat grows over the heart and actually is where that fat externally is touching the corate arteries that that's where a lot of this PL plaque buildup uh develops um from something that he said if I'm if I'm not misremembering um so that's interesting as well you want to play chess buddy okay he's gonna start knocking on my chess pieces in a second I'm sure but uh I I would expect that this is something that that will be shown uh to yeah there they go um to uh be a thing in the future but but uh again the the data is pretty preliminary at this point super fluid of naughtiness uh thank you for the Super Chat do you have any opinion concerning blood type diet I'm o and it recommends a lot of meat but also specific veggies and fruit also any thoughts on food uh combining principles so the thing is is that it you know I'm I'm Type A so I'm supposed to be a vegan apparently I'm supposed to be an herbivore uh somehow and uh I am not um and neither are you and neither is any other human being on Earth this is this doesn't go by blood type this goes by species and so the your blood type is is a is a one protein expression two protein Expressions um and on on the surface of your of your red blood cells and not really anywhere else so why is it that that a protein or two difference on your red blood cell cells is going to completely overhaul your entire digestive tract and nutritional requirements why is it that someone with blood type A all of a sudden doesn't need B12 anymore do they just make their own now because of their their blood type no that's obviously not the case um the you know Lions have different blood types parakeet have different blood types they still have the same diet so regardless of the genetic idiosyncrasies or blood types of any animal on earth they they eat they eat according to their species not according to their blood type you know you have you have people in a tribe you know uh that uh that are have have different blood types and then you have them eating what the tribe eats but all those babies have different blood types and so some of them are dying off or something like that no that's not how that's not how that works infam morality can be high but it's not because of their blood type and and whether or not they're getting enough asparagus um so no that's that's really not a thing um the only the only thing you need to worry about your genetics um is uh are you human if you're human then you should eat what humans eat you should eat a human specific diet doesn't matter any of the any of the uh my cat sorry any of the um genetic differences between Lions you will you can take every single Lon on Earth with all their little idiosyncrasies and all their genetic um you uh uniqueness and um and you can put them all against um you can have them eat gazelle and you have them eat asparagus you will not find a single lion that does better on asparagus than it does on gazelle never you'll never find that um and the same thing goes with us we still have an optimal diet there may be some people that according to their ethnic background um have uh an easier time with inappropriate foods like people that have had their their ancestors you know had agriculture for 10,000 years versus Native Americans native Australians who've only been exposed to this for a couple hundred years yeah there's going to be a disparity there um and in what they can eat but they all do best on meat right my mom is Type O my dad is type A we all got we're all AO right so what does that mean oh well if you're type O then you came from hunter gatherers we all came from hunter gatherers we all came from hunters and um and my my mom who's you know European American my dad who's European American um type O and type A they're just totally different human beings and then then we are then what the hell are we I have type A and type O what the hell does that mean I just need to eat Caesar salads for the rest of my life no it's um it's it's not it's not the case that that matters it's you know one protein difference on your red blood cells is not going to make a difference um it matters what our species is our species is um human and our species is carnivore so that's what I would do how to fix dandruff more fat less eggs no cheese yeah if you if you're reacting to something you know then that can potentially give you uh dandruff or rashes or other sorts of symptoms so you just get get rid of that um and more fat is good but also you know we're putting on pretty harsh chemicals on our hair and our head that can dry it out and cause problems sometimes dangerous is is from uh fungal uh issues that you know may may just need to clear or sometimes you putting products in there that sort of looks flaky and weird so uh but yeah U but more fat is possible and then getting rid of things that you might be reacting to is a good idea as well oh my goodness little boy Jesus he's just systematically taking every chest piece and knocking them against the wall and then he'll come back for another chest piece and start knocking it against the wall um I may have to get him out of here but uh DC thanks for the Super Chat uh how can I get my teenage daughter to at least try this for 30 days um I I don't actually expect you to answer that uh well yeah I mean you just just slowly but surely try to ease her into it and um and just just show by example and just show what you're doing and and sort of with teenagers especially the more pressure you put the uh the the more they're going to go away from it you know and um thank you and um and so you know that that's H that's a thing too so if you just leave by example and you just show how good you're you're feeling good you're doing and you just you're just sort of dropping hints and all these sorts of things and she sees that you know she's going to you know she's going to start to pay attention and hopefully hopefully come around on her own uh but if she thinks you're the one doing this you may not may not uh go for it but um you never know it depends on on your relationship with her but um you know I think most most kids will come around when they see how well their parents are doing on it and how excited they get about it and you know they'll want to they'll want to copy that and they want to want to do that with them Portland 454 thank you for the Super Chat I'm a male in my late 50s what do you recommend to maintain testosterone and muscle mass in older adults exactly the same thing just going on a cornivore diet I see this every day in my clinic um people in their 20s 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s going on a carnivore diet and massively increasing their testosterone had a guy uh in yesterday who uh nearly doubled his testosterone as a 43y old male and uh is now uh making testosterone in in the range that you would expect a healthy 25y old okay so he's he's middle-aged and yet he's not you know because middleaged is not middle-aged uh 60s middle-aged 70 80 that's middle-aged you know we're supposed to live 120 years 40 is still in the prime of life so uh so is 50 and so you know you can absolutely uh build your testosterone by eating just a carnivore diet because you basically get rid of the the barriers in the way of making proper testosterone um and and this is without any supplements or or medications by the way he just doubled his his testosterone and I've had you know young men young man he was he's 19 or 20 and his his testost was low for an 80y old and so was it was way way below the chart uh for the reference range which is already way too low and he was below that and so a normal doctors see that oh my God youve got primary testicular failure like you know we need to go on testosterone replacement you'll never produce testosterone properly well uh we just put him on a cornivore diet and in two months of not even being uh 100% he he still had some cheats here and there um he he more than doubled his testosterone and so he went from like 40 150 up to like 380 and that was just in a couple months and it kept going up from there and then he got really excited about that and started really dialing it in and becoming more serious about it and improved more than that as well chronic cardio is is not going to be your best friend um stress and poor sleep or testosterone Killers so optimize those lift weights to fatigue Sprint to fatigue those both will um produce more testosterone and growth hormone and then carnivore diet and that's how you improve your testosterone at any age Jeff H thank you for the Super Chat I've been carnivore for eight months following no calorie goal aside from eating till I felt full I feel great but I'm finding that as I lose weight I'm eating more per day not less is this common yeah think about it you know you're you're you have excess fat and your body's prioritizing that and using that that's why it's going away right and so by the time you get down to a more stable body fat percentage you have to eat more in order to maintain your weight and and the the body fat percentage because your body wants you at a certain body fat percentage and so you're going to need more to sort of maintain that I I it was literally over overnight for me I was eating one big riy a day and that was perfect for me and then one day I was just like no I need more than that and I was eating two and it was then two from then on of that size now I just do much thicker uh staks and so that that's enough for me um but I got down to you know like a low body fat percentage is you know on on calipers so however accurate those are um it was like you know 5 6% body fat and that was it Noe nobody was like nope that's where we're staying and you need to get um you need to to get more food now and it just doubled overnight so that that is very normal um that uh you know and and and it makes sense isn't it you know you're losing weight you're losing body fat and then when you get and when you get those body fat stores down to where your body says no this is the rainy day fund that's when your your appetite will increase so yeah that's totally normal it's to keep doing it you're doing it exactly right just eat until it not necessarily until you feel full but until it stops tasting good because feeling full is very different because it's uh you know our hunger signals are very different you have to relearn that it goes by taste keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good that's the key Bishop Ste learning thanks for the Super Chat uh can you expand on the nutrients found in fat also does fat from different parts of the animals have better nutrients EG Eskimo considered the brain and fat from behind the E eyes a delicacy uh creepy so um uh yeah so I mean the brain obviously has a lot of of extremely important nutrients in it as well that are important for your brain and um and that's something we've been eating for millions of years there's evidence we pound stones crack open the skulls of carrying animals and get at the brain and that was something we could access because we weren't you know we were Scavenging a lot of the meat that we were eating for for a long time before we were able to actually hunt and get Sharpstone tools to cut off meat and eat it um but uh there's quite a lot I mean there's there's more than we understand as well there's a study that came out that said there was estimated about 51,000 uh nutrients potentially essential nutrients in meat that we we don't even necessarily have names for all of these things and so um you know a lot of those being the fats but you know you get all the the essential fatty acids cholesterols really important as well but DHA EPA um the the other sort of saturated fats and unsaturated fats that are important for your body coming from animal fats and um vitamin D3 vitamin A vitamin E K2 all of these things are are fat soluble and uh and exist in the fat and so those are those are things you need so those are sort of of some of the main ones but there's there's so many and we don't even necessarily have names for all of these things so it's not even enough to just supplement um you know certain things like yes you have a deficiency in D and you're not really getting enough from from for whatever reason sure you know you want to take some fine or B12 especially but um as far as the different sorts of organs certainly the different organs are going to have a different nutrient content like the uh like the brain is going to have a different nutritional uh uh composition than just your normal fat around your body um fat behind eyes who knows potentially you know people go would would prioritize the cheeks and the tongues of animals those were always the delicacy the high fat content very very tender very flavorful um that flavor that more flavor is probably indicating more nutrients and so that's probably why that is so yeah there would be a difference just like the different organs taste very different as well and um and uh yeah so those are some some broad Strokes anyway but uh you know if you have if you have a certain part of that animal that you really enjoy and that tastes really good to you your body's probably talking to you and telling you like hey you want some nutrients that uh that this little particular part of the animal has that's why sometimes liver tastes really good and then you eat a few of it and you just go no don't want it anymore that's uh that's probably your body saying we have enough of those nutrients now so this is from my sister rosin new t-shirt idea plants killed Socrates actually I'll probably end up making that that's that's a great idea um uh because they did the bastards so yeah that great idea thank you for that rosand um Emily thank you for the Super Chat I've been having mild gallbladder pain the last week I'm 22 on carnivore uh I eat three meals a day till full with small snacks in between when hungry any suggestions on why and what to try well you know I mean the first question I ask is is is it actually your gallbladder that's painting you that's um you know you get that sort of in the right upper quadrant just under the the ribs there if you eat fatty meat and all of a sudden it's squeezing and it might be on some stones or sludge it's pushing on those things and that's uncomfortable and um and so that would happen when you're expressing bile when you're eating eating uh fat so first of all it's important to to know if that's actually what's going on or if it's something else um so it's specifically in the right side under the ribs when you eat fat and um so you know that's the first question as answer um if it if if it does turn out to be that's what's going on and you have stones or you has sludge Um this can potentially clear if those stones are small enough and they can they can pass out if you have stones that are that are too big and they get stuck then you you will need a procedure you'll need help to get that that stone pulled out of there you may end up losing your gallbladder the thing is is that bile store is stored in the gallbladder and concentrates there because we have to deal with famines and not getting enough food all the time time and so it has to be concentrated so you can get a big amount of fat you know at a certain point or when you're able to eat as opposed to you know eating every single day and all the time every day like a grazing animal and um so if you're doing a carnivore diet and you're eating a lot of fat you know that's going to start stimulating that you're going to start moving that uh and if you have those stones in there it's going to start uh you know it can be a bit uncomfortable but the reason that you have those in the first place is because you weren't eating enough fat before because your gallbladder is going to store that bile and it's going to just sit there and sit there and get concentrated concentrated and it's going to form crystals it's going to form precipitate that's what hyperconcentrated Solutions do at rest is they turn into crystals they solidify right and so that's what bile sludge is that's what gallstones are and so you they say oh don't eat fat you're going to get it you it's going to hurt okay well it might hurt but what it's doing is is clearing those things and it's dissolving that and and not making more concentrated if you avoid fat then it's going to get worse those stones are going to get bigger and you will get an obstruction and they will get blocked and you will have to get your gallbladder removed so the trick is to eat enough fat hopefully this clears you know if you do it you know slowly and and um carefully then hopefully it won't be too uncomfortable but um first of all maybe talk to your doctor and and get like an ultrasound of the of the gallbladder just to see what's going on make sure it actually is that's what it is but either way I would still do the same thing which is eating high fat carnivore diet and that will potentially dissolve those or clear those and have you pass those through and get those out of the gallbladder you could get an obstruction you may have to end up getting a procedure like an ercp where you know goes in through the mouth and snakes up in there and pulls that little Stone out of the the common bile duct if if it's possible to do so um but if it's not possible to do so and they have to take out your gallbladder that'll be unfortunate but that's sort of the horse is out of The Barn at that point anyway because it was it was a foregone conclusion at that point because if you um if you don't eat fat then it's only going to get worse and you're definitely going to get a blockage and obstruction at some point anyway so might as well just sort it out now but hopefully that doesn't happen hopefully your body clears it Kevin P thank you very much for the super chat last two weeks or so on Carnivore I'm experiencing um really vivid dreams so vivid that real life experiences through the the the day seem to continue on in my sleep interesting is this related to a new way of eating uh potentially I mean um I I heard I have no idea where this came from was just something my mom told me when I was a kid was that um is that if you had higher B vitamins you'd get more vivid dreams and um and I tried that as a kid because I was like oh that's interesting and um and you might have lucid dreams where you actually realize you're dreaming in your dream and then all of a sudden you're like I'm in my dream I can just do whatever I want in my imagination instant superpowers I think everybody just starts flying and doing all this sort of crazy stuff when I did this um that was always the thing I I basically turned into a jet a flying Jedi um I would just like instantly start flying and then shooting like lightning bolts out of my hands like the the Emperor Palpatine and um and like materialized a massive diamond and like a a chick there because I was a teen I was a teenage boy but um uh you know that that could very well be uh because of U B vitamins um and you're actually getting proper B vitamins now so I I don't know but that's uh something that I was told as a kid anyway and uh when I B vitamins before I would go to sleep I would always have very vivid dreams and even lucid dreams especially when I was tuning up for it cold brute thank you for the Super Chat uh I'm tired of ground beef Stakes are expensive can I eat chicken thighs and eggs uh yes you can I heard that beef is more nut has more nutrients and is the best meat to eat do you need to take any carnivore supplements generally not you know you can you could probably live your whole life on eggs uh pasture raised eggs though I mean those pasture raised eggs have far more nutrients in it than than the normal cornfed eggs that we're we're going to get corn and soy fed eggs so you know that's what you want you want to get you want to get um the highest quality chickens and eggs and things like that that you can and um and so you're getting Pastor raised eggs if you raise your own chickens and you get your own eggs that's going to be even better just let them eat bugs and worms and things like that and Forge around that's where you're going to get that's where they get nutrition that's where you're going to get the nutrition as uh by proxy and um so that that's but yeah you can absolutely do that um I've I've spoken to people who um uh who have you know have met people that have lived years and years there was a there was a story of a guy uh in who was traveling in Germany he saw this guy and he was in his 80s but he just got done cycling and he was just you know he he you could tell he was a bit older but he he had the physique of like a you know someone in their 30s and um and so he uh he sort of just asked him he got talking to him and he just said you know he had been in World War II and he was uh you know obviously he's German so he was fighting for the Germans and um he got injured early on in the war so he was sent back home inflation was just out of control and so he just as as soon as he was able to with his you know the money he had from from the Army he uh just bought a little place up in the hills somewhere and bought some chickens because he couldn't really afford food and so he just lived on the chickens he would never eat the chickens just because they fed him and so you know they lived together nicely and then he got more chickens and they laid eggs and they had more chickens they laid eggs and pretty soon he was able to eat very comfortably and and um and and feed his neighbors and give them eggs and all that sort of stuff and he said that he just kept doing that throughout the war and he just felt so good that he just never stopped and so he'd been eating just eggs his own pasture raised eggs for 60 70 years at that point or 60 years at that point I'd say and um and uh you know it was doing great was really healthy so you could do it you just need the higher nutrition uh pasturised eggs and um you know tons of folate in pasture raed eggs uh tons of everything you know these are the precursors for life is all the nutrients that are in an egg and um you can always just check you know if you're not if you don't think you're or if you want to know how much nutrients and vitamins and minerals you have you just check and if you're low on something you can supplement that or make sure you're getting higher quality eggs chilled monkey brains uh thank you for the Super Chat so I've heard you mention an association between diet and autism spectrum disorder can you elaborate are there any studies I can take a look at thanks uh yeah I I put a number of studies in um the the uh videos that I've done on autism and um uh yeah there's a lot of associations and you know Association isn't causation but at least it's interesting uh there's one that had preconception diet so women that were eating a lot more meat and red meat preconception so before they got pregnant had much lower rates of children with autism presumably they're not just going to stop doing that during pregnancy and and rearing of the child um so you know who knows um about that but they specifically were talking about preconception um women that have higher LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol during pregnancy lower rates of children with autism that eat higher saturated fat diets during pregnancy lower rates of kids with autism women who breastfeed instead of bottle feed lower rates of kids with autism um does people that now this one I was looking specifically for formula fed versus bottle versus breast fed and I couldn't find a study on that but the bottle fed was the closest one I could get I was wondering you know is sugar going to be a precipitate Factor um for uh autism because formula fed formulas have there a buttload of sugar added to it um which is not good uh I think and um and a bunch of seed oils and horrible nasty crap like that so this didn't differentiate between people that just Express milk and put that in a bottle and use that as well as formula but you know most people who bottle feed instead of breastfeed are using formula um because usually people that that breast pump they're also breastfeeding and then they pump as well and there're sometimes that having a bottle the ones that exclusively bottle feed they're not breastfeeding at all and they're not pumping at all and so they're not making milk at all um and so it's much more likely that th those people people were using formula and so the so that group anyway had higher rates of kids with autism and then the out of University or the Texas A&M University in America they found that vegans and vegetarians were having higher rates of kids with autism and and that is in the literature as well as higher rates of autism in vegan and vegetarian families that eat less meat or no meat and Texas A&M found that one of those was uh seemed to be causitive because um of a carnitine deficiency and so people that don't have enough carnitine their brains don't develop properly their neurons can't develop properly and uh and this is important for mitochondrial function and health as well and so it's um they found that um well it is the case that carnitine is actually an essential nutrient for a lot of people fully 30% of people don't make enough carnitine or any carnitine at all and so is oh it's non-essential it doesn't matter it matters for at least 30% of people and more in your diet is helpful as well and so they found that that people vegans and vegetarians they weren't getting enough carnitine for their kids and if their kids weren't making enough carnitine if they were one of these fully onethird of humanity that doesn't make enough carnitine that they were that they were uh getting these types of autism the brain wasn't developing properly and then you have study of of uh you all all throughout the literature showing that ketogenic diets in particular getting rid of carbs and sugar changes the brain energy and changes the mitochondrial function and patterns in the brain of autistic um children and adults and their brain starts working better and so there are entire treatment group there there are doctors and Facilities that treat autism with ketogenic diets Professor Chris Palmer from Harvard is a professor of psychiatr Harvard wrote about this in his uh book Brain energy and we talked about it on our interview um that that I did with him you will look for that on our Channel we talked a lot about autism and uh and he was saying that that going on ketogenic diets is really important for autistic kids especially because you have a chance to reverse a lot of the mdev of the brain and develop properly and uh and more healthfully than um uh as a kid when your brain is still developing and so that's when you need to get this but even as adults I've spoken to many adults with autism who have significantly improved their lives and their symptoms one guy um Jonathan grip this we've done a couple podcasts together really nice guy he's a British guy who uh is is a bodybuilder and um and we you know the subject of autism came up and he said that he had autism you would never have guessed this by speaking to him by by the the rest of the conversation I had no idea that he was on the Spectrum but he said that a year ago before he was doing carnivore he would not have been able to have the conversation we were having right now which is amazing and I've had uh people come to me and say Hey you know come up to a conference there's a lady that did a uh a podcast with uh Ally she goes by Ally carnivore we did a podcast together on autism and her story with her kid she I Had You Know i' spoken to her online before and she came up to me at ketocon um two years ago and she said um you know this is my son this my these are my kids and you know said did all the hell and she said he's a non-verbal autistic and I was a bit confused I was like I'm pretty sure I just heard him talk and she said when eating carbohydrates and so when he doesn't eat carbohydrates he is completely functional and and then he'll go over to his grandparents house and they'll you know try to buy his love with candies and cookies and things like that and and he'll come back he won't speak for four days right and um and so that just shuts down his brain his brain needs ketones and so then it goes back into ketosis and all of a sudden his brain works again and so they got him on Carnivore for probably close to two years now and six months ago or so she told me that she messaged me and said that tested into the gifted program at school so went from being non-verbal autistic and that could have been the rest of his life to now being in the gifted program and actually being able to be functional and and a and a a productive uh successful adult and that's a that's an amazing amazing difference you can do for somebody and it's just from not eating carbohydrates and I get comments all the time you know if people here are suffering with autism or have a family member suffering autism please put that in the comments put that in the chat uh and defin in the comments because they're more permanent uh tell your story what what's your what's your um experience with this because it's important for people to get this out there and know it because if they have a family member and they're just kind of like well it's hard it's hard to change people's diets especially when they're autistic you know it's difficult but oh my God it's worth it and so the more this gets out there the more people realize just how worth it this is you can completely change this person's course of their entire life for the better you know that it's so important and however the hell you can do it by hook or crook you know it's so important to do um i' I've spoken to adults that are autistic and suffered with autism their whole life and um and said that uh you know that when they eat carbs they turn non-verbal and they can't speak for days and they just shut off one person was actually really sad we're talking about autism I I had a short talking about autism and you look at the comments it's a recent short so go into my shorts and go uh to the the one on autism look at the comments there's a lot of comments on there people with Autism the family member with autism and uh these massive improvements one was was was kind of sad but they said imagine being in a world of your own design in your own head for years for your whole life and then one day deciding to eat meat and and all of a sudden coming out of it and now you're in a completely different world and you realize the world that you were in before wasn't the real world but now you have no skills you have no family con you have no friend Connection you have no this you have no that and you're in this new world that's now completely foreign to you and you don't have any skills and life skills and things like that um I don't have to I don't have to wonder what that's like because I that's my experience so that's some what they were describing and you're going in the chat and people were talking about this and other people had that experience too was that they had autism and their their brain was not working right and then all of a sudden they started eating meat and it started getting better as an adult getting healthier and healthier and healthier and all of a sudden they're there and they know what's going on now and their brain's working to an extent that you know they they see the world around them for what it is and they realize I'm 40 years old and I don't have any job skills or skills and that's hard so the earlier you do this the better however there are a lot like Jonathan that that are adults that have you know had uh autism and um and and completely changed it and now you know he's he's just living a normal functional productive life which is great so it it makes a massive difference it makes a massive massive massive difference so anybody with uh that that has this sort of condition or has a family member with it please give this a try this is something that can completely change your life and it can change their life and it's something that um is probably the most important thing that anyone with autism can do okay I'm going to do just a couple more questions guys um and um okay I'm just G I'm actually sort of want to just end it on that note because that was sort of a good note to end it on um and I've sort of gone about half hour over where I thought I was um thank you very much everyone I I I think I probably do just want to leave it there on that that note about autism because I think that's a really important message um please if anybody has or knows someone that suffers from autism you know please do to try to get resources to them or their parents or if you're the parent you know think about this seriously um and and look at the research and uh and see if you can do it for your child or yourself because it makes a massive difference and the sooner you do it the the sooner they can recover and the sooner that they can can rebuild their life and um and just be a happy healthy uh wonderful uh person that doesn't have to get um you know doesn't have to suffer with with their brain not working the way it's supposed to um so yeah we'll end it there thank you all very much it's been an absolute pleasure I've love the questions they're always they're always interesting and always great um and um and uh you know it's always it's always interesting to see what the the questions are going to be and it's always you you think that it would be pretty pretty much the same questions of just the me do this you know it's like but it's not I mean there's similar one you know cholesterol gets brought up a lot but um that's understandable but uh yeah it's um always great questions and I really appreciate you guys coming on hope you like this if you do please uh hit like and think about subscribing if you haven't and leave a comment below and let YouTube and other people know what you think and uh and especially if you or someone you know um suffers with autism please do let us know what your experiences have been with yourself or with your family member loved one or friend just because my God I mean if we can just reverse this um and nothing else I think that would be a huge huge impact and benefit to humanity so all right thank you everyone uh really great to see you I'm I'll be doing a um another premiere on Sunday us time Monday morning um Perth time as usual and then I'm thinking of adding in a second uh YouTube live thing a week just because of um you know I don't always have as much time to to get through all the questions so I might add in a second one during the week possibly on Tuesdays in the US Wednesday mornings in Perth so that would be Tuesday Thursday or Wednesday Friday depending on what part of the world you're in okay thank you everyone really appreciate it and have a great weekend"
