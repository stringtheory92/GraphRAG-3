        "body": "[Music] hi everyone this is uh dr anthony chafee i'm here with a very special guest today uh hollywood actor and model antonio sabato jr uh antonio thank you so much for coming on that's been it's an actual uh pleasure of mine to to meet you i've actually seen you in your work um all throughout the you know the the 90s and 2000s and so it's a real pleasure to speak to you thank you for coming on thank you doc thank you anthony i really appreciate it yeah not a problem so um you were telling me that you've actually come across the carnivore diet now and that's uh been something that that has helped you that's probably an anomaly in uh hollywood everyone else is going vegan um and be very very aggressive about that um how did you come across the carnivore and and what made you decide to to go that that route how did it help you well i i've been in fitness and sports my whole life i i love to train really hard i love to push myself and i just turned 50. so i i've been doing this since i was a teenager and and i've been in the fitness world all my life that's that that's something that is a big part of my life i enjoy it um it's it's something that i have to do daily you know in every home that i've ever owned i always build a gym i have a gym right here that i use and i go running i i i you know i race cars i race motorcycles i skydive i you know and i also do jiu jitsu i like to wrestle i like to do things and weights and stuff so and i've been boxing my whole life so i i tend to really know my body really well and i've i've tried a lot of diets over the years i even tried vegan and that was horrible that was one of the one of the most horrible experiences i ever went through because i i tried i wanted to do it i wanted to try things and this is just for me i'm not here to preach to anybody what to do but for myself i really know my body i know i know what goes through i know i mean really like i know how i feel on a daily basis um and it's all related to the food that i put in my body and the rest that i get um and and i tried everything and and i've done research this whole year i spent a lot of time researching this carnivore diet and i found out that you know the only way to really find out is going to work after everything that i read including stuff that you have talked about um i said let's give it a try and i got to tell you um one of the things that i realized that i wanted to do was cut cut coffee i didn't want to drink coffee anymore it was just a habit it was it's a drug i drank it every day and then i had to put the creamer every day it was an addiction every morning every morning every morning and and in the past when i cut coffee i had these migraines i've always had these migraines for at least a week or two and they were really bad and it was one of the things that really scared me to quit because i just didn't want to have these things going on well guess what when i started this carnivore diet i had no migraines at all i had i quit coffee like that and the next day i was surprised i didn't have a headache then the next following day i didn't have a headache and then a week later i'm like i didn't drink coffee for a week i didn't have any caffeine for a week and i did not have a headache and i had this really when i started carnival and i went really deep i went meat beef uh i really didn't go with chicken a lot i went really beef i wanted to really go hardcore and see what my body could could deal or not deal with uh and it was fascinating right away i had in the morning i would get maybe five hours of sleep and and i was working on the movie so i was really tired i felt but then in the morning i would wake up and i has all this energy i had amazing energy and i would just i would work out before going on set i would work 14 hours i would go to sleep i would eat these two maybe three meals but it was all beef and it was i put some fruit in it pineapples things like that but i got rid of all sugar i got rid of all bread i got rid of all pasta i got rid of potatoes i got rid of vegetables i got rid of all that and it was just fascinating and i was i was kind of i was kind of contemplating about the the constipation you hear about and i was not constipated at all my body felt really good energetic i felt like i was like on steroids i felt like um i was taking something that was just i was really unreal the the the effect that it had on my body and it still does today like um you know when i got back home after the movie and i had some free time i worked out twice a day i had so much and i still do like i worked out in the morning i would have an hour of bike and i would just go on the bike and run for an hour and just sweat and hardcore i'm talking about like really hardcore on the bike and then i would have my my meats and i would have the things that i usually do now uh and eat like my eggs and i would have the cheese and the eggs and the sausages and things like that a lot of water water is great it's just floating through my body and then in the afternoon i would go for another one and i would go for weights and box and then before you know it in a matter of like i think two and a half weeks i lost 20 pounds yeah well it was like and i was having such a hard time losing any weight because i would either put it back or i would be hungry and i would eat certain things and then that the carbs and the and all that stuff that i was eating before and and i've always had a clean diet but i never really knew how clean it was until now because now now it's a whole different ball game and i'm having this blood work down next month and i know my doctor is going to say i'm i'm skeptical to find out about my cholesterol level because obviously it might be high it might be i don't know but i really don't care about that because what i care about is how i'm feeling and i'm feeling better than ever before and i don't take i hate taking any protein powders i i hate taking creatine i hate i don't take any of that stuff uh i believe all stuff is bad for you it's poison so i am just sticking to grass-fed a lot a lot of grass fed a lot of burgers um that are just awesome to eat and they fill me up like i don't have uh i have honey i have honey on these burgers which is really good i have a little bit of ketchup uh but and she's but i feel fulfilled like i don't i don't crave anything else and when i see other people eat you know i go out with my fiance we go out to dinner and she's eating something that you know maybe i would eat in the past i don't crave it i don't crave it at all so my body is really full it's incredible i think it's amazing the best i should have done a long time ago i'm really happy about it yeah so how long have you been doing it now well now it's been a constant over 30 days of just really full on and i don't intend to stop anytime soon i am going to continue this for the rest of my life um i really am uh and i'm really consistent on things you know when i set my mind on something because why would i change it i mean i i don't see any reason why i would change it uh because i feel i just i feel the best i ever felt and also the recuperation muscle aches um sleeping uh it's just incredible how my body's just really reacted really really well um and like i said i don't take any um any additional you know for for vitamin c you know i have my orange juice uh with with you know with no sugar just really fresh orange juice um and then pineapples i love eating pineapple um but i leave it at that and i feel great i feel really good and strong i feel really strong my skin is really thin uh i have i mean i have muscles and things that came out of my abs that i never had in my it's like i feel good man i'm not complaining i'm looking pretty good nice yeah that's the thing like uh yeah obviously we we try to live healthy and especially in your industry you know you you have you have to you know you have to you know keep your body in shape you have to keep your your mind and body right you know to look good and feel good and be able to do these long hours on the sets but it's only when you actually get on the right path or you know get on on what i i believe is is our primary way of eating that you actually see just how good you could have felt just how good you know good actually feels and then and then everything um you look back on this goes like crap you know i actually haven't been feeling good my whole life apparently and so for me personally like yeah i just i have no interest in going back to that that's the and uh yeah so now and the coffee thing was really uh that was an addiction for me because i'm italian i was born in rome italy i mean coffee was always part of my life it's just everywhere and i was drinking too much of it and uh and i needed that to wake up and i just hated that because it's like why do i need stuff you know i always felt like i don't need anything you know i just wanna and now i don't eat anything now i i get up and i have i have my full meals and uh and they get me going and most importantly is how i feel afterwards you know like um just everything really my my sharpness my memory uh is incredible i really am sharp about everything memorizing stuff more than ever my eyesight um my lungs too when i go running uh how how hard i can push you know like i said i'm 50 so i'm not a not a spring chicken but i i uh i just love to train so much that in the past you know i would have to you know if i push too hard i get either too sore i i you know or i hurt myself and i have to take it easy now i don't take it easy at all now i just kept pushing i just keep going so i'm like how far can i go so it's um it's exciting to to do that and um because it makes me feel great you know it's part of my life i don't i train because you know the hormones and everything that kicks in my testosterone level is incredible right now you know it's just um wow i mean i'm telling you man i when people ask me and i tell them what's going on they quite don't understand and they're kind of scared because they've heard so many negative things and so did i i mean in the past the cholesterol level was a big thing the constipation is always a big thing but um you know the vegetable things uh i got rid of a lot of it and i mean all of it and i feel great i don't need them at all for anything you know and i'm glad i don't have to buy any more vegetables like um yeah that's the thing uh with with constipation yeah as long as you get enough fat generally uh you're not going to be constipated that'll keep everything soft and and that's uh that's something that people don't realize they always think that it's fiber fiber fiber that's removes your digestion but that those recommendations only came around in the 1980s after we said stop eating fat and that's when people started getting constipated because they weren't getting enough fat and then they said oh well you should just you should eat fiber that will that will keep things moving through but that was a brand new suggestion and so people don't realize that like you know it doesn't really make sense that we would all of a sudden as a species need to eat a lot of fiber to move our digestion in 1986 but before that needed nothing you know yeah i remember that because in the 80s i remember uh there was all those you know take take your fiber in the morning the remember that there was it was the product especially in america when i came here it was um i don't remember what it was but it was it was every morning it was a commercial plan you got to put scoop in the water and you got to put fiber and it became such a thing but i got to tell you the the vegan the vegan was for me was horrible man i was like i was burping a lot i had a lot of gas constant get like it was just uncomfortable and really uncomfortable and i felt weak uh the estrogen level was really high because i remember that was really emotional um a lot of times they're like why am i emotional about this you know and um i i definitely would never ever ever ever do a vegan diet ever again it's the worst thing i could possibly do to my body um 100 uh no question no question and when like you said hollywood is very high on these things on the protein shakes from all this stuff and you have to take all these supplements and and we don't even know what's in the supplements and i used to train many years ago with an old old timer and um he's passed away now but he was he was a great guy he used to tell me all the time i said if you were if you were starving in a desert and you had a protein shake or you had a rotten hot dog which one would you eat which one would keep you alive and at the end of the day probably the hot dog will keep you alive so you know more than the than the the man made the powder so and that is so true nowadays because people go and they buy this stuff and they look at all these youtubers who are taking so much gear i don't care who you are because i i'm in sports you're in sports we have trained our whole life and you know what it takes to get your body to look like that i mean it's it's just and i wish to god that people would have because everybody from sports athletes even the olympics are taking gear everybody knows it it's just constant they're not tested as much as they should be and everybody gets away with it but all these fitness guys they are taking so much stuff and injecting so many things i wish to god they could at least talk about what they're doing and how much they're taking so instead of giving the lies about these products that they're trying to sell tell the world what's going on what are you taking what are you injecting yourself what kind of pills are you doing because because kids are doing that and whether you like it or not they might buy your products they might buy your your shakes or you might all this stuff but that doesn't work and that actually ultimately will kill your intestines i i know it because it's just it's it's going to affect you inside when you put stuff in your body it's got to go somewhere and that stuff is just artificial stuff that we don't even know what's in but they inject themselves so much and all the the fitness contests are all you know they're all under drug i mean they're all taking so much stuff and and i wish and it's so easy to get it and um that would be so beneficial to the next generation to understand what's going on because if you want to compete and you want to inject yourself with something you have a doctor's supervision or stuff and you explain and you talk about it that could help a lot of lives because you know that's your heart and i'm not talking about testosterone i'm talking about a lot of other stuff that they're taking that uh it's just killing people man and and in the long run it's not going to be good you know and i wish to god that they would tell the truth because we all know it's fun to watch them and it's fun to see them train and all stuff but talk the truth tell you know you're making millions of dollars by doing stuff that is not good for you let us know what it is or at least let know your viewers what it is have the guts to say this is what i take every day and and i wish i wish they would they would do that because it would help a lot of people especially the kids out there yeah and also [Music] you know when when kids get you know the idea is that they they can do this stuff and then they can play professionally you know it's one thing if someone's you know that they're perpetuating their career and they're saving for their future and they're taking care of their family and their you know that that risk and detriment to their health you know maybe that's worth it to them because they're actually getting paid to to do that but you know think about how many thousands of kids uh or young adults end up using these performance-enhancing drugs to try to make it you know even to just make it a college football team or make it into uh you know the nfl or some professional team and never make it and so they're getting all the harm to their body and future and they're getting none of the of the benefits from that and so there's there's a bigger knock-on effect as well than just the people that are that are doing this to perform because there are thousands and thousands of other people that are never going to be able to they're never going to make it to the show that they're still hurting themselves with this yeah and there's there's actors that i know you know a lot of actors have their trainers you know for specific movies they train for three months they get their trainer their their nutritionist they do all that and they inject themselves with a lot of stuff and then afterwards they let it go and then and then afterwards they don't want to train you know and not all of them there's there's some good guys out there that are training hard that are doing the right thing but you know the big movies the studio movies they want you to look a certain way and these guys have never worked out before so before you know it three months later they're all jacked and ready to go and then after the movie is done they go back to what they used to be um where you know i believe the actors that i love you know like tom cruise people like you know or even guys in the past you know like uh you know when brando was younger or paul newman you know he's always looked lean or bruce lee or people like that that really there's a different time or even steve reeves steve reeves was a natural guy back in the day you know he was he was uh he was a strong guy who lived a really long life a healthy life uh but you know people like schwarzenegger and people like that that have done a lot of gear a lot of stuff and you know schwarzenegger had how many hearts plan i mean he had surgeries after surgery he's lucky to be alive he should talk about that because i'm sure that the heart surgeries that he had was was affected by all the drugs he was injecting himself you know he and the thing is you couldn't have won those mr universe if it wasn't for the drugs you took so at least talk about it and say this is how much i took this is what i was taking and now to another level now they're taking it to another level now they're taking so much more stuff that you know these guys are just risking their lives but i'm telling you like this diet is just waking me up to a new level of of health and and fitness that i really enjoy and i love talking about this stuff because you know when you promote yourself out there on youtube and you're lying to a lot of people and you're making a lot of millions of dollars lying uh it's not right it's not right you know and uh and we all know the truth but it's not okay to lie constantly you know i just i just don't think you know you can lie a thousand times it's still gonna be a lie you know it's not gonna be the truth ever yeah and um but it is what it is you know this new social media that we have is so easy to but also it's good because i was able to look at people like yourself and and understand about this new diet and new way of living and stuff so there's good and bad i hope the people that watch stuff like what we're doing here and rather than other stuff that is not so true you know yeah definitely and that's the thing too is that this is this is a way that you can optimize your hormones optimize your health and like you say you'll get get the effects like you feel like you're on steroids and and in in a lot of ways you know that's it's not far off because you know i've i've had patients that have completely optimized their uh their hormones and you know men in their 50s uh that that increase their testosterone level by over 100 points in three months you know and so that that would be the equivalent of taking uh you know the supplemental uh testosterone replacement therapy getting them back up to uh high normal levels of physiological levels of testosterone and and without any medications and you know i talk to people and obviously i get i get accused of doing steroids all the time you know just uh i just since i was a kid really you know i've always i've always trained very very hard i was played very aggressively in in rugby and i remember you know when i would make some big play and i just go and just clean someone out people say like oh jesus you know calm down you're right freak you know and i would i was always taking as a compliment and just laugh because you know i was up there you know just you know putting the hurt on people who really were doing steroids and i wasn't i wasn't using any of that and um and i try to tell people that going on a carnivore diet as an athlete has been you know just one of the biggest uh you know benefits and and and advantages that i ever had i was so lucky to be you know i i was still you know very successful before i went carnivore uh like sort of 1920 but i was uh but that it just put me into a whole new level at that point and you know i try to tell people you know that this is actually i i was getting better results and i am getting better results now than people who i know were on steroids and they don't seem to believe that but like i know people who are on steroids that i played with and i know how i stacked up against them i know how i was able to compete i know how i was able to train beside them and the results i was getting as well and and i can actually say that that this is as good or better than taking steroids because it's not just one aspect it's not just optimizing your testosterone or raising that whole that hormone it's it's raising and optimizing all your hormones and how they work together and how your body works together and how your your your muscles heal and uh and recover and that's it that's a that's the complete package that you're not that you're not going to get just by doing steroids absolutely your body really needs it and when you when you feed it you know when you feed tigers uh you know the right meat and uh you just know what what kind of animals they can become and the same thing goes with us um it's just phenomenal because the how i felt right away was immediate it wasn't even like i had to wait a week or i had to wait a certain amount of time it was just my body really needed it and my entire crew were asking what's going on what are you taking what's what's happening over there you know your jawline is everything you know and questions started coming and and i was like wow this and they saw me eat and they saw me what kind of diet i changed and i won't even call it a diet it's just my regimen changed dramatically and i never went back and uh i'm constantly just loving it every day how i feel and um and trying and trying you know trying different way of you know eating maybe fish here maybe eating meat over here you know just changing it up but it's just carnivore all the way and uh and it's really incredible and then you know i had you know we went out the other night and um and even even even uh eating at other places i enjoy eating their steaks right now you know i really enjoy eating steaks from different places and and um and my body really reacts really well just striving i mean just really enjoys eating it and i guess that's how a tiger feels when you feed somebody and they eat it like that because um and the next morning how i just get up in the morning and i'm ready to go i don't i don't need my coffee anymore i don't need any anything to wake me up anymore i'm up and i'm ready to go um throughout the entire day uh and that's that's incredible i look forward to that um each and every day and uh and also the like i said the the training is is that the amount of sweat and the way i can push now uh without having any um caffeine without having anything that you know pre-workout stuff that that pre-workout stuff was just oh it was horrible it was just horrible um not that i used to take it all the time but there had been moments where i was on location or i would go to gold's gym in venice and i would have some some stuff that over there you know i was tired and it was just it gave you that stuff on you know i felt weird and uh i don't need any of that yeah i mean i'm i'm bench pressing more um i'm leaner and stronger um veins are coming out that i didn't see before i i just feel great and um yeah i tell everyone just try it just try it for yourself and see how you feel and then give it give it a little bit of time for me it was right away but you never know like why would you want to change something that makes you feel so great yeah absolutely so the the people on the set that saw what you were doing and saw what you were eating and they tried to try it out themselves yeah they did they tried it but uh you know it's hard because you know we as human beings are so addicted to so many things our addiction is so high right now we're so addicted to everything whether it's social media things that we see or things that we put in our bodies and all that stuff that we put in our bodies and mostly is bad it's very addictive it's like you you you want more of it and i remember being there you know like i remember my creamer it was part of my coffee so i had to have i couldn't have coffee without it so i would buy this jug of a creamer with so much sugar and carbs and it was automatic i had a coffee i had to put this thing in it and um and it was i remember i wanted to lose this little fat that i have and men as you know like behind our back lower back it's really hard to lose that fat uh for me it was you know i would do everything kind of you know i would run and it would just never go away now it's gone you know and in a month it's gone and but i remember the sugar which is i felt like everything would just go there you know it's like all this extra stuff and um that i don't have anymore and and i don't i don't need it you know but uh going back to my people that saw me they they want to try it but i don't know i think you got to be me you got to you got to really look at yourself understand your body see what where you want to go what kind of body you want to live in because it's the only body you've got so for me as you know i i'm i'm one of those people that when i do something i do it 100 and i don't turn back when i find the way and i've been looking for this way for a while doc i mean i i was i'm glad that i found it and it's never too late but i would have done this years ago and but they were asking questions you know they were asking questions there was one editor that was looking all the dailies and he would see my transformation through the film like my jawline was coming out and coming out i'm like look at this this is day three and day four and day five and he would always bring it up to me a really good kid and i think i impressed him so much that he was like he was he was like he was motivated by the things that i was doing to um to give it a try you know and uh and that's all you can do you know you can just show by example um my kids are definitely on it um i i you know when they're here during the summer especially i want them to eat like i eat and see how they feel and get rid of everything else it just doesn't make any sense you know and um just there's so much best stuff that people eat throughout the day it's just it's it's amazing to me it's scary too because of just heart problems diabetes and so many other things that are happening that are constant happening to people you know like just recently just people just you know like they go to sleep and they don't wake up the next day you know they die in their sleep you know we had you know phenomenal actor ray leota just passed away i don't know what the reasons were but it's just happening too often you know where people are now waking up and i never seen so much in the news where actors celebrities or people that are in the limelight don't wake up in the next day and i know it's got something to do with your heart heart attacks and things like that and i i know it has to do with the food that we put in our body or definitely something that goes in our body that's making our heart stop and um i certainly don't want that to happen to me i want my heart to keep going yeah well you know i i've actually noticed that as well and you know i i when people sort of hit hit a certain age especially men that that big push of like you know you really got to take care of yourself you got to worry about your cholesterol and and we're about heart disease and people get worried about that they have kids they want to be able to to be there for their kids and not have a heart attack early and so they end up they end up dropping neat they dropping stakes um i remember um i was at um luke perry you know he was saying the same thing he unfortunately passed away early and i think he was like 52 and he and he was saying that he used to be a big steak and potato guy but then when he sort of hit 40 he sort of went you know dropped the steaks and just went more vegetables and and it appears that that's when his his health sort of took a dive carnello carnello anthony was uh the boxer who just lost the fight he was heavy uh he was eating like horse meat i mean he was really heavy on the meat and he was unbeatable the moment he went vegan he's like full vegan he just lost his fight and i think he's gonna keep losing and uh yeah you just see a difference in their body they become like they become sad like saggy they become they're not as solid and strong it's kind of like the body wants it and you're depleting it with giving it all these vegetables and all the stuff that it just doesn't uh like i said i tried it and i was really without any energy i mean i i could not have a good day on on full vegan and those those disgusting burgers man oh my god man with the beans and everything like um and i don't miss beans by the way yeah i don't miss beans and i you know my girl is cuban so beans and rice is a big thing but i don't miss it i i don't miss it i don't miss the beans i don't miss i don't miss the the spinach i don't miss the broccoli um i go to the supermarket and i i know exactly what i want and it's really easy actually because it says it's fish beef and and and less chicken but mostly beef and and fish macro i love to eat macro and tuna and all that but but the beef is great and sirloin is great and all kinds of beef and you can make beef in all kinds of ways stews whatever you name it it's it's endless and uh and beef uh broth uh and and bone marrow i mean there's just endless stuff i haven't started with with the with the heavier you know with the heart or the tongue or any of that sort of stuff but but i'm not saying no to it um but definitely i don't know about the raw stuff i'm not into the raw stuff i definitely want to i want to cook the stuff uh but you know unless i had somebody with me who kind of could show me with me and see but i still want to cook the stuff yeah no yeah i don't think i certainly know people that that like eating things raw but i don't i don't think it confers any specific benefit that i've seen anyway you know maybe you get some things a bit more uh accessible uh and easier to deliver do you eat liver very rarely almost never yeah you don't need to eat eat the organs um you know if you're if you're coming from a vegan diet or even just a standard diet liver is probably your best friend because you're so nutrient deplete that it you know it has an abundance of nutrients but it can that can be a problem as well because uh vitamin toxicity is just as dangerous as vitamin deficiencies and so if you're if you're eating organs too often you can you can build these things up and especially the fat soluble vitamins like vitamin a that that takes a long time to clear out out of your body and it can just build up and build up and so you know like the the you know the inuit and people living in the north they really don't eat organs at all they give those to their to their dogs and you know if you eat even a moderate amount of of seal liver you'll die from from uh vitamin a toxicity and polar bear liver was just like any amount of that will kill you from the amount of vitamin a that's in there so what about supplement liver supplement spills that some people are talking about how do you are those something that you would add to your diet or or yeah was there some companies better than others how much should you take if you do yes i i wouldn't yeah i don't i don't think you need it like if you're if you're just eating a standard diet you know that's that's nutrient deficient then sure you know take take some some liver or liver supplements but if you're on a carnivore diet then no you don't need it i haven't i've taken any of those supplements i don't take you know every now and then if i if i'm not getting enough sun or it's like winter months and like i'm in the northwest or something like that and you're just not going to get exposure to the to the light as much you'll still get vitamin d from you know butter and animal fat but you know maybe if i don't feel like i'm getting enough i might supplement with vitamin d3 that's it i don't take anything else what about yogurt and milk would you suggest yogurt and milk to be something that you would add to your diet only if you want it um i i avoid milk just because it has has carbs in it and has enough lactose in it that that'll spike your insulin and so it's um and i also find that uh you know sort of that gets into that carb addiction as well i ended up really craving milk i'll have some of it i'm like oh my god i want more of that and yeah and it just tastes amazing and you know my sense of sweetness uh my my you know sort of experience of a sweet taste is much more uh refined now so if just drinking a glass of milk it tastes like i'm drinking ice cream and like that's that's like dangerous for me so i'm drinking that i'm like oh my gosh yeah and so yeah so i avoid that but um things like yogurt if it's just yeah raw plain full fat yogurt every now and then like if i were to need to take antibiotics say then i would maybe have have a bit of yogurt with that but or with like ground beef and just having some yogurt put on put on top of that you know sort of a mediterranean style sort of condiment or cheese but i really just use it as a condiment you know it's not that there's necessarily anything bad in the in the like fermented milk products or cheese but they don't necessarily have cheese right you have cheese as a condiment yeah yeah yeah so i'll like melt it onto like beef patties or something like that but i wouldn't have i certainly wouldn't have it even every week you know it's um it's it's a rarity that i have that just but i i just like the meat on its own and you know so i just i just prefer that flavor and that taste and and it has everything that you need anyway some people have a problem with dairy some people do need to avoid it especially with autoimmune issues they seem to be more sensitive to the milk proteins which can be slightly uh pro-inflammatory but but a lot of people don't have a problem with it i don't really have a problem with it but i do feel the best just eating straight beef and so even even if i'm uh having some dairy you know i just i just won't feel this just you know just as tight and hard uh on the on it as i normally do and so yeah i do too and one of the things too that i do now that i didn't do before i mean i've always eaten beef but when i used to eat a steak i never really finished it or i never really ate the fat of it or something like that i was kind of you know i i would eat it but not but now i devoured it yeah yeah it's gone to the bone you know and and then it just it really is it fills me up um my body's feels really full and and my brain because it's all like the addiction of because now that i got rid of the sugar it's like it's like a past thing in the in the past the sugars in the past it's like something in the back of my head that i i don't need it's there uh it's kind of like an addiction too like you know if you get rid of an addiction and you don't want to go back to it because you know how bad it was yeah and but it's still there you want to be aware because you're you're a recovering addict so that's what we are we're recovering addicts and uh and you know how it makes you feel um and um and i'm sure that if i fell through the cracks and i had like i don't know if i had some sugar in between i would i would really feel it right away it would be so right it's it's that addiction coming back i don't want this anymore you know so yeah that's good yeah well that's the thing like fructose actually is a drug and that's and that's something that i i think really needs to be you know if not age restricted at least you know generally put out there that that fructose actually fructose specifically gives a dopamine response to the addiction centers of your brain you know just like the hard drugs like cocaine and heroin and they've been mri studies that dr lustig from ucsf talks about showing that when when people are given like a dose of amphetamines who haven't you know been addicted to any substances you know certain areas of the brain will obviously you know light up if you give that someone to you know a a drug addict who's been addicted to drugs for a long time those areas won't light up as much they'll be sort of a softer twinkle but if you give that same dose of amphetamines to someone who's metabolically sick and is sugar addicted it's the same response as the drug addict and that's quite scary so this means that this is this is a it's addictive as these hard drugs and it's actually killing the same areas of your brain as these hard drugs um just because that dopamine turns on it's an excitatory model molecule so it turns on your brain cells when your brain cells are firing they get damaged and this is why we need to sleep this is why we need to sort of turn off parts of our brain to heal itself and if you're just constantly hitting it with with dopamine it just won't let it you know go to sleep and it eventually dies and so you can do that with sugar just as you can do that with with uh other drugs and so yeah it's absolutely horrible especially because we don't even realize how horrible it is and we put it in everything and we're giving this stuff to kids and you know think about you know we talk about a sugar high and you give some kid sugar and they're bouncing off they turn into little you know maniacs and and then you know you hear people the justification for it is like why are you giving them sugar assistant well they just really like it they really like it it's like would you say the same thing about cocaine yeah i'm sure they'd like that you know i'm sure they'd you know be all for that if you slip that in somewhere but you know obviously oh gosh i would never do that but because we don't recognize this actually as a drug then then we actually are giving this stuff to kids which i think is a bit uh is a bit unfortunate because i think it causes a lot of damage to them and let's talk also i want to hear your opinion on this which is comes up as you know cholesterol right the cholesterol situation right because as soon as you start talking beef you start talking about eggs the cholesterol level if your cholesterol level is high and then you know now i'm going to be doing my blood work i'm excited to see what's what what that's going to look like but i know it's going to come up and how do you how do you respond about this cholesterol level situation and kind of put people at ease because they're all so scared of this word you know yeah absolutely yeah the so the thing that people need to to realize first and foremost is that cholesterol was never the problem cholesterol was never a marker or indicator for disease and particularly heart disease that that was a fraud played against the the people of the world we have hard evidence of that ansel keys uh was a was a paid shill you know we have documents showing that he was paid off by the sugar companies to put forward you know false uh studies and data and to doctor his own studies in research to make it look like cholesterol was a problem when it really wasn't uh he did something called the seven nations study which he found these seven countries that sort of fit this parabolic curve and it just showed the the more uh cholesterol that they had the higher rates of uh heart disease that they had and it sort of it showed like its exponential growth he said wow look at this i looked at seven seven countries and they just they just fit this this graph perfectly the problem is that that they don't tell you is that he had full data for 23 countries and those were completely scattered they were all over the map so there wasn't even a correlation you know there wasn't there was no association between more cholesterol and higher rates of heart disease it was completely unrelated and while you can never sh you know prove causation from from a correlation you know you at least have to have correlation to have causation so if you prove that there's no correlation which he actually showed his own studies showed there's no correlation between higher cholesterol and heart disease that proves there's no causation because you cannot have causation without first having correlation and and there's more of this there was the journal of the american medical association jama they published in 2015 a study from university of california san francisco medical school uh it was a top six research institution in america for medical research they published this study in jama showing actual internal memos from the sugar companies back in i think the 60s talking about how they paid off three harvard professors to falsify data and publish fraudulent studies again to make it look as if cholesterol caused heart disease when it was really sugar and one of those professors was named head of the usda and he was the one who authored and published the 1977 declaration from the usda that cholesterol caused heart disease and that and that's what completely upended the scientific discussion this was hotly debated since the 1950s i remember seeing uh you know papers back in 1956 in jama talking about how you know they say well you know it's it's basically accepted that you know cholesterol is is uh you know indicated in in heart disease but this is based on really bad data really bad evidence and these studies are crap and it just went through excoriating the the the idea that cholesterol caused heart disease they just showed that these are really bad studies this is really bad data this is this is low level evidence we shouldn't be changing our entire practice based on these things so this is a hotly debated subject for decades and then all of a sudden the usda said no no that's it and and everyone you know appealing to authority just said oh well teacher weighed in you know you were wrong and it just completely just just shut down the conversation and destroyed these guys careers um we have hard evidence that that was never the case and all the big studies after 2015 these large meta-analyses going through literature reviews and and really looking through hundreds and hundreds of thousands of patients and actually found that there is no association no correlation between higher ldl cholesterol or even higher saturated fat and cholesterol or stroke in fact they found inverse relationships so you know you you improved your cardiovascular health you you improved uh your stroke rates if you had higher cholesterol higher ldl cholesterol they're finding this to be implicated in depression as well they're finding in psychiatric journals that if you have higher ldl cholesterol you're you're protected against depression and suicide people that had lower levels of ldl cholesterol had higher rates of depression and more importantly higher rates of suicide and so yeah and so now psychiatrists this is this is strong enough evidence in their field that now there are a lot of uh psychiatrists that are putting their their depressed patients on um or just telling them to get their cholesterol up say look you need you need to get your cholesterol up don't worry about your heart like you're you know this is this is a bigger deal and there's a lot when you go to see a doctor the first thing that when especially you do your blood work they check your cholesterol level and they tell you the usual stuff your cholesterol level is too high you got to change your diet yeah what happens then you start eating more vegetables right that's what they tell you to do so and i'm sure it's going to happen so how is how is your because i haven't done my blood work yet so i'm going to do it next month and i want to have at least two months of carnivore really full on and have my blood work and i'm really excited to find out what that is but how is your cholesterol level and how would you describe it to be the right level or it could be too high or whatever you know because i think that's what people really hear the most when they go see a doctor is like cholesterol is too high change your diet go home and eat your vegetables right yeah i think they just want to feel useful you know they want to give you money worth you know just and then just and just contribute to the conversation somehow so that oh cholesterol got it you know got to do something about that um no it um you know so when i checked my cholesterol my hdl was high which is great my triglycerides were low which is also great and my ldl cholesterol for you know what is traditionally thought to be the normal range was slightly high but again that was never a marker of disease you know ldl cholesterol is actually really good for you it's it's an important molecule in your life and so i'm actually happy that it's there because there are a lot of studies as well looking at elderly populations people over the age of 60 uh which is the cohort that we're talking about here anyway that that suffers from cardiovascular illnesses and and stroke they actually find that that with higher ldl cholesterol they have longer lifespan they have less heart attacks less strokes you know they live independently out of a nursing home longer so it's actually it's actually a marker of health having higher ldl cholesterol so i'm happy with that you know and whatever my cholesterol is because i know that you know because i go back to first principles you know i i all the best evidence shows that humans actually are carnivores and this is actually the way we're supposed to be eating the way we're designed to eat and so whatever my cholesterol is it's physiological my body wants it to be there and so i don't i don't worry about that um it is technically high but it's high in the context of us thinking that cholesterol was bad in the first place which it never was so you know i think we really need to reimagine what the hell these uh these reference ranges really are because um you know it's just not the same thing and there are a lot of different kinds of ldl cholesterol and and they're not they're not all made the same and they can be damaged and that's the thing you know it sort of appears as if there might be an issue there but that's because their your cholesterol damaged ldl cholesterol is actually used in atherosclerotic plaques so when you're eating carbohydrates you're eating sugar you're drinking alcohol you're going to be damaging this ldl cholesterol and there's there's a molecule called apple b100 which is a signaling molecule that allows your liver to to suck this stuff up out of your bloodstream and when that gets damaged your liver can't recognize it anymore so it can't pick it up and now the only molecule the only things in your body that can recognize it are your your macrophages and so that they just start picking these things up and picking these things up and because there's an abundance of them and they have basically an unlimited capacity for picking these things up they just keep doing that and they grow up into these massive foam cells which is what we see in stuck in the walls of the arteries and so now you have damaged the artery wall and you have these macrophages doing their job which is going to heal damage and they go into the into the tissue of this damaged uh wall and they're just stuck and there's this big fat foam cell and they get stuck and they can't get out of there again and you get and you start building these things up so you know if you're not eating carbohydrates you're not eating sugar or alcohol you're not going to be damaging those cholesterol in the first place so you know it doesn't matter what they are because they're good for you and obviously there are things that you have to do to damage the lining of your of your artery walls as well smoking is a bad thing you know different chemicals that we put in our body as well and so you know if you're if you're not going down that track in the first place it really doesn't matter what what's going on because you're not going to be involved in that disease process but you can look at particulate sizes you can actually do studies that just look specifically at your ldl cholesterol and you can tell if you have like the damaged kind of ldl and and you know and you know maybe maybe you might still have some of that left over but after a few months it's going to be gone you know yeah it's going to be that's going to be that's going to sort itself out and a good way of sort of getting an idea of whether you have the healthy kind or not is just looking at your ldl to triglyceride ratio and not worrying about your ldl because your ldl is only a problem if it's damaged and involved in a larger inflammatory disease process but the ldl itself is not a problem so if you're if your hdl is high and your triglycerides are low this indicates that your your [Music] your ldl cholesterol is is unlikely to be damaged and it's just working normally and so yeah and so you just just don't worry about it but even if your triglycerides are like a little high so what you know if you're not eating carbs if you're not eating sugar if you're not smoking if you're not drinking your ldl your ldl is going to be undamaged it's going to be fine but yeah and ultimately it's just how you feel too if you get to know your body so well you just know the difference about how everything is working and uh it's incredible i i i hope a lot of people watch this because this is so educational to me but also to to people that don't know because uh you know telling a stranger about this they they're so skeptical about because they've been so mis informed for so many years pretty much since birth yeah you know and uh and then you just stuck to this way of living um that it's that it's just not true and uh we need to educate more people um but i'm excited i'm excited about the future i'm excited about what i'm doing and thanks to the guys like yourself that uh i'm able to find out all this information and actually put it into practice yeah well i'm glad man and um yeah it's cool it's cool what's that sorry it's it's our bodies and it's our life you know and it's yeah and i keep telling people that it's never it's never too late to really change your life uh because that's the only body you have you can't you can't get somebody else's one you know you just that's that's the one you have and yeah that's the life you have and it's it's it's it's incredible how i think it's really incredible how our bodies really function when you feed them right and how fast they adjust i and i can you know i can prove it in the last month like i was talking earlier that it's just so active and so fast at the moment and i was just blown away i was really blown away about the timing and stuff it wasn't even like i mean really as it's been like a month no not even it's incredible yeah that's the thing you know i say i say as well like it's never it's never a bad time to stop eating poison you know people say like you know i was like well is it too late for me i've just been doing this my whole life i'm like no it's not it's not bad just yeah just get it get it out of your system you know and and you'll always feel better and you know i know people you know my parents are are 80 now and they started this in their late 70s and they and they just looked like they just were aging backwards you know and their their their brains and their bodies just woke up and like my skin like um i don't use any products you know people are always surprised to see you know what kind of products you use i don't i just i don't i don't you know i mean you know we live in florida so i'm in the sun i get you know but it's it's uh it's just really it's it's just fluent it's really that's what that's that's how i i relate to it it's just fluent it just you put the good stuff in and and just everything just uh flows away really well and uh and it's it's just comfortable um and i'm just blown away by the fact that i'm not i don't need it i don't need it in my body that that other stuff anymore you know i just don't crave it which was something i was really scared of you know like i said cough is like that or pasta i mean come on i'm italian i love pasta right but i don't i don't crave it because i i guess my body's finding out that what i'm doing is so good for it then why would i put something bad in it you know what i mean so i guess i'm just defining like that mentally that i don't you know when people put stuff in front of me you know do you want to eat this you want i don't need it i don't eat bread anymore i don't i don't crave it at all at all you know and there were times that i was i felt weak or i felt like you know you have some carbs to give you energy it was always that thing get carbs to give you energy uh and now i don't have carbs at all and i have lots of energy yeah what's the thing too yeah you know and you were talking about your pre-workout and coffee as well you know but i i've absolutely found the same thing that i have so much more energy when i don't take caffeine and you know i mean coffee aside you know i mean sometimes like if i if i drink coffee like i'll just get sore after working out which is you know what so i know something's going on there i know that there's you know this is causing some inflammation in my body that i that wasn't there before because i normally don't get sore and so you know if i would you know so so you know to get rid of that i just would take like a caffeine pill every now and then i wasn't ever big on caffeine anyway but just just to have it like if i was you know working a long shift or working overnight yeah and so maybe i would take that every time i did i regretted it like for the first few hours i felt great i was just bouncing off the walls and and then and then after that i had this this come down i just felt so gross i was just i just felt really junky and gross almost like i was you know fluish or something like that and uh you know and you're just withdrawing from from this caffeine and it and it just it really messed with my whole health i remember the last time i had a red bull it was a long time ago but i remember it was yesterday because it was one that you know i was working and it was long hours like you said and i said okay no problem i have i have a little red bull and man i had like the next 24 hours or the worst 24 hours of my life it was horrible and i used to drink that all the time and i just can't imagine drinking it ever again but that 24 hours was just horrible i couldn't sleep it was up and down my head was all over the place i i felt like you know somebody hit me with a bat uh and it was like why did i do that and uh every time i look at the red bull every i guess it's everywhere i go i'll never drink that stuff yeah like um yeah the pre-workout stuff too like i i used to take pre-workout or like you know branched-chain amino acids and then you know when i was eating just a normal diet like they were a game changer like branched-chain amino acids those were those those are probably one of the best things that i ever added to my workout when on a standard diet but then when i went carnivore i tried it it just took it just detracted from it you know it took away from that i think a lot of that's to do with the the artificial sweeteners as well uh it was something that it was like man that stuff really for some reason when i took uh and i haven't taken it probably years now but i remember i gained like 20 pounds yeah like i remember taking a couple scoops of that and you know and people said take creta and give you energy and all that stuff and i would gain weight and then it was really hard to lose it it was like all this water gain yeah really uncomfortable just just all this stuff right now that i don't ever have to take again uh i ever have to buy i never have to put anything like that in my body it's really it's a good thing doc it's you know i'm really happy yeah yeah well and that's the thing too you know people don't realize there's a ton of creatine in meat especially beef and you're also getting carnitine yes i mean that's that's not the same stuff that they give you in the powder right well it's it's it is similar but you're also getting it in in with all the other molecules and and things that you're supposed to be getting it with so yeah you don't you don't need to supplement with with creatine if you're just eating enough meat you know like it i i don't i don't um you know all this all the different studies that look at creatine i think that they're um you know they're a bit not suspect but i i don't think they really prove what they're trying to prove and you know a lot of these things they they'll you put on weight but you know is that actual lean muscle mass or is that your water weight you know a lot of it yeah no i look i you know for me i always want to look lean and fast you know bruce lee you know six foot bruce lee you know just like a lean a dancer you know what i mean like those that's what i want because i don't want to carry a lot of weight as i get older i don't want to be you know 200 and some pounds in my in my 60s and my 70s and or and that turns into fat anyway so you want to be lean and and flexible and i want to be fast you know i my body's i always loved like sugar ray leonard or haggler you know those bodies were like tight and just a boxer you know like just ripped um and if i could do that in my 50s and my 60s and keep going like that then i'm happy man that's what i look forward to yeah nice yeah definitely and um that's i mean that's the that's the ideal is is just aging gracefully and uh and just being healthy the whole time you know people talk about how they're like well you know i don't want to i don't want to live you know 20 years longer 30 years longer because they look at people it makes no sense to me i was just like okay well then just you you just it sounds like you've just given up on life you know and you're just you know you need to really sort some things out and i want to be there i remember talking in the past and some people that were taking steroids and i go is it is it worth it it's like yeah i'm like what about your life is it worth it to look this good right now by taking these drugs but your life might be cut by who knows how many years and some people don't care you know the vanity it's just the bane part of them i guess human beings but i look at that as health you know i never i never was the one to train so i could go to the beach and for me it was always about how healthy and how strong and how you know how far can i take my body to you know and and and see you know how i can just uh you know get everything going and working really well and that was really the goal for me you know because ultimately that's that's that's the body you got yeah yeah and that's the thing i think that some people just aren't really thinking about it because you know we talk about how you know genetically humans are actually designed to live like 120 years and yet we're dying in our 60s and 70s which is literally middle-aged and you know i tell that to people and say oh my i don't want to live 120 years anyways it's like have you thought this through i'm not talking about like you know because people look at someone in their 70s they look at how much their bodies have to have decayed and they just think oh add another 50 years of you know of linear destruction to that body and uh you know and they they're imagining that they've just been they'll be you know wheelchair bound or bed bound for most of them there's so much stuff that people are taking you know and i know people in their 70s are just taking so many antidepressants and they go to sleep things to wake up on and they're addicted to these things i just see all these people just deteriorating i mean they're just they don't have any they don't have any stamina they have a hard time getting up they have a hard time moving um they're they're they're i'm like i just it's really they become like zombies you know and uh i think if we promote this and keep promoting this as you get older because i know other people who are on this diet who uh live in their 60s and 70s who are phenomenal you know and it's got to do with what they eat and i i wish i could just you know these these are close friends of mine some family members you know you try to be there for them and like get rid of that medication you know because it's just not helping you in the long run you know but yeah it's tough you know you can only be there and so hopefully by example you can be there and you know yeah well i think that's um the best way to do it you know i mean i i didn't try to you know you know push my family into doing it but they saw the results i was getting and they just heard me you know excitedly talking about all the different things that i was i was looking up and researching and finding because i just you know i was really just digging into the literature and trying to see exactly what we knew exactly what we could prove and and going from there and i was just getting really excited talking about these things and eventually my parents were like started asking me questions and then asking me for a bit of help with it and you know they just said okay we'll try it for a month and then after a month they're like well i can't can't stop doing this you know their their health was improved so much my mom's diabetes and her blood sugar control was so much better and my father's memory and parkinson's was was improved so much just from just from one month that they're like yeah well we just we really can't justify not doing this and and that's what people don't get is that you know if being on all these drugs and living very very debilitated limited lives sure i wouldn't want to tack on another 50 years to that on my side either but you know i'm talking about health i'm talking about another 50 years in better health than you have now and and and living independently the entire time and it's when you don't do that that not only will your life be shorter but the reason will be shorter is because you've been sick for decades longer and you're going your body's going to break down faster and you're not going to be independent and you're going to be in in a nursing home so it's paradoxical you'll live a shorter life but you'll also have less uh healthy years as well and you'll you know you'll be in the nursing home longer even though you've lived a shorter life and so that's just yeah that's something that i don't want for myself and i certainly don't want it for my family either i think we sort of lost a generation of elderly because you know we've been telling them for 50 years cholesterol is going to kill you it's going to give you a heart attack and so everyone's been eating a low-fat heart-healthy diet and they've all been developing alzheimer's and and dementia because our brains are made out of fat and they're made out of cholesterol and if you're not eating fat and cholesterol from animal sources we're not going to build and maintain our brains and they're going to decay and you know eating a ton of carbohydrates our brains are running on glucose uh primarily but not exclusively actually our primary our brain's primary energy sources are ketones there's a big push now talking about how it's actually glucose that's false that's completely that's completely wrong completely wrong you know i mean that was that's something we teach in in college level biochemistry the brain runs on ketones your brain always runs on ketones and then when you're in a fasting state which i think is our primary metabolic state it almost exclusively runs on ketones and even when you're your blood sugar sort of dropping down a bit and your ketones are starting to rise but still like a quarter of what your blood sugar is your brain just switches over and just goes nope we're only running on ketones we only want ketones that's its primary source and so we get peripheral insulin resistance that's what type 2 diabetes is and you know we're not getting sugar and glucose into the cells properly that includes our brain and so our brains are are getting as much energy as they need either and they're not getting enough fat to rebuild themselves and so they just start shutting down and and you know if you don't have energy for your brain your brain is not going to work that well and when you switch over to a carnivore diet or even a ketogenic diet and all of a sudden your brain starts running uh predominantly on ketones again these people just light up you know it's like it's like flipping on a switch and so even if someone has has you know uh you know manifestations of dementia or alzheimer's you know in the day they can they can all of a sudden make an improvement by by just dropping carbohydrates and sugar and and switching their their brain's energy source to ketones makes a huge difference and unfortunately we've we've lost an entire generation of people that weren't made aware of that and in fact we're told the opposite and they were in nursing homes when they probably shouldn't have been and they you know they they lost decades of their life uh unnecessarily plus all these elderly folks for most part they're eating a lot of sugar doughnuts and cookies and cakes and they're doing all that i see it with with my family as well it's just it's just sugar on top of sugar and chocolate and you know it's yeah that's the diet right there and then carbs from bread and pastas and you name it right so that definitely just injures your body as you get older so much more so yeah i'm going to i'm going to show this video to my family and i'm going to i'm going to i'm going to beg them to see all the way through and just kind of just listen and open up your mind to it because yeah you really got nothing to lose you know just just try it like i did and you'll see it in a really a matter of a short amount of time you'll see a big change and if you know your body really well you see that chain why would you want to not you know keep it going like that you know it's just it's obvious yeah no i totally agree and and uh you know just like you were saying with with the cholesterol like i think that's something that's that's so important as a nutrient that that we're just not getting enough of and uh and just depriving ourselves of that has really hurt people as well you know cholesterol is is a is the precursor for all of our body's main hormones it's a precursor for testosterone estrogen progestogens or glucocorticoids mineralocorticoids you know things like cortisol all these things they all come from cholesterol and you know our all every cell membrane in your body is cholesterol our bile uh that are that our liver makes in order to absorb fat that is is uh you know one of the building blocks is cholesterol so cholesterol is is ubiquitous it's one of the most important molecules in our bodies and i remember when i was a kid you know obviously we were told since birth that cholesterol is bad for us and i remember learning in like eighth grade biology that the cell membrane structure was cholesterol and i remember thinking like but isn't that what's this was bad for us isn't that what kills us but we're literally made out of it and i was like oh that doesn't that doesn't really uh that doesn't really square out and i was like all right well i'm you know i'm just a kid i don't know everything yet i'm sure i'll learn uh you know how this makes sense later but i filed it away as a curiosity and obviously looking back now it's just like well that's that's why it's not bad for us it's a really important molecule and so you know and just getting enough fat as well if that's so important and you know even when people go carnival sometimes they don't eat enough fat and that's often why they get constipation because they're just eating fat but they're not eating as much fat as they may actually need to and the way i try to explain this to people is if fat were bad for us why would we have four different organs all working together just to absorb it you know the liver makes bile the gallbladder stores bile um that's secreted into your uh small intestine which then emulsifies the fat so you can absorb it and the pancreas makes lipase and and other enzymes to help break it down and then the small intestine absorbs it so you have you have four organs all working together just to absorb fat so that is a very very important nutrient and if it were just bad for us if we were only causing harm we wouldn't even have a mechanism to absorb it we would just be like nope we don't want that but you know our body expends a lot of energy just to get fat because that's very very important and you know we we limit that at our at our own peril because it's absolutely vital i can't wait for my friends and my family to see this video yeah i am looking forward to that because these are facts and they don't have to hear from me they can hear from the doc themselves good um so i was going to say um you just you just finished up a new movie you were telling me uh he said it was it was called grace by night is that right yeah you too yeah you tell us a bit about that that was that was really interesting yeah i this is probably one of the best roles i ever played the most challenging role i ever played he's a father who lost a son to suicide who has to rebuild his life or trying to keep his life going and through this process he meets a young man in high school who's dealing with a lot of family issues a broken family and gangs and just going to the wrong side of the track and uh he puts him under his wing and and they they find themselves getting back to love and family and uh and there's wrestling involved which is incredible wrestling is one of those sports it's just a sports that needs to be brought back into into the it's just part of the american culture and uh it's one of those sports it's just one man against another man um and it's the rocky story you know it's what we need now it's it's it's it's a story that deals with things that we're dealing we see on the news every single day but people don't have any anything to really talk about afterwards it happens all the time suicides are happening people are taking their lives you know people are depressed uh people are addicted uh to drugs or alcohol but and kids and kids are left without a father you know and and um and so what do you go from there where's the family value where is where's god where's the higher power so all that is in this film and so much more great actors and um uh william oliver is a young kid who played next to me he's amazing he's gonna have an amazing career and um yeah it was one of those films that i'm really proud of and uh you know i produced this film uh and um as well and and it's just uh it's what people need to see you know it's one of those films that you want to see over and over again that makes you feel great it makes you think about stuff and it's just motivational it's just it motivates you it makes it makes you think about life and life is important that you can there's certain things worth fighting for and um yeah it's just one of those films that gives you the goosebumps you know and uh we're going to release it this this december uh nationwide all over the world and i hope you get to see it and everyone this is because it's it's a good film for the whole family to see that that talks about all those things that people don't want to talk about but with a with a great ending with a great storyline and arc um and uh like i said it's just the best performance for me i really dedicated myself to another level um and thanks to this diet i was able to do it uh with energy uh but uh i'm really proud of this one i really am we're good man yeah what sounds good and i'll definitely look out for it i'm trying to commit myself to to work with people that uh have the same goal you know that we have we want to make good pictures good movies motivational films good american pictures that could motivate people around the world with good stories you know action stories dramas comedies um but entertainment is one of those places where you know and i sometimes in in the recent years all about politics is about changing people's minds about political views for me it's more about entertainment and it's just moving people you know what do you get out of it um what what's the big picture here you know and when you finish watching the movie what's the lesson to be learned in the sense that is this movie making you a better person it makes you think a little bit more about life um and also i want to do films that showcase what what america really is all about the core of this country how and what is done to a lot of people all over the world um and certainly what it's done for me and my family coming from italy to america and how much i love this country what that what the flag means to me um freedom and and integrity and and honor for something you know and to fight for your land you know australians have that you know i i go to australia a lot and they're very you know they're proud of their country and and you know australians have been through so much you know with from the beginning of of of history in that country and and i've been going there for many years and i i respect this so much because we have that in common about that we we love our land and um and and it's just given so much opportunities america has done so i want to promote that and i want to promote good films with good heart you know awesome yeah well that's awesome man and it's good to see out there doing that it's um obviously you know like you say there's been a lot of political events in hollywood and and um it looks like you're you're fighting against the tie and that's something that's uh hard to do you know and it's a very brave thing to do so it's good to see you standing up and and doing something you believe in man so uh congratulations on on that i
