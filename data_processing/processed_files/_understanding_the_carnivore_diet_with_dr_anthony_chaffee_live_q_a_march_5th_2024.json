        "body": "everything's all yeah okay um from hexen thank you for everything's all yeah okay um from hexen thank you for Super Chat it says what is the best way to start a baby at six to seven months uh that is ready to start eating solid food on a carnivore diet so I mean there's a lot of different techniques on on on weaning babies onto food that you can look up I'm not an expert in that but I do know that traditionally certainly what was done in my family um my great-grandfather who was a who was a a doctor graduated from Columbia University in in the early 1890s and um you know lived for hundred years and at home didn't have any any um cognition issues um what he did and what he recommended to my grandmother and my mother was uh you start babies on the drippings from a roast so you have a b roast beef or whatever and you have the the meat juices that come on The Cutting Board and sort of pull up there and you just spoon feed them that and you get you know there's a lot of iron there's a lot of you know U good vitamins and minerals and nutrients there and sort of just starts making them taste this new thing um and get used to that oh that's good that tastes good um then after that you know so a lot of people will cut things up into very small pieces now this is again I'm not an expert in this but from my understanding that can be a bit more of a problem because if you have these small things of small things are the ones that get caught in their throat they can't really tune properly and they they sort of have problems swallowing them um what a lot of people do and certainly what you know is done in the wild with you know animals and humans is that you give them a bigger piece and then they're able to bite and tear off the the pieces that are appropriate for them to chew they're not going to take in a whole turkey Lake right they're going to they're going to be able to to gnaw off and gum off you know with one tooth just a little bit of bit of that and so that seems to be what um I've heard recommended from people who are experts in it I am not an expert in that but that is what I've I've heard from other people and seems to work for them with their their carnivore kids and from other people that are that are more more well-versed in in uh gett ing kids started on eating uh JP thank you for for the"

        "body": "ing kids started on eating uh JP thank you for for the ing kids started on eating uh JP thank you for for the super chat [Music] um he says I'm a 16-year-old Man 6 foot tall I want to grow taller but you say milk isn't optimal and that I should stick with meat how can I use this diet to grow taller how would you do it I'd love a video on this uh look that's a good question there's two ways to think about it one um if you're eating what you're designed to eat you're going to grow as tall as you're designed to grow you you're not going to you know there are growth factors in milk you know so like raw milk you know if you get raw whole milk um maybe I you know Dr cus um you know say thinks that you know like a bit of bit of milk with that just that that bit of a of an insulin bump gets your it doesn't get you crazy high uh you know blood sugars and things like that doesn't get crazy high insulin although the older you get it has more of a response when kids are younger they they they're much easier to stay in get into and stay in ketosis so um you know as you get older I mean you know you look at adolescence of any species right they're not they're not drinking milk right um they're drinking they're they're you know eating what what the adults eat you know once you weaned on you mammals drink their mother's milk then they weaned on to their mother's diet and they eat that for the rest of their life and they wean their children onto that so you know the same would go for us so I think you you'll get very very tall um uh or as tall as you're genetically capable of doing so at this stage if you haven't been carnivore your whole life that um that you'll you'll actually grow quite tall and like at least as tall as you're able to um I think for me the jury's out on you know adding in a bit of whole milk every now and then is that going to is that going to help with these growth factors and things like that maybe um I don't that's certainly not settled in my mind for me I would just do meat um and uh I would just eat just a ton of just fatty red meat I'd eat until it stops tasting good every day you know and i' i' you know not Gorge yourself in the sense that you're going to be uncomfortable and and and all that stuff but I would make sure that you you're eating as much food as your body is telling you to eat if you do that you're going to you're going to grow like a weed you know 16 years old most people won't have closed off their growth plates and so you you still have time to grow um and so I you know I don't know how much you're going to grow but you know there are people that have done this around your age and they you know they've had growth spurts since then there's a there's a guy's a professional soccer player he does carnivore mostly carnivore and he's all into grounding and blue blocking glasses and all that sort of stuff and um you know all the all the sort of things that you you hear about in these sorts of circles and in his early 20s you know he's one of the top Strikers in Europe and he he grew like two inches three inches like in his early 20s switching to to the carnivore or carnivore is diet so I think you've got plenty of time to grow and um and that you just eat meat a lot of fatty meat red meat in particular that's what you want to do and uh make sure you got enough B12 make sure you're getting organs uh because that's it's especially important to have abundant nutrients when you're when you're growing and developing so you know some organs like liver kidney heart just you know throw the stuff in there at least the liver it's harder to get other things well kidneys are usually pretty pretty easy to come by um and just just have those doesn't have to be a main stay of your diet but just at least include them as a little bit you know because they're they're very nutrient dense and you want you want uh you want that nutrient content but you don't want so much that it it builds up U these fat soluble vitamins that are that are too much so that's what I would do anyway Jill Taylor asks carnivore for seven months highest ever A1C at six uh at 3 months and 7 months glucose 92 and 106 insulin 3.9 and 6.3 highest prior was uh 5.7 longtime healthy lifestyle not overweight your thoughts uh two things one there are there is a thought that the healthier you get the healthier red blood cells get the longer they're going to live so hba1c is a marker of your three months average and so um hba1c of six will would actually denote a higher average blood sugar than than what you're getting there um so is that accurate if your red blood cells are living three and a half months four months and you're comparing them to a three-month average obviously it's going to be a bit skewed same thing goes if you a lot of plant oil seed oils um they have plant steril which are which are the plants cholesterol and they they're close enough to our cholesterol that that our body uh thinks we have enough and we don't we don't make anymore sorry oh sorry and we don't we don't make enough and so we don't have enough available to us and those plant sterols get used in the cell Linings in the cell membranes uh which is a lipid bilayer of cholesterol and then there's proteins and different sorts of molecules stuck in there so if you if you're eating plant oils and things like that your plant sterols are going to get into your cell membrane and uh and they're not going to live as long because they're more stiff and rigid and so they die quicker because once they get too stiff your body pulls them out because they're not they can't get around these small capillaries and things like that so your spleen rips them out so if you're eating these plant oils and your your HBO C could be artificially lower because they're only lasting 2 and a half months not 3 months right and then you're eating only animal animal fat and you're not getting any these plant stero and now they're living longer than three months and so you can see a bit of a disparity there and a lot and there are people that I know um that argue for this and some of them are are endocrinologists and diabetes doctors and nurse practitioners that see this they have patients with constant glucose monitors and they spot checking to make sure they're accurate and they do not line up with their A1C and their A1C is markedly higher than than their average glucose so I think you go by your your blood sugar read like your your point test I would take that with more with with more weight than the hb1c the second point is is I was talking to Dr Rob CIS um you know who does a lot of this sort of stuff and uses low carb carnivore diets for his patients and one thing that that he notices that sometimes if people are not eating enough fat um they're they're forced to use their protein as energy and that can get converted into glucose and things like that and if we're if we're having an abundance of of protein we're not getting enough uh fat then that can actually be converted into a bit more glucose and then get subsequently stored into your fat but for a little bit your your blood sugar is just a bit higher than it than it normally would be and that's potentially a problem too so um as b k would say you know um glucan neogenesis is demand driven it's not substrate driven but there could be a you know a bit of wiggle room there you know that sometimes you get a bit more than you want just converting some of this stuff in if you have an abundance of protein you don't have enough fat that's that's a going Theory anyway so those are the two two uh theories that are out there on what's going on so check your blood sugar just make sure that that's normal and if that's just consistently at good levels fasting levels don't worry about it like you're fine um you can also try increasing your your your fat content another way of looking at that is if when you got your blood test done did you get your uh you know your your kidney function is done did you look at your Ura and your bu and creatinine if your Ura is going up or your bu is going up um you know and your creatin is staying normal then your kidneys are fine but that's a sign that you're converting more uh protein into energy because you have to cleave that Amal group um that amino group and that turns into ammonia which then gets turned into Ura which then has its own job in the body and then it gets passed out in the urine so or in the sweat so when that starts creeping up you know that's a sign that you're you're probably not eating enough fat and you're being forced to use more of your protein protein and you're using more protein than fat and you need you need fat so that's a thing too so if your is up eat more fat um check your blood sugar and make sure that uh it's just uh normal normal blood sugar through most of the time and then stress and sleep these are very very important things that people just think that you just you just eat you know a carnivore diet you just eat a proper biologically appropriate diet a proper human diet and uh and that and that's everything but but of course there's more to that that's a major thing that's that's probably the biggest thing that people are doing wrong but sleep and stress are really important your stress goes up your adrenaline goes up your cortisol goes up your blood sugar goes up your A1C goes up if you're not getting proper sleep your adrenaline goes up your cortisol goes up your uh blood sugar goes up your A1C goes up uh Dr Tony Hampton just had a short that I uh that just came out a couple days ago which was very very pertinent to this discussion which said if you get four if you average sort of four or five hours of sleep a night for uh you know seven days straight you will you will become borderline diabetic you become pre-diabetic but then if you sleep for seven to eight hours for a week that will reverse so it makes a big impact on your body and so if you're not sleeping well or you're not getting proper amounts of sleep proper quality of sleep and your stress levels are up that's also going to affect it so just remember that so those are those are the main things that I would keep mind Gordon Smith says what are your thoughts on Carnivore priming saw another Advocate offering a 90-day plan with two weeks of priming eating three meals or more a day for the first two weeks and then backing off the idea there is that it's just showing you how much you actually need to eat which is generally a lot more than people think um but not necessarily so it's very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet because it you feel satiated so much more quickly and so maybe you always feel satiated I haven't you know eaten all that much I haven't had a chance to I was just very busy working very late until last night and I was just like I'm I don't even feel like cooking and so I'm just going to go to bed and so I did and now I'm doing this and I haven't haven't eaten yet and that's fine I feel fine um but in my early 20s I did not eat enough I would go three four days without eating because I didn't feel hungry like I normally did now I know my Hunger signals my body's saying yes you know it'd be good to get some food but I'm not you know voraciously starving you know and um and and we think of that starvation signal of those oh we have to eat that's what we think of as hungry and when that calms down a bit then we think oh I can stop because you have to stop when you're eating a normal diet because you know or well corn is a normal diet for humans but when you're eating the standard sort of Western you know plant-based processed food garbage diet you have to stop yourself you have to limit yourself you have to have portion control you have to have self-control to say oh I'm just going to stop there because otherwise you you do end up eating too much because your your your hunger signals are just all out of balance so um you'll it's easy to undereat because you say well I've eaten enough I feel like that's enough I I can stop there and that's usually when you would stop maybe even before that if you wanted to if you wanted to say trim and all that sort of stuff so that's that's not the case anymore you eat until it stops tasting good that's what you want to do and so the priming thing if done right I think is you know can be beneficial where you're just you're just eating until it stops tasting good now some of the some of the priming depending on who you hear it from they say you have to just stuff yourself I don't think you have to stuff yourself I think you have to keep eating till it stops tasting good right and so if it tastes good if you finish a steak or you finish some eggs or some meat or whatever and that last bite was like yeah that was that was pretty good you need to eat more you need to make more make another steak make another burger patty make some more eggs you want to try to have leftover so especially in those those first that first 30 days you want to Endeavor to have leftovers you should have leftovers every meal right and you and you try eating twice a day you can do three times a day too I think you get a bit tired and lethargic after you eat a big meal during the day so it's a bit impractical sometimes um you know but see how you go at least try that twice a day if you're if you've got a lot of excess weight you may only need to do that once a day if you're working out a lot expending a lot of energy try it twice a day you probably need more energy than you think and so you just try that and but I think the way you do priming is yeah yeah you can you just say I'm going to eat twice three times a day whatever and I'm going to keep eating until it stops tasting good if it stops tasting good on the first first bite you stop there you don't just stuff yourself it's a m it's it's just telling yourself and training yourself to know what hunger actually feels like what being full actually feels like what your body signals are telling you you have to relearn your hunger signals and so part of that is by retraining this and saying okay how much my body actually want well I could stop what I I could always eat more there a lot of people say it's like oh I could eat more but I felt fine I didn't need to keep eating it's not about that it's about if you felt like you could eat more eat more if you're eating the right thing then your body's giving you a signal to do that and that's what you want to do so in that sense I agree with that you really want to make sure you're eating enough um and some people have a problem with that and some people have a real problem with um you know getting enough in and because they just they just feel fine you know and I've you know I've known people that that do that and they're losing way too much weight and they're not healthy well I mean they're healthy but they it's not they're losing an unhealthy amount of weight and they're you know they're losing more muscle mass than they than they should um and and I press upon them you need to eat more you have to eat until it stops tasting good not just until you think it's fine to stop that's the difference so that's what priming comes into I don't think you need to overdo it I don't think you need to stuff yourself I don't think it's a good idea to eat past the point of enjoyment because now you're you're getting an unhealthy relationship with food food should be enjoyable it should be good should be a a nice experience and then it stops and your body going to tell you when to stop because it's going to stop being enjoyable once you get to that point that's when you stop and so if you're doing that three times a day and you eat the first couple times and you eat a lot on the first time and eat a little bit on the second time and then the third time you just be like this sounds wretched and you take a bite and like I'm not enjoying this don't eat it that was your meal so you you maybe give it a try I think twice a day is more than enough especially for people that aren't underweight you know if if you're coming from you know veganism anorexia those sorts of things where you're undernourished probably give it a try three times a day see how you go if you're overweight and your your body's trying to you know expel and expend excess energy you probably won't need to do it more than twice a day usually only once a day but make sure you keep eating until it stops tasting good high fat very high fat that is very important it's an essential nutrient it is not just a calorie source you know it is um it's essential you have essential fatty acids you have to have or you get sick and you can die and they're essential fat soluble uh vitamins and minerals that you have to have or you get sick and you die right so very important eat a lot of fat eat until it stops tasting good try that twice a day or even three times a day if you want and stop when it stops tasting good and then after that maybe you you know your body says oh I really just can do just once a day and that's good for my body then that's what you do if it's you need to eat twice then you do twice if you need to eat three times you eat three times but you keep eating until it stops tasting good and you try that a couple times a day just to test and see how much your body wants and when if you're losing body fat and you get down to a stable body fat percentage your appetite will increase dramatically so it's that same principle you have to teach yourself to eat until it stops tasting good not just eat this amount right because it's going to change it's going to change depending on your body composition depending on your um you know U energy level or or your your energy expenditures and working out and all these sorts of things you're not going to figure that out you're not going to calculate that out with any real exactitude so just let your body do it because it's it's uh it's brilliant at it it's designed to do that Sena Nails thank you so much for the super st icker that's very kind of you uh Penelope

and they do keto treats and keto snacks and all this sort of other stuff with artificial ingredients and nonsense that obviously you don't want I'm assuming you're not doing that because you're health conscious you're trying to have a baby um so maybe you're eating whole bunches of vegetables and all these sorts of things that are that are what we told with a ketogenic diet you need because that's where all the nutrients are in fact all the nutrients are in the meat and the anti-nutrients are in the plants there are nutrients in Plants but there's more anti-nutrients and there are more defense chemicals and toxins so you know that's um that's something to think about so there is a difference between doing keto and carnivore depending on the types of of vegetables and things like that that you're eating but if you're eating just really high fat meat and you're really not eating much of the other things you you are less likely to get that stomach upset now heart palpitations are um you know that that needs to be sort of qualified a bit if you mean palpitations as in you're getting irregular beats you're getting extra beats you're getting a fast rate it's just really fast it's going above 100 at rest when you're calm and relaxing you're just sitting there and your heart's just uh you know beating very quickly then that's something you just need to go see your doctor about and see if there's an underlying condition that's that's now manifesting itself when you're when you're changing your diet what's more likely excuse me what's more likely and more common is um is that when you run on ketones you go into ketosis which is you get really get into ketosis around day two and three that's when your Ketone levels are high your brain runs um preferentially on ketones and that's when you have normal blood sugar and you have high ketones your brain only runs on the ketones at least two-thirds of your brain do anyway and so even though you have glucose available it decides to use just the Ketone so that's a preference it's preferring ketones you don't need glucose for this some some cells in your brain still use glucose and that's fine you make glucose but the majority of your brain prefers ketones your heart prefers ketones too so when you are in ketosis and you haven't been in ketosis before all of a sudden your heart's running on Rocket Fuel where before was on like you know crude oil right so it's a much better it's a much better substrate it's a much better um fuel source for your heart and so people notice they have a big strong heartbeats and maybe it's a bit faster but it shouldn't be over a 100 at rest and so that's what that's what I found in myself that's what I see in my patients that's why I you know speak to people in um uh you know online forums and and online uh you know Q&A sessions like this is that that's what they noce is big strong harp they can hear it in their ears but it's a it's a normal rate it's a normal Rhythm so it's a normal pattern it's not too fast and that's okay so that just means your heart's running on Rocket Fuel now and it's a bit weird because what's going on and um that's okay as long as it's a normal rate and a normal Rhythm then that's okay if it is not you need to go get checked out by the doctor you can always get your potassium checked I have yet to see someone actually get you know uh lab confirmed low potassium on a carnivore diet um you you do get you can get some electrolyte spillage and wasting especially in the first few weeks most people just adjust to this and and do fine with it and some people don't um and they they benefit from doing some electrolytes but I've never seen anyone like with clinically low uh potassium or even magnesium or or uh sodium um unless you're drinking like a bunch of coffee and that can strip out magnesium so so that's what I would do you know um low potassium like very low potassium causes uh the arhythmia that causes the heart palpitations it causes our atrial fibrillation first generally and so you get a very fast beat it's a very erratic pattern so just just all over the place right and it's very fast and you get lightheaded you generally get symptomatic and you don't feel well um that's typical you don't always have to feel unwell but that's generally but that's the pattern it's very fast and it's and it's irregular irregularly irregular there's no pattern to it it's just all over the place and so if you're not getting that if you're getting that go to the doctor get a check out if you're not getting that it's just a big strong heartbeats it's the ketones it'll it'll wear out it's not dangerous it's just it's just your body readjusting to a proper uh energy source for your heart obviously if there's any concerns just go see your doctor get an EKG and just make sure everything's okay it generally is uh question from Becky Dr C can I reverse any effects of premature birth with carnivore I was born at 24 weeks almost 40 years ago well it's it's it's going to improve your health as much as you can so you're going to be the healthiest version of yourself that you can be uh genetically and congenitally so I mean there's going to be different issues that people have from being born premature but you there's plenty of of very um successful and high functioning people that uh were born premature there was a girl in my class in medical school that was born at 20 weeks you know so it's um you know it just depends you know if if I mean there can be harm done you know that's very premature you know that's very very early but at the same time you're here and you're you know you're you're um uh you know you're here and an active healthy adult hopefully and a carnivore diet will improve that you know just be as healthy as you can be genetically now if if you're if you were born at 40 weeks instead of 24 you know would that potential be a bit higher possibly but you know we don't know we have no way of knowing that so don't worry about it you know the main thing is is that this will make you as healthy as you possibly can be and so it's uh you know it and it's making a lot of people I mean I wasn't born premature I feel a thousand times better than I did you know you know when I was eating a standard well not even a standard diet because I never ate that crap you know I never really ate processed food I ate Whole Foods I ate mostly meat um but I generally was low fat and I I forced down choked down vegetables and had some bread every now and then you know pretty damn clean from from uh most respects and yet I feel a thousand times better now so you'll feel you'll feel much better as well and it may not be able to undo all the damage that we do to ourselves or we were born with but it will make you as healthy as you can be um for your body and that's you know that's actually really good that's a lot better than people think so good l uck with that Mary Shepard thank you very much for the"

        "body": "uck with that Mary Shepard thank you very much for the uck with that Mary Shepard thank you very much for the super chat um truly several issues biggest one is a weight loss surgery sleeve meats are so hard to get in for me protein shakes an option yes but you know protein shakes are just going to have the protein they're not going to have all the vitamins and minerals and nutrients that you need along with the protein it's not going to have the fat you need fat Fat's an essential nutrient remember so with gastric sleeve what you have to remember obviously you have smaller you know surface or or smaller area inside your stomach so you need to you're probably going to need to eat multiple times a day and you need to eat obviously smaller amounts very high high fat and you need to maximize the the volume the area in your in your stomach just for meat so don't drink water two hours before a meal and don't drink water with your meal maybe some sips to get it down but any water that goes in there that's space that is now not going to be able to fit meat and you'll get full way too quickly so just um you know just just have that in mind don't drink water two hours before you eat a meal or at least an hour before you eat a meal because if you're eating multiple times a day it's going to get a bit difficult to do that two hours but if you start in the morning you just eat as much as you can don't drink any water really unless you you know have to take some pills or whatever you know just do but minimally and um you know and then later in the day have a bit more and have a bit more and have a bit more and you need to work in some water in there too but try to separate it out you know with with a good hour before um you know between uh watering meals it's very important to do that because you need you need all that space for food um and most people do fine with that I I have a number of patients with gastric sleeves that that that's what they're able to do um so hopefully that works as well you could do protein shakes most of them have a whole bunch of garbage in there that you don't want so you want to go find the protein that have um you know no additives right it's just the protein so there's things that only have whey protein or things that only have beef isolate protein um you know equip foods does that um and they have like affiliate code with them if you want to look at that I haven't sort of used them in a while because I don't use protein shakes because you don't need to you just eat meat right um but some people still like to eat protein shakes or maybe you think that you know this might help you it might meat is better meat's a lot better you don't need products um you just need to sort of figure out how you can logistically get enough meat in and that's that's the thing you need to eat multiple times a day you need eat high fat and you need to not drink water within an hour and uh and that that that should be fine and if you're going to do protein shakes only get the ones without any additives flavoring sweeteners anything like that just the protein but again you need all the other things uh as well as the protein okay guys um we have a good turnout we got like 1100 people which is fantastic it's probably one of the higher turnouts that I've had so this seems to be a good time uh to to do these um thanks everyone for joining on if you are a subscriber thank you very much if you're not please do consider uh doing that you know hit the like button you know let me know that you like it uh leave a comment let me know what you think as well if you want more of this sort of content discussions then um you know that that lets me know all right T erry oh thank you very much Terry it's a very generous"

        "body": "erry oh thank you very much Terry it's a very generous erry oh thank you very much Terry it's a very generous Super Chat uh Terry says hi Dr chaffy can you give a synopsis from your interview with Dr cus as it relates to protein do you still recommend eating to um fatty meat stops tasting good yeah I do I think it and and I think that you know speaking with Dr cus you know reinforced that that you really need high fat you know that's something that he's seeing when people are eating more lower fat or they're trying to avoid fat because maybe they have excess fat he said that doesn't work very well that actually be harmful and people get very agitated they get very hungry there's something called protein sickness or or um rabbit starvation where you're just eating really lean meat really lean meat and you need the fat and so you're just eating more and more and more and more and more and you're getting cranky and upset and people have died from this you need the fat thatat is an essential nutrient it's essential for life and they're essential nutrients in in the fat that you need as well so really important to eat enough fat and that just sort of confirmed that that's something that he has seen and he know he you know the guys in uh been in clinical practice were long time he's been in this field for a long time he does you know copious amounts of tests on his patients and he tracks these things you know he's he's a scientist you know by training and by virtue and so he's he's um he he tests these things and as he's been testing these things as he's been looking into them he is seeing that people that don't eat enough fat don't have as good of a time and they they can have other problems they can they can actually start getting um uh get more conversion into to blood sugar because you can't really store protein you have to store it as fat basically and it can get converted into um excess glucose and that can cause a bit of a problem and that gets converted into fat and and so on and so um if you're getting higher Ura in your in your urine tests in your um kidney function test then that can be a sign that you're not eating enough fat and that you're having to convert more protein into glucose because Ura is a byproduct of of protein metabolism and so if that's going up then that that can mean that look you're not eating enough fat your body has to use protein as a as a um energy source and so that's not what you want to do so yeah so I um it's hard to give a synopsis on on a two-hour talk um but but that was it you know it really confirmed a lot of things uh for me that I had sort of seen myself that people eating higher fat do really much better it's really not great to to uh limit the fat even if you have excess fat in fact I Fe I find people that have excess fat when they eat as much fat as your body's asking them to they actually do better they lose more weight and again you can't overeat fat physiologically it's not I don't care what anybody tells you you have bile and bile emulsifies fat that's how you absorb fat it is nearly impossible for your body to absorb fat without bile you can do it but it's it's a very small amount it's mostly medium chain fatty acids the vast majority of fat is cannot be absorbed without bile so when you run out of bile you have this spillover mechanism you just can't absorb it you absorb a bit but the rest of it goes out and if you eat a lot more fat than your body's going to absorb you're going to get diarrhea and you're not going to like that so you're going to want to pull back that fat now could you just eat buckets of lard and that you know four five six 7 10% % of the fat that you're absorbing you know without bile and could that be excess sure you could do that but you'll have torrential diarrhea you probably won't be out of the bathroom long enough to eat all that fat and uh you won't want to continue that so you know it's self-limiting U fat is self-limiting so you eat fat until you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you eat enough fat that you have soft stools and you're not constipated but not so much that you have diarrhea and that's it so that was um yeah so that was uh that was good and we had a lot of really good takes you know he said that um you know there's that that study from uh Harvard I probably have to make this into a into a short or something like that maybe Melissa can can remind me remind uh um Mark about this but where he said that um that that study that uh that he said you know from Harvard that said oh red meats associated with diabetes caus of diabetes and he says like he's like yeah yeah that's true if you look at it from a certain perspective just like I say that water causes you know if you ignore certain things because just like water water will cause um uh you know will cause uh you know liver curosis as long as you ignore the whiskey right because there there is water in whiskey water causes aerosis right so he was saying that that you know yeah meat causes diabetes if you ignore the bun and the sugar and the carbs and the and the the seed oils and the fries and everything like that the meat comes with um that's exactly what Harvard did I mean they they're just um you know they're they're trying to push a narrative they're trying to push an agenda um which sort of made me wonder like I was actually considering doing like an mph like a m Public Health at Harvard um and um obviously that's where you know like you know Dr will it is and and the other very very plant-based people and I just wonder I a I mean I don't know if they'd let let me in the first first place you know if they just look me up and see who I am no not this guy or maybe they want me to come in and see if they could um you know as an interesting sort of addition um because I think very differently than that um you know I'm also a legacy of Harvard my my grandparents um met at Harvard and um so maybe that that would help but um I I do wonder if they'd even let me let me in the door um but it would be interesting uh but yeah but he was showing that that look yeah meat causes diabetes just like water causes therosis um so he had a lot of very very interesting quips like that um that I that I really liked um but uh but yeah people want to see that it's um it's it's a really good interview I really liked liked talking to him um and uh yeah one one thing that that um you know he did mention there was that you know when we're eating that that we maybe we didn't eat all that much fat historically because you wild animals are lean that's true to an extent but elephants and whales and large larger animals tend to have a higher proportion of fat to their body weight and that's why we went after the megap we went off to the giant giant sloths are just full of fat and things like that there's a lot of these things bears bears you know they have to have a lot of fat they're going to hibernate and so a lot of these these these Ice Age animals you know they needed to have a lot of fat for insulation for energy for you know the ones that hibernated um obviously for those purposes so actually was a lot of fat available you know seals you know how much fatter in those whales so uh we we actually did get a lot of fat and it wasn't until the the ice ages uh last ice stage ended in the this mass extinction of mammoths and and megap that we actually started going over to other sources we started having so shoot we we're not getting enough fat we need to cultivate you know Dairy and get milk and and make butter out of that that's you know why we did that we needed more fat we started you know breaking open marrow bones going after marrow bones that that happened in a distinct part you know place in history um prehistory because you know we were the megap had sort of were dying out and we didn't have access we needed more fat and so we didn't have Buzz saws to cut down the femur like we do now we get marrow bones you know they had to cook these bake these heat the hell out of them get them to they were hard and cooked and brittle and then smash them open with rocks to get it the fatting side it's labor intensive you know and so it's not um you know we had to work for it so you know that's how important fat was to us and um you know uh and and and like he said too the visceral fat there's a lot of fat around there and around the organs and that's and that's what animals tend to go for when they eat another animal they go for the abdomin abdomen first that's where more fat is and that tends to be tends to be why uh Quantum truths jck thank you so much for the"

        "body": "o your doctor Dron Hernandez thank you so much for the o your doctor Dron Hernandez thank you so much for the Super Chat hello Dr Anthony uh quick question I keep hearing that if I don't consume carbs or testosterone tanks uh can you please elaborate on this as uh I'm 40 uh dead opposite just absolutely dead opposite when I get people on uh carnivore diets their testosterone levels massively increase all I I have older men in their 60s and 70s that double or triple their testosterone I get men that are on trt testosterone replacement therapy I get them off you know when I have a guy coming into my my clinic and they have very low testosterone I don't just put them on trt I put them on a carnivore diet and then they don't need trt I had a 19-year-old kid 1920 uh you know nice kid and he's just sort of he's sort of going there because his mom made him um but you know he had low low testosterone and I mean this guy's like a like a teenager early you know or 20 like he he should have had testosterone screaming out of his ears right but his is actually very low it' be like an 80y old man it'd be like low for an 80y old man it was it was low and so you know normal doctors see you got primary testicular failure you need to go on testosterone placement for the rest of your life right because your body is just not making testosterone properly uh I didn't do that I put him on a carnivore diet it in two months it went from I think it was around 100s I think like it was either 120 or 180 anyway jumped up to like 400 in two months right so and it's still going up we're testing again now I'm assuming that's going to go up as well depending on how strict he can stay on it he's not he's not being perfect on it but he's eating a lot more meat and a lot less carbs and and he's only sort of rice every now and then um just that is already going to improve it so no I don't I don't see that I've never seen that clinically people can make all the claims that they want but in actual uh you know real world scenarios that doesn't happen um if you're eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you're lifting weights and you're reducing stress and you're optimizing sleep you're GNA you're going to improve your testosterone greatly um getting on the Sun that something that uh Andrew hubman dr huberman was saying that just like 30 minutes exposure with as much skin as possible you know shirt off things like that St for guys um uh is is fairly straightforward if you're a woman you have to maybe be in a more private enclosed area to get more skin exposure but um if you do that I think he was saying 30 minutes a day three days a week that that that can like increase your testosterone Alone by like 50% vitamin D is a hormone it's a it's a sex steroid vitamin D is what differentiates out some of the body body uh shapes in in men and women through puberty so higher vitamin D it's the vitamin D actually broadens out men's shoulders and narrows the waist so you have that sort of that vshape right that classic bodybuilder vshape big broad shoulders and narrow skinny waist that's vitamin D and then in women it gives that that sort of the the the the shoulders coming down to a narrow waist and then coming out to a more shapely rounder hips so that that sort of that classical hourglass appearance that's vitamin d That's What vitamin D does in in men and women during puberty um but it affects you after that too so you're not getting enough you're not getting enough Sun you're not getting enough fat um and cholesterol and all these sorts of things you're eating plants and plant sterols which replace our own cholesterol and can't be used for vitamin D can't be used for testosterone can't be used for our other hormones like DHEA pregnanolone andrine progesterone estrogen all of these things they're all derived from cholesterol and so if you're using plant oils you know you plant sterols and that's going to stop you from uh making enough cholesterol you're not going to have enough cholesterol for your hormones or your vitamin D so anyway it all comes in uh in fact intermittent fasting has been shown to increase growth hormone and testosterone levels by like 50% too so again getting that insulin down your insulin goes up your testosterone goes down think about it like that in women it's opposite um insulin goes up that blocks a conversion of testosterone into estrogen in the ovaries so it stops the ovaries from uh making estrogen and so you get too much testosterone not enough estrogen and you get you can get PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome like we had the the previous question the treatment for that is a ketogenic diet get off the carbs this helps your hormones get away from plants plants have hormone disruptors they're going to raise your estrogen they're going to disrupt your testosterone in men especially so uh no yeah you're not going to you're not going to trash your testosterone uh you're going to feel better than you ever have you're going to put all muscle more easily than you ever have you're going to feel fantastic uh so uh yeah just just go after it um and you'll you'll feel great you'll literally age backwards and you'll feel like a kid again and you'll just want to just work out and be active and you'll yeah just you'll do fine don't don't worr y about that Antonio Crete

        "body": "ut all right uh Michelle C thank you very much for the ut all right uh Michelle C thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr C are some cancers hereditary based on what I'm learning in the corn of our community it seems that cancers are metabolic disease am I understanding that correctly Dad passed from colon cancer 10 years ago thanks well some some of you have certainly have a genetic predisposition and then you'll get environmental triggers so generally if you don't get the environmental trigger even though you have a genetic predisposition and you know so you know that would be considered hereditary you you can pass down the you know those those genes and there are genes that uh damage your mitochondria and that make it more easy for your mitochondria to get further damaged and and have further issues um relating to cancer so yes they can be hereditary but you still have to even if you have a genetic predisposition you still have to have the environmental trigger now you know people will say well what about children that are born with brain tumors that happens and that is absolutely devastating it's absolutely tragic um that is also likely very strong genetic predisposition again with environmental trigger so you know would we see those brain tumors and kids in in you know newborn babies if their mom had been eating a different diet we don't know um I suspect yes but we don't know um it could be that you know we go on a carnivore diet and someone just has you know something wrong genetically and they just this growth in tumor and they're born with that and there's just nothing they could do about it you know that's possible but I think the vast majority of these things while you can definitely be genetically predisposed to getting cancer through familial inheritance or from a denovo mutation um in your body like in your in your in you when you're a zygote um that that that you still have to have an environmental trigger for most of these things the vast majority of these things you need the you need the environmental trigger and that's the most important part of that because even if you have the the genetic predisposition most often you won't get get the problem if you don't have the environmental trigger so that's what I think is going on uh there but yes you can be predisposed and so if you have a family history of cancer you need to be more dialed in and on top of um of your diet and other sorts of things to reduce and minimize your exposures to uh any cancer causing or cancer facilitating substances so and and I think I think that's what you're doing if you do cornivore I think you are doing you're addressing a major um source of that sleep stress can't stress stress enough it's really important to lower that down your body works a lot better when you're de-stressed and uh sleeping well so good luck with t hat uh Nicholas Taylor poke thank you so much for this"

        "body": "hat uh Nicholas Taylor poke thank you so much for this hat uh Nicholas Taylor poke thank you so much for this Super Chat uh I'm a redheaded fair skinned carnivore I know some people stop getting sunburns on Carnivore at least a lot less can you elaborate on this will I more than likely have this being fair skinn yeah I know redheads that get tan now right they don't like just Freckle up they actually get they actually get tan um will that happen with you I don't know but that has happened with other people so you know we talk about plant sterols and how they they mimic cholesterol and we don't make enough cholesterol so we don't have enough olol to make vitamin D so we don't synthesize vitamin D vitamin D is made on the well it's made in epithelium and also on the surface of your epithelium and um it gets into the seum and actually works as a as a UV sunblock it's a it is sunblock and so when we when we don't have enough cholesterol or we have a lot of plant sterols getting in the way of cholesterol we're not going to make vitamin D and so we're going to get burned right we're going to get uh sun damage if you wear sunglasses with UV protection your brain doesn't think that brain thinks you're in a cave and so you're not it's not getting enough light it's not getting UV light it thinks you're not outside and you're not going to produce as much melanin you're not going to produce as much um vitamin D so uh that can be a problem too and then you know when you're when you're eating plants they come with the plant stero which you know we just talked about but they also come with inflammatory factors cause more inflammation so if you get damag it will cause more inflammation more more oxidative stress more damage and you'll get damaged get more burned and you'll peel and then they also come with different substances different classes of toxins that make you more photosensitive make you more light sensitive UV sensitive um uh there's a whole class of them called Fano cumerin I just did a I just did a story on uh on my Instagram showing this called celery dermatitis kids chewing on celery and the spit goes down their face and they get chemical burns in the sun because those Fano cumerin burn their skin in the sun when exposed to UV light outside of UV light doesn't do that um but it gets in your body and your body's detoxifying this and you can get more light sensitive as well so you're not eating those things and you're not going to be as light sensitive um animals do livestock does they get into feed or plants that they are not supposed to because they run out of their normal food and they don't have feed they'll eat what they have to to survive and some of these things will just get scorched and burned and horribly um horribly uh hurt by this we do that too so you're eating a whole bunch of plants and garbage you know celery parsnips uh Citrus all citrus have Fano cumins that make you light sensitive so you know um kids um there's a there's a picture of a kid I put on there too he's squeezing limes out in the sun lime juice dripping down his arm he got second deegree chemical burns down his arms but yeah but but but the plant toxins are good for you aren't they so you know this is this is how plants defend themselves and so that's a major thing when you cut out all of those things out of your diet and out of your system uh your body just works differently I have I've not worn sunscreen in Australia um and they oh the sun's different here not where I'm coming from you know I don't burn you get red but that turns into a tan I don't I don't peel and it doesn't hurt I can take a hot shower looking red and the next day it just looks Brown so uh that that can happen with you as well well obviously it's um you can overdo it um I've really really overdone it and just been in the sun just all day every day for a day and days and days and days and days in the middle of the summer you know 110 degrees out and um loved it and just turned into a tan and I and it had a little bit of peeling on my nose that was it little bit on my shoulder that was it wasn't like huge amounts just little tiny spots and that was it and I really overdid it so you know being fair skinned you know you probably not going to be as able to be as aggressive as I am U but um no you you'll probably T I don't think you'll you'll burn much at all but you know ease into it I think you'll be fine um you don't need sunscreen sunscreen has Benzene and things like that that are known carcinogens so I don't think you need to to take those sorts of things just be smart about it uh ease into it see how you go and um if you're doing just meat and water I think it'll be fine Gordon Smith hey thank you for the super st icker I appreciate that um from Lena thank you for the"

        "body": "icker I appreciate that um from Lena thank you for the icker I appreciate that um from Lena thank you for the super chat if you do omad and later on feel fine not hungry but not full do you eat some meat anyways um and it tastes good doesn't mean that you should eat more yes if it tastes good you should eat more it means you're hungry so remember your hunger signals are going to change they they're very different on a carnivore diet they're appropriate on a carnivore diet when you're not eating carnivore diet eating a whole bunch of other garbage you will inappropriately increase your hunger signals and so you'll just be starving all the time so you have to limit yourself you say well I could eat I want to eat but I don't need to eat I'll I'll I'll forgo um you don't want to do that on a carnivore diet you want to eat until fatty meat stops tasting good and so if you eat once and you do that and you get to the point where fatty meat stops tasting good and you stop that's great and if later on you feel like yeah I could eat steak sounds good you start eating like yeah that tastes delicious your body wants that food keep eating until it stops tasting good yeah absolutely Joe fry guitar guy um says is it true we get all the nutrients we need for life from only meat yeah absolutely you get everything you need in the proportion that you need it from eating meat and how do we know this well um because we exist and we had to make it our way through ice ages and those ice ages did not have plants abundantly available we were eating meat and and people in the northern reaches during the ice ages they really didn't have any plants to eat so you know they uh and then you Inuit up in the Arctic Circle there are no plants up there they're above the tree line there's nothing growing up there except like deep down in the depths of the ocean like Plankton and things like that um you know I don't even know if seaweed is there because it's just so deep there but um you know they don't eat plants and uh and they they're very healthy they're just eating fatty meat polar explorers that went up north when they only ate meat they did better than if they packed in their food if they were just hunting and eating fatty meat the way they inue it did that's when they they did the best um so yeah you absolutely do get everything you need in the proportion that you need it if you're only eating meat if you're eating a mixed diet you need a different constellation of nutrients and that can change they say oh you need this much and this much when we were figuring that out um we were we were all eating a mixed diet and so you know it's different you know you get anti-nutrients you get things in plants that delay stop um and prevent you from absorbing and utilizing nutrients properly you're going to need an abundance of other nutrients in order to overwhelm that when you're not eating those plants you don't you don't need them so yes we absolutely do um if ever if ever you hear anyone say like oh well we weren't in the ice ages we weren't living up in the ice well the Inu or and um you know I say well we were just racing down towards the equator and we just stayed there eating fruits because we're frugivores somehow somehow people think that with their brain that they somehow think works so that's not true they're just making that up the fossil record actually shows that homohabilis when the ice sheets were coming down on the start of the first Ice Age they migrated up into the ice right away from the equator they went into the tundra and the Frozen Frozen arctic areas because that's where the meapa was presumably but anyway that's where that's where they went and so they they survived because they went to a meaton diet because they manifested their Destiny as apex predators and that's where our Evolution took off our height and brain size went up exponentially faster than basically any other um advancement in brain size and height that I know of anyway um it's and certainly in our in our evolutionary history that that was the fact it was sort of going up as as we were eating more meat sort of going up like this and then it hit Homo habilis in the ice ages and became apex predators and Bam just took off and then 10 15, years ago with the Advent of Agriculture brain size going up up up up up up down height going up up up up up down so you know not what you want but yeah you get absolutely everything you need what what are the Inuits eating they don't have access to anything in the last ice age when the when the bearing straight became a land bridge between Asia and North America and people could walk across that's in the Arctic Circle and well it's close enough anyway if it's not in it but it's you know completely iced over that was the whole point it's just the the the the sea levels went down down down down down and um and uncovered this just this ice bridge that went across from Asia to North America and that's how people came across during the last ice age why you know why were they able to survive if they they were able you know when they came across there there's no plants there what were they eating there animals that's it that's all you're eating during that time in those areas so yeah you get everything you need in the proportion that you need it and you don't get all the other things that you don't want because meat doesn't come with toxins plants do and that's the main thing any animal can eat meat any animal can thrive on meat only certain animals can thrive on certain plants plants because they have the the biological ability to detoxify and gain the nutrients from that specific plant which are locked up in ways that we don't have access to they lock up their nutrients in a lot of ways they and they guard them with toxins so that's that's uh that' s the idea there Lonnie call thank you so much for the"

        "body": "s pretty awesome um question from un thank you for the s pretty awesome um question from un thank you for the Super Chat 48-year-old female BMI 21 blood pressure 96 over 60 HDL 98 triglyceride 68 LDL 123 uh low carb high fat mostly meat diet got a CAC score of 330 referred to cardiologist what do I ask uh and I'm worried well look that's fair enough to be worried a CAC score over 100 is is sort of where you start getting worried what was it last year what was it the year before that and the year before that and the year before that now you need to know these things what's it going to be next year what's it going to be the year after that and the year after that and the year after that that's what's important you need data points um they'll probably say you have a CAC score of 330 you need to be on a stat and you're very high risk the question to ask is so you're putting me on a Statin for a high CAC score yes so does that mean that a Statin will lower my CAC score the answer to that is no it actually raises the CAC score and they say well that's good because it's stabilizing the plaque and that makes it less likely to rupture okay but a CAC scor says nothing about the soft plaque you could have a lot of soft plaque or not a lot of soft plaque so raising your CAC score is that necessarily a good thing not necessarily is it necessarily a bad thing well according to them if you're on statins then it's not a bad thing because you're stabilizing your plaques which sort of seems a bit off to me that's those are two sort of mutually exclusive ideas if your CAC score is up so that means you need to be put on a Statin which makes it go up even more are we thinking about this so that's a question I would ask um your triglycerides look great your HDL looks great LDL looks great um CC score we don't know what that was before you need to remember that and that doesn't tell you what the soft plaque is if you have soft plaque that's going down your CAC score can actually be going up because the plaque there that's that's that's still around can still be getting calcified and according to them getting stable and and less likely to rupture so is that good but if the Soft plaque is going down your C score is going up a bit just because it's sort of calcifying a bit of this stuff that's not necessarily bad thing women that take calcium supplements have a 15% increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease that's something to think about you know so maybe if you're on a calcium supplement and you got calcium in your arteries maybe that's not what you want to do um maybe statins aren't what you want to do because LDL was never a problem in the first place cholesterol was never a cause of heart disease it was a scapegoat by the sugar companies and it raises your CAC score so CAC score if that's the problem why are we trying to raise it why are we taking medication that raise it so those are the questions that I would ask those are the things that I would think about and I would just me personally I would just get successive CAC scores check it in a year check it in two years get an angiogram if you want to know what's actually going on in your heart if you want to know what's actually going on with the blockages how much obstruction you have then you get an actual scan that can visualize both the hard plaque and the soft plaque so you look at total occlusion if any you can have a CAC score without you know uh any significant occlusion and then you check that and you check it again in a year right and then you see what's going on there and you reduce stress and you improve sleep major major major Killers poor sleep uh and high stress um the only study that's been shown to clinically reverse atherosclerosis was a study on uh meditation when you meditate for 40 minutes a day or people who meditated for 40 minutes a day actually clinically reversed their aosc sclerotic plaques so do that too uh and get more data points we don't know what your CSC score was before so all you can do is start where you're at now you know you need to get on a plan that you think is going to be best for your heart that's going to be best for your health for me that's a 100% meat and water diet that's what I do for my health and that's what I think the data shows is the right thing to do but you need to be you need to be convinced you don't just do things just because I do them or someone else does them look at my my video on the truth about cholesterol and heart disease talk to your cardiologist talk to other people look at other videos that have different reviews and then see what you think holds the most Merit and then make a decision for you because at the end of the day this is this is only going to affect you and your family and so you need to you need to make the right decision for you right you you can't don't let people uh make decisions in your life that pay no consequence for being wrong if your cardiologist says you have to do this and you think that that's a really bad idea if you have a a bad outcome from that it's you that suffers it's not the doctor and if the doctor is following the guidelines he can't even sue them right because you know he's just I'm just doing what we're told to do that's what everyone that's that's a standard of care you can't get sued for doing standard of care right and um and so that's why a lot of doctors hide behind standard of care but it's also the standard of care that's what most people do that's a consensus say like hey this is what most people think most people should do but you know those those guidelines come from not exactly trusted sources sometimes often uh even the the editor-in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet have both said that you can't trust these uh expert opinion or uh guidelines or even the studies published in the L it in the New England Journal of Medicine that they're all corrupted um by industry mostly you know and special interests so um you gotta you have to know you have to do what's right for you you know if you if you look if you see what your doctor says and you said like I I think I need to go with him then don't worry about what I say you know because if I'm wrong you're the one getting hurt I'm getting hurt too because I'm doing this but you know I don't think it is I don't and and that's why I do this and that's why I recommend this to patients and that's why I have my my I recommend to my parents you know that's the tough one you know when you're looking at this going like my I need to be damn sure you know that this isn't going to hurt my parents because you know I I just I love them to death and I would never want them to I want them to be as healthy and happy as they can be for the for a very long time and so you know this is something that i' I've put a lot of thought and effort into because I don't want to hurt my parents and I don't want to hurt any of you so this is the conclusion that I've come to but if I'm wrong you're the one getting hurt so you need to decide what's right for you so you need to listen to other people don't just listen to me don't just be in an echo chamber listen to gundry Listen to Gregor if you can stand his voice and you know listen to me listen to Ken Barry listen to Dr aadia cardiac cardi thoracic surgeon um you know and talk to your cardiologist and then take all that information and you come up with a plan for your health because it is your health it's no one else's Health it's only going to affect you and so you need to be on a plan that you think is the right thing to do but that's what I would recommend I would recommend doing exactly what you're doing eating a high fat meat-based diet because saturated fat in the journal American Colley Cardiology has said in 2020 a massive metaanalyses of randomized control trials and metaanalyses of randomized control trials showing that there is no correlation between dietary saturated fat intake and cardiovascular disease none right and higher saturated fat actually correlates with lower risk of stroke and less saturated fat higher risk of stroke so that's what the data shows that's what the evidence shows and the history shows that cholesterol was never the problem in the first place this was invented by the sugar companies and then they found unscrupulous doctors and researchers that they could pay off to push that narrative it was then it's now and statens raise your CAC score so those are the questions I'd ask those are things i' think about and I would watch um the truth about cholesterol and heart disease on my YouTube channel and I would watch my interview with Dr Philip aadia who's cardio cardiothoracic surgeon who is of the same opinion as I am and um and then look at the alternative side and then talk to your cardiologist and come up with a plan for yourself and go od luck with that uh trust no one uh thank you

it's it's still early days you know it's only been a couple months um sleep apnea asthma COPD and fi fibromyalgia I mean those things I've I've certainly the sleep apnea asthma fibromyalgia weight massively improved I'm seeing more and more people with COPD uh from smoking things like that empyema that that have actually started improving now it's going to be like curosis of the liver or

completely irrelevant to the discussion at hand and pretending that there are these randomized control trials robust this that the and he's just he's just assumes that no one's going to check them and uh so I checked them and they're they were were completely irrelevant and in fact some of them actually proved my point which is very funny to me because uh he said this proves that you know plant toxins are good for you uh and actually some of the studies actually showed that they cause more harm so which was funny so he didn't even didn't even read his own study so if people can join for that uh that would be great and that would be a Premiere and and I'll be there chatting with people in the live text chat as well and you guys can just let me know what you think and hopefully you like it but um I think it's important to start pushing back on these people that are making these erroneous claims and and using studies that have no bearing on the the conversation at hand and trying to say that other people are being dishonest and zealous and ideologically driven when actually is more likely him you know he says like this is what he thinks nothing's going to shake it because he's right and he couldn't possibly be wrong you know I even saw him uh he did a thing with Thomas Del who was so nice to to even have a conversation with this guy because he' been so rude to Thomas before and um and uh and he was really nice to him and Lane said like oh well you know um you know and and you you admitted it to he's like oh yeah Thomas was so nice even though I was really not nice you know so at least he has some sort of insight into that sometimes but then he still acts badly you know a lot of the time and cuss people out and tell me it like an eye doctor or something like that said oh what what about this and this and he said you're an eye doctor F off or shut the f up like what does that have to do with anything you know and so it's um you know he acts like that and at least sometimes he gets that that's inappropriate but um he still does it which is bad uh but with Thomas he say like oh well you know I said you know I was maybe not as nice as I could have been and he was always nice so we're going to do this but also you know he's come around he's really he's really matured and really you know come around on his thinking on a lot of things basically meaning that he is so rigid his thought that no one is going to be right unless they agree with him and so the reason that he's that that that um that Thomas was doing better now was because he came around to Lane's thinking therefore it's okay so that's that's zealotry you know that's ideologically driven that's being so rigid in your thought that you can't think anything else I was taught this stuff too I was taught a lot more than he was and I was and i' I've had to look back and go wow that was all wrong so was not ideologically driven like I before I was a doctor I was an empiricist and so I just I want to know the facts and um and the data so you know a lot of things in medicine are like that like I I you know there's a Harvard there's a Harvard graduation address where they said that um they said to the students who graduating class they said hey look 50% of the 50% of the things that or half of the things that you've learned here in Harvard are going to turn out to be wrong but no one's going to tell you which half and so you need to figure that out you need to experiment you need to test you need to research yourself to find out which half and what's right and what's wrong and you don't just take all these things at face Val well that's what I learned so that's true um so it's um sorry it's um you know it's important to remember that and and you just just because you learned something in college and just because you read a study on it doesn't actually mean that that's true you need to keep an open mind on things and the reason I think the things that I do now is is because of that I've radically changed my view on things because that's where the evidence LED you know I I wasn't born with this oh it has to be this like I was like looking at more and more and more I'm like oh my God this just it just blew my mind so that's the thing and it's I think it's important for us to point these things out and get more and more people on board um pushing back on him because he just shouts people down he just yells at them and so we need to we need to push back and we need to be more aggressive and AR defense and uh and and calling him out and holding him to task to be more um to be more appropriate and to be more rigorous with his argument and stop being so um stop being so rigid in his thinking so that will come out tomorrow hopefully people enjoying for the the premiere if we can get this sort of turnout tomorrow uh for the premiere that would be amazing hopefully we can please do i f you're able to uh Muhammad thank you so much for the"

        "body": "f you're able to uh Muhammad thank you so much for the f you're able to uh Muhammad thank you so much for the Super Chat how to gain muscle on Carnivore um and fix skinny fats so the skinny fat will uh will try will sort of fix itself you know you're just not eating carbs and all that sort of stuff um um and so that will sort sort itself out you know the the skinny fat the visceral fat they'll just just sort of melt away and uh and fix your metabolism um um and um then the muscle side of things that's that's sort more you just need to eat more so you need to stimulate your muscle growth you need to lift weights you need to Sprint and you work maximally you need to push yourself right you need to go to muscle fatigue and then you need to do this regularly and consistently you can't just work out for two weeks and go ah I'm not a I'm not a I'm not going to the Olympia so you know that's it you need to be consistent you need to go need to work out you know you set it set it out three days a week four days a week you pick certain days and you go come hell high water you work out um you got a home gym system or you have like the X3 bar something like that you have it you just do it right you don't mess around so um that's that's important to do that consistency so you need to lift weights you need to work maximally you need to be consistent you need to Sprint maximally and then you just eat you need to eat enough and you need to eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good if you're working out a lot at least try twice a day and if you get enough meat if you get enough fat um and get enough food and you work out like that you will put on muscle more easily than you ever have in your entire life now some people it's easier for them to put on muscle than others um but it either way for you it'll be the easiest that you've ever put on muscle but you got to eat enough you got to keep eating till it stops tasting good that's different than just eating until you feel full or feel like you could stop there two different things you eat until it stops tasting good and you work out and that's it that's what you do um so we had a question here as well um but there's one there's a question that seems to pop up and um that I've got here the chats it says do you have any plans to expand your practice to include nutritional therapy similar to Rivero so I basically do do that now you know my functional medicine practice that's a major part of my practice is is is diet diet and lifestyle sort of interventions that's like 95% of the treatment now we have medications and things like that that we can fill in the gaps and you know Band-Aid issues but the major underlying driver is is the diet so if I have someone who comes in they're in you have hypothyroidism they're Hashimoto and they're having these other sort of issues you know you know yes you they they need to be on thyroid medication if they're below a certain level and they're not well then they need to be on thyroid medication so you put them on thyroid medication but you also address the diet which is going to address the underlying condition so then you see if you even need to stay stay on on medications often times you can bring them down or even take them off and you don't need to keep as long as they're able to stay on top of the diet especially on a on a just a red meat and water diet and so that's the thing so you can use other traditional uh medicines and medications as an adjunct you know someone comes into me and has diabetes like I'm fine with them being on Metformin I'm not fine with him being on OIC I you know but you fix the diet and then then that fix the underlying condition and then they can come off the medications so you know that's um I already do that now but you know I really like Rivero and you know if I if I go if and when I go back to the States you know uh depending on what I'm doing I I'll probably try to involve myself in Rivera because I really like Dr Baker he's he's a great guy and and he really means well and he's you know I consider him a you know a friend of mine and I I want that model to succeed where we're we're just helping people and treating root cause um sort of issues so I do I do do that um in my practice um and um you know even you know when I finish up neurosurgery like I'm this that's going to be part of it I'm going to talk to people about this and be like hey you have all this pain you have all this thing have you tried these dietary interventions like yet we can do surgery but you need to be on this diet leading up to that so you can have a best outcome right and if they come back and say hey um my Pain's gone I don't think I really need this anymore great I don't care if I don't make money from those surgeries like there's enough people that need surgery there's enough money in the I don't care you know I just want I want the right thing for people I don't want to have to carve into someone's spine unless they have to right so um yeah I think that that's a really important thing I think all doctors should incorporate uh nutritional therapy in into their practices and if they're not I think that's honestly borderline malpractice like you're not you're not addressing the underlying thing you're not doing something that can help them um it was actually really interesting there's a patient made a very good point he had a friend of his it's an orthopedic surgeon and U he said well do you do diet oh no no we don't do that we just do the medicine all that sort of stuff you know that's just we're not allowed to give dietary advice or all that sort of stuff first of all you are actually and you know sort of uh um you know you're supposed to too you know I mean a lot of do oh no don't eat fat don't eat red meat because of cancer on that's dietary advice right just the wrong dietary advice but um you know he said oh we're not allowed to give dietary now you are actually because Doctor Gary fety got attacked and The dietitian said you're not allowed to give dietary advice you're just a doctor doctors treat health and diet nutrition is part of health and he was reversing diabetes and so people didn't have to get their legs chopped off and um and they're and they're trying to take him to court over that and they did take him to court but he won and the course of course you can give dietary advice of course you need to n you're a doctor that's part of being healthy and so of course you can do that if that's if that's helpful so um you can give dietary advice this we said well no no we don't do that and and the my patient said said to him like well you know aren't there certain foods that interfere with certain medications like wouldn't you wouldn't you tell them not to eat certain things if it interfered with the medication oh well yeah of course but that's that's different because that's that's medical it's like how do you know that they're eating that if you don't ask them if you don't ask about their diet and their nutrition how do you know if there's going to be a conflict or not right it's a good point and um and uh you know probably you know made him think and hopefully did okay carnivore Chronicles thank you very much for the"

        "body": "and let us know pure blooded Patriot thank you for the and let us know pure blooded Patriot thank you for the Super Chat do you agree with your last guest regarding uh needing carbs oh for for Dr cus so he he wasn't really saying that you necessarily have to have carbs um he was saying that he want you want like a bit of a of a a glucose bump insulin bump and that can be helpful um he was saying mostly that he saw the problems in people that are just not eating enough fat and so I think that's probably part of the problem also if you think about it you know you're saying that like if you eat more protein and that turns into glucose that's going to raise your glucose a bit and it but he was saying that when you do that sort of internally it does raise insulin but it's not all that much it's just a little bit you want like a bit more of a bump um and then to do those sorts of things um but I haven't had any problems with that I haven't seen any other people have problems with that the Inuits don't have any problems with that our ancestors didn't have problems with that again crossing the land bridge from Asia to America you know they weren't eating carbs outside of the glycogen in in the meat and organs that they were eating so I'm still of the opinion that there's no such thing as an essential carbohydrate there are entire civilizations and populations that don't eat carbohydrates their entire life after weaning all mammals don't eat carbs after weaning so no I don't think you need it I think you need to get everything else right and if you do get everything else right then then you'll be fine and if you know if you're you're growing you get that bit of an insulin burst is that going to help you grow a bit more is that going to be a bit of a cheat to get you going maybe you know like there you know one of the previous questions was was you know if you're drinking milk and and I would I would only drink raw milk if you're going to drink milk um that um you know maybe they had some growth factors maybe that little bump in insulin would you know help you get energy into cells and help you grow maybe um I'm I'm a fan of just doing things the way we're sort of designed and and you know we don't need we don't need milk after we're weaned you know uh we do need fat and so getting things like butter and stuff like that sure but I don't think we need carbs no um and I don't think the Rob really thinks that too I think he's he's he's very much avoidant of carbs um because he's he's you know he deals with carb addiction all the time um but um yeah I think that um I don't think that you need carbs I think that um you know there might be certain isolated incidences that that cars may be helpful like um I was just talking to someone uh earlier that um had um you know an injury from from the injections that that she was forced to get um and she had damage to her heart and there's there is growing evidence that you damage the the metabolism of the heart the the metabolic health of the heart so all of a sudden can't run on ketones um your heart primarily runs on ketones preferentially runs on ketones and if your heart can't run on ketones that's a sign of metabolic distress in your heart and so there are more studies showing that this is happening and so um she said that this actually happened to her and she was carnivore for two years feeling great but then this happened and now she's just feeling awful and having a horrible time with things and uh unless she has some some uh uh fruit some carbs from fruit so that's an injury you know and that that could potentially be the case that you know she may need that I mean you make carbs anyway so I don't know if that's 100% what's going on there but um but either way maybe she just needs a bit more and if you if you have a sort of injury like that and you know that isolated circumstance you know maybe and hopefully she gets better and recovers and doesn't need that anymore but the vast majority people unless you're in a very very specific uh situation like that then no I don't think you need carbs whatsoever and I think you do better without them because you make them you make all the ones you want you make all the ones you need uh Michael mixler can you address how cutting out the last 5% uh things like coffee really change your carnivore results yeah basically you just just get this exponential drop when you add in any plants because it just it disrupts your metabolism physiology in a lot of different ways you know coffee for instance is it really uh disrupts your energy metabolism and you get a an energy burst but then you get a drop and you just feel like garbage coffee also comes with 150,000 other chemicals in it that are not caffeine and so you get all those sorts of problems as well you get a lot of a lot of inflammation and so that's um you know that's not what you want I feel sore um um you know for um I feel sore for um you know two days after I after I drink coffee so you know it's um it's uh it is the case that there there are inflammatory factors in there and there are problems in there you just just a little bit a little bit a little bit that builds up if I have one cup of coffee I'm sore for two days what if I have a coffee every single day it's going to build up inflammation it's going to build up soreness I'm not going to feel great if you have any carbohydrates that's going to completely upend and rearrange your metabolism your insulin goes up it shuts down your your normal metabolic State and um and so even a small amount of carbs is going to cause a big disruption and so you get more of an effect with that the early introduction of these things and then you know it's just like if you have an open watch or something like that with all the watch gears going on there someone sprinkles some sand in there I me it's going to destroy the watch and the mechanisms it's going to run all cranky and gross it could stop it all the all the way now you can pour another pound of of sand on there and that's going to make it worse it's really G to stop but you know you already did a lot of damage just putting a few grains of sand in the watch gears we're fine-tuned machines we're we're very very uh fine-tuned uh instruments we're Precision Instruments and we need to think about it like that so you know just a few grains of sand can can screw up the the mechanisms Lance Maguire thank you for the"

        "body": "'ll do more of these Annie thank you very much for the 'll do more of these Annie thank you very much for the super chat um my son is on the autism spectrum he is 216 foot tall and weighs 111 pounds he has been on Carnivore for a week and we are seeing neurological gains already um can he gain weight on a diet well first of all that is fantastic news I'm really happy to hear that he's already gaining Improvement uh I think that's just a product of him going into ketosis and uh and getting proper energy um Dynamics in his brain which is amazing and I think these are going to continue to improve at 21 your brain is still partially plastic well we're all plastic uh brains to to a degree but he can he can actually gain back some ground which I I I hope that he does um yeah he's quite skinny um but yes you can certainly gain weight on this diet you just need to eat enough so a lot of people come to this because they want to lose weight but people come to it because they want to gain weight too they want to put on muscle they want to put on lean body mass they don't just want to put on a bunch of fat right which is not what you want it's like these bulking you have to eat tons of fat in order to put on muscle yeah you can't put on muscle unless you put on fat nonsense of course you can uh you just have to eat the right thing you have to do it in the right way and so people that tell you that oh this is how you this is how you put on muscle you have to put on a bunch of fat they don't know what they're talking about if you just eat a bunch of meat lot of high fat you know high quality meat and you work out you will put on lean muscle mass and only lean muscle mass and you'll it'll actually improve your um you'll improve your your muscle gains more than than you would by any other by any other means so yes you can definitely put on weight just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good um need to impress that upon him that it's not just a when I feel like that he can stop it's when it stops tasting good so if he finishes play and and that still tastes good you know you should ask for more or or get some more very important now it may be that there's some you know Communications issue I don't know his exact situation but if it um first of all we hit 2000 that's pretty amazing it's the first time hit 2000 and went immediately back down which is why I called it when it happened but um uh 2000 pretty cool but um the uh the the thing is is that that he he needs to be you know understand that that he eats until it stops tasting good so he just keeps eating while it's enjoyable if he's only eating meat so he's fatty meat high fat very high fat brain's made out of fat you want all that fat you want all those ketones for the brain the proper functioning and neural development and and restructuring you can you actually you know redo a lot of of um structures in the brain uh which is I mean not not the whole structures if you're missing a lobe you know it's not coming back but you know but you can do a lot you can do a lot especially with the you know the the connections in between the neurons and the different um Connections in the brain so and the functionality of the neurons as well and this will keep getting better as you go and the mitochondria get better and better and better and stronger and stronger and stronger and more plentiful they'll get better and he will gain weight just eat meat until it stops tasting good he's very skinny probably need to try to eat two three times a day maximally eat until it stops tasting good and do that at least twice a day and and see if you can start exercising if you can do Sprints or if you can do resistance exercises you know even just push-ups sit-ups body weight squats pull-ups things like that those will do a lot for him to stimulate his muscle uh development and growth and for helping put on healthy weight and healthy lean body mass um okay well we got down to the end of the of the questions that we had there we were answering some uh Facebook questions and the questions that U popped up in in YouTube as well and um you know so I don't know if anyone has any more sort of last couple questions that are burning burning a hole in their brain but um um let me see here I'm GNA pop over so I'm on streamyard but I just want to see if um if there's anything up on just actual YouTube itself um yeah okay um all right well okay there's a couple questions so why don't we yeah we'll probably just finish up with these couple questions these are from um like Facebook as well um Sinclair Cole said I went carnivore November in 22 lost 70 pounds and all Labs became great awesome that's Fant fantastic yeah that's that's that's typical if you're able to stay with it that's that's what happens and that's really great to see thank you very much for sharing maybe other people you know let us know your your results you know write that in the comments write that in the chat um and especially the the comments let people know you know it's really important to let as many people know you know what people's results are because people come to these things and they say like well what's this I heard about this you know maybe I'll try maybe I'll sort of ask questions or whatever and they come see and they just see more and more and more people having the results that they want and they need and that's very helpful to them so um you know please do comment and let people know your your experiences with it even the negative experiences that helps people learn too they say hey I did this and this didn't work very well what do I do how do I fix this you know and other people will be able to comment say hey I did that too this is how I fixed that so you know it's not going to be Flawless and seamless for absolutely everybody every time you know it is it it is something that you have to sort of learn and and see see how to do it properly and and get enough of what you need so it's uh it's important to have these discussions and uh and the comment section is a great place to do that so question uh cats on Carnivore how much should they eat as much as they want as much meat as as they they want to so um you know raw is what you need for cats and um and actually like like Meats not like minced up chewed up they need to be chewing chewing on things ripping it off the bone maybe chewing up the bone um if it's raw then you know it's okay they can deal with the bones and so um you know I give give my cat just a just just a ton of meat um and I just keep you know I give him and then and I'll see him stop and he'll just stop at a certain point you know his body's telling him to stop just like it tells us to stop right and so um so that that's what I do just give them give them as much as they want they're not going to get fat on meat unless they're eating other stuff uh they'll do that um and same for dogs as well just just let them go to town and uh hmod um thank you very much for the"
