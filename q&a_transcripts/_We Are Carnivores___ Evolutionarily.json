    "transcript": "I think that really drove us into that final stage of pure carnivorism was the Ice Age the initiation of the ice ages around 2 2 and 1 half million years ago or so we came into an Ice Age which were still actually a part of and these ice sheets came down they killed off the plants that killed off the animals that ate the plants and weren't able to survive during the ice times and really only these big meapa and big fuzzy full furry mammals like mastadons giant sloths and things like that were able to survive during this this period and then the carnivores and and predators that were praying on them our ancestors being among them so evolutionarily uh as I mentioned about eight million years ago we broke off from other primates because we started eating meat started eating more meat and more meat and started having these genetic and physical adaptations phenotypical adaptations uh that that we we see in the fossil record we started becoming more upright we started becoming taller we started having smaller and smaller teeth smaller Jaws bigger brains and we started using tools because we had to figure out how to take down animals that outclassed Us by every physical metric like a madon or even a deer you know there aren't many people that can you know wrestle down a deer and and beat it to death with their hands you know uh maybe they exist but these things are very big strong powerful animal anal with antlers and so we had to figure something out we had to figure out how to take them down and that's where tools and tactics come in you know the pound stones go back millions and millions of years the first worked Stone tool came in at around 3.3 million years ago and those developed and became more sophisticated as the you know eons go on and go by and these were used to kill and dismember animals and they got more and more sophisticated and that's something that um you know know Dr Bill Schindler spoke about uh you know in his talks and in his book uh you know eat like human and uh and he had had a great talk at kokon as well it's a shame that um that that wasn't uh uh recorded but you can you can find his material on um on YouTube as well and I'll be having him on the show soon also so you know what what um what happened I think that really drove us into that final stage of pure carnivore ISM was the ice age well the the initiation of the ice ages around two two and a half million years ago or so before that there really wasn't uh these ice caps these polar ice caps those didn't exist further back than about two two and a half million years ago then we came into an Ice Age which were still actually a part of and these ice sheets came down they killed off the plants they killed off the animals that ate the plants and weren't able to survive during the ice time s and really only these big megap and big fuzzy F furry mammals like mastadons giant sloths and things like that were able to survive during this this period and then the carnivores and and predators that were praying on them our ancestors being among them or at least adapted enough to survive during that time because we were eating meat and because we were eating these animals and became uh basically reliant on pure animal nutrition because there there weren't the plants available so our ancestors that went down that line and and just went you know Whole Hog on the whole uh Meat Train those are the ones that survived and those are the ones that turned into modern day humans because of that evolutionary drive and necessity for animal Source nutrition we can also look at this from the fossil record and something called the stable isotopes stud so it's stable uh nitrogen studies they can find this in the bones of any animal and you can see what that animal at and if the there basically it builds up uh throughout the food chain so animals that just eat plants they will get a certain amount of this stable nitrogen and then animals that eat that animal they'll have a concentration of that nitrogen and so on so as you go up the food chain you get up to the top you know like you know a fish that eats algae there's a fish that eats that fish a fe fish that eats that fish and so on up the chain till you get to sharks and orca whales and things like that and so you can see that these are top of the food chain apex predators and we actually see that our ancestors and early humans and even early Homo sapiens and Neanderthal were apex predators they had a higher carnivore rating than even lions foxes hyenas around at the same time in the same location okay so this is because our ancestors were eating the Lions and hyenas and foxes and wolves as well we have done this looked at the uh done stabil isotope analysis of the ancient Egyptians so not everyone knows this but there actually more it's thought to be that there are more mummies in Egypt than there are people currently alive in Egypt this is because these were just the burial practices of ancient Egypt it wasn't just the Pharaohs and the and the wealthy that were uh mummified certainly the only ones you know buried with a fortune in gold and and uh trinkets but everyone was buried this way and so they looked at the stab isotope study and they found that you know that during the Agricultural Revolution post Agricultural Revolution that they were actually heavily eating grains and this actually affected their health we can look at these and we actually see atherosclerotic plaques in their hearts and and this was first thought to be that the pharaohs and Wealthy were the ones eating all of this um you eating all the the rich food and they could afford meat and fat and so obviously they were getting uh fatty arteries because they were eating fatty meat but that actually isn't the case when you look at the stable isotope studies we find that the the normal peasant class were eating the same amount or the same uh kind of food as the upper class just probably maybe not as much access you know so if there was a famine or something like that you know they they're the ones that are going to starve first however they were they were still eating the same thing and you can even see from their statuary that this is not not actually the you know peak of uh of human health here this is this is a statue of a man who has clear gomasa and a pop belly okay so that already is is showing this this disregulation of health and hormonal Health in the population just eating grain so they they had the original grains that they you know may have had had treated and fermented or sprouted or done uh different things than they do now to get a more less or less harmful product and it was still causing all of these problems so even then without processed sugar and refined sweets and junk food they were still still getting sick and they were still getting uh uh unwell and gomasa and obesity as well hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys so evolutionarily um again we look at different studies that are just all over the map uh there was a major study that was done out of the University of Tel Aviv in Israel from uh Professor Mickey bandor who I will be interviewing uh next week actually um this showed that humans have been hypercarnivorous apex predators for at least two million years so again apex predators top of the food chain this is what that stable isotope study shows that we actually were top of the food chain apex predators don't graze I've never seen a great white shark e the shark eat kelp for roughage I've never seen a lion eat grass for the same reasons this this is not what apex predators do this is not what top of the food chain animals do they eat animals they eat the animals below them on the food chain and this is what the Israeli study showed as well from Mickey bandor that not only with the stabil isotope study but by many many many different metrics you know we show that humans have been carnivores apex predators Hunters not hunter gatherers hunters for at least two million years and that coincides with the Advent of these ice ages and people say that well you know when when the ice ages came down know well people were still eating plants they still had to do this and you and you point out that like well during the ice ages there really weren't any fruits or vegetables available to people and uh you know because it's it's ice and they argue well no no people just move towards the equator when that happened that's actually completely false that is uh that that is nowhere argued in any of the scientific literature and in fact it's very clear from a fossil record that as the ice shelves were moving down people were moving up okay probably because this is where their preferred prey was which is like the macadons and megap so we can also look at the fossil record and look at what happened after the Agricultural Revolution you know paleoanthropologists can actually look at a fossil and a skull and teeth and actually tell you if a if a human skull was before or after after the Agricultural Revolution the teeth and Jaws only develop properly with proper nutrition and so crooked teeth small jaws microna th those are all a product of uh malnutrition so not getting enough of the appropriate nutrients that we need uh will make it impossible for our bodies to develop properly there are other things as well um you know uh uh mouth breathing sucking your thumb and and using bottles and all that sort of stuff they can actually change how your how your how your mouth develops you know chewing on actual food this stimulus the development of your jaw as well um so but looking at this just from a nutritional standpoint you do need specific nutrients like vitamin K2 K1 calcium vitamin D and so on in order to make straight teeth and this is this is published widely in dentistry Journal today that that this is a phenomenon that this is not a genetic issue crooked teeth are not a genetic problem they are a nutritional problem this is from not getting the proper nutrients so when we look at the fossil record before the Agricultural Revolution we actually see very wide jaws with straight teeth all of their wisdom teeth are in and comfortably so their jaws are big and straight and wide and and and pronounced uh they're not these short truncated crowded jaws with crowded teeth you know why is it that now we we like almost no one gets their wisdom teeth in whereas a couple hundred years ago all you know most people did if they were getting proper nutrition uh people say oh well we're evolving away from that I'm sorry but it takes way longer to evolve than just a couple hundred years or even a couple Generations because just a generation or two ago not getting your wisdom teeth in was actually less common than it is now far less common than it is now now now we look at uh height in the fossil record actually people in in the prehistoric era were actually taller and they had larger brain sizes so the average uh brain size of homo sapiens was 11% larger before the Agricultural Revolution than it is now and the anthol brands were actually larger than that going back like 50,000 years this is likely because you know even before the Agricultural Revolution maybe people did start having to be you know add into the Gathering part of the hunter gatherers because they weren't able to get sufficient nutrition sufficient fat and calories from the animals that they were eating because the meapa was going extinct and we had to looked at other sources of nutrition potentially to uh to help mitigate this so before that our brains were actually bigger and people were actually taller and there are areas where uh people were known to have been hunting mammoths and we can date these and say like okay well the these guys were Mammoth Hunters and we can see this by other other metrics as well to show that that's what they were eating and they found that that some of these populations were on average 6 foot2 or even 6'4 and that's on average you know the average height of uh an adult male in America is 5 foot eight you know in in China Mongolia and elsewhere it's like 5 foot6 somewhere it's 5'4 that's that's very very very short and that's the average so you know half the population would be below that as well not so in the areas that uh that had an abundance of meat to eat like these uh big Macedon Hunters are on average about 6 foot2 or more and so a lot of these people were much taller than that as well um you know the different tribes in Africa where they just eat meat on average these guys are 6'2 6' 3 6'4 the adverti of a population to know the average health of a population and while you may have uh you know geographical uh you know you know differences in population uh and sort of you know like you have the pygmies in Africa you know they at full height those guys are not that tall however uh you know you do have different populations like in Asia we have you know people that went through you know the the you know the forced famines through of Mal dong and the other other communist famines um obviously they were had stunting growth and you have all these these uh elderly Chinese people they're very short and then they come over to America and they have kids who're 6'4 you know because this is a nutritional issue this is not just a genetic issue and we look at brain size as well okay so this is this is a chart of our brains growing going back 10 Millions 10 million years and it's slowly creeping up slowly creeping up slowly creeping up and then you see it around two two and a half million years all of a sudden this Spike up and that's because during that slow rise we're eating more meat and more fat and we were growing our brain because we're figuring out you know how to get better quality food we're starting to figure out tools and all of a sudden when we're basically forced to go full carnivore because we don't have any other options with the ice ages our brain development skyrockets and it has this exponential growth right up until the end there where you can see right there at the end it all of a sudden has a sharp decline downwards okay you cannot argue that that is a genetic change like that that is that is something that happened in the environment like the genes don't happen that fast so it's nearly a straight line when you look at it you know in proportion at that small area and then almost direct line downwards okay so that that is a sharp sharp sharp Decline and so something happened there something happened that it was not good for us and if you actually look at that that coincides with the Advent of Agriculture and plant-based nutrition becoming more prevalent not even as as as dominant as it is now just more prevalent okay before that we were carnivores we were living as carnivores then we add in plants on a wide scale bam our brain size goes down that's not good right so you know that is a very clear piece of evidence that this is not the way we should be eating"
