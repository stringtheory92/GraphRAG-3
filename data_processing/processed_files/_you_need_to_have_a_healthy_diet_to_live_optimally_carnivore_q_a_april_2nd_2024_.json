        "body": "90% of of medical issues that we treat in in the world as doctors are these non-commutable chronic diseases that don't exist if you don't eat plants they just don't exist if you get enough fatty meat and you don't eat plants these don't exist the vast majority of them don't exist you know that that's important you know having people die of you know dementia and uh cancer and autoimmunity and kids not developing properly and you know one in 22 uh boys will have autism one in 34 uh people in general will have autism now whereas one in 10,000 back in the 70s I mean that's not ethical I mean you cannot you cannot support A system that does that to people and destroys their bodies and brains like that you just [Music] can't all right hello everyone thank you for joining uh another YouTube live also live on Facebook and X um formerly known as Twitter so uh this is is for the 2nd of April uh 2024 and April 3rd here in Australia so um I had a couple uh super chats last week that I I uh or last Thursday Friday um unfortunately I had to cancel my live that morning had a a last minute uh issue come up that I had to go deal with and so couple of the a couple of the uh people had already put up super chats uh before the things started so um I'm just going to start with those and um and then go from there so the first one is from uh Beth who Beth r1220 who says uh hi Dr chaffy thank you for answering these questions I'm uh starting The Challenge on April 1 um I have so that be the how-to carnivore challenge that that uh we run I have a long history of severe yo-yo dieting and restriction I'm currently a bit underweight and I have a massive appetite I know so I know that my Hunger satiety cues are messed up I think eating is almost uh more mental Than Physical for me so I know fatty meat will taste good as long as my uh long after my stomach is physically full how do I handle or cure this also how critical for success is grass-fed meat where I live Walmart is basically my only option but I want to be sure I'm doing everything right thank you so much um you know if you're if you're a bit underweight you know and your body's telling you to eat more it's probably for a good reason I don't there probably not uh that you're you're getting false signals or things and that you're being told to eat when you shouldn't if you're not on medication like prazone Picone hydrocortisone those sorts of steroid hormones then uh you generally can listen to your hunger signals and if you're if you're underweight um and your body is saying please eat then you should probably eat it's probably a good idea to do that um and uh and so I would just I would just do that I'd eat high fat meat and just keep eating until it stops tasting good if you get physically full and your body just is saying well that would still be good but you're physically full that's fine come back to it later you don't have to just eat once a day you know if your if your body wants to put on weight then you will likely have to eat more than once a day so when I'm working out I'm lifting weights a lot and my body wants to put on muscle I have to eat more than once a day it's just it's just a requirement and so um it's uh it's probably the same with with you your body's telling you that it wants you to eat and so just eat you know that's that's what your body's asking you to do um there are people that are in that position that they're they're sort of underweight and their body wants to put on weight and they eat a lot they they eat more calories than I do and um and they they put on a lot of good healthy weight so I would just I would still do that I would still just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good or until you're full and then try to eat you know and eat more than once a day if you need to you know and if you do that a couple times a day and you're eating fatty enough food typically you'll find that it um uh that that's enough and that your body's very satisfied if um if you need to eat three times a day then eat three times a day you're you're going to hit a point where your body body puts on a certain amount of healthy lean body mass and maybe a bit of a bit more uh fat stores that that are healthy for you and uh and that point when your body gets to a steady state and a stable position it's just going to say okay that that's it that's where we want to stay and your your appetite will come down again so I would just I would still listen to that okay let's see um so's there's a couple other um there are a couple other sort of uh things that were on from from last week as well that have been starred here so this is one from carnivore Scott who said um what are your thoughts on possibly reversing portal vein hypertention which is which is Scott's issue uh a lot of different things can cause portal van hypertension so that's a you know that's a very specific and significant uh medical issue um you know I think that obviously the same dietary principles apply you eat what your body's designed to eat and then at least you're you're removing out any potential issue that that an inappropriate diet can cause have to contribute to that however portal van hypertension is is a very um specific issue and and could very well have um problems that that are going to uh not be amable to just diet alone so it depends on what's causing the portal vein hypertension you can at least try to uh you know eat this way and just eat carnivore your names carnivore Scott so I'm assuming that you already do um and if that helps and that's great and if it doesn't then you need to go uh through the traditional sort of treatments and methods to um you know to help to help your situation sometimes that's surgical some that's Medical but I wouldn't ignore it I wouldn't um just just say well I'm just going to eat this way and hope for the best you know that's um you know there are there are other things that cause harm to our bodies besides just the things that we eat and sometimes the things that we eat cause harm in our body that can't just be reversed by switching the way we eat because there's there's permanent damage done so you know eat carnivore diet high fat carnivore diet absolutely and then uh you know talk to your about you know getting that that treated in traditional ways as well and find out what's causing your portal vein hypertension and seeing if that can be reversed so Zachary Scott um says after rectal cancer chemo radiation and surgery uh as Professor C freed said I'm fighting the Battle of treatment effects uh ahead maybe um thanks Dr cha you I've been a big fan for over a year oh well thank you very much I appre appreciate that and and I'm really glad that you you come across this stuff and and hopefully it is helping you in your treatment against cancer and and hopefully recovering from that fight you know chemor radiation surgery is a big it's a big hit to the system you know and obviously that's when you need proper nutrition the most is when you're your body's in a in a compromised state so hopefully this this is something that helps you helps you get better helps you recover helps you feel better and uh will also hopefully help keep your your cancer in remission or or put it there if you're not there already so good luck with that okay so uh cifu thank you very much for the"

        "body": "with that okay so uh cifu thank you very much for the with that okay so uh cifu thank you very much for the Super Chat uh teenager with optical nerve thinning SL atrophy with calcium deposits on one of the eyes shown on MRI any suggestions or opinion of what can be done um again it depends on what's causing these sorts of things a lot of times you can get thinning atrophy inappropriate calcium deposition due to eating inappropriate things as well so that's always the go-to you know just try fixing your diet try going on a carnivore diet high fat meat-based carnivore diet U cut out all the other things and see what happens and if it if it does help then great and if it doesn't help well you know you still have your doctor so nerve thinning can be be for a number of different reasons nutrition is a major part of that if you don't have proper nutrition if you don't have proper fatty acids if you don't have appropriate amount of cholesterol if you don't have an appropriate amount of B12 which almost no one does then you can you can get demin you can get thinning or wasting of your uh nervous tissue and so you know why wouldn't you address that first and foremost while you're investigating other sorts of things inappropriate calcium deposits it's generally pathological in nature if you're seeing calcium start getting deposited where it shouldn't be you know that's that's a some sort of pathology that's going on and could and and absolutely can be caused by um uh diet so that's the first thing you do that's the first thing you address and then you work with your doctor to see you know what else can be uh the problem and what else can be um at play here and potentially reversible but a lot of these things you know they're idiopathic and and you look at that and a neurosurgeon or neurologist looks at that and goes yeah well that's what's going on no idea why you know and so uh you know do work with your doctor do work with a neurologist on this but um you know but also try the diet you know eat what you're supposed to eat and and a lot of things just just start working better as a result of that so that's what you try you you do that but you also see your your doctor and work with them on trying to figure out what's going on and you know if it starts getting better on its own because the way you're eating great problem solved and if not you know you'll need the help of of your doctor to try to figure out anything something that you can do so good luck with that hopefully it's it uh just resolves itself so thank you Jordan vardy for the"

        "body": "just resolves itself so thank you Jordan vardy for the just resolves itself so thank you Jordan vardy for the Super Chat uh 28-year-old male 17-day carnivore MRI uh on upper and lower back neurosurgeon said discs in my back are dehydrated is this reversible he said it's not reversible it's traditionally not reversible um but I've I've seen people who have reversed this I have seen people on MRI who have done this I just actually interviewed um uh a lady who had this you had like multi-layer disc degeneration designated disc all the way up and down her spine uh you know throughout her thoracic spine and and elsewhere and then she goes carnivore and it just they just re-inflate she was also doing um inversion therapy so she's sort of hanging upside down letting that stretch out that's that's how your discs re-inflate uh get those that fluid sort of back in there is is you know from uh gravity and lack of gravity so when we're laying down and we're sleeping we wake up in the morning we're actually slightly taller than we are at the end of the day because at the you know gravity is off when you're when when you're just laying down and these things start to reinl and then you stand up and just gravity just starts sinking it back down and just sort of pressing those out that's how nutrients get in and out of the dis and so when the when that happens you're sort of you know getting getting more nutrients and uh and food into those discs to keep to keep them healthy one thing that an inversion table can do is it just sort of how helps gravity stretch those things out a bit more um I had pancake discs l45 and L5 S1 when I was 20 on MRI and I went carnivore shortly after that and I started using an inversion table my my uncle had one and said it really helped his back and back problems were gone after a few months and they stayed gone for a long time no idea what the hell is my back's doing now um I haven't gotten an MRI since then but it um it certainly symptomatically helped me quite a lot so yes I have seen that get better it's not going to get better doing traditional things you know which is why he's saying that or she but um there are people that have gone carnivore that have that have reinflated their disc this lady that um that I just spoke to last week she said that I mean she G like an inch like she grew like an inch taller like since since she went carnivore because her disc just all sort of reinflated so you know it is possible but you know we're we're basing things off of you know what what happens traditionally with people eating a normal diet in a normal traditional way and it's just like yeah it doesn't happen but you know orthopedic surgeons will also tell you that you only put on you only lay down bone um density until 25 and then after that you don't put on anything it's just you're just just fight against entropy and it's just going downhill from there that's not true either it's just that eating a traditional diet it it it's that's the case but when people are eating a carnivore diet in their 40s 50s 60s 7s 80s I've seen people reverse osteoporosis by going on a carnivore diet and adding in resistance exercise so um I've certainly seen that where people can reinl their discs um but I you know that's what I would do you know if if you have some specific medical issue or not able to go upside down then you know don't worry about it but um yeah you know that that's something that um I have seen that people can reinl those things it's it's um doesn't mean that that's going to happen for you though it just means that that has happened for other people and so those are the things that I've done and those are the people things that other people that have that I've spoken you have done um carnivore diet and inversion table see how you go I mean what's the worst thing that can happen it they don't reinl and you're exactly in the same position you are right now so I mean who cares you know it's not going to it's not going to hurt you unless there's a specific reason why hanging upside down in your particular case can hurt you but you know for most people it's fine um and um and Carnival that certainly not going to hurt you it's only going to help so you know just see what happens you know and if uh if it doesn't work then you're in the exact same position except you have a better diet and you feel better so might as well just run with it and um hope for the best and hopefully that does sort you out if it does you know let us know um come back and and leave a comment or um you know comment uh send me a message all these sorts of things it's always good to know always see what people's results are hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnival bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys Janet Wilson um oh Jan just has a comment here says hi Dr C I'm the

        "body": "ll get more reliable results so Lena thank you for the ll get more reliable results so Lena thank you for the Super Chat can carnivore get rid of cellulite and stretch marks if I weigh 150 and eat 100 grams of protein because I get full of fat will I have muscle loss no you won't get muscle loss you will um you know just eat just eat the amount of fat and protein that your body wants and is asking you for and and you'll be fine so you just keep eating until fatty meat stops tasting good and you'll be fine uh cellulite can be sens sensitive to uh insulin and ketogenic diets and so people have improved their cellulites by going on ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet so that is something that people have seen stretch marks are are permanent scars but they they can soften they can so they be a softer appearance not as sort of harsh and doesn't don't stand out as much and so while they typically won't go away they can become much less noticeable and your skin Quality Health and collagen can improve a lot as well and so that can improve uh the appearance of of stretch marks also and a lot of that a lot of scars can fake you know quite significantly I've had um yeah I've had a lot of scars uh not like the Deep like surgical scars really those are pretty much the same but things like like here I used to have these big nasty scars here from a clash or a head-to-head in a rugby game um this idiot on my team was just compl completely out of position so I was going up to tackle him and he was like tracking him from behind and then just tried to hit him from behind so as I hit into him he came in from behind and his head was on the same side as mine and so we just went Smash Head to-head so he should have realized that and so as I couldn't see him but he was sort of tracking from behind and so he should put his head on the other side and um uh you know to to get away from mine but he just wasn't well he was out of position in the first place so he really wasn't thinking and just smashed in his whole forehead split open and um and he was on the ground just knocked out and I was just had I went blank for minut all of a sudden just like going to tackle this guy all of a sudden just massive huge Welling of pain in h in my head and then all of a sudden I just just goes black and I'm like on my hands and knees and all of a sudden my vision returns I'm looking down the ground I just see blood coming down um and I was just like right all right I just start walking off the feel they're no no JV sit down sit down sit down I'm like nope get the hell away from me I'm going I'm just walking away and got there and like the training was there like PR pressing like hell I mean like d just like smashed my head like a skull fracture and he's like they pressing like that I'm like okay this is this is not helpful and um uh our team Doctor Who was also my boss at the hospital um he was like head of you know the concussion uh research sort of programs and the emergency medicine you know for the the training emergency training program um and uh you know he's professional uh you know national team doctor and and all that sort of stuff he's like know it's all about concussions and the other guy was on the ground wiped out he's like oh yeah no cussion protocol like he's you know he's going to be out for at least 23 days you have to do this assessment that assessment this this this and this and he's talking about how he can't go back and play but I was like um you know so I I played for this team because it was you know it wasn't like the highest level team but it was H it was one that my boss supported and that was that was he really wanted me to play there and so I was just like as like a like a favorite him I said okay I'll play for this team and um so it was you know and so I was sort of like someone he really wanted on the field and um and so he's talking about this guy who's just like no no no he's not gonna be able to play for 23 days he's got to be off this that and the other and I'm getting all bandaged up and he sort of stops and thinks about it he's like oh wait so cha was on this other side of this and probably that would apply to him too and he just looks at me and goes you're good to go back in though right I'm like yeah fine whatever I just like you know put a big gauze pack on it strapped it up and went and finished the game and then he like he stitched me up in the in the locker room after that and then I was and work the next day uh in the hospital and I'm like seeing patients in the emergency department I just got this big Angry nasty wounds and people looking at me like going is he the doctor or the patient like what's going on and um sometimes it's good to have those sorts of things because when you're more banged up and unwell than the people coming in like it's really easy to say look you're not sick enough you don't need to come in for some reason people really want to get admitted to hospitals in some places they just they just they really get offended if you just say yeah you've got a cold go home um and they're like no I just I'm sick so I have to go to the hospital when you're sick you go to the hospital like no when you're dying you come to the hospital when you can't fight off an infection yourself without hospitalization you come to the hospital um so yeah different there but um that scar in any case has has faded dramatically so it's actually um not all that easy to see anymore you have to really sort of look for it and it doesn't really show up that easy on on camera so I don't know if you can even see that but um but yeah so it'll it'll calm down anyway the stretch mat will calm down but you know it is scar tissue and so some of that's going to stay and you'll still have those marks b ut they get a lot better they really really do another"

        "body": "e what's been causing that um okay in reference to the e what's been causing that um okay in reference to the Super Chat my pre3 was fine TSH has always been fine um but your TSH is very low and your pre4 is going up you know that wouldn't be a real good explanation as to why you got um you weight gain anyway because your thyroids up you know if it's if it's up too high then people typically lose weight they don't gain weight and so you know I would I would wonder what what else is happening so what happened in those three weeks or leading up to those three weeks that changed that that then kicked off that wak in that's what that's what you sort of need to look into and find out and if um if your doctor thinks it's thyroiditis you need to find out you know what kind of thyroiditis and why is they said hasimoto thyroid thyroiditis is it is I mean Hashimoto generally raises your TSA and lowers your T4 and T3 so you know and that that could precipitate weight gain but I mean you don't have the numbers typical of of someone who would have you know you're not hypothyroid in that in that regard um in fact if anything you're hyper thyroid and so that's um you know that's interesting that that would happen so it doesn't seem to be caused from your thyroid that you're gaining 10 pounds unless it's gone completely the other way um but that those are the questions I would ask is is um you know what happened what changed in that time period because you're going four years and six months eating a certain way and then something changed and you had a very dramatic different change in three weeks okay so what happened at that point that's the important thing to find out uh a question from Rick Diaz during my last eye exam my optometrist indicated concern about cholesterol I've been on Carnivore for 3 months now lost 20 pounds and feel great any concerns with cholesterol and Eye Health no certainly not with with Eye Health um or any any aspect of your health your optic nerve and all these sorts of things are are melinated with cholesterol and fat your cholesterol is is what makes all your hormones your skin your hair every single cell in your body is made out of cholesterol um your brain is is large proportion of it's made out of cholesterol so it's actually very good for you so cholesterol was was never the cause of heart disease it was it was an invention from the sugar companies they made it up because people were actually finding that there's this strong association between refined sugar and processed food and uh heart disease which was brand new in the 20th century it didn't have anybody die of heart attacks um before 1912 in America that was the first case in in America was in 1912 there were a couple in Europe before that but not that many and people would see every now and then see oh look these little weird stuff in the in the arteries that's not typical we don't see that normally but some people have this sometimes so we could see it we could see the stuff there it just it wasn't as as much of a problem as um as it is now it wasn't it wasn't the major major massive sort of disease that we have now and we were eating far more meat in the 1800s but no one was dying from it um shown on autopsy really more than a couple people in Europe um and um and we're eating way more meat in the 1800s in America were in the early 1900s so there's no association there whatsoever and um you know it wasn't until we started really massively reducing our cholesterol intake and reducing our serum levels with uh medications and things like that that hard hard of these rates have only gone up they've gone up dramatically they tripled since the 1970s and people say well deaths have gone down it's like well those are age adjusted numbers so you can't really trust those anyway because they've been manipulated and uh either way that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the rate of heart disease our interventions are better people are smoking less uh and we can save people from from dying of a heart attack more but more people are having those heart attacks most people more people are having the firsttime heart attack um and it has nothing to do with cholesterol in fact a lot of studies show that cholesterol is protective so um what I would recommend is going to see um a video I have on this I have a number of videos on cholesterol and interviewed a lot of people like Dr Paul Mason and um and many others on the cholesterol idea and Paul Mason has a ton of uh videos on cholesterol and heart disease on um on YouTube they're excellent um and I did one called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease and um just go through that and U and and you see what you think and see what you think about cholesterol I think this great for you I think it's really important we make it you know like why are we fighting our body naturally make making a substance if you just fast if you just don't eat for 5 days your LDL is going to go up your cholesterol is going to go up why is that you know it's not from eating meat it's not from eating fat it's from not eating carbs that's the trick so if you just don't eat carbs your your cholesterol goes up my god um well we don't need carbs we don't want carbs it can cause harm and so to me our cholesterol going up is a good thing because our bodies are wanting to do that and now we've dropped the anchor off our back and our body can get back to doing what it's supposed to do so those are my thoughts on it anyway and you can take a look at my uh video called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease uh for for more on that and I have I list you know I go through tons of of studies in that and uh and Link them down below as well so take a look at those uh Freedom thank you very much for the"

        "body": "stion from Hannah e thank you very much Hannah for the stion from Hannah e thank you very much Hannah for the Super Chat husband is doing carnivore for 6 months triglycerides are 277 total cholesterol 540 A1C is 5 great C peptide 1.90 feels great but worried about triglycerides any suggestions um yeah just get more data points down the road you know because we don't know what direction that's going in you know so if he tested before that and his Tre rdes have gone up and it's generally to do with stress and poor sleep those are the main the main issues there and so um that is something that obviously needs to be addressed so um but it could very well be as triglycerides were higher than that and they've come down and so that's the important thing is looking for the trend looking for the the pattern going is this going up is this going down is this staying Flatline see what's happening so you know those triglycerides aren't aren't where you want them to be but where were they before you know if those were higher than that 500 that's a massive Improvement right so you know that's typically what happens people people just improve their their triglycerides and their HDL go in very positive directions total cholesterol sometimes goes up sometimes goes down total LDL sometimes goes up sometimes goes down I tend to not worry about it myself my my feeling is is that you know your body's going to do what it's it's designed to do and supposed to do when you're eating what you're designed to eat and that cholesterol has been falsely vilified for um for heart disease when is absolutely not the cause of it and um large population Studies have shown that uh higher levels of LDL actually are associated with living longer so they're associated with longevity so you know why are we why are we fighting this total cholesterol as well higher total cholesterol lower rates of cardiovascular disease mortality rates I mean like why are we why are we pretending that cholesterol is causing this disease it's not at all that was an invention by the sugar companies like I said so um triglycerides being up what direction are they going in is the thing so check him again in three months and see what's going on make sure he's getting enough sleep make sure he's reducing stress make sure he's getting getting those blood tests at a consistent time if he's getting those at different times of the day he's going to get different results if he's getting them you know fasted or unfasted he's going to get different results if he's getting it eight hours of fasting versus 12 hours of fasting he's going to get different results if he's get 12 hours versus 16 hours he's going to get different results uh you know cholesterol tests are extremely temperamental and that's another reason why I think they're just an absolute waste of time and money um so get it done consistently first thing in the morning same fasting period same hydration period um status you know all these sorts of things if you exercises the day before cholesterol is going to be different had sex the morning over the day before it's going to be different so all these things make a difference and so you just want you consistent pattern and cut all those things out all those little um variables that could affect this and then just get more data points and just see and if his triglycerides are up or not really going down you know address the the the variability and the way he's taking the the tests and also address stress and sleep those are the main things but it'll go down it'll it'll it'll go down as long as he's sleeping enough and and not overly stressed and uh getting things consistent in with the the ways testing um and bennison over on X said says have you seen cold sores improving on a carnivore diet um uh people's frequencies yeah can go down and they can um uh certainly keep them into remission your just immune system gets gets better so people uh typically report that they don't they don't get as much of those yeah I mean it's not going to get rid of them these things are they live in your your um your gangling so they they're just sort of they've inserted themselves in you know as a retrovirus or living in your own DNA so you're never getting it out of there unless those cells die um and so you know that's um uh that's probably not going to happen to get all those things tied off which you probably don't want anyway because that means you're getting nerve damage so uh the the main thing is just improving your your immune system so that that it just suppresses that and that that's typically what we see Lance uh had a question doc have you you encountered patients with necrotizing fasciitis I had it in 2023 had surgery on uh foot and in and I'm in wound care stem cell fish skin treatments uh doctors keep pushing plant-base dive for Recovery my ass okay so I mean they just don't know what the hell they're talking about um they just have absolutely no idea what the hell they're talking about I mean you're going plant-based so you can get what a lack of amino acids and collagen yeah that makes sense um no don't listen to a word those idiots say um and and please call them idiots for me and then then give them my email um because I I want to call them idiots too I mean that's just absurd you know ask them for one one piece of experimental data showing that a plant-based diet helps in this in this state and if if they can't produce it why the hell are they suggesting this to patients that's malpractice I mean that is that is Frank malpractice so um yeah that's that's just ridiculous um to that pisses me off so um uh no I haven't I haven't talked to people in your in your position but um you know if you if you are eating you know a proper human diet and your body's going to have all the amino acids and fat and cholesterol and proteins and and enzymes and things like that that you require for life and rebuilding your tissue then that's obviously going to help you recover from these things can recover from any surgery higher protein diets always been shown to improve uh surg surgical outcomes and and healing tissue and so you know the idea that you should go plant-based and just completely screw that up and never have B12 again in your life is um probably one of the dumbest things that I've ever heard a doctor say and I've heard some really dumb things um but it's it's just so crazy like why the hell are doctors pushing a PL oh you got to go plant-based to heal your necrotizing fasciitis where where where's that in the literature why are you pulling that out of your ass um that yeah that's really annoying no don't listen to them don't listen to a word they say probably don't listen to them on any advice ever because if they're making that up what else are they making up what else are they lying to you about what else have they gotten wrong you know if they gotten all these all these people have got all these things wrong and then you're listening to their advice on other things too I mean you have to sort of wonder about that you know I've spoken to you know doctors have said that you know and they have their own health issues and they're going to these doctors and and they're oh yeah yeah you know this is what you do need to do get rid of meat plant-based all these sorts of things and and for this specific issue and they're like yeah that's actually not what the data shows and that's actually not what the literature shows and um and you know they knew this and they were like thinking like well if you got that wrong you know what else do you have wrong you know what what else do you what else are you telling me that you are convinced is correct and is completely bogus you know that's what Mark Twain said he said it's not it's not what you don't know that uh that gets you it's what you know for certain that just ain't so and so because then you're like no no no this is definitely what it is and then I mean you're just you're just really really hammering down the wrong path and so uh that is definitely where you are at with this one so well that's scary um no do do your own thing with the diet um I would not listen to a word they say on that you know you know the treatment fine um you know with actual sort of wound care and all that sort of stuff but you know anything about the plant-based uh yeah don't don't listen to a word that they say about that you need animal fats and proteins and B2 and all these other sorts of you know essential essential nutrients uh in order to heal properly and have a proper immune system that's going to allow you to heal properly and to fight off this infection and keep that effect infection away um it wasn't until we went to agriculture that we started seeing widespread signs of uh systemic disease and infection in skeletons like tuberculosis that happened immediately after agriculture why why are we telling people to go plant-based to help our immune system when we know for a cold Frozen fact it makes population sick and gets them more susceptible to infectious disease it's just it's just absolutely ludicrous so um no I would not I would not do that I would not recommend a plant-based diet for anybody at any time in any situation ever and certainly not healing from necrotizing f itis get some has a question uh doc I just finished watching carnivore versus vegan video you recently participated in uh you were too nice and I'm being nice uh you were too nice he was pretentious well you know you have to try to be nice and and just you know civil and mature and just let the people sort of you know screen themselves out people see you know generally see that um I was um you know I was way too nice in uh you know uh one of the other debates that I did because I was trying to have just a civil discourse and they were not doing that and they were being a complete prick and um so this time I was just like y all right I'm I'll be civil but I'm not going to give him an inch and uh and so I didn't do that and especially when when he started um you know going at homm and saying wow what's the point of talking to this guy is's a pseudo scientist I'm like interesting that was a big mistake yeah that's not what you wanted to say right now because after that I was just like I just I didn't let him get an inch anything that he said any uh you know unqualified statement that he said I didn't let him slip by anything I just cut off and say like where's the study for that how do you saying that you made this statement you made this claim and it's wrong you know where does it say what is your evidence for that well but I mean everyone knows and then everyone else was like well yeah why why did you say that you know why you know that's that where's that evidence from where are you getting that from and I you just didn't have answer I just would not let him let him up on that because he was just like you know it's like all right you want to play that game yeah let's do it um so yeah um um the other thing is I mean you don't want to be mean to people you know I don't I don't actually disagree with their motivations you know I I disagree with you know a lot of their actions and the way they they go about you know trying to to bring about the changes that they want um I don't disagree with their motivations you know wanting to to protect animals and you you should you should protect things that can't protect themselves um you know and uh that's that's you know human nature to try to protect um you know protect you know defend the defenseless um and so that's not a that's not a bad motivation and um I just don't think that it's it's um the right way to do it I I think that it has a lot of other KnockOn effects that are seriously going to damage People's Health and you can't actually do that safely um for the vast majority of people and certainly not optimally for anybody and you're getting a lot of people I mean 90% of of medical issues that we treat in in the world as doctors are these non-commutable chronic diseases that don't exist if you don't eat plants they just don't exist if you get enough fatty meat and you don't eat plants these don't exist the vast majority of them don't exist and so um you know that that's important you know having people die of you know demension and uh cancer and autoimmunity and kids not developing properly and you know one in 22 uh boys will have autism one in 34 people in general will have autism now whereas one in 10,000 back in the 70s I mean that's not ethical I mean you cannot you cannot support A system that does that to people and destroys their bodies and brains like that you just can't um so you know and then there's more animals die as a result of plant Agriculture and and and monocropping and it just destroys the environment so you know the the motivations are right it's just they're they're seeing things at a surface level and you know they're not they're they're not you know seeing it from from A broadscale View they're you know they're missing forest for the trees they're very focused on this tree this issue and they're not seeing you know the the grand scheme of things and I think that that's important to do and there are a lot of people coming over from the vegan vegetarian side because they were like oh crap that's um yeah that's what that is um I just had an interview with liar Keith who wrote a book called The vegetarian myth which is excellent by the way you know people should check that out we had it in our book club in patreon and she was kind enough to come on and and talk about it and I just interviewed her now literally just now and um I'll be putting that up in in the coming weeks and um you know she goes through about all these these these myths about how this is better for the environment it's what we're designed to eat this is really good for us this really good for Animals it's like these these are all wrong and we're being misled and we're being man iated and that's the thing people people's kindness and and good intentions are being manipulated for the greed and um you know and uh benefit of of uh nasty people that that make trillions and trillions of dollars off us eating garbage and getting sick and having to pay for the sickness and treatment for that so um you know the people that profit the most from that are the ones that want us eating this crap and staying sick and so you know you don't yeah just good to stay out out of that whole whole side of things but you know it's important to sort of make these points and point this out to people and you know most people that follow me on Instagram and YouTube most of the people here you know leaving the comments you know if this is you were at one point vegan vegetarian and then they they either saw that what they were doing was not actually making the difference that they wanted it to and they were better ways of doing that or they were getting so sick that U they really had to make a a change in their life and so and sometimes sometimes both so um more and more people are coming around to this so having these conversations while they can be a bit tedious and obnoxious hopefully they do good and and bring people around JP thank you for the"

        "body": "ou'll do great uh Taylor k thank you very much for the ou'll do great uh Taylor k thank you very much for the Super Chat uh my auntie is 52 and has terminal cancer I'm very sorry to hear that um has been eaing high carb die forever yeah pretty common how can I convince her to go keto carnivore any thoughts on carbs and cancer yeah a lot of thoughts on carbs and cancer um it's it's something that's actually pretty well studied there are hundreds of studies on uh ketogenic metabolic therapy many of you know tons of them in humans I mean there's like there's over 20 just in uh GBM you know GL blastoma brain Cancers and uh and there's tons and other other cancers as well and and even more in animal studies and animal models I mean just just just tons of these things right so I would absolutely uh show her my uh video on um with Thomas caed professor caed over at Boston College and he's one of the you know the world premier uh cancer researches have well over 150 um peer review Publications out in the literature at the moment on ketogenic metabolic therapy and cancer and how it affects cancer and and he particularly um studies uh GBM but it's not the only one he does tons and tons and tons of other studies as well so I would definitely look into that so watch that's that interview with him um I also have a lecture on ketogenic metabolic therapy as an adjunct a standard of care in Cancer Treatments um on YouTube that's pretty much the name I think that's that is the name pretty much verbatim and that's on the low carb down under website so that was at a um a conference that I spoke at in San Diego last year and so um take a look at those show her those and you can show her the I have a a playlist on YouTube uh on cancer and it has that and it has a lot of other things on cancer other talks on cancer and other success stories people that do this and um and have had very positive outcomes as a result of that so um yeah do take a look at those and hopefully you can get her to watch them and uh and convince her to give it a try I it's not going to hurt her I mean at the very least it's going to help her chemone and radiation I mean that's been shown in um you know multiple studies that that um and particular two that I can think of in 2018 2019 where they they showed that um uh being in ketosis fasting or on a ketogenic diet during Chone radiation um is um beneficial to The Cho it sensitizes the cancers the cancer cells to chemo radiation and it protects your native cells from your healthy cells from uh the chemo and radiation effects so it's uh at the very least if it doesn't not else it's it's going to do that and but also something called the warberg effect which is that cancer cells require about 400 times the amount of glucose that normal cells do and so what you're doing when you're when you're eating carbs is you're massively increasing the amount of available energy to these cancers and they just grow like hell um that's what a pet scan is we give someone radiol labeled uh glucose and you see what sucks it up that Cancer Sucks it up right that's because you know think about that every time you have a bagel or eat some cereal or a cookie or chocolate that's just sucked into that cancer that's feeding that cancer so uh think about that hopefully one of those uh one of those um videos or you know those pieces of information can help bring her around and and good luck to her I hope she I hope she well I hope she gets better if she can and at least um does as well as she can otherwise so very sorry to hear about that but hopefully hopefully she can she can get better uh fana says interesting I wonder what the doc feeds his cat uh just meat same thing what are cats meant to eat they're meant to eat meat what are humans meant to eat we're meant to eat meat so cats don't need as as fatty of meat as humans do so they can do well pretty pretty well on lean meat giblets organs things like that like my cat loves chicken gizzards just goes to town on them uh he really likes beef though too he's like sort of got a bit spoiled on you know sometimes they have some some bit extra you know pieces of meat will give them to him or just like don't have any anything so I'll have like a roast and I'll just cut up you know a bunch of meat or just give him like a big Tomahawk with some meat LIF on the BP just give him to that he's this tiny little cab with this massive bone he just carrying it around like Fred Flintstone you know and um he gets really excited for meat and um so uh yeah that's what I feed him he's very very healthy never had never had any sort of health issues very lean and muscular and uh very healthy in general very he doesn't have fur is just how he's designed but um Skin's very healthy some people have like these the Sphinx cats and and oh they're just so oily they have all this and skin issues none of that none of that just a soft um dry skin you know it's just just normal soft warm skin you know and no issue so yeah he's very very healthy and just meat only meat never never give them anything else hey everyone really happy to announce a new sponsor of the show for

bodybuilding competition on Carnivore well if well if you're going to do a bodybuilding competition I would I would recommend it being on Carnival yeah absolutely look up uh my friend Richard Smith he goes by keto Pro um it's really carnivore Pro because that's what he does um but um you know he was he was a professional bodybuilder he sort of moved on to different different Avenues now but um he was a a natural um bodybuilder and he won like the European Pro bodybuilding Championship as a as a natural athlete competing against um um performance enhanced uh athletes right the bodybuilders and and he won and he he was able to get down to like 2% body fat he's absolutely shredded and so um you know that's yeah you're going to be able to work out harder you're going to be able to recover faster you'll get more muscle gain lean mass gain uh for your effort and uh you won't have to like do this whole dirty bulk thing where you gain a whole bunch of fat and then have to lose muscle and fat you know which is you're not losing muscle fat anyway you're just losing fat you're just um you're losing glycogen water weight and then intramuscular fat out of your muscles that's that's what they're losing anyway they never gained the muscle in the first place so no it's much better I mean the golden ero bodybuilders they were just eating steak and eggs steak and eggs steak and eggs some of them thought you had to do one refeeding day on with some carbs one day a week to replenish your liver glycogen but that's not true you know we know now that that your body replenishes your liver and muscle glycogen better when you you don't eat carbs than when you do eat carbs so um and faster too so uh yes I would absolutely recommend that and more and more people are doing that now and having fantastic results so hopefully you do too so's a um question or comment from Andrew uh who says thank you you saved my life I started at 600 pounds with chronic pain and although I'm still obese I have a ton more Mobility I've been filming my whole journey so I never get where I started well that's amazing Andrew that thank you so much for sharing that that's absolutely fantastic um and I'm glad you're you're recording this you know I mean that's that's really really important for people to see um so if you have a a YouTube channel you know feel free to to pop it up and people can take a look at it and um you know so if you're if you're filming it but you haven't shared it on social media please do please start a YouTube channel and um Instagram page and and and document your journey and and show people this because that's really helpful for people to see because there are a lot of people in your position right now that uh don't know where to go and and their life is is hopeless and so they don't know what the hell to do and so the more people they come out there and say hey look this this actually works um and you can you can do this and you can get better and you don't have to starve yourself or eat you know rabbit food and make yourself feel miserable all the time and depressed um you know you can actually eat real food and uh and get real results and that's really the only way you're going to get real results is it with real food so please do please do share that if you haven't already and thank you very much uh for for being here today uh Sandra says I don't understand vegan positions yeah it's it's really bad and also um you know why are you why are you telling somebody you know to uh to go go vegan you know with with a I mean you know it's it's it's not part of the treatment protocol I mean that there's certainly not that's certainly not in the guidelines or anything else and there's there's no uh backing for that in the literature you know to say that you you should go on a plant-based diet that's going to help you recover from necrotizing fasciitis really you I mean the studies that have been done is showing that higher protein is what is what you need in these circumstances when you're healing tissue so you know going on a on a nutritionally deficient diet like a a vegan diet is um is is asinine in that situation for a doctor to start recommending that I mean they are they are doing harm to their patients and that is uh obviously very much against the the code of ethics for doctors and so I hope they they uh they you know pull it around because that's they're they're harming a lot of people doing that uh Tera gouki from Facebook says started yesterday other than headaches I'm all I'm doing good and you'll check up in three weeks trying to get out of a pre-diabetic category well look I think you'll I think you'll do well it may not be that you'll reverse your pre-diabetes in just three weeks but it'll it should make a significant dent in it um but if it doesn't if it's not as dramatic a change as you as you were hoping for in three weeks just give it time it will go away um this has been clinically proven from verta health and elsewhere that you uh go on a High um meat-based ketogenic diet it reverses type two diabetes so you know going on cornivore diet is going to be even better and you're just getting rid of absolutely everything your body doesn't need or want and only things that it that does need and want and and you'll do very very well your diabetes pre-diabetes will be will will go away uh don't worry about that get adequate sleep de-stress keep your life happy and meaningful and um and y ou'll do fine Mary Shepard thank you very much for the"

        "body": "o good luck to that metal head hippy thank you for the o good luck to that metal head hippy thank you for the Super Chat is I is iodine okay to take just as a supplement or do you need to be deficient in any chance of saving a gallbladder healing it uh if you have Stones thank you um yeah you can save your gallbladder depends on how bad the stones are if it's if they're just super big you know there's a chance that these things can get stuck maybe they can dissolve enough I don't know we don't have any evidence one way or the other with that um but if the stones are small enough they can just pass through potentially and there are people that have had stones and gone carnivore and uh you know cleared up their issues and haven't had any sort of um negative reaction from that if the stones are too big they can get caught and you'll need uh you know surgical intervention to get that sucker taken out yeah down through the mouth and it pull it out of the tube if it's stuck in the tube in the B duct or um could potentially need to get the gallbladder removed you know but if you don't eat you know fatty meat then it's definitely going to grow and they're definitely going to get stuck and you're definitely going to need to get it taken out that's just all there is to it so when you start eating more fat then you're going to start moving these things out and you're going to stop building up the stones that's that's how that that works um as far as ion is a supplement yeah you can I mean a lot of people can be deficient in it I don't feel the need to take supplements unless you are deficient in something um depending on where you're sourcing your meat and and you know the mic specific micronutrients in it it may be that it doesn't have all that much iodine in it but um if that's the case and you're a bit deficient then sure supplementing I think it's just it's just important to be a bit careful because if people are having thyroid issues you want to know why you're having a thyroid issue is it because you're not if you're deficient in iodine or is it because you have Hashimoto Hashimoto thyroiditis is is one of the most common autoimmune diseases already and it's wildly underdiagnosed because no one looks for it until it's an absolute train wreck disaster um but I look at things when it's more subtle and I find way more cases than you'd imagine and um that's so that's just something good to know and so if you have Hashimoto that can really exacerbate the Hashimoto if you take iodine for some damn reason and so you can just make that worse and make your antibodies jump up and and um be a bit worse so um why is that is it because of the supplement itself or just having a lot more iodine than you necessarily need somehow triggers this off is there something else that's going along with it we don't know um also we only know this in the context of of eating a standard diet because that's that's what everybody does and so maybe it's only it's only those people maybe on a carnivore diet it doesn't exacerbate Hashimoto but that is the accepted uh teaching at the moment is that I you know taking iodine when you have Hashimoto actually makes it worse so try not to do that unless you are aware of your Hashimoto status I think it's just safer to to just check that and just see where you're at and if you have antibodies antibodies for Hashimoto then probably don't take the iodine unless you are strictly deficient question from uh Karen RoR viser thank you for or yeah from from um Facebook I'm on day 52 mostly for joint pain but also for weight loss lost four kilos in the first four weeks but have stall now feeling good though well really the main thing is just is just feeling good so just focus on your on your health and how you're feeling and your energy levels and joint pain and all that sort of stuff and and um you know and just and just go from there if you are if you're feeling good that's the most important thing you know there's different different reasons that you wait and stall I don't think it's a great idea to check your weight in general because you know bone has weight muscle has weight you're improving your lean nass you're also going to increase your weight and that can offset the fat you're losing and so all of a sudden you're stalling but are you stalling you you could still be losing fat and and not losing weight so that's an important uh important distinction and and something to think about mostly just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good uh exercise when and where you can go for walks and uh you know do resistance exercises um could be just body weight could be at the gym and try to go sprinting that's a fantastic exercise when you are exercising you will put on muscle you will put on bone you will put on weight and um but you also lose fat and so you you need to remember that's going to offset um offset all of that as well let me see here I'm just going to just check one thing how we're doing on time oh no um okay um why don't we say no more Super chats at this point um so that uh yeah so I'll probably need to to go around noonish so maybe we'll just do what's left and then and then call it a day um and benesh thank you very much for the super s ticker it's very kind of you um Ryan thank you for the"

        "body": "of the Q&A so Jason Brown thank you very much for the of the Q&A so Jason Brown thank you very much for the Super Chat thoughts on Dr mcdougall's the starch solution he's effectively treated thousands of diseases using a starch-based diet with positive results um I don't I don't actually know if I've seen that um you know it depends on what what else you're you're cutting out I mean there was McDougall the one that did like the rice diet where it was just like white rice and that's all people ate and they they lost weight and they reversed different issues but I mean uh those sorts of things at least that one I mean it's not sustainable you you talk to people that were sort of involved in those studies like it's completely unsustainable people hated it they were miserable um and um they weren't able to sort of continue the stuff at at home and um uh and so they they just all fell off of it as soon as they left um so yeah it's uh it's hard to say but you know what else are you cutting out you know that's that's one of the things that friend of mine Dr uh uh Chris Kenobi said um he argues a lot that that seed oils are really the big culprit here um I would say you know seed oils and fructose are very very major culprits um and and he he used if it wasn't mcdougall's it was whoever did the rice diet um and um and he was showing this was uh at least in that study I don't know if it's been replicated because that's important is it replicable um that at least in their study it um you know reverse diabetes and type two diabetes and you know help even though it's a very high carb diet really like when just eating just a buttload of white rice um you know they were I mean you can't I mean there's no nutrients in that though you I mean you can't you can't live like that you know so like uh but but a lot of these things it's just like one of the things is just you're cutting out a lot of things that are causing a lot of horm so he thought that it was largely to do with uh cutting out uh seed oils you know and there's a lot of these different places that cut out seed oils and they have a lot less disease and um and or no disease and um but you know in the rice diet too you know starch as well you're cutting out fructose you know fructose is is uh from the looks of it pretty harmful stuff and so um you know that's uh that's the question you know you're cutting out you know what is he cutting out as well and is that what's causing the benefit you I mean there's more than one ways to more than one way to skin a cat uh but what's the most optimal way what's the best way what do we biologically optimized for uh in doing that it's uh it's not from starch anyway um but you know you can you can get good results by you know people go you know more Whole Food plant-based and they reverse a lot of their issues because you're cutting out so much garbage that is that is a major factor in causing harm but then there's literally the most rigorously studied diet on this planet is a high-fat meat-based ketogenic diet right so a carnivore diet with a side salad that's the most beneficial diet that's has ever been studied it's only study diet has been studied at such a high level with rigorous Interventional trials randomized control trials and it's showing massive improvements Mass massive benefits for multiple Health outcomes like diabetes like cancer like autoimmunity like Alzheimer's and on and on and on and on um so you know getting rid of carbs and eating a lot more meat and cutting out all this stuff seems to do good eating more starchy food but cutting out all this other crap relatively going to be good it's always compared to what right and so uh compared to a carnivore diet I doubt it you know I doubt that he's going to do better than a carnivore diet you know I people that do very clean plant-based diet or very clean omnivorous diets and they they get they still get very sick and they have very serious autoimmunity um and then they cut out the plants all go away right and um you know Inuit um descent uh People First Nation up in Canada one lady she's been eating corn of her whole life that's a cultural thing and her daughter just could not have any plant because you get seizures you get very unwell as a kid and um and so they just ate meat for you last 40 plus years but she had you know she's like 60 years old and she looks like she's 35 and maybe and um and but she was eating spices and she had a lot of seasonings and spices on the meat but otherwise just meat and she had four autoimmune diseases it wasn't until she cut out the spices that those autoimmune diseases went away so just depends on the person depends on the problem and depends on what you're comparing it to so the star solution as compared to a standard American diet sure you know there's probably going to be a lot of objective benefits to doing that is that going to be the best thing that you can do though that's the question is it going to be better than eating our naturally evolved diet that's the question improving someone's diet is going to improve their health 100% get rid of processed food get rid of that crap um get rid of the seed oils get rid of the sugars and all that sort of stuff definitely going to help um is that the only thing that's going to help no is that the best thing is it going to help the most that's the question and so um that's that's uh you know what I would argue is uh more important question to ask is uh what's the best diet that we can possibly do what's the optimal thing for humans to do and I don't think it includes starch carnivore nurse Kim thank you very much for the"

        "body": "glad they're gone basic X thank you very much for the glad they're gone basic X thank you very much for the Super Chat uh Anthony love what you do one thing bucks me you Advocate natural and evolutionary appropriate diet are you on HRT if so not important to share uh no I am not on HRT uh in fact I have never put anyone on uh trt like testosterone placement or you know women going through menopause and they they want to go on that sort of stuff um I've inherited a lot of patients that have been on HRT or or testosterone placement therapy um I have not put anybody on them I always ask them to try a carnivore diet first and for my patients the male patients they all improve their testosterone and like I said I have 72-year-old patient who um you know slammed up his test like literally tripled his testosterone levels went from these are Australian numbers so a typical um you know a good range for um someone who in their mid 20s a man in their mid 20s uh you know in good health their testosterone level be between 600 and 900 for Australian numbers and his was you know was like 200 220 or something like that so quite low and but you know 72 so like yeah well that's just what it is is and so you know some doctors would say okay well you're symptomatic we'll put you on testosterone if you want it and I just said hey why don't you try this instead and he went on it and he um like in three months three or four months he went from like 220 up to like 750 right so he like over tripled his testosterone he's out there in the middle of the range that You' expect healthy 25-year-old to be and he's 72 and when he came in there he said he's like I feel like a teenager I just tons of energy all I want to do is work out and have sex with my wife I just like this kid again um which is great maybe not I tell that to to um older women they're like well not good for the wife you know they looked horrified by it but you know if she's doing it too maybe that that um you know made her happier about it as well um but no I get people off of trt I don't put them on it um most patients that I have that have inherited uh who are on testosterone replacement therapy I try to talk them into going on a carnivore diet to improve their hormones and quite often you'll see their testost same dose their testosterone levels just creeping up and up and up and up and up and up and DHEA creeping up and up and up and up and up and you're like okay well let's start ratcheting it down ratcheting down ratcheting it down a lot of times we can take them off and uh that's what I've been able to do and some people just feel so good they they just they say well do I have to be on this stuff it's like no of course not you know if you feel good and you want to try this on your own just come right off and so one guy um actually seemed that the testosterone replacement was actually suppressing his body's ability to make make enough and it was actually slowing him down because he'd been on Carnivore for six months he said he felt amazing he wanted to try come off so I like okay great well let's take you off and check you again in two months and see where you're at his testosterone again Australian numbers was 450 so you know even with trt it wasn't even in that 25y old range and then when he came off of it two months later it was 650 so it jumped up 200 points by stopping the testosterone replacement so no uh no you don't need to take that stuff and I don't recommend it to people uh when they're starting this when I have when I see people and they they come in and their testosterone's low I said okay well look we need two data points you know we can't just this could be an off test it could just be that you know how it was taken it could be a lab error you know we need to check this again in that time you go on this diet and here are all the reasons why you do we check it again it's double or triple what it was job done you know you don't need to put them on anymore and so uh no my um you know my Approach is to do this naturally for people and not put them on that and t hat includes myself Tyler a wise guy thank you for the"

        "body": "hat includes myself Tyler a wise guy thank you for the hat includes myself Tyler a wise guy thank you for the Super Chat do you know if the diet carnivore diet can cause high heart rate for the first month um it you know I I've spoken to people and it's and it has caused an increase in their heart rate so it's just gone up a bit typically not over 100 so maybe it's like people that you know track this stuff pretty regularly it's like well it's normally like in the 60s or and now it's in the 80s or now it's in the 90s or something like that so it's up for them but it's not necessarily like act like you know clinical tacac cardia right um so you know it's um that you can see but I don't I don't think that's a big deal you know when your heart actually optimally runs on ketones as well uh as your brain right so it's um when you start going on ketones all of a sudden your heart starts beating better so maybe that increases the rate a bit often times people just feel a stronger heartbeat that they can hear in their ears and that I think is probably because because of the ketones your heart running on ketones you're just going boom boom boom has big strong heartbeat you get used to that you know your heart your heart gets used to running on Rocket Fuel now when before was on crude oil um and so it's uh it's now just working a lot better and then it just sort of adjusts you know now it's using this really good uh efficient Fuel and it doesn't need to um you know it can sort of slow down this these comp compensatory um processes that it may have gone through in order to uh get the get the job done with what you were giving it before which was glucose um if you're getting a heart rate over 100 you should get that checked out you should get like an ECG EKG and um you know get it checked out to make sure that it's not something abnormal a carnivore diet won't cause that but something else can cause that and maybe this can unmask something else that's underlying um or you know it could be you know coinci that something comes up at that time um caffeine can increase your heart rate all these sorts of things as well so keep that in mind and you can be much more sensitive to um much more sensitive to caffeine as well um uh when you go on a carnivore Diet also so yeah you know and if you but if it's a regular pattern regular rhythm regular uh rate as in under 100 even if if it's a bit higher for you I wouldn't worry too much about it if it's an irregular pattern irregular Rhythm and and over an irregular rate so over 100 or under 60 best get that checked out and just to you know just to have that piece of mind that everything's okay or if there's something else going on you sort of investigate there's potassium higher low um almost never will be I've never ever seen that um I've seen one guy have a low potassium but it wasn't even all that low wasn't symptomatic or anything like that so I just said just te check it again and uh and see what that is it could just be you know an a lab error sure enough it was um you know it was dead in the middle of the normal range so you know on a repeat test you know a few days later so you know it's not something you typically see people get derangement of their potassium which could give you an IR irregularity like atrial fibrillation but generally atrial fibrillation is not only a fast beat it's in regular beat it's irregularly irregular there's no pattern to it it's just this wild random uh set of Beats so you know if you're getting something like that certainly get it checked out and um you know check your pottassium and things like that so uh yeah but no typically it won't cause tacac cardia it shouldn't cause tacac cardia anyway but if it's h if you are tacac cardic do get that checked out because there could be something else underlying Dr good thank you for the"

for all the super chats very kind of you and I do try to answer other questions too but obviously have to prioritize the the super chats um so thank you again everyone um for that so Preston says hey Doc almost finished with day one carnivore doing it to put my bipolar into remission I'm 24 6'3 195 pounds exercise 5 days a week my meds are 50 milligrams of cakil th000 milligrams of uh Depot and any advice for labs for or getting off of them with carnivore um I don't think you necessarily need to do any particular Labs um I just think you're doing great I think it's really great that you are giving this a try and um you know seeing what other people are doing I mean this has been you know shown at by you know Professor um Chris Palmer Professor Georgia Eid over at Harvard to be very beneficial to bipolar and other mental health issues so um but it's certainly not accepted mainstream yet uh because it's not even known about mainstream yet and so I'm really glad that you were you're brave enough to give this a try and try to help your situation and I really hope it works for you and I'm sure it will I'm sure it will help significantly and hopefully it gets rid of it all together um really the main thing to do is the diet right so just high fat meat just water that's it really cut out everything else except your your meds um if you need to be on meds you need to be on meds um I I can't help you with sort of how to get off those things it's just going to be when you're feeling stable enough and you're not having uh the issues that you you would normally have with bipolar syndrome um bipolar disorder then you start thinking about okay you know do I need to be on these medications anymore be stable for you know a couple months before you start thinking about this and then talk to your doctor and say hey look I'm feeling great I've cleaned up my diet I'm exercising I feel really good I'd like to try coming off these things can you help me with that these things often need to be reduced very slowly and carefully under the supervision of your doctor and so that's that's the way you would do it um exercise is great especially Anor robic exercise so lifting weights doing sprints those sorts of things you know you want to you know walk and Skip straight to sprinting from walking if you can um and so you know but that high-intensity exercise is really important it's really helpful to your brain health and your body it actually increases brain derive neurotropic factor bdnf and that can help uh restructure your brain and make more synaptic um connections and improve as well as you go the mitochondria in your brain and the rest of your body will not only improve in function and character but in number so after 3 four months you should have four times the number of mitochondria and they'll be four times as effective which would make a massive massive Improvement to both your mental health and your physical health um as far as labs are concerned you know I think the some of them may be just academic you know you check your testosterone levels you sort of check and see what you know your your normal hormones are doing just like your testosterone and things like that um you could check your thyroid sometimes people having low thyroid that can contribute to mental health issues um these should improve but if you're very low on like thyroid side of things you know it may be that you're low enough and you have a have a significant problem that you know maybe um some thyroid medication actually would help with your with your uh recovery and your mental health issues but I think the most important things would be things like B12 and vitamin D zinc magnesium those sorts of things and uh just understand that the reference ranges that we use as doctors or in the labs are the average for the community there are not the reference ranges for good health or Optimal Health most doctors don't know that and so you go to your doctor and everything's all the numbers are black they say you're fine everything's a normal no you're not fine not necessarily so for B12 for instance I have yet to see a single reference range anywhere in the world that actually includes even part of what I would consider an optimal reference range for B12 so almost everybody's going to be deficient in B12 um at this one most people are deficient in B12 and that's why the average range shows deficiency because most people are deficient and so that's what you're seeing the reference range is say yeah you're right in the reference range right so I'm deficient that's what that's saying so if you're normal for B12 you're deficient that's that's a good rule of thumb so in America an optimal range would be around 1100 to 1600 for most people right and then in Australia New Zealand uh UK and probably Canada because it's its Commonwealth is um 800 to 12200 and Below 4 400 in those countries is is is a severe deficiency where you can get demin of your nerves your axons of your nerve cells right you get brain damage nerve damage in America it's under um 540 is I believe the conversion so that's a critical deficiency so if you're in that critical deficiency get a shot you know that's that's not something you want to sit on um and then you at least know you know adding in a bit of liver a bit of kidney and and other organs you know that can that can help catch you up because when we start a carnivore diet most everyone is deficient in a lot of nutrients and um vitamin D is a hormone it's very important for your brain and your nervous system as well and so you know if you don't have enough of this and most people don't um you know this can this can cause problems right you're going to get this from meat you're going to get this from animal fat especially good quality animal fat um it doesn't have to be grass-fed and finished but that is better fat that is a better nutrient profile if you can't afford it you can't have access to it don't worry about it eat the best quality meat that you can uh that you can afford that you have access to that taste good makes you feel good um and um you know sometimes just add in you know a bit of liver if you want to because that can be very nutrient intense you don't always have to most people will get enough nutrients just from you know Safeway beef right or or Tesco beef or Kohl's beef depending on what country you're in and um so if you um if you're just eating you know just beef and eggs and all these sorts of things you're going to be you're going to be massively improving your nutrients and you'll catch up eventually it just may take a little longer than if you add in a bit of organs early on pastur raised eggs instead of normal eggs they're twice the price but they've got 20 times the folate and other sort of micronutrients are improved as well so it's uh it's more bang for your buck anyway and so uh something to think about you know just maybe like that's that's what I would check is if you have very severe deficiencies you know like like B12 in that critical range probably good to get a shot you know of methyl cobalamin which is the methylated form of B12 which is the one you want and um if you can't get a shot then you know under the tongue ones hopefully without sugar or sweeteners in it um you need to catch that up you need to get those levels out of those critical range es because those critical defici those critical ranges can cause deficiency that can actually cause neurological damage and damage to your body and your brain um can be reversible but you can also get you know serious damage that can take a long time to reverse or maybe not even reverse so you know that's what I would suggest otherwise just eat meat uh eat fatty meat be happy cut out everything else and then be very careful about coming off your medications do that with the doctor's supervision and only when you're ready for it okay good luck with that Preston I'm really glad to see that you're you're going to give this a try let me know uh when you're yeah when you're you know sort of a few months on with it and let me know how you're going because it's it's something that everyone can uh be helped with you know it's really important for people to know how people are doing um thank you all everyone uh for coming on I really appreciate it um do remember that uh the regenerate Health summon is coming up um this month um in a couple weeks actually so it's on April 21st which is a Sunday and um you can go to regenerate um a us.com and um uh for for tickets there I believe there are some tickets left but um they are uh they are running out so if you if anyone's going to be in the Melbourne area that weekend or wants to come down um that's where we'll be and um Dr pran yoga Nathan will be there um as well as Max Gohan Dr Max Gohan and um um and Mr arnet from uh you know arnet crackers and and biscuits and things like that and he's gonna be talking about regenerative farming and um and I am and and I think Jalal will be there as well he was a speaker last time and I'm I'm pretty sure he's gonna be there this time as well but anyway it's gonna be a great lineup I'm going to be going on uh a lot of rants about my feelings on the on the healthcare system and and why it's so screwed up and how we can fix it um and so if people want to see that they they can see me there and then uh on the phc uh Public Health collaboration in the UK that's another conference that's going to be in London next month in May so that'll be um in London May 18th to the 20th and you can see the link down there as well it's phc.org and um we can see that there so thank you all very much I really appreciate it um it's great to see everybody there please do comment below you know we talked about you know different people with um you know coming from a plant-based diet and coming um you know to this way of eating if that was you why'd you do it and and what were your benefits what were what were the different things that you saw from that I think it's really important that we know about this you know because there are very good people that are that are being duped into doing what they think is the right thing and with absolutely the right motivations and um and they're being prayed upon and so I think that it's important for for people that have gone through that and and come around the other side to talk about that and um you know comment and let people know how uh their experiences went and how they're doing now and uh so if you could please do leave a comment below and let people know your thoughts on that and your experiences as well uh because I think it's it's very important for people to know about thank you all very much I really appreciate it I will see you in two days for my uh next live event Friday morning for me Thursday night in America thank you all very much I'll see you soon and I'll have a Premiere tomorrow morning sort of the sameish time um maybe a bit earlier but anyway so uh anyway it will be tomorrow roughly the same time have my next premiere for uh YouTube um my YouTube uh uh Video new release will be tomorrow um around the same start time probably 9:00 a.m. maybe 8: 9:00 a.m. and um great all right we'll see you all then and um until next time take care"
