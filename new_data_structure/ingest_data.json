    "body": "brocker good to see you Beth um and thank you for the brocker good to see you Beth um and thank you for the Super Chat Beth asks what beef cuts are fatty enough on their own besides riy I'm getting tired of adding fat trimmings on the side well things like brisket uh the four quarter sort of chopped like the chuck steaks things in the front towards the animal that uh generally ends up being a fatter that fer part of the animal you can also get things that have like a thick fatty C like you get like a rump steti that has a fat uh a thick fat cap just depends on how the butcher cuts it so talk to your butcher just ask them to leave big Ridges of fat on things um and then that usually helps a lot and then so instead of you know trimming things off and putting in a bag of trimmings for you to have it just fats just still the meat and you don't have to it doesn't have to trim it off and then get the trimmings and then cook the trimmings it just comes with the steak uh but Chuck is really good for that and brisket is amazing for that so I know people um that even just eat brisket like steak they just cut brisket up into steak it's cheap as hell and it's very fatty and tastes good it's um you know some some it's just cat freaking out um sometimes the you people think it it's a bit more tough but if you're you know cutting it against grain and cooking it up um I haven't tried it myself but from what I've I've been told by people who have actually that's actually fine you know I mean it's not like you know like a Tender Loin or something like that but not not many cuts are so things with a bigger fat cap tell the butcher not to cut it off um brisket Chuck those sorts of things and and ground beef you know you can get your butcher to make a very fatty ground beef beef it's pretty good lamb chops are really uh very fatty too the four4 chops again that would be like the the version of the sort of the chuck steaks in um cow I think would be similar equivalent to the or like the shoulder chops things like that in in Lambs would uh be very fatty too and they taste good too and they're cheaper so those would be those would be some good good Cuts you can try try and other questions here um how to determ oh yeah and how to determine if it has enough fat if there's no nutrition label yeah probably isn't going to be on on a whole meat you because it's it's going to vary between cuts so um you just eyeball it and and you see how it affects you and you see by taste as well maybe you add some butter to that and um and also by you know your your your bowel motion so if you're you're getting dry hard stools and you need to up the fat so whatever whatever Cuts you're doing aren't aren't uh cut in the mustard and you need to add something more to that and so either getting more fat in the in the in the cut or or adding butter bit of fat trimmings things like that so Al leici a question is it is it okay not to eat fish how would you get Omega-3s well there are Omega 3's like DHA and EPA now it depends on the type of Omega-3 you know because you know people will tell you there like well there's there's Omega-3s in plants and it's like yes but that's like saying there's water in vodka you know it's like yeah it's not uh it's not really what you want or liquid in vodka vodka is a liquid therefore and water's a liquid therefore you know drink Vodka because all you need is liquid you don't need Omega-3s you need DHA and EPA which are Omega-3s but it's it's different you don't just any any omega-3 won't do you need these specific ones so there's ala and plants and that's not good enough it doesn't doesn't do anything uh for your brain maybe like a 5% conversion at most but some studies actually show that there's that you actually lower your DHA when you eat more ala so definitely not the the way to go so uh animal fat in general will have them will have DHA and EPA generally if they're eating what they are supposed to eat like a cow eating grass they're going to have more DHA you know a lot more DHA uh to uh the omega-6 ratio especially there was um something I saw from Dr Paul Mason in one of his lectures where he discussed uh study that looked at grain finishing beef and after three months in a feed lot so 90 days uh they seem to have uh very little Omega-3s if any after that so keep that in mind a lot of a lot of meat is grain finish now and um you know so depending on how long that that's that's uh done for it could be that have less Omega-3s but the grass-fed and finish will definitely have DHA and EPA um you can have little tins of sardines things like that um and other sorts of things but grass-fed tow if you add that grass-fed beef trimmings those things will all have DHA and EPA but yeah it's fine not to eat fish I hardly ever eat fish uh there are some people that I just saw um someone friend of mine interviewed someone about basically how we should really be eating fish and how important that was to like grow our brain um because of the the DHA and EPA in there farmed fish won't have any because fish get um fish up the food chain get their DHA and EPA from the other fish that they eat and so you take them out of the food chain and you start feeding them grain and rice pellets and soy and garbage like that there's no DHA and EPA in there so they're not going to get it they don't make it they get it from their their food supply too we don't make it either and so you need to get it up the food chain properly and when you dissociate your food from the food chain it's not as nutritious as it's supposed to be for us either so so uh keep an eye you know think about that don't buy farmed fish it's um it's a pretty nasty uh process anyway it's not really good for the fish it's not really healthy for them it's not really nice environment and um the meat is not good for you so it's certainly not nearly as nutritious I mean it's it's better than nothing uh it's better than plants but it's not it's not good and um so I would I would you avoid that uh and just get wild caught or just beef really if you can get grass-fed do but you know I don't think it's I don't think it's required for absolutely everyone especially because you know we're talking about coming from other ways of eating and you know any any port in a storm you know any meat is going to be better than every plant and so just get the meat that you can afford that you have access to and that you enjoy makes you feel the best and you know if you can add grass-fed butter that's going to that's going to get you some DHA and EPA grass-fed Tallow same thing so you know those sorts of those sorts of measures will really help as well okay Jonathan Davis had a question carnivore one month down 20 pounds and loving it awesome I have five kids and wife doesn't want birth control due to hormone issues what are your thoughts on vasectomy messing up my hormones or any other ideas it shouldn't mess up your hormones unless they you know roughly manipulate your testicles or something like that and and maybe there's something to do with that I I I don't do those surgeries so I don't know if there's any sort of literature on that um being the case but if you were it would it wouldn't uh it would likely be just something temporary you know unless they really messed up and and damaged your testicles but it's it's just it's just cutting the you know the vast difference so there just a tube coming up from the the testicles and you just cut cut take out a big chunk so it doesn't just you know Rec you know reconnect uh very easily and then tie off the ends uh it's pretty pretty straightforward so um it shouldn't it shouldn't mess up your hormones though it just uh you know makes you sterile so that's uh that's up to you um if you guys want to do that and um you know it's understandable with you know the hormonal birth control there are other things non- hormonal iuds things like that copper coil that can have its own problems that can increase um you know menstration cause more U bleeding things like that and then there's the the weekly hormonal iuds like the Marina and the what's the other one the kylina say even less U progesterone in it and that's supposed to work locally but you know vasectomy is pretty you know it's pretty uh effective and it shouldn't mess up your hormones anyway so if that's the way you want to go I don't think that will will screw you up in that way um tell them to give you drugs to knock you out though I've seen that U some people say it's like it's not that big of a deal but um you know the ones I saw when I was in medical school did not did not uh not make give me any interest in getting that myself anyway um Sharon Francis uh has a question over from uh Facebook hi doc I'm full carnivore is it okay to eat a few berries per week blueberries r berries um I mean you can you know if that's what you want to do I don't just on principle that they have things in them that you don't want oxalates tannins these sorts of things sugar I don't want sugar not as much sugar and raspberries there are some in blueberries obviously or else they wouldn't be sweet and um and uh but there are these other things as well so you know if you if you want to do that you know and and you know just try it out I mean I would I would stay away from it for at least a month and then you add in just blueberries see how you feel and but really pay attention to how it makes you feel and feel and and to your health you itchy on your face or sinus issues or aches and pains or anything like that you just just keep an eye on it because sometimes people are affected in in subtle ways and sometimes unsettle ways so just be mindful of that and so you add these things back in and if you say oh okay well you know I like them and it and it and I don't feel worse and uh I feel fine then you know fine if you continue to do that and you have more and more that that's going to build up and I think that that's going to be you know a net negative uh but you know if you want to and you that fills you with joy then go for it they will have things in it that that aren't good for you um which is why I just avoid it because you know I I I separate out you know my entertainment my you know my my my pleasure reward sort of uh you know uh activities from from eating like I love steak I've never I've never not enjoyed a steak but you know that's not why I eat it I don't eat steak because it's enjoyable I I eat steak because it's U food and I want the nutrition I want the food um you know so blueberries raspberries you're going to have some of these little things you're going to have uh you know the different antinutrients they're going to block out different absorption different things that you you may not want to do and have bits of little toxins the more you have the more toxins you'll get and um just but see how it makes you feel you know and if you if you like them and you enjoy them and you don't you don't see that it makes uh too much of a difference and you know that's perfectly up to you um just remember that in the while we a we wouldn't have have been having berries and fruits that were this sweet raspberries aren't that sweet but you know blueberries and things like that and other berries cherries those are things are very sweet and and we would only have them seasonally and locally and we'd be picking them ripe if you pick them green which almost every commercial uh fruit is picked green then it's going to have a higher concentration of toxins and you pick it or separate from the plant it's stuck there in the pl in the fruit it can't go anywhere it doesn't just break down into deg grade the plant has to pull out those toxins and when the seeds aren't ready it has more toxins in there to stop things from messing with it so just remember that you know so if you were going to have blueberries raspberries I'd still try to do it in a more ancestrally appropriate sort of way like if you had you know blueberries at your house in your garden I sort of eat the ripe ones and then you know for the few weeks that they're around and uh and that's it and uh and otherwise just you know just eat the animals that come in your yard maybe but um uh uh that's you know that's my opinion on it but you know you're free to do whatever you want you know I I think I feel much better when I don't touch anything else I mean even like Pepper or like you know some garlic seasoning or something like that at a restaurant it's like I just feel far better when I avoid all of that stuff and um so I do on principle and uh and and I don't I don't worry about it I don't think about it because it's not something I want and the thing is when you start dipping in on things saying well maybe I'll have a bit of this well that's okay maybe I'll have a bit more maybe maybe this other thing I'll have two or maybe this other thing I'll have two maybe this other thing I'll have two it's a slippery slope and then because you're introducing these things slowly but surely it's sort of a buildup and you don't necessarily see how how negatively it's affecting you and until all of a sudden you're just sort of in the middle of it and you're back eating all all sorts of stuff and then you're not feeling great you like oh how did I get here um so just be careful because that happens too",

    "body": "Remy Hogan says doctor Lions as other carnivore animals usually eat their whole prey raw they eat the bones as well which contain calcium so uh is eating only the flesh enough assuming one eats only meat so I don't think um lions eat much of the bones I don't think their jaws are strong enough I do know that the hyenas can can uh Jaws are strong enough to crack the bones and so there's one phenomenon that you see um you know where the Lions will go after the fattier parts of the kill and they'll but they'll tend to lead the the hind legs the you know the the hind quarters because they're they're very lean they're usually much leaner part of the animal and um so you know cats do well with with leaner meat they don't they don't need as much fat as we do but they do need some fat and um so they go for the more fattier parts of these animals which you know can can run pretty lean too but tend to leave the hind quarters uh the Native Americans tended to leave the hind quarters too interestingly enough I learned that when I was a kid and it sort of makes sense that they sort of stripped the high cour that was said at the time well they would leave this part as as an offering to the spirits and this that and the other maybe they did but um it just happened to be that the part that they left was the part that didn't have nearly as much fat and uh it was sort of dead weight you know you don't want to you know you're out in the middle of the woods hunting you've got to you know pack back you know 300 lb of meat you know you don't want to you want to bring the stuff that's just not as as useful and so you just bring back the more Choice parts of the animal and um so the Lions tend to leave those as well and then hyenas come in they'll eat that part and then they'll crack open the bones and they'll get it to marrow which is where the fat is so um uh yeah no meat is actually fine organs add to all of that um you know you can you can make bone broth and all that sort of stuff but you don't have to I mean there there are plenty of animals that are carnivores that that don't eat the bones certainly um some too I mean we're looking at like an owl like I mean it's it's it you know eats mice and then it just pukes out these owl pellets that are just all the all the fur and bones and things like that so I don't know how much of that uh of the the calcium they're getting out of that either but no you get you get plenty of this stuff you know and um I I don't think that lions eat a lot of the bones I don't think they they crunch them up bones and all um and they get plenty of calcium from from just the meat you know the majority of of bone growth happens after lions are weaned off of their mother's milk and onto just meat you know and a baby lion certainly is not crunching bones right and um and also where's the mother line getting the calcium to make the milk and um you know I yeah so I don't think they actually do crunch up the bones hyenas do um and they eat it raw do we need to eat it raw no not necessarily we've been cooking meat for at least 800,000 years if not 1.5 million years or two million years plus um so whatever happens to meat when we cook it we're well used to it cats can't do that they have to have torine and other um nutrients that are cooked out that are denatured when you cook meat and um so they don't do well on that they have to they have to have raw meat but we don't so yeah know just eating eating the flesh is is great um some people because of absorption issues or from you know having you know MTHFR uh or something like that may need a bit more organs or maybe the meat that you're eating is is grain finished and it's not as healthy as it could be and so you know it's not wild Mammoth anymore and so you know you might need a bit more of the nutrient density from something else to make up for that fact if you're eating Wild game and you're eating regeneratively raised grass fan and finished beef and lamb the muscle means probably everything you need when I was just eating Costco beef and I checked my my nutrient levels after SE after a few years on Carnivore I was I was actually in optimal levels for all of these things um and when I when I check people and check their blood work I mean it always improves it just gets better and better and better but you know especially when you're first starting out you you are you are going to be nutritionally deficient you just are and so getting some more nutrient dense things like adding in a bit of liver kidney and heart little organs or whatever or taking dedicated supplement like very low on magnesium or something like that or extremely most people are exquisitly low on B12 to the point that the reference range is now the average for the the depleted population so if you're in that reference range for B12 you are low on B12 that's just a fact there was a study out of Oxford in 2008 they showed that for like P moles Pro leer such of UK Australia and other other countries apart from America that's their their numbers that below like 320 um which is fully within the normal range by the way there's a lot of things that say it's like if it's above 130 it's normal right um okay so below 320 or so they track people for over five years and they found that uh they their brains shrank by over 5% on MRI and they did they did annual MRIs so no that's not that's not an acceptable level of of B12 that's a that's a true deficiency you actually get demolation of your axons you get nerve damage you get brain damage you get brain shrinkage um and and that's half or more of the normal reference range so I do see people's numbers go up unless they have some that pernicious anemia some other reason why they're not absorbing things but which actually more common than people think U at least you know partial you know may not be fullon they just don't absorb anything but absorb very small amount but either way if you're in that level you should probably just get a shot I mean you should not keep yourself in that level you shouldn't just wait months for that to come up um and you should add in things like liver that have a lot of B12 in it early on and then you maintain that with your diet and you just make sure you say okay if am I eating just muscle meat is the muscle meat that I'm eating sufficiently D nutrient dense so that I'm getting everything that I need if it's not you're add in some organs that's it that's nature supplement early on you should probably should include organs um you don't need much just just a small amount and um but you know do do that and um and or use supplements because you will be deficient you will catch up on just eating muscle meat like you will but it can take while and so if you want to speed that process up and and feel better faster you know add in some organs add in add in a bit of supplements but you don't have to you know I mean what the the meat is far more nutrient dense than anything else you've been eating and it's not coming with all the anti-nutrients uh from from plants and coffee and things like that that will block out the absorption of all these nutrients so you're actually getting everything out of it uh that you need that makes a big difference you know there's a study with um oysters and they're just looking at zinc so this is so some of things that they ate it with blocked out the absorption of zinc but it's going to block out the absorption of a lot of other things too but specifically they were looking at zinc so oysters have a lot of zinc and so they gave people oysters and they checked their blood levels right afterwards and you know went up significantly right and then they gave uh people oysters with like beans or whatever and it only went up a quarter of the amount so it's 75% reduction in absorption so that's massive so just something that you eat this with all bang you're you're missing out on 75% of the nutrition and it's not just going to be zinc it's going to be a lot of other things as well that you're not absorbing properly uh even medications I had a I had a patient that was um taking her thyroid medications um after she had coffee and she was hypothyroid on medication she just wasn't absorbing and so I said okay you need to stop taking the coffee you just take your thyroid medication before you do anything else at least half an hour before you take anything else drink anything else just let your body absorb it and instantly bang up into normal levels you know so it was it's a it makes a big difference what you take these things with what if you drink coffee and you take you know uh different vitamins and minerals you're not going to absorb that um and it's certainly not going to absorb much of it and um so in that study with the with oysters you know they with beans only 25% of the rise right so 75% was blocked out but then they give them like tortillas I believe corn tortillas or something like that and it was Zero rise in their in their zinc so they absorbed nothing of the zinc right so it was it was um you know very telling you know what you eat the stuff with makes a difference and when you stop eating that stuff all rdas right it just oh you have to eat this much a day well do you have to eat that much a day or do you have to eat that much a day because you're eating with a whole bunch of other crap and you're not absorbing it right or you're not utilizing it properly and so when you don't eat it with all that stuff what about then you know you're taking a whole bunch of oxalates and other sorts of things that strip out calcium from your body you need a lot less calcium if you're not stripping yourself out of calcium and and you're actually absorbing this stuff so uh yeah if you find just eating muscle meat if you're early on and you're nutritionally deficient you know there there are go for the more nutrient-dense things to catch yourself up but you may not actually need to do that most people don't need to do that to maintain very good levels if not optimal levels so good luck with that and just eat what eat what makes you feel good uh as far as meat is concerned",

    "body": "hi Dr C 58-year-old Aussie female Aussie long-term carnivore nice no coffee for 20 days have toxo plasma Gandhi parasites um no gut symptoms but very fatigued no meds any tips how do they die I eat organic meat liver eggs thank you um jewels from South Australia well I'm I'm glad to hear that you've been doing this for a while it's great to see more and more long-term carnivores and and people thriving doing this um so you have sort of you know toxo or other sorts of parasites um and and it's not sort of shifting on its own I mean we do have a ner an immune system response to parasites that is there for a reason but at the same time um parasites have way of of dodging our immune system as well I mean that's we're designed to deal with parasites but parasites are designed to deal with us and our immune systems too so if you are not shifting this I I probably would look into um you know taking medications for that there's a lot of very effective medications that aren't really harsh on your system that work very very well they're very very safe and um and and can just clear the stuff out of you um it's uh I I don't know uh when this sort of picked up but you know you can have you can have these parasites in your body for years or decades and not notice it and it doesn't really you don't really know that it's causing a problem until at one point then you get a diagnosis so um either way you you know if this is if this isn't really clearing I would I would just I personally would go and talk to your doctor and talk to my doctor and uh and try to get on something you know go to a parasitologist someone who deals with this specifically and and get on a treatment regime you know to get this stuff cleared out it's generally pretty innocuous um treatments most of them and most of them are very very safe and they're used sort of all over the world for decades and they're very effective so that's what I would do um and that can hopefully get this out and you can get off and running and feeling great as a carnivore so good luck with that a question from uh Facebook four months in any help for estrogen well it depends on the person but I see a lot of of women make a lot more estrogen I've seen I've had several patients in their mid to late 50s who have come out of menopause and started having periods again and started making completely normal amounts of estrogen so you know just keep going with it just eat really fatty meat don't eat anything else just water and fatty meat salt to taste and um you know just remember that your hormones come from cholesterol so you know if you don't want you don't you want don't want to avoid the cholesterol you don't want to do things that lower your cholesterol and um because that's what your hormones are made of that's what your estrogen is made out of so you know just do that support your body as much as possible um there can be other reasons why your your body isn't making as much estrogen at at some point women are just going to stop making as much estrogen from their ovaries uh but just carbohydrates raise insulin insulin blocks the conversion of testosterone into estrogen when make testosterone first and that's turned into estrogen so you stop that and you you you raise your insulin you you block that and you mess up with your hormones so just getting rid of that should help but you know at the same time there can be other reasons why you're not making estrogen you know age I I don't think that that 40s or even early 50s is uh is the normal time that we should be going through menopause I think it's later than that um and I've seen that but um you know at some point you're probably not going to make uh normal amounts of estrogen at some you know I I I don't know of anybody in their 90s that are that's still um you know fertile and things like that uh So eventually that's going to catch up but at the same time um it it's a lot later than than we think so I would uh you know I just hope for the best and if your body is you know give your body the best chance that it can to to heal and and recover and uh you know and if it does it does if it doesn't it could be something else going on it could be that you just sort of pass that point that it's going to recover but um you know just check it every now and then and uh and see how you go a lot of women when they're still in fertility ages you know they'll see a lot of disruption of their period potentially within the first four or five months and then things sort of stabilize out some people don't notice any differences at all some people do but um just see how you go anyway and just just check and and hopefully y ours does so good luck with that",

    "body": "hi doc I hear you don't salt your Foods is that true um what are your reasons someone doesn't need to salt and someone does need to Salt yeah that's a good question I think early on people may need to Salt because when your when your insulin is high you know it's it's drawing in more more electrolytes in at the level of your kidneys so you're storing you're retaining more and your kidneys have to work harder to get out the appropriate amount of of salt and other electrolytes so when you go away from carbohydrates and your insulin levels start coming down you don't have fasting uh insulin that's way too high you know insulin resistance and you're not getting these insulin spikes and all these other sorts of things then the idea is that your your kidneys may be you know over over spilling these electrolytes and you may need more salt to compensate but just because but you know when you were born you didn't have insulin resistance and you didn't have insulin spikes because fetuses are in ketosis breastfeeding infants are in ketosis and so it's um you know even you know there is milk in there but you know then then um you know most people in the wild they're eating meat you know that was the traditional way of doing it Lions the same way so your insulin levels are going to start off fairly low you're not going to start off with insulin resistance and eventually it's going to creep up and creep up and I had you know your insulin should your fasting insulin should never be above nine uh you know if you know if above seven um and uh yet I see people with fasting insulin one one U gentleman was 44 yesterday and a couple months ago 72 you know so that's that's fasting right so all the time it's up there he didn't he wasn't born like that right so that massively elevated insulin that's affecting how many electrolytes are staying in or going out right but it had to work up to that so if his insulin just went to an inappropriate level and was just like storing all this stuff and and his kidneys didn't respond and to to maintain homeostasis and eliminate electrolytes another way he'd be dead because his electrolytes would be way too high and when your potassium gets too high your heart stops you know that's what lethal injection is you anesthetize people and inject them with potassium chloride and their heart stops right so that is um a known consequence of getting your electrolytes completely out of balance like that and then in exercise your potassium goes up to like sort of otherwise lethal levels which is a bit strange so you know we don't really know what the hell is going on with that but uh under normal normal circumstances other than that that's that's a that's a bad bad idea so his body had to had to get used to his insulin level going up to 72 fasting right so I can get used to it coming back down from 72 fasting and so your body's going to and actually his after six weeks his on a carnivore diet his fasting insulin went down from 72 to 35 massive difference and he didn't uh you know go the other way and and die from hyponatremia and hypokalemia and things like that so your body adjusts one way or the other some people in in Studies have suggested that they would spill out more salt than they than they uh was good for them and they needed to add a lot more salt in so I think that's an early thing um maybe down the track some people may have still have some electrolyte imbalances and things like that but you just check you know and you just and you see what that what's going on and you need to add in a bit more salt or potassium or magnesium fine do it most people are low on pot on magnesium anyway sodium and and um potassium are very tightly regulated because they have to be and um so but you know a lot of people are pretty low on magnesium so I just salt to taste early on I salted more the thought is is that we started adding in more salt when we uh started eating more agrarian crops and we needed more mineral salts there's a lot of long-term carnivores that the the real old school ones that called themselves zc or zero Barb before the the moniker of carnivore was was attached to this way of eating um they they uh didn't use salt and they they just didn't salt anything there's plenty of sodium in meat and um there's a lady Dana Spencer who's like 16 plus year carnivore and she started the Facebook group zerocarb health and I I like that one and zeroing in on health that's with Charles Washington because they're they're both great they're very EXP experien and knowledgeable and they're they're very interactive on there but it's also a very strict uh Facebook groups they just was like look you want to eat something else you do that but you don't talk about it you know because that just confuses people like this is what we do it's just meat it's just water you're not fasting you're not eating plants that's it that's what we do here you want to do something else go somewhere else um and I like that because I think that helps people a lot more and then you and you see Real Results you see people on on different carnivore groups and they're just doing all sorts of crap oh well I didn't really find this benefit I yeah because you weren't doing it right you go to those those ones that are really strict they're just meat only water and they have they have they have the most incredible results and so you know it does make a difference and so that's that's what that's where you go if you really want to see real results but uh they don't use salt and Dana posted uh just recently a post about the sodium content in meat you know per ounce or whatever there's plenty there's plenty of sodium in there and so we and again we we we we create homeostasis in our bodies and and retain the amount that that we need so as long as you have some Supply uh you should be fine my taste just ran that way so I just salted to taste early on you might need a bit more salt because of the reasons I mentioned uh but eventually your body is just is just there and and so I just wanted less and less salt so salting to taste became less and less salt until finally I didn't really want salt sometimes I put some salt on there sometimes it might be salt on there from a restaurant um it's a bit weird because you know if I if someone else is cooking and they put salt on things or we get uh you know meat from you know from a restaurant or something like that there's almost always salt on it and so it generally tastes too salty but then I go back and some tastes not salty enough it's like that's a bit weird but yeah I I tend to not use any salt and uh and tend to prefer it when there's no salt on things like if I get meat from a restaurant now it just tastes way too salty um so but that's just but still though just salt to taste you know I think that's that's perfectly fine uh be more mindful of it in the beginning when you're transitioning and um and uh otherwise just you know if your if your body doesn't want salt you don't don't need salt there are reasons and arguments on why you don't want to have salt so just you know take a look at those Stanley is a guy named he's sort of nicknamed The Bear he was like a 50 plus year carnivore white guy and he was the the sound engineer for the Grateful Dead for just years right and um yeah I don't know so he did a lot of LSD and only ate meat so I don't know it's a bit of a unique character um it would be great if he was around he apparently died in a car accident unfortunately was very sad but um he he gave a lot of knowledge because he was doing this for a very long time and um and he talked about salt and how it's like actually you don't want it it's not necessary in a lot of different ways and and um and sort of thought it can make you eat you know overeat and eat too much and um be a bit addictive like you know sugar and things like that so there are definitely arguments out there that people you can go find and look at I just go by taste and um and yeah so I don't I don't salt very much anymore anyway well I don't really add salt to anything myself um but so the salt that I would get would be from someone else salting it if I'm if someone else has prepared it or if we're at a restaurant that's pretty much it but that's how my tastes run it tastes too salty if I had any salt so that's just me you probably might run that way too who k nows just see how you go",

    "body": "Tina says lost 80 pounds on mostly carnivore leptin is under seven uh is is this why I stalled uh still at 190 for weeks well first of all that's fantastic 80 pounds is is amazing um you saying your leptin is under seven or over seven um usually the higher leptin is uh can be a reason for for slow weight loss but you know when and it it depends on units because I I don't know where you are so um I don't know if those are the same units that I use but um in any case elevated leptin can be a sign of a slowed metabolism and it can be a slower start a slower burn if you've already been losing a lot of weight that's probably not what's holding you back because your left is just going to keep dropping and dropping the longer you're on a carnivore diet um could be other things in it you know anything slip back in any dairy artificial sweeteners uh berries other sorts of things just you just dairy in general certainly milk uh because of the the lactose or even yogurt and kefir and those sorts of things just cut them out just cut all of that stuff out just go right down just fatty meat and water add a bit of organs in there your body wants nutrients it doesn't want calories calories come along with the nutrients and so uh you can think of it that way so if you're eating more nutrient dense things you tend not to be all that hungry as long as you're getting enough nutrients um salt that's another one people argue that salt can actually make it so so you uh overeat and you eat more than you actually your body actually wants so I don't know the veracity of that but that's certainly uh something that's spoken about um and uh there are a lot of other reasons too like if you're uh exercising which you you ideally should be you're going to put on muscle you're going to put on bone density and that's going to offset the fat you're losing so don't worry as much about the weight as as much as your body composition and how you feel first foremost so just number one how do you feel are you feeling good are you feeling healthy number two very distant number two body composition you know are you losing fat but gaining muscle that's what you want that's the ideal and so you may look different your clothes may fit differently and if you got a dexa scan it may may show that there's a significant difference and um and then basically nowhere on there is is the scale because it's not important because what's important is your body composition and your health and so I would just keep going with it remember this is a long-term game this isn't just this isn't just a crash diet and then you go back to doing what you're doing you're doing this for life because this is the healthiest thing for you to do for the rest of your life so you just do this and you let your body go the way it's going to go any little cheats any little additions will screw you up promise you that you know I see this in people all the time that struggle with their weight and they're doing really really well and they're really just eating meat they're having a little bit of this they're having some nuts or maybe a little bit of whatever and it's not until they really just cut everything out that they actually go keep keep losing weight so you really just have to cut absolutely everything out everything even vegetables especially vegetables they're disgusting and um you know I lost 23 pounds as soon as I stopped eating vegetables and started eating more meat and that's another thing too are you eating enough are you eating enough fat if you're chronically undereating or you're fasting or doing these sorts of things because everyone tells you you have to not eat fat if you want to lose fat you want to not eat all that much you want to be in the chloric deficit just throw all that nonsense out that is that has not worked ever in history why would it work now just eat what you're designed to eat eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good this will encourage your metabolism will ramp up your metabolism and your body will say like we don't need this excess fat and we'll we'll let it go now so uh and I've seen people do this they've tracked their calories they've tracked their intake they've tracked their fat content and they've tracked how much they were eating and they tracked their weight and when they started reducing their uh what they were eating they could actually put on weight because their body slowing down the metabolism so they're saying hey look we're in a famine and so we need to actually store things we're not going to use things we got to store them because you know may get to a point that we're that we're uh stuck and we need this and then they started eating more and weight started coming off fat started coming off so it actually does matter your metabolism actually does matter it's like oh the law of thermodynamics we're an open system we're not a closed system there's not in a vacuum humans don't exist in a vacuum and a calorie is not a calorie because we don't burn these things first in formal so the entire principle is flawed you you're not burning these things so it's oh this energy if this heat is idiotic right you can have all the energy stored up in these chemical bonds and just not absorb them and just crap them out what do that do right so oh but the law of thermodynamics is in the toilet all right so you know this is this is not applicable um that's something that just people just latch on to so they can sound intelligent well but the law you don't know what you're talking about it's not applicable to the system and we're not a bunson burner so we're not burning things we're not burning calories and producing energy as heat um so eat fatty until it stops tasting good don't eat anything else and um and do work out you know because high-intensity exercises anobi exercises resistance training sprinting will help you lose fat it will put on muscle though and so you will you will offset the scale so be as strict as you can eat as much as your body's telling you to eat until it stops tasting good because that's how you know that your body doesn't want it anymore is when it you get that bite it just tastes like cardbo board then you move on with your day and and exercise and then don't worry about the scale worry about your body composition and your health first and foremost and you know some people after years and Decades of harming themselves with different ways of eating and starving themselves they're not going to get necessarily get back to their the body shape that they had when they were 16 um so it's uh it's just one of those things but your body will will do wonders and so just put it in the in best position possible possible to do just that and and you'll do fine and you'll be very healthy as a result so good luck with that",

    "body": "hey Dr chaffy I'm starting carnivore my trainer has me drink a mass gainer for muscle growth within 30 minutes after what are your thoughts about how to replace that on carnivore or do you have a certain product to use uh steak just fatty steak cut up you know just cook up a big big fat ribeye something like that put some butter on it cut it up into chunks take that with you to the gym soon as you finish just eat it you know you just get that right away it's it's everything that you need the mass gain is a bunch of carbs and sugar and that sort of [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah you'll gain Mass you you'll gain mass in a fat ass it's just G to it's just arbs it's just going to put on fat you're not going to put on muscle like you will put on muscle you know but it's not going to be because of the carbs like you'll put on muscle because of the work that you did and the protein that that you eat um you know you you do raise insulin insulin does put uh carbohydrates as as well as protein into your cells but you know what you already have insulin and protein does give a bit of a bump of insulin as well for exactly that reason and so you know the idea that just oh if you don't eat protein with carbs and you're just not going to get the you're not going to get enough insulin put in get to your protein in your cells like who told you that uh what was that where where was that written down that's missed that day on biochemistry class I guess it's complete another nonsense you know so I mean what 70% of animal species are carnivores and they I guess they're just not they're just not getting any protein because they're just they're not eating with carbs um that's nonsense so you don't need carbs in order to build muscle in fact it's counterproductive because you're just putting on fat as opposed to muscle and you're getting intramuscular fat you're getting uh more glycogen storage and deposition and water retention as a result of that so you look more bloated you look more bulky but that's fat water and glycogen it's not muscle you know so if you want to put on lean muscle mass you just eat meat you just eat fatty meat and uh yeah absolutely so the same thing that you'd eat at any other time you eat then right so if you want to if you want to you know the you call like an anabolic window straight after uh working out and some people say that that's a thing some people say it's not a thing I don't really care one way or the other if you find that you like doing that and you and it benefits you do it I I you know I think of it you know and uh I I don't think it's it's farfetched from an evolutionary biology point of view because you know when are you maximally abser exerting yourself as a carnivore when you're running the hell away from something fighting for mating rights or hunting and trying to physically dominate something and kill it that's when you're working the hardest physically and so what happens directly after that big large exertion you get your kill you eat your kill you know so maybe there is something to that um either way I don't think it's it's unnatural to eat directly after you work out for that exact reason and so you know if that's what you want to do then do it but just do it with meat always do it with just fatty meat if you're in a stretch and you're in a bind and you and you just don't have access to that at that moment there are proteins protein powders that only have animal proteins like whey protein or egg protein or beef protein that um that I I have one of them um I I think I've used a quarter of it over the last three four years something like that and it would be for exactly that reason like I just worked out and I wanted to go and I want and I didn't have time to eat I had to go you know back into the hospital I had to go you know do something and I was like okay I'm just going to I'm just going to and grab some protein and then get on with my with my day um and that's it but I I wouldn't do any other products of that I just eat meat really you know you can get you can get those protein shakes that don't have anything else um but I would really make sure they don't have anything else you know so some things that have whey protein and that's it that's a single ingredient um or you know egg protein that's it single ingredient beef protein icelet that's it single ingredient if it has more than one ingredient besides animal protein don't get it they tend to cost more even though there's less in it don't know why probably just because you know there there's not as much of a market for it and so people are willing to pay more but there aren't aren't as many available but in any case you just eat meat if you're planning ahe and you're planning on having this muscle Gainer and all that sort of stuff you know just just just bring a steak just bring chopped up steak just eat crush it down and uh and you'll do great you'll you'll you'll SL on muscle you you'll uh uh yeah you'll find it's easy very easy to to put on muscle actually more easy to put on muscle now than ever before um if you're working out hard is making sure you're eating enough so eat right after sure make sure you're eating enough after that maximally until it stops tasting good you have to do that a couple times a day to make sure you're getting enough meat um or else you'll you'll miss it and uh you won't uh you won't build as much muscle as you can you don't you don't need to be in a caloric Surplus that's nonsense a surplus means Surplus to demand mean you're going to store as fat so again you want to put on mass fine but you want to put on muscle that's a different story so you don't need a surplus you need enough so you eat until it stops tasting good your body's going to tell you uh when I start working out I double my Hunger easily and so I'm eating like you know two 2 and a half pounds of very fatty meat a day and then I start working out goes up to four four and a half easily you know and um and that's that's pretty normal and when I do that and I'm eating enough slamming on muscle I'm at 44 and it's easier for me to put on muscle now than it any period in my entire life except 20 to 25 when I was also doing this exact same diet and um I was jacked and when I was down in um well before that when I was in Seattle I wasn't lifting weights as much but I was like my legs were like tree trunks just because of the amount of of running and sprinting I was doing and um and and I every now and then I would go do squats it was just like am I and I was squatting what was I squatting 495 I us sets of 10 it was just easy but it was like but my it hurt my back so much it was like I didn't use weight belt probably should have used the weight belt um but it just put so much pressure on my back and I was just like I couldn't do more weight than that because it hurt my back so much um and uh or put a lot so much pressure on my lower back which I've always had problems with my lower back um for whatever reason and uh but for my legs it was nothing it was nothing you know I could I could squat that easily so I use like sets of 10 and then I'd breast I do like four sets of 10 just from my sprinting workout I didn't I didn't squat much at all just every now and then I just would throw it in there but just because the amount that I was sprinting it was like six to eight hours a day I was just at a dead Sprint and um you know in interval right because break in between sort of drills and games and plays and things like that but uh massive massive gain then when I was down in in Arizona for a year uh and I was with friends that were you know regularly in the gym I started getting back into like a regular lifting cycle and so it was just like four days a week rain or hail it's never rain or hail in Arizona so that's easy um that uh that we were in the gym and I I got Absol abely massive I got absolutely ma jacked um so and now it's the same thing you know if I'm if I'm working out consistently and I'm eating enough you know I get absolutely very easy to put on muscle I just put on muscle very easy and you'll find the same thing eat enough to eat enough meat you don't need supplements or or products yeah you don't so good luck with that man you you'll kill it and hello from my sister Rosland hello Rosland nice to see you um there's another one here um so Rossa said highly valid about the part of the animal but there's also um the part where the intestines are humans may have been avoiding infection as well um don't know what that's referring to um highly valid about the part of the animal I don't know maybe we're talking about organs and and different sorts of things like that but yes I agree absolutely Rosland 100% and let's see so yeah um I don't know what that's referring to though sorry but good to see you",

    "body": "member says can I still try carnivore struggling because of lack of stomach acid uh because of Nexium for Hiatus I have diverticulitis to please help no you can you can definitely still do that the Nexium may or may not be as necessary as well because when you're when you're eating carbohydrates again your insulin goes up and what people don't understand when they talk about well this is a normal reaction you just eat carbohydrates your insulin goes up and that just drives the energy in cells this is a normal process and you can say that all you want but it's not normal at the levels that we're experiencing when we're eating exogenous carbohydrates because blood sugar is not supposed to go that high that is toxic to humans that kills us eventually that's what kills diabetics that's what makes their organs fail they lose their vision and they get their limbs chopped off and eventually die that's because of high blood sugar so no that is not normal at that level and then the insulin goes up to combat this because it's toxic at that level and then the insulin goes up to yes drive this energy into cells oh well that's normal no at levels down here that's normal levels way the hell up here that's very abnormal and things are going out of balance specifically because insulin doesn't just drive energy into cells insulin does over a hundred other things in your body that are very important and so when your insulin's at five which is very nice place for insulin to be it's affecting everything at a five and then you eat some pasta or bread it slams up to 35 and expecting everything at a 35 that's abnormal that's not good for you and then you get insulin resistance and all of a sudden you have you're fasting insulin is 72 like my patient a few months ago and his unfasted postprandial uh insulin is probably over a hundred you know so that's that's going to affect things very negatively one of the things that it does is insulin increases the acidity of your stomach acid so you can get a lot more reflux and problems um um you more reflux and problems with stomach acid and things like that the hiatus hernia that's a structural abnormality that can just make things you know so that things structurally are so that that you can have more problems and potentially get up back into your esophagus and regurgitate more easily and um but either way you know the neck seem is sort of offsetting that but when you stop eating carbohydrates it will actually go back to a more normal now it'll be still be very acidic but it'll be normally acidic it'll be it will be appropriate for our anatomy and physiology so even even if you have uh are on Nexium you can absolutely still do a carnivore diet you don't you don't have to you don't have to in fact it's it's still going to be easier to absorb and digest any meat than anything else because that's the easiest thing for us to digest you know plants don't get digested we just don't break them down we don't have the enzymes to break down cellulose no animal has cellulase it's the microorganisms that that eat the fiber and produce fatty acids and protein as result of that so it's um and um and so uh you know is perfectly fine uh to do that uh to to eat that on on a Nexium that's fine don't don't worry about that just eat meat eat fatty meat and uh until you know it's comfortable if you're getting a bit of upset stomach maybe eat a bit less and see how you go diverticulitis is you know that's what do you do for diverticulitis you go on a low residue diet anyway so low fiber no fiber so you can rest your bowel and that's what a carnivore diet is have you know very little of that is going to go out in waste and so you know you're gonna actually do a lot better with that anyway so yeah all these things are actually totally fine on a carnivore diet so good luck with [Music] that okay um all right there's just a a good good comment here from sir praise the sun uh where do lions get their Gatorade pre-workout and pancakes for carbs and how do they Sprint like I don't know that is a mystery of the ages um you know how they they they actually exercise without all the Pre-Workout and carbohydrates and car bloing and things like that I mean where they where do they get their glycogen I you have to have carbs for glycogen I mean it's it's impossible any other way um yeah you know how do whales you know swim for you know thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of Miles um and don't eat for eight months in a row damn it where are they getting their carbs there must be like big soy plantations down in the sea that we're just not knowing about so obviously yes a good good point uh people just don't I think they just don't like to think anymore I certainly taught not taught how to think anymore and sometimes taught not to think just no no no just trust the experts just trust the experts oh but not those experts no no no no just these experts the ones that we want you to listen to I'm like oh shut up you know you need to think for yourself if anybody's telling you no no no no no just blindly follow who we tell you to do you know that that's just mini Hitler they're just trying to gear up for totalitarianism uh they're trying to get you you geared up for that as well so you know don't don't talk to you know Baby Hitler baby Lenin baby Stalin baby Ma just just ignore their ass you know oh you need to listen no you need to shut the [\u00a0__\u00a0] up you know and I'll listen I'll do what the hell I want and I'll listen to myself thank you very much um sorry for swearing as I try to tell you guys I normally SW swear way too much so the fact that I'm I'm I'm being this good this consistently for this long I think I I deserve some sort of recognition for that maybe rosling can let you know just how rampantly I swear on a normal bas is so um you're welcome",

    "body": "hey Doc if we are true carnivores why are we able to metabolize carbs sugar or um develop the ability to do so in the first place thanks uh well look we weren we weren't always carnivores we had the ability to to eat these sorts of things historically and so does give a survival Advantage because we have we can eat other things we can survive on them um and when when you're looking at things in evolutionary terms you don't lose the ability to do something unless it confers a survival advantage to do so so because that's just that's just how that works because the ones that don't have that trait tend to die off and they tend not to have kids and so it's that trait that actually is a big survival Advantage so you know making having the ability to break down carbs and sugars and and absorb them is is uh you know an advantage to anybody because if you don't have that ability then you you're limiting more resources and um in a famine period you trying to eat something else you know that's not that great but you know pretty much any animal can absorb simple carbohydrates you know not all animals make amales but most of them do and um and so they can still break down starches some don't have amalis in their saliva but they can make it from their pancreas and either way uh they can they can absorb they can absorb carbohydrate simple carbohydrates like simple sugars and and there are carbohydrates in meat I mean there's glycogen in meat and and so you actually do get these things on a carnivore diet so you actually do need this stuff uh on a carnivore diet because there are carbohydrates that you're going to break down and absorb as well it's just not the mass quantities of these things that that we see in you know processed carbs or you know starchy vegetables and things like that or fruit you know very sweet um unnatural sweet fruit that we've we've uh arranged you know and bred and and intensively bred to be much more sweet so plenty of animals do plenty of carnivores do still have that ability we're no exception it does confer a survival advantage to to be able to eat potatoes and survive um it's just not it's just not optimal but also there are carbohydrates and meat and so you need that ability there too break down the gly and uh and certainly absorb the simple sugars and you know I mean look at you look at your cells I mean there's there are carbohydrate components to uh many proteins to many receptors to many parts of your cell to many parts of of the animal and so that's important you know that's important to be able to contend with that break it down and absorb it so yeah that's not actually abnormal um you know i' I've seen some things where they say that that you know like lions and big cats don't make amalis in their saliva but that doesn't mean they don't make it in their pancreas and I've seen other ones that said that they do so I I don't know about that I think it's generally generally accepted that they they don't but I have actually seen some that that said that they did so you know it's um either way it doesn't really matter if we have you had that ability because we were or biver before you don't lose that trait unless there's a survival advantage to lose that trait um but also I mean even herbivores I mean look at gorillas you know they're they're not eating carbs they're not they're not eating like roots and tubers and starchy vegetables they're eating fiber and that fiber you know amales won't break that down you know it won't won't do any of that it's um the bacteria in their gut that is in their in their hind gut which is their seeum which is very very very long or equivalent is the appendix because that was a survival advantage to lose that we did have a very elongated seeum presumably and then that shrunk down to almost nothing because that's very energy dependent and so we traded our gut length for our brain size and we needed more nutrient-dense food uh meat and so we that did uh give a survival advantage to lose that big useless gut that we we weren't using anymore um and so we have a much smaller one so they have a big hind gut and the bacteria eat the fiber because only bacteria and protozoa and these single cell organisms that can even make cellul a termites don't even make cellulases the protozoa in their gut that eats the the cell cellulose and produce cellulase and as a byproduct they produce saturated fat and then the microorganisms die off and they get absorbed as protein so do gorillas have Amala do gorillas have the ability to break these things down why they don't need it they're absorbing saturated fat and protein so it's the same thing you know we need fat and protein Lions need fat and protein gorillas need fat and protein and we get those from our food source that's really the main thing some of us have some amales some of us don't doesn't really matter you still just need fat and protein t hat's the main thing",

    "body": "member says GF been trying to increase meat girlfriends has been trying to increase meat but says she has low appetite for red meat and feels sick when eating only meat um even one meal any recommendations yeah you look we we're conditioned to think that this is really bad for us women especially have have um taken that to heart um and uh there some seems to be some sort of psychological reason for that that you know they're just more much more um much more likely there just much more coachable and people say this too it's just like you know when you're when you're coaching girls like they they really pay attention they really listen they try to try to do what you you tell them to do and like guys sort of do whatever the hell they want so you don't have as as much coachability in some guys and and so you have to you know that's why you know being being able to learn being able to be coachable is is uh is a good trait you know that coaches look for in young athletes um and so but you know girls women seem to have taken that and saying okay well this is bad for me I'm not going to do that okay makes sense and if believe that that's the that's the right thing to do uh guys are a bit more headstrong like yeah screw that and so I like it I enjoy it so I'm just going to do it a bit more hedonistic and um that can be good in this circumstance when you're being lied to and you're just let trusting your your Natural Instincts and the other side of it is that it could be very bad because you end up doing things that are bad uh in any case we train ourselves and condition ourselves to think that meat's bad and to think that um and to think that Fat's bad and we and we have a psychosomatic reaction where it just it it makes us physically ill I would get that in my late 30s when I knew that this was the right way to go when I would eat fat I just couldn't do it and I had to slowly work myself into it and so that that's what you do just ease into it you know it's uh just just a little bit more a little bit more doesn't have to eat if it doesn't taste good if she feels unwell don't eat that's fine your body's your body can can tell you that if if meat doesn't taste good you're not hungry and you'll eat a lot less you don't need nearly as much and so you just eat fatty meat till it stops tasting good if you can't eat big chunks of fat you you cut a small piece of that fat off put it with the lean meat eat that together and you say like okay that actually tastes good together and um and you can do that and you just recondition yourself and really decondition you know that programming you know that we had of listening to The Experts and never eat fat because Fat's so bad for you even though it has never been bad for us ever in human existence um and then the argument goes well but we weren't living all that long says who the Census Data didn't say that in the 1800s if you made it to adulthood you'd live that you know s very similar length of time that we live now it's just average life expectancy from birth was 38 in 1850 because the infant mortality rate was so high and 50 years later it was a lot higher than that because infant mortality or the total life expectancy from birth was a lot higher because it was um it was the infant mortality rate had had uh improved significantly and so um you know it's completely false all people were just weren't living long enough in the 1800s and before that to uh to experience these diseases like really have you have you read a book because they were written by people and some of those people actually have um biographies and you can actually see like how long they lived you know how how old was Mark Twain how old was Sam Adams when he died how old was was John Adams second president of the United States born in the mid 1700s died in the mid 1800s he was 91 all the founding fathers look them up they're all in their 80s and 90s when they died Ben Franklin was 64 when the Revolutionary War broke out and then funny enough I I seem to recall that the minimum age required to even apply for the job of President of the United States was 35 isn't that well that's funny if everyone dies at 35 that's funny age to set a minimum and I'm pretty sure we've had presidents in the 1700s and 1800s which is funny that because these these people are so smart and they know so much and surely they they'd look it up right and they'd understand that there's historical figures that we have clear documentation of that were much older than that and there's what was it Socrates is that who I'm thinking of who uh was in his 70s when they had to kill him and he was so sharp that it just pissed everyone off in Athens so they had to kill him by eating a plant by the way they made him drink Hemlock so I mean that's just nonsense that people weren't living long enough to um to experience these these diseases that's just ridiculous and I just spoke with a with a gentleman uh Dr Verma from India he's an Emergency Physician over in India and he said he treated a a boy who's 17 years old came in with a heart attack 17 yearold kid had a heart attack right vegetarian by the way vegan vegetarian and of this mostly plant-based Nation every says oh but and plants are so bad for us and meat is so good for us explain India India explains that you know 20 years ago the average person in India only ate five kilos of meat a year a year right I eat more than that in a week way more than that in a week you know and um and then in the last 20 years it's actually dropped down to 3 kilos a year right and the metabolic disease rate has actually sprung up in that time it's gotten worse right um he said something it was like 30% of people have metabolic Sy metabolic syndrome and disease and 30% 30 30% of people in India had diabetes full-blown diagnosed diabetes and this is very you know so a lot of people living rurally they may not ever get that diagnosis they may not have access to healthare so diagnosed diabetes 30% that's three times the diabetes rate of America is slovenly Americans who just eat a whole bunch of processed meat and processed foods and and red meat oh you know these guys are eating three kilos a year a year and a lot of them aren't eating any and 30% they have three times higher uh diabetes rates so it's just Flatout ridiculous that that people even make these intentions they're either complete Liars or just too stupid to to uh just too too stupid to to take any advice from anyway uh either way these are not people that you need to listen to if they're so flagrantly incorrect by either intentionally or because their brains don't work that like this is this is no one you want to take advice from anything else you know I mean people get things wrong and that's fine you know and and so you know I just I agree with some things that people say and I disagree with other things that they say um that doesn't mean that I hate them you know broke clock is wck twice a day you know but um but some people when they get these things so intensely wrong and it's so easy to look up it's um you know it's just like okay well what else are you phoning in you know like we just can't really we just can't really trust anything you say at this point like Ansel Keys the guy's a known fraud he was defrauding people for the majority of his his career when did that start when was he when did he start being a sellout I mean presumably had to do some good work in order to sell his reputation and integrity but when did that start can you trust anything he did because he's unscrupulous maybe he cut corners on other things maybe he just did things to publish them just so we could just so we could get some recognition fits the profile you know there people with Alzheimer's they say well this beta amalo plaqu that's what doing there's there's this there's a landmark paper that came out you know supposedly proving that showing that and turned out it was total fraud it was total garbage and that just came out last year so no that has nothing to do with it and they just defrauded people just so they could get the reputation just so they could publish a landmark paper and get their name on the map and um and you know get everyone tenure and everyone's all happy and patting each other's back and now they've got tenure so can't get rid of them but it's fraud it's absolute fraud and uh so when when did the fraud start with with anel keys who knows just don't trust anything he says don't trust anything he does and um you know and uh and the same thing with these sorts of things so long story short we've been conditioned to think something that is inherently untrue and we're getting psychosomatic responses as a result of that so just lead into it just just ease into it you know eat what tastes good stop eating when it doesn't taste good feeling a bit nauseous just stop you know if if she has to sort of do a slower transition and include some other stuff too just eating more fatty meat and less of the other stuff is already going to make a big difference and if you start easing into that and eating more and more meat and getting used to the fat you know eventually she might be able to just drop everything else you know but don't you know you don't want to force it you know because you know it might be that she just goes too much and goes no no no no no I'm not doing this and just mentally can't get her head around it and then you know might might just uh not really want to do it and not be motivated to do it so you know just it's okay it's okay to ease into these things too so good luck to to to both of you",

    "body": "member asks will intermittent fasting help me lose weight while on Carnivore um yes and no because the thing is is that most of the time you'll you'll naturally be doing something along those lines where you'll be eating in a in a shorter amount of window or maybe only once a day I typically eat once a day twice a day at most um if I'm working out especially and um so that that people say like oh well you're intermittent fasting you're doing that it's like well no I'm not because what fasting is is is intentionally withholding food from uh when you're hungry and you want to eat but you're like no I'm gonna I'm GNA I'm going to abstain that's what fasting is just not being hungry is just not being hungry you know if I'm only hungry once a day and I eat once a day and I'm fine that's not fasting but it looks like it it looks like you're intermittent fasting so that's so that's the the yes part of it the no part of it is if you're intentionally withholding food and you continually do that and you do that you know day after day after day you're going to slow your metabolism down and you can actually stall weight loss and again it's not weight loss it's fat loss that you're looking for you're not looking for weight loss you don't want to lose muscle and bone you want to lose fat and so if you lose fat but you put on muscle and bone you're not going to lose weight and so you need to remember that and uh quite often when people are having a stall it's not actually a stall it's that they're working out and they're replacing they're fat with the muscle and bone uh then you can do things like take OIC that horrible poison that's been foed across the planet um again to make billions and billions and billions of dollars the research on OIC for weight loss by their own estimate was that you'd lose weight generally because you felt so sick and just nauseated you couldn't eat and then after that after about two years that that uh those symptoms would go away your appetite would come back and because you just been eating just little bits of chocolate and candy the whole time because you couldn't stomach anything else um and you basically just starved yourself for the last two years now you have horrific eating habits and uh and your appetite comes back and then you eat a whole bunch of garbage and then you end up putting on more weight than you lost initially and the weight that you lost wasn't just fat what they showed was that a large portion of this was actually lean body mass was muscle mass and bone density which you just can't afford to lose at any point in your life especially when we get into to middle and late age uh but I mean kids I why would you Jesus why would you do that to kids so you use a lot of lose a lot of lean body mass and then so you're losing weight but you're not losing the weight that's healthy you're losing really un you're losing uh weight that is very unhealthy to lose and then when you put weight back on because you have such horrible eating habits you put on fat you're not getting back the muscle and bone you're just getting back fat you're getting back more fat than the muscle and bone that you lost so after two years people tended to regain more weight than they lost um so that's not good so it's not about weight it's about body composition and really it's about health so you just eat what's healthy for you and and the the body composition comes as a result of that and that just happens down the road that's a consequence that's a secondary outcome the prim primary outcome is your health that's what the most important part of this is and um and if you if you intentionally withhold meals and intentially withhold from eating you will slow down your metabolism and you can stall and you can actually start gaining weight eating less you know bariatric surgeons will tell you that like women in particular if they eat less than 1,200 calories a day they will not lose weight so they have to eat a minimum threshold to actually be able to for their body to actually let go and um and and and let go of that excess fat because they're they're storing it because like no we're going to die we need to save this and because we're trying to save you so your body doesn't know it's not a conscious being it just it just it's taking inputs right so the input is that there's no food available okay we're in a famine we're going to shut it down and so that's what's going to happen so no I wouldn't do that I would just eat until fatty meat stops tasting good if that's once a day it's once a day if that's twice a day it's twice a day if that's 32 times a day it's 32 times a day it won't be you eat until you get that bite that tastes like cardboard typically when people are losing weight that's one going to be once a day twice at the outside but just make sure you're getting enough enough fatty meat until it stops tasting good you generally won't eat all that much and you'll you'll look like you're intermittent fasting but you won't actually be fasting you'll just be eating when you're hungry and that's what you do and that that's the other thing you know when when you you do these tricks and gimmicks you're fasting and starving and doing all these sorts of things eventually you get to the end of it and you just go okay well something's got to change because this isn't sustainable or the OIC and you're losing weight and now your your appetite comes back and now what happens now your pattern of behavior and your and and how you're you're functioning is now in congruent with a healthy lifestyle whereas if you're just eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good you can do that at any day at any point at any stage in your life because at different times you're going to need more or less and if you're just listening to your body and eating until stops tasting good your body's going to tell you what it needs today it needs 4,000 calories tomorrow it needs 3,000 next day it needs 4,000 now it needs 2,000 now it needs 5,000 it doesn't matter it's going to change on different on different days if you're losing fat your body eventually gets down to a stable body fat percentage you're going to need more that's all there is to it because you're not you're not going to be going on your fat stores anymore you need to actually get more energy and and nutrients in to run your body and maintain your your body fat and so that's what you do and your appetite goes up and so by the time you get to that stable point now you're you have the eating habits and the lifestyle that are going to be conducive to perpetuate that right so that's really important to just uh lay down patterns of behavior that you're going to be able to continue and perpetuate for the rest of your life to continue to get maximal results and the most benefit out of um out of your uh out of your life and on your health voy",

    "body": "member asks do you need a multivitamin on Carnivore I've just been taking uh the off-the-shelf Costco multivitamin gummies for years not sure if I should stop or not been carnivore for only 5 weeks um so not the gummies don't don't do the gummies um you don't want the sugar you don't want the artificial sweeteners or whatever the hell else you know red 40 or whatever the hell else they they put in there that is just not fit for human consumption um you if you want to take a multivitamin you could some of these things are better than others some of these things are not really bioavailable so they say they have iron but there like iron filings you know it's like that's useless and uh other other things like that so when you're starting a carnivore diet most people are pretty deficient you've been taking multivitamins for years so whatever's in that multivitamin that you're actually extracting is actually bioavailable you're probably fine you know so uh you probably don't need to continue that I wouldn't do the gummies if you were going to take supplements you might take something specific to what you're deficient in so you get checked you check your B12 your folate your folate your um zinc magnesium vitamin D and um uh and then you just see if you're low on these sorts of things maybe you take those if you're really low on vitamin B12 you get a you get a you you take a supplement for that either under the tongue or an injection because some people have absorption issues they can't they can't absorb B12 due to pentious anemos and autoimmune condition it's much more common than people realize and um so so you just you just take those if you need them it most people are deficient and so the reference range ranges is is way too low so you want to be on the upper end of the reference range for these nutrients or above if you're if you're if you're normal for B12 I can guarantee you you're low because you don't want everyone's low and so the reference range is too low so I would uh just check just take a look and at the end of the day you know just add in a bit of liver you know if you're if you're really deficient in these things liver is Nature's multivitamin it's just it's there's nothing more bioavailable and access than the nutrients that found in in liver and so tons of B12 tons of folate tons of other sorts of things they're absolutely exceptional uh nutrients and they're very bioavailable so if you are deficient and most people are when they first start out you know add in a bit of liver just you know a few ounces you know 50 grams whatever you know just a day just do that for a few weeks and then you know bang it down to you know three days a week whatever and then check six months down the road see where you're at if you still need to have a bit of liver maybe you're just you know the meat that you're getting isn't as good as as grass-fed and finished Mammoth and so you know you need a bit more help with it and and organs are great for that you don't need much and most people don't need any it just takes longer it takes longer to get up there and you know maybe you won't quite get up into that optimal level without the organs so just check see how you go but you know eating just meat is is going to be way more nutritious than anything else you've ever eaten so you're going to improve you're already going to improve um it's just going to be faster if you add in a bit of organs and uh and if you're really deficient in in something then you could take that supplement but you may not be you know if those if those multivitamins are any good U the ones from Costco if they're bioavailable at all then uh you're probably fine if you were taking a multivitamin and drinking with coffee probably didn't absorb any of it at all ever um if you're eating it with a bunch of plants probably didn't absorb as much of it and uh if you're just taking it on its own on empty stomach maybe if if they were bioavailable You' probably be fine so just check you know most people don't need to just eat meat fatty meat till it stops tasting good if you're really deficient you add in some organs or take a dedicated supplement early on and then perpetuate that just with your diet but eventually you'll catch up unless you're like if you're really deficient then get out of the deficiency like you don't that's not safe to be at at so low that you're deficient you know if you're under 4 or 540 in America or you're under 400 anywhere else that's a real deficiency of B12 and you can actually get brain damage and nerve damage and brain shrinkage as a result of that that's not safe to stay there get an injection take a sublingual B12 uh supplement just get that and start eating liver just get the hell out of that situation and then check yourself for pernicious anemia um so because that's that's not safe to be at those levels other than that meat will get you there and it'll maintain you there bit of organs put you over the top so uh that's my advice on supplements",

    "body": "member says in a vicious cycle of carnivore six days and then having carbs can't help myself um it's very hard for me this coming from a man that did a 40-day water fast two years ago before my S sinus carcinoma treatment well you can always start with that you know you can you I don't recommend this typically but if that's going to help you get through the carb craving times you know maybe uh maybe that's what you do you just just don't eat anything for two weeks uh but uh that's not typically something I would recommend for people just remember that that the carb Cravings generally do go away after about two weeks right the addiction side of things go away and then it's just a matter of well I remember that that tasted good and then you just don't eat it if you are getting carb Cravens you're almost certainly hungry and you're not eating enough meat you're not eating enough fat and you just need to eat more more so if you get cravings and your body wants carbs and says oo that pizza looks good that bread looks good say okay I'm hungry so eat but eat meat eat fatty meat and if you can get through two weeks you can get through forever after that it's not it just goes away so just light at the end of the tunnel it's two weeks you've done 40 days so you'll be fine it's just the thing is if people thinking like oh my God I'm just going to have to deal with this forever screw it obviously that's not um uh you know that's not what you're going to be experiencing after two weeks you typically won't have very many carb Cravings unless you really are undereating significantly in the first two weeks you can get those carb Cravings but a lot of times it does have to do with Hunger because again our hunger signals are very different and we don't we don't um experience that the same way and so you just have to body has to tell you to eat somehow and so sometimes it's just like eat carbs eat sugar and that's how it how it tells you so eat a lot of fatty meat every day eat until you're full every time eat until it stops tasting good and then if you ever get you know the inclination to eat carbs just you know eat a lot of fat fatty meat until that goes away and uh it typically does and usually after two weeks you don't miss it and as long as you're eating enough you won't you won't have any problems with that so you know just remember light at the end of the tunnel you'll get there it's only two weeks it's not it's not that far you'll do fine",

    "body": "they say my question is I'm only eating once a day because I'm not hungry otherwise is that okay uh also I've been experiencing indigestion like symptoms with burping is this normal I've been lying for two weeks so eating once a day is is definitely is fine do remember that your hunger signals do change and they're much more subtle and so maybe you are hungry you're just not realizing it so eat H fatty meat until it stops tasting good if that if once a day is fine then that's fine if you're feeling a bit off or a bit weird or H don't really know what's going on there or you're getting carb Cravings or like something else besides me is looking good or a steak sounds really good ask yourself am I hungry right now try eating meat and if it tastes good then you're hungry keep eating until it stops tasting good and and just go on like that um getting a bit of indigestion and sometimes you can get some uh again that psychosomatic sort of upset stomach because you're eating something that you're not used to and you're and you're doing it in a way that your your body's not used to and so you just need to ease into that the burping side of things I've seen that a couple times times I don't really know why that is it typically goes away um just see how you go and hopefully everything just sort of settles down and um doesn't cause a problem but um you know the you've been doing this for two weeks which is great you're just about to get into like the really exciting time where your body starts working so much better and you start shredding fat stacking on muscle if you're especially if you're working out and you just start feeling better and better and better and better and better some people are a bit more Slow Burn on their weight loss or fat loss I should say um but but typically people lose a lot of weight even early on and they just feel a lot better anyway some people who you know because one reason their leptin is very elevated their fasting insulin's very elevated their all of this means their metabolism is very depressed it's it may take a little longer some people snap right back and their bodies recover and they lose a lot of weight really quickly and others it takes longer so uh either way just just keep going with it you're just about to get in that time where you're just starting better and better and better and better and better so I'm really excited for you because that's a very exciting time I remember that time that was my favorite time because I just felt it so good and it was just really exciting to see how much better I could get as I went um but yeah if you only need to eat once a week then you only need to eat or once a day then you only need to eat once a day just listen to your body eat more often if it's telling you to and uh and try to relearn your hunger signals because they can they can be very subtle and you it's very easy to undereat on a a carnivore diet so at least try to eat once a day if that first bite tastes like cardboard fine you don't need to eat that day but at least try once a day and uh and you'll be fine two three times a day it's perfectly fine too if that's what your body is telling you to do good luck hey everyone if you need a little extra help getting started on a carnivore diet and my online resources that I have for free aren't enough for you you can go to www.how to carnivore docomond carnivore challenge where you'll have online resources group support weekly Zoom meetings as well as the ability to chat live with myself Simon Lewis and the others in the challenge who can help you and support you and give you extra advice and help you along the way so that sounds like something that would be beneficial to you then please go to howto carnivore docomo your plants are trying to kill you message uh in an old book I read that a few fermented vegetables have probiotics do those also have toxins and is it best to avoid them they do have toxins the fermentation process does lower the toxic load and increase the bioavailability of the nutrients so that's better uh it's still optimal to avoid them though I would say if you're trying to get them for that probiotic purpose fine but remember that you when you establish a microbiome that's healthy you will perpetuate it with the meat that get you're eating and so you don't need to continue doing that there are also probiotics in live culture fermented dairy so you're can have fermented dairy as opposed to fermented vegetables that's what I would personally do that's what I've personally done I don't use ferments at all uh to any great extent not not plants anyway I do have occasional yogurt but it's but I I do it in the same way that my friend Dr shanara would do with recommend with other prob fermented vegetable probiotics which is little tiny bit put on meat chewed up together in the same bite so you're mixing that stuff into the meat so that you swallow that down and the bacteria survive your stomach acid which is you if you're just eating it straight probably won't happen and so when you do that um you can get that bacteria past the guard of your stomach acid and get that into your lower intestine where it's supposed to be and but once you have it established there it's established you don't need to keep you know you know planting crops they just keep going they keep they're they're they're you know uh they're plants that just keep keep growing and growing and growing so um they're you know not they're not like the the wheat that just like grows and dies and grows and dies you have to keep replanting them um you know these these will perpetuate themselves if you're just eating properly so and a lot of people don't use probiotics and they have excellent microbiomes so but the the fermentation um process does lower the toxic load yes um and those probiotics are fine you know if you need so you had antibiotics or something like that yeah maybe have some of those things I wouldn't take probiotics from the from the store because those have been shown to be pretty useless and so you know if either do it with fermented vegetables but I would really stick to fermented dairy that's what I stick with and um you not that I've had to take antibiotics uh in a very long time but uh that's something that people typically do is take is have a bit of yogurt uh for a week or two after they take antibiotics and that can just sort of replenish their gut microbiome and uh be be pretty healthy so that's uh that's what I do but then eventually you're just going to have an established microbiome and your meat's going to perpetuate that just like the Inuit they um they just have very healthy microbiomes and uh and so that just gets perpetuated also your oral biome changes and so that bacteria is going to get seeded into the meat and then swallow with each bite so if you have healthy oral biome that can give you healthy gut biome it's just when we're eating a bunch of plants and carbs and things like that you actually don't have very healthy oral uh oral microbes and so those aren't necessarily seeding the right microbes down to your gut as well so you know those sorts of things probably a good idea but uh but not in our case and certainly not long term I don't think you need them",

    "body": "member says brand new carnivore from Texas with uh with questions first your thoughts on fasting to help us lose skin from weight loss I have heard it's important I don't necessarily think it's that important I don't think you necessarily have to to um to fast at all um I haven't seen one way of the other on on fasting helping uh skin loose skin um people have fasted and their skin has you shrunk there's you know famous guy famous story in the UK where a guy I think in Scotland was very overweight and he just basically stopped eating for over a year and just drank water and took a multivitamin every day and he lost all this weight and he walked to work every day and just lost all this weight and it was very skinny and the skin came down with him now you can do that if you lose a lot of weight your skin will come down but if you gain it back up and then lose it and you gain it and you lose it and you gain it and you lose it after about the third fourth time the Integrity of your skin and elasticity just sort of gives up and so it just depends on where you are with that but um if you are if you are just eating the proper amount of protein and fat and all these sorts of things and eating the right things that should stimulate the the skin to come down as well um I you know people probably talking about like oh you need to fast for autophagy and this is going to break down the cells that is that is a really big reach um on what autophagy is for and does and also how it comes about because you get autophagy just from not eating carbs when your insulin goes down autophagy goes on and so it's insulin that blocks autophagy and so when you fast yes you go through autophagy because your insulin is coming down not because you're starving yourself and your body's trying to eat things your body eats the fat your body runs on fat that's what it runs on when you're fast and or when you're starving and um it's not just going around because it's it's breaking down the mitochondria and it's replacing them and increasing their number so it's not looking around Scavenging for materials you know it's it's it's making new things it's making new mitochondria it's making new cells and so no that's not what's happening there so I don't think you need to fast if you if you are going and you're on a carnivore for several months and and um and you're not really getting the results that you want you want to try fasting for periods of time go for it but uh I don't typically recommend it and I don't think it's necessary in this case um two will carnivore help nail skin and hair Health my nails are not in great shape yes absolutely it absolutely helps um all of those and a lot of people find that it's it's really really beneficial uh especially with skin and nails and hair the one caveat to that is that some people find when they go on to any ketogenic diet you have this metabolic State change it can actually trigger a Fallout phase in your hair and so you can lose a bit of hair it's very much more noticeable for women especially because hair is longer and so you squeezing your ponytail it's just like like oh that's not as thick anymore you're seeing it in the drain and all these sorts of things and you're like you know it's like a wook you took a bath in your in your tub or something like that and you're just like well this is this isn't good and um you know so it's uh it's it's temporary though so it triggers a Fallout phase it's not that the hair is dying it's that it's a Fallout phase and they actually typically grow back and they typically grow back thicker and so it's not necessarily you get more hairs but the hairs that grow back are thicker and so it looks thicker and Fuller as well and so you know that's something that a lot of people experience as well so just be mindful of that because some people do experience that do make sure that you have all your nutrients right so you check your B12 and your folate and your zinc magnesium and d and thyroid thyroid is a is a when people have thyroid dysfunction you know that's a very common cause of of having hair sort of fall out and not be supported you need you need thyroid for every single cell in your body and you need your thyroid hormone for every cell in your body and so I would uh you know just check those things if people are experiencing hair loss you just check your Bloods you check your thyroid you check all those sorts of things as long as those things are okay and everything's great like okay it's just a Fallout phase it'll come back um keep an eye on it and you'll see and your your hair stylist your Barber will look at it and be like yeah you know there's there's little hairs growing up and you have a whole bunch of these things takes a while for women to to grow back they do come back by and large so uh and yes your your hair skin and nails get a lot more healthy put Tallow on your skin probably the best thing you'll ever put on your skin is beef Tallow just straight up cooking Tallow unused cooking Tallow you know just scrape it out of a pan and um and just put it on your skin you your skin will never look better or or be healthier than if you use T on your skin good luck",

    "body": "followup question why is ruminant meat better than meat like fowl or poultry any meat that's wild that's eating its natural diets great but most animals that we buy from the store are not and they're not being fed their natural diet and so ruminant meat have a complex four barrel chambered stomach stomach and so they are going to ferment this food before they digest it and absorb it right so or as part of their digestion they're going to ferment it and then so they're going to ferment it before they absorb it fowl poultry pigs fish they're monogastrics like us they only have one stomach they don't ferment it before they absorb it and so the if they're being fed a bunch of plants that have plant toxins that they're not actually designed to eat they're not going to be able to detoxify those things as well and so it has to go into their body first and then their liver tries to detoxify this stuff but this stuff gets stored in the fat especially like in the like lenol acid much higher linolic acid levels and and they can um just build up it's not going to be as bad as eating the plant it is filtering out a lot of this garbage and getting out a lot of the nutrients but some of that stuff builds up up and so that's that's the main reason why so it's more nutrient dense it's also uh less uh has less of a toxic load and typically even when a ruminant animal is eating grains and other garbage that it's not supposed to eat either it's it's going to bring less of those toxins in it's not necess going to be as nutritious because it's not going to have all the nutrients that it needs which is from grass but it's going to be a lot better than the other ones and so it just depends on what your access is to it but you know a lot of people that don't need to worry about that you know it's typically for people with autoimmunity they have to be careful about non- ruminant meat I feel the best on ruminant meat beef in particular that's just how I feel the best but uh eat whatever meat that tastes good to you eggs all that sort of stuff pasture raise is always going to be better you know regeneratively raised you know eating its natural diet is always going to be better for you and the animal and so you know we vote with with our pocketbook and if you don't like how animals being treated in production Farms um then then don't then don't buy them don't support that sort of uh practice and it's better for you anyway it's more it's more uh nutritious however not everyone can afford to to make those um to make that differentiation and so don't Brak the bank on this you know just eat the meat that you enjoy that makes you feel good and that you have access to and can afford and um but yeah but that's why r at me is typically uh better I feel best on it anyway and um I think um I was talking about the the horses and El eating ducklings and uh no not the ducklings yeah I know it's very it was very sad his sister wasn't happy about it um but um yeah it happens so so animals animals eat other animals animal animals eat other things all animals are heterotrophs and so they have to eat something else something else has to die for for them to live and carnivores as well as herbivores and herbivores while they can turn plant tissue into animal tissue and turn it into fat and protein by way of their microbiome um they will still go after the easy the easy solution of a little duckling or meat or something like that and um because it's much more bioavailable and that that's what they're going for they're going for yep that's what I want you know I need I need meat I'm going to make meat in fact there were some cows that sort of a creepy story and pretty sad because the these cows were sort of kept in a pen and um you know ran out of you know food and forage and uh and they were just basically abused and so they were they were sort of locked in maybe you know whatever I don't know if it was you know sort of a barn enclosure or if it was out in a padic and they just didn't have nearly enough grass and didn't get get fed hay or anything like that um but either way they started dying and some of the cows started dying and I read this story about and they were very they were very subtle about it but they said that um that the cows that started dying off and then the only way for the other cows to survive was to turn to uh animal Source nutrition and so they started eating animal Source nutrition in order to survive and then they were eventually rescued and um but as a result they had a taste for meat and so you know what animal Source food is there right it's the dead cow that that you know died next to them and and there I don't know how their teeth got through the skin or whatever maybe had to rot a bit first before they could sort of tear it apart but basically they were eating the the other cows that had died you know sort of like that story of alive where you people you know crashed in the Andes and and um had to had to eat each other you know the people that died in the pl crash to to survive for the next nine months until they were rescued and um so the cows did that that and not only did they do that and survive and do just fine um they put you know bone meal and then blood and things like that into the feed for cows actually from the process broken down cows you use every single scrap of every animal that's process we oh well indigenous populations they would use these things they use every piece of it now we just waste it we don't actually that's money and so that gets used in fertilizer that gets used in feed and so you know cows typically eat you know uh get fed you know meat and things like that in their feed when they're in in sort of the feed lot because grain is not very nutritious it just makes you fat and that's why they feed it to animals that's why they feed it to us and um also because it's very profitable um and so you know same thing that happens to the cow is GNA happen to us they're going to make the cow fat it's going to make you fat like just use your brain and um and so these cows and now they had it taste for meat now they wouldn't eat feed they wouldn't do it and so they got rescued and they got taken out to another farm and they would not eat grass they wouldn't eat hay they were like no no I want beef now that's the good stuff that's what we want and so I had to start feeding it they had to keep feeding them um you know animal animal uh nutrition don't know what the hell they were feeding them um but uh you know I don't know if they were giving them sort of like you know raw you know you know like you know dog food food cat food those sort of raw meat foods but um it's interesting anyway and uh you know um yeah so so that was that was interesting I don't know what the hell they fed the cows after that probably pretty expensive to feed a you know 800 PB cow or th000 pound cow uh you know meat all the time that's a lot that's a lot of that's a lot of meat to to feed something but that that's a normal thing everything eats meat meat is not bad for anything I can't think of a single animal on Earth that uh is does not do well eating meat not even herb Wars and I would I would you know if anyone knows of any you know please let us know but you know barring eating like a poison Sack or you know an organ that's like chalk full of vitamin A or something like that but actual meat from another animal like is that bad for any other animal I would I can't think of a single one 70% of animal species are carnivores and even herbivores opportunistically eat meat when they can and and others are omnivorous so they're eating meat and they're eating plants meat is not bad for anything because it doesn't need to be plants are bad for nearly everything because they have to be so that's the difference and so when people keep telling you that meat's bad for you just tell them to shut up I mean it's just just don't even engage be like look this nonsense it's a tired ass argument it's clearly untrue",

    "body": "member asks is there a way for someone on human dialysis to get into key h ketosis on Carnivore can carnivore actually help in this case does anyone know thanks uh yes you can you can absolutely do carnivore or or keto on um with on hemodialysis uh probably even better too because this is something that can support your your renal health and and you're getting rid of all these plant toxins such as oxalates but there are many others that directly damage the kidney so you're getting those away and in fact Studies have shown that higher protein Di actually improve kidney function um so you you hear people like like I mentioned zero carb health and zeroing it on health uh earlier in the in the uh episode they you go there you look up dialysis go on their search Chat goes back 15 years 20 years some of this stuff and or so and um I don't know exactly how long they've been going on but a long time they've been going on a long time and you look at some of these things and and you look up dialysis or kidney failure all these sorts of things you will see tons of people who improve kidney failure absolutely I mean I've seen people with CKD four and five completely reverse it just get back to more or less normal kidney function within a matter of months by going on strict meat and water especially red meat in water and even some people not as strict I had one friend of mine who was ckd5 he was he was nearing having to go on dialysis and and he was 35 and he's just like I'm not gonna see my daughter graduate high school you know and so he went on that but he still had some like um avocados and meat which I probably wouldn't have done the avocados because they're high in oxalates and when you pick them green which every avocado you buy from the store is going to be picked green and then ripened in the store or at your house um it's usually like a block of wood by the time you get them at the store still and uh and so they're even more they have four times the number of oxalates when they're picked green uh even if they ripen after that so you know even then he uh he he got up to he completely reversed it um and um and uh and so you know it's um uh very very uh common that people have improved improved their kidney function like just all the time if you drink enough water especially you know people with normal kidney function will just improve their kidney function especially when they're going on a carnivore diet you can definitely do that on on dialysis will it make them come off dysis unlikely you know this is not many things have ever done that in fact nothing is really ever done that I've seen three and there's ones is a work in progress I don't work with people on dialysis all the time but of the people I've spoken to I've seen a couple of them on that zero carb health and zeroing in on health Facebook group so look at that maybe that's been update maybe there's been more since then um there's one lady who the first one I saw was on there and I've SE I've seen people since then that I've spoken to and this lady in particular she said she did it for nine months and her doctor's like you're going to kill yourself you're going to kill yourself but she's just like my kidneys already don't work I'm already on dialysis like they're not going to get more dysfunctional than this I already need a transplant but she was just like no this is the right thing for me I'm going to do it and after nine months she came off dialysis that's that does not happen any other way that has never happened any other way that I know of um and there's and there's a uh young man I'm I'm uh friends with now and he's on dialysis unfortunately he was vegan for a long time it just destroyed his body destroyed his neurology you know he was one of these guys probably has B12 was so low that um that he got neurological dysfunction and that's the thing a lot of V oh my B12 fine like I bet you it's not because the reference range is is lowed down because so many people are deficient and anything under 400 or 540 in America can get cause nerve damage and so these people like oh yeah you know uh the r rang is 130 to to 540 in the UK or 600 here and 700 in some places um 7 750 and one one uh place I saw here but they go down to 130 right that's not normal and so you're in that you're like oh yeah I'm normal it's fine no it's not like you are getting nerve damage you're getting brain damage from this stuff so unfortunately this this young man was in that category and destroyed his kidneys vegan died destroyed his kidneys destroyed his uh neurological structure in fact he couldn't get out of bed he couldn't he stopped being able to use his phone he's so neurologically impaired and that's when he realized my D is killing me and unfortunately he's still on dialysis but he's making more urine so he's not completely you know he does still make urine it's just a little bit but now he's making more and more and more and he's actually getting um you know better they test you every time before you get dialysis and before you do all these sorts of things so he's actually is improving is it going to be enough is he going to be able to get off dialysis and and avoid a kidney transplant I don't know he's going to give it a year hopefully it does um is it going to get other people improvements it's going to improve but is it going to um is it going to um is it going to come back to the point that uh you're going to that you're going to to be able to get off um uh dialysis I don't know but it's it's definitely worth a shot uh to look at that so good luck with that there's a comment from from my sister rosin she said uh our great-grandfather ate his steak so rare his anesthesiologist accused him of being a cannibal uh when they were at dinner together and did not end well for the anesthesiologist that's true so you know the pranks you know probably a family trait um but you know going back to the the question people had with uh you know why doesn't raw meat taste good like it does taste good people people commonly eat raw rare meat and it's delicious and so uh but also we've been cooking meat for 800,000 years at least 1.5 million years more likely and possibly even more than that over two million years so we've been cooking meat for a very very long time we don't need to enjoy the taste of raw meat because we weren't eating raw meat in the wild for the last 1.5 million years or more since H sapiens have walked this Earth we've been cooking meat right since we've been breathing air and drinking water we've been cooking meat and so we don't have to enjoy the taste of raw meat and yet we do so you know the vegans uh are not winning any any points with that one um but yeah so my our great-grandfather he was a surgeon and he was actually very interesting guy he was the the youngest ever graduate from Columbia Medical School um ever to date he was um it was a sixe program at the time and he uh started at 16 so he started early and he finished early so he finished a six-year program in four years starting at 16 so he's only 20 years old and New York state law at the time was you wern't a able to start your residency until you're 21 and there goes the idea that everyone died in their 30s because you couldn't even start your residency in 21 and people had professions and degrees that took a lot longer than that you get your PhD at 30 and then you die two years later it's like kind of a waste of time at that point wasn't it um so you know just tell those people they're idiots but so he U he was on the on the on the the very beginnings of modern surgery because he was the second class at Columbia Medical School ever taught sterile practice you know that you should wash your hands right before you do surgery that was not a thing people didn't realize that and so in infections were rampant in surgeries and it wasn't it wasn't ethical to open the abdomen or open the thorax or open the abdomen open the thorax you you chopping off limbs doing this but there were other things that you did and U so this was on on the ground floor of being able to actually do anything because anesthesia was invented in the 1880s like mid 18 I think it's like 1885 or something like that mid to late 1880s and that's right after he went to medical school so he he graduated sort of when was that that would have been um in the in the early 1890s that he graduated I I have his diploma from uh Columbia and um his medical New York medical license he's also the 13th medical license the state of California ever gave out lucky number 13 and he um and I have his diploma of finishing his um residency in in uh surgery at bellev hospital in New York and um and that was early 19 1890s she was right at the beginning of that so you know he was like you know they were inventing seeing what you could do because it's the first time you could put someone to sleep and and and open the abdomen um safely and not get horrible infections so very very interesting so he's doing a lot of surgeries he like they have Striker or you know um metronics or anything like that in these places that would like make a whole bunch of utensils for us to use as surgeons and just uh and just repeat other people's surgeries he had to invent his own uh tools and I still have some of these things so he he would design his own things he had a forge at his house like his dad was a badass that's that's a whole other thing um that that's probably too long of a story to get into but that his dad was just an Stone Cold badass and taught him and his brothers out to be badasses too and so he could he would work a forge he could work metal and and um you know he's a he's an Ivy League surgeon and he's he's out in the Forge you know doing work like a man and he would make his own tools and I I still have some of these things that he made for different surgeries he would think of what he could do and then was like okay I'm going to make this tool for that and then he would make it and he bring it in and use it pretty badass so he was with his an anesthesiologist one day and uh they were at dinner and it was this very raw steak he oh that's just bleeding like a cannibal it's just just disgusting and he was just like all right and my great-grandfather was like he did not accept um uh slights and manner like he that was unacceptable to him and so he's just like all right and he like but you know the guy was the guy's guy was marked and so um and so he uh what he did was he he basically set him up and so he started back then every you know because they didn't have cautery you know they didn't have like you know um you know the electric Coty that we use now you make the skin incision with a with a scalpel but then the rest of it you're doing dissections with cautery so it just it cauterizes and burns the little vessels and um you bipolar and things like that burn these vessels and separate them things like that there's bleeding there it's much less and so for you have to slowly dissect down slowly dissect down tie off arteries and veins and things like that you just be tying these things off tying these things off tying these things off all the way down and it was just it was a lot of blood so people would lose a lot of blood and you always have to give transfusions always have to give transfusions and so they had they would have a a refrigerator full of blood and it was just like these little like glass canisters um that they would sort of hang up and stick in and they just give blood and give blood and give blood and that was very typical typical way of doing things because you just had to and you had you didn't call down to the blood bank and get things you know cross matched and this and that you just you had blood there you got it you brought it over because you needed a lot of it for most surgeries and so he started using like different sorts of things you getting tomato juice and like werer sauce and this and that and and he started like mixing this stuff and like red wine I think was like the base and making it you know bit thicker and this and the other and he and he would would play around with this until he got it the the the appearance and texture and consistency and viscosity of blood and but it was all you know household items right and so he finally did this and he and he he got one of these things and and put it in one of these blood bottles and he put it in there and he just said and he's pointed to said to the nurses don't touch this one just leave that one alone that one's that one's for um uh you know Dr power right that's just that's for me don't touch it and so uh you know after you know they they would operate in the morning they didn't have like big electric lights and things like that I mean this is the late 1800s early 1900s right so they would operate on the top floor of of a hospital and they'd have these big open Skylight so that just this natural light would come in so they had to start first thing in the morning that's why surgery starts first bloody thing in the morning is taken over from that um and so it's with Dawn you had to be there ready to go when that sun came up so you could actually see properly and then you were Dawn a dusk that's when you were operating and so you um so he was just at the end of it he was just like he was there talking to he man I I am par I'm just wasted I I really need to pick me up and he walked over to this cabinet with to the blood thing and he he pulled out his his uh his blood canister he just popped it open and he just like drank it he just drank the whole thing down and see y'all just saw that and act just blacked out just fainted and passed out on the floor like just like learn not to not to mess with uh my great-grandfather so that was um that was pretty funny so that's the story they're talking about and yeah people do just fine with raw meat the Messi drink raw blood they they do cook the meat too but they also can eat it raw it's it's not uncommon uh that people do that",

    "body": "hi Dr C I talked to a co-worker today regarding one of her relatives um having stage four breast cancer I'm very sorry to hear that they told her she would have less than five years to live would carnivore help I think that it it would there are a ketogenic carnivore diet there there is a growing body of evidence in the literature showing that ketogenic animal-based diets like a carnivore diet doesn't have to necessarily be a carnivore diet but just a ketogenic animal fat diet because it's the animal fats that are good for you and the plant oils are not so good for you and the studies that that show the best results are the ones using meat they're eating animal fats and things like that to get into ketosis and then other other studies on ketogenics you know generally in mice you know giving them a bunch of like Crisco and and hydrogenated vegetable oil which does not exist in nature and yet we're giving them to to animals and people and saying hm you know we're getting we're getting strange uh and POS possibly bad you know blood markers and biomarkers from this ketogenic diet it's it's like yeah well no kidding you're giving them poison and so they're in ketosis but they're also giving them poison and so I'm not surprised that they're getting better results the ones that that are getting the best results are the high fat animal-based ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet um and depending on the breast cancer too that that's been more studied as well I U you remember seeing a study on triple negative breast cancer responding very well to ketogenic metabolic therapy um always remember that U you know Dr OT warberg showed nearly 100 years ago that cancer is a mitochondrial metabolic disease it's not a genetic disorder uh and then Watson and CRI came along and discovered DNA and everyone just went everything's DNA well every most things are stored in the DNA but that doesn't mean that the DNA is the brain and the PowerHouse the mitochondria of the PowerHouse they're actually moving around in the cell and actually uh um you know turning things on and off and running the cell as if it were a ship the DNA and the that information that it codes for is very important but it's it's um it's sort of the blueprints it's not the architect and the and the builders right the mitochondria or the workers and The Architects they're using that information and the proteins that it's producing to go and do work elsewhere in the cell now it's a bit more complex than that because the the DNA can actually you know self-control which proteins get Express and so and so on U but the but that's like like a chemical Dynamic and um based on gradients and other sorts of signals that that the DNA is getting uh the mitochondria actually moving around doing work and so they're very very very important and excuse me and so we have something called the warberg effect which is that cancer cells require 400 times the amount of glucose as normal cells to and so it has um you know has been shown that when you rest restrict glucose and sugar and you go into a ketogenic State you get your gki low your glucose Ketone index your blood sugar is low and your ketones are high that actually shows a survival benefit in in cancers of you know all different forms I mean there's there's dozens and dozens of studies in multiple different cancers uh like dozens in each dozens of studies in in in each of these different cancers including breast cancer showing significant Improvement with ketogenic metabolic therapy all the studies that show the most benefit are the ones that have the least carbohydrates so I have some that have sort of middling like is it all that much better uh whether they're having you know low carbohydrate what the hell does low carbohydrate mean it's it's ambiguous so some of them like you know below 200 grams of carbohydrates that's a low carbohydrate diet well that's intensely high from my standpoint because I don't have any carbohydrates outside of the glycogen that shows up in in meat and organs um and I don't even have that many organs you know it's really much it's really just meat um so then there's other ones like 50 grams or you know 20 grams and 10 grams and zero grams as you go down you know people tend to have better outcomes and so you keep that gki under 2.0 that's considered therapeutic and you do that from a combination of a ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet and uh potentially restricted eating you need to include organs if you're going to do that because you still need the same amount of nutrients you just want less energy coming in and uh and potentially fasting you know if you can't get your gki under two or even under one is is uh preferable uh for periods of time at least so that you can sort of have um this sort of constant pressure of of low access to energy then um you know fasting can can sometimes help that help sort of tip the balance and get you uh into that more ketogenic state so good luck to your friend um maybe show her my my interview with Professor Thomas seed SEF IE D where we talk about cancer and cancer biology and it's it's pretty amazing it's it's a you know hour and 40 minutes uh long talking about you know cancer biology and it's it's my most watched long video it's like two million views nearly maybe even hit it but that was 1.9 last time I checked and and then my my my lecture at uh it was a medical conference in San Diego last year uh and it was just called uh ketogenic metabolic therapy as a novel adjunct to standard of care and cancer bit of a mouthful probably not a Punchy enough to really make it go crazy on the algorithm uh but it's a good talk it has good good information in it anyway and um and so I would I would recommend taking a look at those and and um and seeing what she thinks and at the very least it's not going to hurt um it can help actually make chemo and radiation uh more successful by sensitizing the cancer cells to the chemo and radiation and uh protecting her healthy cells from the chemone radiation as well so I would take a look at those and um and maybe show them to her and see how she does because it's it's you know cancer is really nasty and um and you have to throw the kitchen sink at it um otherwise you know you're just sort of giving into to fate and that's not it's not a good fate to give into so uh I would definitely try that it's not going to hurt her that very least and I think it would help yes that's what the that's what the data shows anyway you know and and the thing is to you know you talk to her doctor if her doctor has a particular feelings on oh my God don't do that you know that's that's a discussion she can have but the vast majority of doctors that that or an oncologist that I speak to and that um patients speak to they say is there anything I can do with my diet should I change anything they say no don't worry about it eat whatever you want okay well then eat what you want and and if you feel that this is going to help you um along with that then uh you know it's worth a try and that's what more and more studies are showing to be helpful and uh and and increase survival and that's that's what we're trying to do here with things like cancer so good luck to to your friend",

    "body": "my friend was told she has nons small cell lung cancer very sorry to hear that they've told her that it is terminal and have her on a prazone causing massive weight gain even when she doesn't eat can fasting and carnivore reverse all this well you know cancer is is an extremely dangerous and deadly and nasty disease even doing everything as best that we can and fasting and doing carnivore and ketogenics and things like that sometimes it's not enough and um you know there is there is a point of of no return but there are a lot of people finding that they are significantly improving their health issues there have been studies on La M lung cancer and ketogenic diets I'm nearly 100% sure just going back to that lecture I gave I those some of the studies I came across were for non-s small cell lung cancer and so it's definitely worth a shot the prazone is you know it's it's a double-edged sword because it's reducing the inflammation allowing their their breathing to be easier but what it's doing also is causing diabetes and massively increasing her blood sugar and feeding that cancer and making that cancer much more aggressive and it's also suppressing the immune system which fights the cancer so this is sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy is um you know that she's on those medications to sort of help her symptomatically but they're they're accelerating her demise unfortunately so it just depends on how how much left she has in her how how much she has in her to fight this you know if she comes off the the prazone to get her blood sugar under control and she can fast and eat carnivore and ketogenic um and you know potentially address the you know glutamine action with different sort of medications press pulse um method that Professor seed has outlined in several of his papers and another paper that um I'm actually a part of that will be coming out shortly and um and that I talk about in the uh my uh talk on ketogenic metabolic therapy for cancer and in our our um interview my interview with Thomas caed uh we talk about all this I think it can definitely help and I think it can definitely help her feel better and get more out of this and uh and be healthier for longer and I can't say that it's going to reverse all this I can't say that it's going to fix her I can't say that um she's going to be able to put this into remission but I can't tell you that others have um and that they are still fighting this you know I mean this you just have to sort of assume that this is always going to be going on in your body you really can't stop and so um you know if if she tries it I think it's well worth trying you know nothing else is really going to do much I mean they've already given up on her and said that she's terminal and so they're putting on paliative measures and just giving a whole bunch of prazone which um is just going to jack up her her blood sugar and and accelerate this cancer cells require 400 times the amount of blood sugar as normal cells and so you know you want to do everything you can to keep that blood sugar levels down not up because you take do a pet scan you eject radiol labeled glucose and you see where that goes you see dot dot dot dot dot oh that that's all the cancer cells are sucking up all that glucose so that's what's happening when her blood sugar is high it's just feeding those cancers and they're lighting up lighting up lighting up so remember that pet scan anytime you have a bagel or a piece of bread or or have your prazone jumps up your blood sugar you really want to keep that down uh because the you're just you're just stuck energy into these cancer cells which is exactly the opposite of what you want to do so I'm really sorry for your friend that's a very difficult place to be in you know especially because sometimes you know the breathing is so hard that they really can't go off the the steroids and that's that that's really tough and you know it's like for for brain cancers brain tumors get a lot of swelling in edema you have to go on steroids you have to because the edema can kill you then you do the surgery you cut out the tumor and then you have them on steroids for another you know several days in a weaning dose and uh and then you come off of them you know when that swelling's down you've taken out the tumor so now it's not causing swelling anymore so you can get them off the steroids you don't keep them on for very long if possible and then you do radiation that causes more swelling so you put them back on steroids and then you're sort of going down that rabbit hole but it's um it's something that in certain circumstances when you have brain edema or you have so much edema in your lungs that you can't breathe that sometimes these are these are necessary evils and U you know the fasting and carnivore diet being at least ketogenic so you're not adding fuel to that I think is definitely going to be a net positive and hopefully it reduces the swelling down enough as well that she can come off the prazone and um and not be so horribly symptomatic that she's that she's miserable or or or uh putting herself in danger of respiratory failure hopefully that's the case and and if it is and she can really attack this with you know getting her gki below two or below one if possible with with um combination of a ketogenic carnivore diet liver organs um some restricted eating and some fasting hopefully that that um is enough to start turning the tide back the other way there are people who have done that and it's a growing body of them and there there are there's a growing body of experimental literature of randomized control trials and Interventional trials that um may be you know controlled but not randomized um you know self- selected uh trials Etc that um that that are doing extremely well and there's a just there's more and more there are more and more of these studies showing that so uh good luck to your friend hopefully she gets a lot of improvement by going carnivore hopefully she's able to get off the prazone and hopefully she's able to turn this around you can check your actual objective markers your CAC score or uh you know cored Doppler and see what's going on I have a number of patients that have been reversing their atherosclerosis this is all anecdotal but this is they are reversing it had a a gentleman in my my patreon uh chip who had 100% uh stenosis blockage of his right cored artery and uh a year before he started uh you know a a year ago he was on carnivore for a year",

    "body": "member says hi I'm 41y old female living with p and arthritis 6 weeks on Carnivore lost 6 kgs which is absolutely fantastic very well done um and and pain almost gone I just want to know can carnivore diet reverse my phah um so well first of all I just want to say you know it's it's only been 6 weeks you've already um you've already lost 6 kilos your pain has has significantly improved from your arthritis that's an amazing um that's an amazing Improvement already it's only been six weeks um the issue with ph and again there you know I I I say this other times but there are a lot of acronyms out there so I am going to assume you mean one of the more common ones which is um you know pulmonary hypertension ponary arterial arterial hypertension and um that's at least the only one I can think of right now with that acronym so um I I don't know is the short answer it's not something that I've seen too much of it's not it's not a disease that I treat it's not an issue that I treat um I haven't come across too many people that have reported back so you know if I had it would be very anecdotal I haven't seen studies on ketogen genc diets and um uh pH they could be there there are literally thousands of these things so i' I've seen dozens and dozens I haven't seen thousands I haven't looked at all the thousands that are out there but you can you can check this out and if people have a condition that you're that you're living with you want to say okay you know can a carnivore diet help me well there may not be one on a carnivore diet but a carnivore diet is a high-fat animal-based ketogenic diet and the ketogenic diets in the literature are high fat meat-based ketogenic diets they're just cutting out carbohydrates what do you replace that with fat protein but they replace that with fat and protein from meat they don't replace that with fat and protein from Plants because it's it's a very poor source of fat and protein and it's nutritionally deficient in many ways and significantly inferior in even more ways so they don't so these thousands of studies that do ketogenic diets are all animal-based diets they're all meat-based diets and that's probably why the powers that here trying to trash it because they they want us to think that meat is harmful even though it doesn't harm any other animal on earth carnivores or herbivores herbivores routinely will eat uh smaller animals opportunistically I've seen elk and deer eat uh ducklings and little chickens and even rabbits like full full grown rabbits that was a weird one but um because they don't have the right teeth so they're just chewing this in a very strange way and um but they do you know this doesn't hurt them right it doesn't hurt us either why we be the only creature on Earth that gets hurt from eating our natural evolved diet and and meat doesn't have any toxins in it it's not toxic to any form of life they can have a poison sack that's different the meat itself is not poisonous to anything anything I know of anyway I couldn't imagine anything toing because herbivores eat this stuff too opportunistically so either way um you can look up ketogenic like go on you know Pub met or Google Scholar or something like that something you have access to and just look up pH or pulmonary arter arterial arterial hypertension and uh ketogenic diet and see if anything's come up see if someone has studied it may have I mean there's thousands of these things you can also look at fasting mimicking diets and whatever disease or disorder that you've come up with because that's a way of hiding the word ketogenic because that's a bit of a four-letter word in some academic circles and so you know they say it's like well we know fasting is is really good and helpful in these conditions but you know that's really hard to fast for this period of time and so what about a diet that mimics fasting right it gets you in the same metabolic state as when you're fasting uh AKA a ketogenic diet so a carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet so anything that applies to those like those benefits you get from ketogenic diets from animal- based meat-based ketogenic diets are going to apply to a carnivore diet um and then some because you're cutting out more than just the carbs you're cutting out more than just carbs and going into that metabolic State you're also cutting out all the plant toxins that are coming with that and um and there's plenty of books on this look up you know Dr gundry's you know the plant Paradox look up uh most delicious poisons is written by a professor of biology at UC Berkeley an evolutionary biologist and professor of biology there um and any textbook on botany I mean they all cover this stuff plants are toxic that's how they survive they're not they're not duking it out with people they not running away fighting back um scratching people and clawing them and attacking and all these other sorts of things they're just sitting there they're sitting ducks they're just they're not even trying to run away they're not even trying to hide idiots you know so how the hell they defend themselves why are they not why are they still there you know why do they exist as a form of life because they have actually have really robust defenses and they are chemical in nature the vast majority are chemical in nature they are Toxic by Design and so you get rid of these things you're going to get rid of these toxins um so that's what I would do I would look up for that unfortunately I don't know if there is literature on phah and uh ketogenic diets that could be extrapolated to people on a carnivore diet but I do know that you're going to be helped in a number of other ways just like you know the previous question that there are so many good reasons for going on a carnivore diet and hopefully it helps your issue but even if it doesn't it's going to improve your life in a thousand different ways and it's going to be more than worth it it can certainly make your life a lot easier and a lot better and uh better able to deal with your your phah as a result of that and just be healthier overall and just be as healthy as you possibly can be in the body that you have and hopefully it gets better but again there are things in this world that can harm us that that are outside of our diet and uh a lot of things are from our diet a lot I would say like 90% of the diseases that we're treating now the issues that we're treating that was doctors are come from the eating an inappropriate diet a biologically inappropriate diet easily 90% but that leaves 10% that's not from that but you can be as healthy as you possibly can be and you're going to be better able to weather and heal from those other 10% of things so that's what I would suggest is just doing it anyway and seeing how you go and you can check and see on Google Scholar PubMed and see if there's anything on ketogenic diets or fasting mimikin diets and anybody else who has an issue that they're concerned about do that same search more often than not you'll find something you'll find something very promising and uh and it can can uh most likely help you and there's just more and more data coming out every single day and so it's a very exciting time because we're actually we're actually healing people it's almost as if it's almost as if uh you know the the the system was working in a way and the people are actually trying to help each other and figure out the root causes of disease um these disease just never existed before and now they're just the only things we treat so what happens something in our environment so you identify what happened in our environment wasn't meat we've always been eating meat so that wasn't it so it's something new right like processed food seed oils refined sugars refined carbs this crazy plant-based push that everyone's been trying to shove down our throats for the last 60 years actually really 150 years if you want to go back far enough so that's what's new meat's not new so just eat your biological design and you'll be as healthy as your biologically designed to be and that's pretty damn healthy all life on Earth is extraordinarily healthy the natural state of all life from single cell animals you know to humans and everything in between trees plants fungus everything they're all healthy the natural state is to be healthy so why are we sick why 90% of Americans why are 90% of Americans uh unwell why do they have at least one metabolic disease why are 70% of people in Western countries overweight are obese why is that you know that's not normal that's not natural that's not supposed to happen um so something's happening in our environment we're doing this for ourselves and it's not meat we've always been eating meat that's established we already know that's safe right they have to prove that eating this other crap is better than eating meat or or at least or even safe at all they have not done that they've started at that as a position of yeah fruits and vegetables are really good and then meat is bad saturated fat cholest o that causes disease therefore anything without saturated fat and cholesterol is de facto good for you that was a whole argument and so we're starting from the point uh well hold on everyone knows plants you have to prove that meat's good you have to prove that we don't need test meat was established it was just usurped and they just sort of did a little coup and got me kicked out of there but that was the established reigning champ no one ever proved that plants were good for you they just said that saturated fat and cholesterol were bad for you so things without saturated fat and cholesterol de facto became good for you because the only thing was bad was saturated fat and cholesterol and therefore anything without saturated fat cholesterol automatically became good for you uh that's not how that game works but they snuck it through good job them you know got to you know give credit where credits do they were sneaky little bastards and they they shoveled something through that should never have gotten through and he you know more power to them but now we've recognized what happened we we see the game and we just plug up that hole and say no that's meat is established we've already always eaten meat that is what's healthy that's the Baseline you have to prove that something else is better not the other way around so just go back to Baseline eat we've been eating for millions of years eat was biologically appropriate for our diet for our for our species and you will be as healthy as you can be and hopefully that helps your pah and if not it'll still make you a lot healthier and you'll feel a lot better having to deal with the phah and so at least that's something anyway",

having heart attacks yeah it's it's very concerning isn't it and um you know when you consider the fact that the first heart attack diagnosed and confirmed on autopsy in America was in 1912 and there wasn't a single case reported in the literature uh confirmed on autopsy of someone dying from a heart attack then uh you have to sort of wonder why the hell that is and why 10 years later became one of the biggest killers and then few years after that became the number one killer in America even though we're eating the least amount of meat in America than we were in 200 years before or since and so in the 1800s we're eating far more meat oh people are only living to their 30s well people in their 30s have heart attacks now people in their 20s have heart attacks now my friend Dr Anor Verma is an ER physician in India and they eat three kilos of meat per person per year on average and he's seeing 17-year-old vegetarian kids coming into the heart the hospital with a heart attack the hell is that so people just 17's not old enough I guess um it's it's it's pretty wild uh what people the mental gymnastics that people can do to deny reality in in front of their faces the average life expectancy from birth in 1850 was 38 but the average life expectancy from age 10 years old if you made it to 10 was 56 so and you get to 20 it's 66 and so on so if you get into adulthood and middle age you lived as long or longer than people do now and so it's just that the childhood morality rate was very high and and early early deaths were high because it's you know it was a hard life you know we have it pretty piss easy now in the west you know you go out go to Bangladesh and uh you know go go see how they live not even in the refugee camps where I was working just go see rural Bangladesh or even Urban Bangladesh the vast majority of people are living under very different conditions than than we are and they have a life expectancy to uh compare that to India their average life expectancy from birth is around 60 60 something right and they're all vegetarians well wouldn't that mean that you know uh that uh you know being vegetarian is bad oh well but there's infant mortality and there's this and there's oh okay so now now there's a distinction but not when it goes the other way so um why does you know what's the connection between carnivore and reducing heart attack R well the simple thing is is that you're you're removing out things that can be causitive you know I mean cigarettes at smoking um nicotine can cause damage to the artery lining diabetes causes damage to the lining of your arteries through glycation you're going to keep your blood sugar down you're going to keep your insulin down and high fat meat-based ketogenic diets like a cornivore diet have been shown in clinical trials in humans to reverse type two diabetes that's one of the biggest risk factors for developing heart attack and heart disease and stroke and um so that would be diabetes metabolic syndrome both of which have been shown to be reversible with ketogenic um uh high fat ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet and people all around the world are reversing their diabetes with by going on a high fat carnivore diet uh that is ketogenic and getting rid of seed oils and these things these Industrial Products that have never existed in nature ever and um then you when you cook with them they can make uh trans fats they can they partially hydrogenate and you make um trans fats that are extremely toxic they don't exist in nature either and um you know that's why these things are illegal now because it's such a high risk of developing heart disease and and other sorts of health issues and when you cook with these plant oils they you know uh they can turn into uh trans fats so that's not good you don't want those but I mean the the the plant oils themselves um can be harmful as well so you're just eliminating out all these different things and so it's an Elimination Diet you're just you're just cutting out things that are bad for you so it's like you know what what is the connection between you know um not drinking alcohol and doing drugs and certain Health outcomes well you're just not doing drugs and drinking alcohol which damage your body and can precipitate these health issues same thing with cornivore you're just eating what humans have been eating since humans have been humans and so your body's just going to work normally you're not bringing it all these other sorts of harmful additives um and for those who said that you know people died in their 30s you know before the 20th century just remind them that since the 1700s the minimum required age to run for president of the United States was 35 minimum right and you look at all the founding fathers all these like white-haired old men usually wearing wigs because they lost all their hair right so tell me again how only leing to be uh 35 again so um you know John Adams was born in the mid 1700s and he uh was 92 years old when he died Jefferson I think was 6 was 84 and um uh Washington was in his late 60s and then he you know caught pneumonia working out in the field and just getting soaked wet and um and decided not to change because he didn't want to be late to dinner he was very punctual it was just all about gen gentlemanly manners and and um that was very important to him and um you know it cost him he got bad pneumonia and um pneumonia and he got very sick and he ended up dying probably from all the things that they were doing at the time you know all the blood letting and cupping and all that sort of stuff and it was weeks and weeks and weeks before he died uh but yeah he unfortunately died so you know unless something killed them they they lived to be in their 80s and 90s for you know centuries you know and so and yet there were no heart attacks and strokes confirmed on autopsy in America before 1912 and then in the 1920s it's massively increased in the 1930s it's the number one killer in America and it stayed that way and it just sort of kept going up and um you know now the prevalence and incidence the new heart attacks people having their first heart attack is getting more and more um common so you know in the in the 19 know so you know liar and people that are trying to purposefully mislead you will use this line um that uh that the cardiovascular mortality rate peaked in the 60s and 70s and then started coming down right when we started you know going away from eating meat and fat cholesterol and and putting people on statins but that's not what we said so the rate the incidence the the you know the how common heart disease was and how common heart attack was went up and increased dramatically actually and worldwide deaths have increased dramatically as well U just in America the mortality and these are age adjusted numbers always remember that age adjusted means they've changed the numbers and you you know you have to you have to sort of say well what did you change them to what are the raw numbers so don't age adjust them why the hell are you age adjusting them just tell me how many people have had a heart attack how many people have died from a heart attack they don't tell you that they only tell you the age adjust it is almost impossible possible to find the unage adjusted numbers I actually haven't been able to find the non-age adjusted uh mortality cardiovascular mortality I have not been able to find them and I've had um you know research assistants and and other people that have not been able to find them either it's very difficult it's almost as if someone doesn't want you to see them so but that's we're talking about we're talking about the prevalence we're talking about the incidence we're talking about the percentage of people in society that have heart disease we're talking about the the how many people a year get diagnosed with heart disease well that's just screening that's just better Diagnostics okay what about first-time heart attacks that's going up to so the number of people having their first heart attack and surviving is going up we have better interventions we have better access to Medical Care we have way lower smoke rates in the 1920s and before when heart heart disease almost didn't exist 80% of men smoked right and so now it's far less than that and yet we have a far higher rate of heart disease and uh and deaths from heart disease actually then in the 1920s when it was 80% uh male smoking rate so you mean this is back when they were like telling athletes you should smoke because it opens up your lungs gets your your cardiovascular system going uh just crazy but it um it it is the case that the first people having their first heart attacks is going up so why is that since we're reducing we've reduced red meat by over a third reduced fat saturated fat and cholesterol by the same in increase fruits and vegetables by 30 and 40% increased heart healthy grains increased um heart healthy uh unsaturated vegetable oil oils by over threefold and um and replaced uh you know these calories that you're you're missing out from animal fats with h plant oils and sugar you know and sugar is supposed to be not bad for it's not supposed to cause heart disease but then why the hell is heart disease increasing why are people having more heart attacks why are people all around the world dying of heart attacks and strokes more than they ever were before and that that and those worldwide statistics you can get and those are increasing and the deaths from cardiovascular disease is increasing beyond the rate of population growth around the world right so you're outstripping just how how how many people are out there right so it's not just wrong numbers it's percentage of the population is going up and up and up and like I said in India there's some of the sickest people and most metabolically sick people they have some of the highest rates of diabetes they're all plant- BAS right a traditional you know vegetarian Indian diet like I said you know my my friend Dr anchor Verma he's treating 17-year-old kids vegetarians that are having heart attacks 26y old lady came in had stroke this is crazy I mean you're destroying the potential that this person had for their whole life you're just destroying an entire life and um and and then people are just try oh it's the meat it can't be the meat because um or not not the meat alone anyway because these people don't eat meat you know three three kilos of meat per year and 20 years ago they were eating five kilos of meat per year and they were healthier they're worse now the the you know diabetes rates in India for these vegetarian population is 25% and that's in urban and rural areas right and that's published in top journals and recent studies published in top journals um 25% of the population uh is type two diabetic contrast that with America when everybody says oh America they're all fat and slobby and junk food and this and that and blah blah blah and Americans are just the least healthy people on Earth the diabetes rate in America is 9% diabetes rate in India where they're vegetarian and all super healthy is 25% so why doesn't that show up in the blue zones right why why don't we make a movie called the anti-blue zones you have all these play that go strictly against that Blue Zone ideology and blue zones are anti-blue zones too because they they disprove their own Theory because most of them eat way more meat than they said they did um and um and they they lied on a lot of other different fronts as well but um you know you have the entire subcontinent of India oh look at this little population this that how about you look at 1.4 billion people who are largely vegetarian and only eat three kilos of meat per year and see that they are the sickest people on Earth how would you look at that and um and and tell me what you think you can check your actual objective markers your C score or uh you cred Doppler and see what's going on I have a number of patients that have been reversing their atherosclerosis this is all anecdotal but this is they are reversing it had a gentleman in my my patreon uh chip who had 100% uh stenosis blockage of his right cored artery and uh a year before he started u you know a year ago he was on Carnivore for a year",

    "body": "member says my father has early Parkinson's and is severely addicted to show any tips or studies that might help um help open him to carnivore he is very very stubborn well there are studies with ketogenic diets show Improvement in uh Parkinson's and so that's obviously getting rid of sugar and getting rid of carbohydrates in general and so that would be very beneficial to him to do that also studies showing that people with higher LDL cholesterol actually have lower rates of Parkinson's Alzheimer's dementia they're protected from these also autism and um and what else there's another one too um well I think those are the main ones anyway you know you know ketogenic diet those sorts of approaches and having more meat more fat these are very good for the brain the brain especially the cortex primarily runs on ketones and so if you have ketones and you have blood sugar available your brain the cortex anyway only runs on ketones even if there's glucose available it says no we want the ketones right so that's a preference that's your primary energy source or ketones for your cortex and that's the thinky thinky part of the brain right um when it's only when ketones start going down that you start adding in some glucose for that part of the brain because you have to you need energy for your brain but that's a secondary energy source and so if you have Parkinson's or any other sort of uh you know neurocognitive issue you need to you need to give your brain the appropriate energy source also ketones cross the blood brain barrier and reconstitute into fatty acids and so these can be used as the building blocks and physical M materials to rebuild and reconstruct the brain and keep it healthy healthy and active which is very important especially in cases of Parkinson's also there are studies in Parkinson's where people um well they've actually found that lectins these different plant toxins that are just absolutely destructive in your body they can actually track up the Vegas nerve and go up into the brain from the gut into the brain and damage the substanti  and potentially be a contributing factor in the development of Parkinson's and so I think it was in the Netherlands they did a study looking at 20 25 years of people they got a votomy which is severed the Vegas nerve they used to do this uh because they thought it helped stop um the development of ulcers you're missing out on a lot I mean that's your your gut brain connection is the Vegas nerve and so you you've really done yourself a disservice by by cutting that but this is something they did for a while so you had thousands of people that did this and they found that people that had the Vegas nerve cut so that there was no physical conduit for lectin to get up into the brain they those people had 66% lower rates of of um Parkinson's compared to the rest of the population so it suggests that there you know that that the lectins and plant toxins are contributory anyway and um at least by that mechanism and possibly others as well so eating the right thing is going to help clearly um there are a lot of people that have been helping their Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and Dementia by going on to a high-fat meat-based ketogenic diet and always remember that ketogenic diets when we talk about that it just it means low carb D no carb D that's really what it is a ketogenic metabolism when you have no carbohydrates your insulin is low that's the whole idea you want to get your insulin down to a normal level then Your Body Works in very important ways um in in its optimal way because insulin affects blood sugar but it also affects over a 100 different mechanisms in your body and so if your blood sugar goes up and your insulin goes up to try to combat the blood sugar it's going up and it's affecting everything else at that elevated level if it's down here at around a five most most of the time then it's affecting everything at a five if you eat a bunch of sugar and carbs it pops up to a 35 now it's affecting everything at a 35 as well and now everything's really out of balance and then you can get uh fasting insulin uh elevation it's called insulin resistance it starts going up to 12 14 15 20 I had a gentleman that came into my office a couple weeks ago and his fasting insulin was 72 which is the highest I've ever seen in my in my career um uh be it you know mic is not as long as other people's but it's uh it's definitely massively elevated and so that's affecting everything at a 72 and then he eats carbohydrates it jumps up to what 104 like who knows it's just it's G to be massively elevated so that's obviously going to derange a lot of these things so you want to keep your insulin at a normal level because without that it's it's affecting everything else one of the thing people talk about they need to fast for a long period of time like at least 72 hours because then you get real good aut and all that's really important to turn over these different internal organel in the cell and that and that's really good for health and that is good for health but it's not the lack of food that's causing that it's the lack of carbohydrates it's the lack of insulin that is triggering that because elevated insulin decreases autophagy it stops autophagy right look it up you know it's all that's one of the mechanisms uh that insulin affects is it it decreases higher ins insulin decreases autophagy right and so it's not fasting that's do so you know Dr David Sinclair and Dr ptia you know they're saying oh you need to fast for several days every every three months and this is really important to get this autophagy if you just don't eat carbs you're always you're always uh able to go through autophagy your body's always turning over these uh these these uh organel and things like that in your C it's always doing that it's not because you're starving yourself and your body's looking for pieces of nutrients that's not what it's doing it's just a normal process it's normal housekeeping for your cells to turn over these these organel and make them run better and more efficiently so all these things are are uh you know studied in the ketogenic diet and fasting they find a lot of you know benefits and improvements with fasting and and being in a ketogenic State and so those ketogenic diets ketogenic diet is the most rigorously studied diet on Earth has the mo it's really the only rigorously studied diet on Earth you know these plant-based diets are all survey studies and they're all garbage you know they're comparing processed foods diet to eating more fruits and vegetables it doesn't say anything about the inherent healthiness of those fruits and vegetables just that people that eat more fruits and vegetables instead of process food and they also work out more and eat less sugar and drink less alcohol and higher socioeconomic status and less diabetes and all these other sorts of things that are confounding factors part of this healthy user bias they smoke class all these sorts of things um all that's saying is that you know people that that are trying to be healthy eat more vegetables because they're told to right and they do other things that they're told are healthy as well and you're comparing this to a processed food diet so that's not real that's not a real study that's not real science you know that's a survey and they're manipulating the data and they're using it to intentionally manipulate the data but the ketogenic diet is actually rigorously studied you have randomized control trials Interventional trials with specific endpoints that they find that the ketogenic diet is a very beneficial and healthy diet and one head-to-head against the dash diet for instance and uh other diets as well so very beneficial but what is it it just means lack of carbohydrates right well but what kind so you could do that with a vegetarian diet but you'd have to eat a lot of plant oils possibly in the form of you know seed oils and just drinking canola oil I mean you'd have to take a ton of of um uh supps right because it's just nutritionally devoid right so they don't do that so those ketogen the ketogenic diet is not just any ketogenic diet the ones that are in these studies are animal diets it's an animal-based diet it's a high fat High animal fat High animal protein High meat ketogenic diet they replace carbohydrates with animal fat and animal protein so that's the most rigorously studied diet on Earth is a high fat meat-based ketogenic diet and that's been shown to be the most efficacious diet in the world so that's a carnivore diet with a side salad that's the most rigorously studied diet on Earth so when people say oh there's no big studies or high level studies on the carnivore diet you know because a carnivore diet is a subset of the ketogenic diet because it is a ketogenic diet and that's what you replace this stuff with you replace the carbs and the plant you know nutrients with meat and then you might have some of asparagus if you hate yourself and you want to ruin your your day um so you know you can do that but the main part of that meal there is the meat and the animal fat right and so that's what's that's what's been studied the most and so that's the thing with Parkinson uh diet and Alzheimer's and autism and mental health issues is that these ketogenic diets have been shown to be the most efficacious diets and help in these in these um treat in the treatment of these issues and that's a meat-based diet that's an animal based diet with no carbs and no sugars so a long-winded answer but I think it's really important to start framing it that way to start framing things like know actually the most heavily studied diet on Earth is a ketogenic diet and the ketogenic diet is an animal-based diet it's a high fat meat-based diet it's a whole food meat-based diet and the vegetarian diet has never won against a ketogenic diet and it never will because it's because well it's that specific ketogenic diet anyway high fat animal-based diet that is the most rigorously studied diet on Earth and has been found to be the best diet on Earth and I so it's just carnivore diet with a side salad and I I think if you get rid of that side salad and you do those studies again I think you'll find even better improvements as a result good luck to your to your dad",

    "body": "Irene asks do you think cacc score is significant my brother 60 years old has normal test results uh across all tests with a CAC score of 1,200 says carnivore help reduce the CAC score uh yes I do think that that's significant it's um it's a calcification of of arterial plaques um and so that's uh not something you want to be elevated anything over a 100 is is significant and increases your risk of of uh you know heart attack and things like that so he's got a CAC score of 1,200 I don't know if he's carnivore um but he should be uh one thing that that you'll hear doctors say is that you oh my gosh your your CAC score is elevated you need to go in a Statin and you know if you have a a bacterial infection you say oh my goodness you have this bacterial infection you need to go and an antibiotic you have high blood pressure you need to go on this anti-hypertensive you have high blood sugar you need to go on this diabetes medication what does that mean you think you're treating that thing right you're so give this medication it's going to get rid of the bacteria you're going to give this medication it's going to lower your blood pressure you're going to give this medication it's going to lower your blood sugar right and so oh my gosh you have a high CAC score you need to go on a Statin the assumption is that's going to reduce the CAC score but it doesn't it actually makes it go up so it's actually exactly the opposite you know it's it's like if you're giv oh my gosh your blood pressure is high here's this medication and Jacks your your blood pressure up another 50 points well what is that oh no it's okay now because we did it and then the medication makes you strong your heart strong that's that's um the the the insanity of what they're saying with uh with statins and CAC score they're saying that a CAC score is dangerous there for you need to be on a Statin which raises your CAC score hold on a second but I thought that was bad yeah it is bad you do it but if we do it then it's stabilizing the plaques and it makes it less likely to rupture like okay but isn't my body doing that anyway isn't that uh isn't that good then that my CAC score is going up because it's stabilizing like oh no no no it's really it's really bad when your body does it but it's but it's really good when our drugs do it makes no damn sense I mean these people are just talking out of their ass really and um so uh yes it is significant that your C score is up uh Canon cornivore diet help reduced that uh we don't have proof of that yet we have better um uh we have things like Dave felman's uh lean mass hyperresponders studies where he has a high fat ketogenic diet animal-based diet carnivore diet with a side salad um study where people have you know uh these these cholesterol and LDL scores that are traditionally thought of as elevated for an average of 4.7 years and the actual trend is to actually reduce atherosclerosis not increase so they did not increase atherosclerosis the trend was to reduce atherosclerosis so U and that's looking at actual total plaque burden not just CAC score right so the CAC score just looks at the calcified plaque but that doesn't say anything about soft plaque the soft plaque doesn't show up on a CAC score you need an angiogram to look at that and see how much actual blockages how how much occlusion you have so that's probably the next step for him and um the the you know we still are still waiting on data but you know there are individuals who are yes reducing their CAC score and yes reducing their arterial plaque and yes we have things like the the lean mass hyperresponders showing that that is the trend when people go keto carnivore and and go to a more animal-based approach with ketogenic uh metabolism being in the mix that that does seem to be the trend so it's definitely what I would do um but remember that you know different things can raise the CAC score so if he's going to be um if he's going to be um checking a CAC score again you know it could go up or down independent of the amount of total plaque burden because the soft plaque can can come or go independent of the CAC score right so it's really an angram that he needs to sort of actually quantify the amount of plaque that's there and um but yeah you want that to go away the the there's a there is an Interventional trial an experimental trial that was shown to reverse atherosclerosis and that was meditation so 40 minutes of meditation a day um ongoing you reduce stress you reduce cortisol and that that was actually shown to reverse um atherosclerosis so that's what I would do and I would do that mindful meditation I would chill out I would relax I would um not take medications that increased my CAC score I would get onto a healthy human diet and I would um start exercising appropriately for his uh Fitness and cardiovascular uh level you know what whatever he's capable of doing but you do a little bit more a little bit more you'll be able to do a lot uh a lot a lot more after that and good luck to them then you get tests down the road and just remember these are always snapshots in time so you need to get these things sort of every couple years to sort of see what direction it's going and the CAC score isn't indicative of total plaque burden so just keep that in mind",

    "body": "member says having stance and four years later a stroke is carnivore diet for those um that had these problems my doctor wants to of course go to Staten route well you know the advice your doctor's been giving you has gotten you into the position that you are now and so that's not his fault he's just doing what his overlords have told him and taught him to do which my overlords do at one point until I you know sort of shuck the shackles of um living inside the box of contained human knowledge and actually started thinking for myself and started seeing that um you know what was spoonfed to us in medical school and residency from the sugar from the the the Food and Drug companies is not the uh not the the the way to the road to proper Health um I absolutely think that it's a great idea to go on a cornivore die for everyone you know all human beings should be eating an optimal diet for human beings and I think that all the best evidence shows that that's a high fat carnivore diet as far as cardiovascular disease uh the journal American College of card Cardiology published in 2020 a massive meta analysis and and U statistical review looking uh or systematic review looking at all the best levels of evidence all the best rcts and met analyses of rcts rcts and things like that looking at the connection between um saturated fat and cardiovascular disease and they found no connection whatsoever no association at all between uh increased saturated fat intake and uh the development of cardiovascular disease none and in fact they found an inverse relationship between saturated fat and stroke so they found that the more saturated fat people were eating the less Strokes they were having and the less saturated fat they were eating the more Strokes they were having so um we have just been lied to the first heart attack in America death from heart attack diagnosed on autopsy in America was in 1912 I'll say that again 1912 there was not a single death from heart attack recorded in the literature in America or the colonies preceding it at all none it was 1912 was the first one they didn't believe him they thought he was he got it wrong he just said look we've all we've all been doing autopsies our whole life in our career we're not seeing these things we've never seen these thrw by you know in in the coronary vessels we have all these other pathologies and problems going on in the heart and we've never seen that no one ever sees that you you got it wrong 10 years later more of these are starting to show up and they like oh okay looks it looks like there's something new on the horizon 10 years later it's the number one killer in America right so it went from one single case that no one thought was accurate to 20 years later it's the number one killer in America during that time the 1920s and 30s we're eating the least amount of meat in 200 years in America right we're eating far more meat in the 1800s than we were in the 1920s and 30s right so why wasn't there a single reported case of a heart attack in 130 years before that actually more than that you know in in hundreds and hundreds of years before that when we're eating more meat than in the 1920s right doesn't make sense um there are a few scattered case reports and I mean a few like less than 10 scattered case reports around all of Europe throughout the entire Century the 1800s of people dying from uh heart attack my cardial infarction and I've I've heard of liter one case report presented at a conference in the 1700s of this thrombus in the coronary B Going H isn't that interesting that's weird no one's seen that before isn't that strange right so we could see this people were seeing it when it came up it just didn't come up because it wasn't happening so if this was the number one killer in the world and this was just just dropping like flies you know people had I mean you read the textbook medical textbook from the 1800s very detailed you know I have I have Dr William osler's textbook from the 1800s it was my my great uh my great-grandfather and who was a doctor he's the to date the youngest still to date the youngest ever graduate from Columbia Medical School he's 20 years old when he graduated and he wasn't even able to practice medicine he was like the original Doogie Hower he had to go home and and sit at home for a year uh before he was 21 because in New York you weren't allowed to start your residency until you 21 then he did his surgical residency at Belleview hospital and and was a you know was a a very you know wellth thought of surgeon uh since then and um he I have his textbook from William Osler and it is very detailed doesn't say a single thing about about um heart disease and um and thrombus in the hearts they have all these detailed dissections and these are all the things that go wrong wrong with the heart and this is what it looks like on on dissection nothing about you know things going WR in the coronary vessels and nothing describing the symptoms that you get that someone would get when they Dro dead of a heart attack you we do have 4,000 years ago in the EBR papyrus in ancient Egypt when they were eating a bunch of grain like lots of grains and pressed seed oils and a lot of alcohol beer um they actually described the symptoms that you would get before someone would drop dead of a heart attack they described diabetes they described Alzheimer's Alzheimer's was first described and presented at a case as a case report a single case report of an old lady who had neurocognitive decline presented by Dr Alzheimer's at a at a neurology um conference in 1906 six right so verse one there isn't a single case report before 1906 of anybody having a similar symptoms of dementia none not not until you go back to the EBR Papyrus right that's nuts oh people just weren't living long and the  you know you had the average life expectancy from birth was low that's because three out of five kids were dying in infancy of course the average life expectancy was low but you look at this the the Census Data from the 1800s In America which which I have and it goes by decade because they weren't stupid like the people trying to make that argument from birth the average life expectancy from from birth in 1850s uh was uh like 38 years but if you made it to 10 it was 56 years if you made it to 20 it was longer than that and longer than that and longer than that right so if you got to adulthood you actually lived to be a great age and um and then you know you started get to the point where you got rid of these infant mortality rates you started getting more portable water we understood about microbes and infections and all these sorts of things and that's what dramatically jumped up the um the life expectancy was because we got rid of these these major causes of childhood disease and death and then that made people survive those those um sort of you know watershed moments and got past that and then you you just live a normal life unless you're killed in a war or something like that so people have died of old age actually live very very long time they did not get Alzheimer's they did not get dementia they did not get heart disease so yes this is a very good diet for you uh especially for you because um you know you don't have you don't have room to play around you know and um so you know I've seen some some absolute idiots uh who call themselves cardiologists who say that oh when statins came and we started treating um cholesterol um the life expectancy humans went up by 50 years like these people are just Flatout Liars they're absolute Flatout Liars that did not happen the life expectancy from the 70s to today is pretty damn similar from birth and otherwise right and um it was in the early 20th century and late 1800s early 20th century that you started seeing this massive increase in life expectancy from birth because of those infant mortality rates and getting portable water and not getting sick from all that sort of stuff so you know uh don't don't listen to to idiot they don't ever have anything good to say",

    "body": "Ruth Johnson says or asks diagnosed with brain tumor on the right side 11th or 21st of November um 23 I'm very sorry to hear that um went full on Carnivore loving it so four months in now great um had a follow-up MRI a week ago tumor is shrinking but a lesion is showing up in left Rin well first of all amazing that's absolutely fantastic that the tumor is shrinking but depending depending on the type of tumor you have you know if it's something like a GBM which is the most common cause or the most common um type of primary brain tumor and it's also the most aggressive uh just just understand this like even when we you know it's not it's not like like a melanoma where you you sort of have this thing right here or and you you take it all out if it hasn't spread that's it it's complete cure it's done right GBM seems to be a bit more of a disease process that's going on throughout your brain or it may spread very quickly and and be all over the place but we've we've seen where we've had you know sort of like right frontal lobe you can just take that whole lobe out right if you're a melanoma you can take a big long wide chunk out right you you just cut off your arm if you need to and you just okay that's there's no more of that anywhere else you're just not going to spread or anything like that if you get it early enough right that's a complete cure those cancer cells are gone right you can get another one but those ones are gone doesn't seem to be the case with with GBM so you know you can't and you can't really do that you know if you have like a different part of the brain you can't you can just sort of you know get what you know to be tumor and you just and you and you're GNA have to take brain with that but you you try not to take any healthy brain without GBM in it but you're G to leave some of these things which is why they then do chemo and radiation that's the idea but if you're like in the right frontal lobe you just take that whole thing out you do a l ectomy you just take cut the whole thing out now you got big margins you got this you know this tumor in here and you've got this big wide margin around that and it still comes back they've done hemispherectomies an entire hemisphere just take out all that stuff and it just shows up on the other side right so there's some sort of disease process going on right or this stuff is just sort of has tendrils everywhere and you know it's going to show up so that's uh I'm you know I'm sorry to hear that um but it is it is not uncommon you know that is that is that is sort of what happens with GBM but you're doing what I would do you know which is which is just going full carnivore I would look up the PKD the the the Sophia Clemens I had her on my podcast she is from paleo medicina who's um uh is a is a treatment group in Hungary and they do basically restricted eating you're not eating until fatty meat stops tasting good you're eating less than that and you're adding in organs because you're not eating as much food so you need more nutrient density and they don't they don't fast much but they do limit the amount of food that you take in it is very limited amount because you're trying to starve out this cancer you're trying to keep your gki low you keep your blood sugar low and your ketones high and that's been shown to uh get uh better results with cancer there are you know over a dozen studies with GBM specifically in humans and hundreds and and well dozens anyway way in animals and hundreds and hundreds in in other cancers in in both human and animal trials showing the efficacy and benefit of ketogenic metabolic therapy for cancer but specifically GBM there're smaller studies but they do show benefit and certainly in animal studies they show benefit GBM runs um primarily on glutamine though and so you're going to get that no matter what you do because the glutamine in meat there's glutamine in plants and there's Al you also make it right you make gluc too it's just that you're trying to keep these levels down so you make make some of it but you're not spiking It Up by eating a whole bunch on top of that that's the idea um so I I think there might be an advantage to periods of fasting with a GBM specifically because you are now not taking in any more glutamine um you know talking to Professor SE freed you know he who's who's the main researcher on GBM and and ketogenic metabolic therapy um he is um uh I've well I've sort of heard through the gra FS I've spoken to people that he has spoken to and they've said that he's said so I haven't heard it directed from him so I want people to understand that that I don't I don't want this to be a game of telephone that that gets misunderstood but at a period of time of fasting it actually does uh help with your body's regulation of glutamine and uh what what they were saying was that um between an eight and 14-day fast was a good period to affect glutamine and and to limit the amount of glutamine that um is available for the cancer to make energy and then there's things that can interrupt glutamine metabolism such is Dawn um and I can't quite remember the um chemical name for that at the moment but if I if I remember it I'll say it but it's certainly I mean you can watch it in our interview my interview with Professor Thomas C freed s y f r i d and the substance is d n it stands for you know deoxy something um and um but you can you can take a look at that but either way it's not it's not really it's not really um it's not really something that uh you can get access to um it is something that uh some cancers are licensed for like leukemias and um so you may get lucky you may get an on call ol ologist that would would give it to you there's other other things that have been used in some of these trials um that that are used for other things like antiparasitics such as Fen bendol and mebendazol and this is something that sea freed is is publishing on these things can interrupt glutamine metabolism um and so they they have been used um I think they've been used in animal models but I'm not sure but anyway they interrupt glutamine metabolism it's something that that Dr CED has has um it's publishing on there's a there's a big paper coming out with protocols talking about how to use these sorts of things and discusses then bendol mendol in there that's something that is off label you'd have to talk to your doctor about that see if that's appropriate for you that's something that's going to interfere with medications that you're on or um or if uh you know that you know if your particular uh circumstance would benefit from that or not um but a big thing is keeping that blood sugar down picking that gki down glucose Ketone index down below two that's a therapeutic level below two below one if possible through a combination of a high fat restricted uh carnivore diet like they do hiali medicina you're eating less than you maybe want to and um and periods of fasting potentially as well you need to be careful with fasting and restrictive eating because you don't want to lose too much weight if you start getting too skinny and you start you know getting you know uh too low of body fat percentage you need refeeding days so you need to have a period of time where you sort of refeed and you and you bulk back up so that you're not you're not hurting yourself with that too so good luck with that keep an eye on it it's not the end of the world that little spot showed up on the other side you know it's um good news is it's starting to shrink on that side too I would be very aggressive with um with this and I would sort of throw the kitchen sink at it if it were me and um those are some of the things you do but watch my interview with Professor Thomas caed and wait for that publication it should be coming out um in the next few months anyway we we've sort of sent it for submission we they have I'm I'm like 37th author something on there so um you my contribution is is uh really insignificant but uh you know professor caed and his and his team have done an excellent job it's it's a fantastic paper and uh very long and detail and so hopefully that will be picked up by uh um by one of the major groups and and uh publish soon and people can take a look at that as well good luck with that I I really hope you do well um really be aggressive with this you know it's there's no room for error with this one um there are no cheat days you know you're only cheating yourself and any anytime you eat anything off plan you are feeding that tumor and I would just be like that's just poison to me I'm not I'm not touching any of it you know you need to be really dialed in and there are people that are doing very very well 10 years after their diagnosis and uh with with shrunken or no sign of disease and so um that can be you hopefully too so good luck with that and be very very switched on and dial on to this and um you'll do better when you do good luck um also there's a there's a group out of um I don't know where you're located but um there's a do Hugh U who is doing a a trial on GBM with ketogenic metabolic therapy out of Cedar Cai Hospital metal C Center uh in America so you might be able to get on on board with them and get as part of that trial and that could not only help you but it could help um you know bring this uh information to more people they're trying like a a phase two trial where they're getting like 120 plus people so if you're able to do that um you know please do and um that could be mutually beneficial to both of you",

    "body": "hi doctor I'm a track athlete and I've seen your videos with Ryan talit how much worse is keto diet than carnivore diet uh what benefits wouldn't you find oh gosh so it well it depends on the kind of ketogenic diet you do if you're doing like those sort of like processed food keto diet we're using artificial sweeteners it's garbage it's complete crap I wouldn't do that at all it's not going to be very good at all the only good thing about it is you're going to be eating more meat right you can still get an insulin response and and screw up your energy levels and things like that depends on how much plants you're eating too you know a lot of people they do keto they're just eating tons of plants and veggies because that's where all the nutrients are no that's where all the poison is all the nutrients are in the meat and in the fat and so it it depends it depends on the kind of key diet you you do but I'll tell you this I'll tell you my own experience with this which is I was already doing a ketogenic diet I was I was back from Bangladesh doing uh humanitarian work there and I was you know fat and out of shape and I mean I wasn't like obese or anything well technically was because of my BMI but um you know just I've always been I'm right now I'm I'm obese according to the BMI so um you know then I was I had you know excess fat I wasn't you know extremely big I can still you can still sort of see the the the hints of my six-pack but uh I was very out of shape you know especially for me because I'm I've normally been in very good shape my whole life just because of how active I've been and so I was already doing keto I just gravitated away from carbohydrates because anything containing carbs uh made my back hurt for days and just like my lower back I had really bad lower back pain I was like okay well I don't want that and so I just stayed away from it and then my lower back pain was gone great so I was just eating greens like um and clean real clean I wasn't doing keto I was just not eating carbs and I always ate clean I never ate processed carbs never had artificial sweeteners I just thought they tasted gross and I was never convinced that they were anything but harmful and um just eating spinach kale and broccoli and then lean meat and not all that much of it right because I was trying to slim down get healthy and get back to playing rugby and I felt like garbage I had terrible energy I wasn't losing weight I was lifting weights every day but you know wasn't wasn't feeling great doing it um was just sort of tired all the time hungry all the time and um you know I was just like o not ready not ready to go back and start playing rugby I'm going to need to you know try to get into a bit better shape and then and then see if I can do it obviously the thing to do to get in shape would be to go back to play rugby but that's you know another story um but you know mentally I wasn't there I was like I didn't think that I could do it yet and then I just dropped the spinach kale and broccoli because I was like right I you know plant are toxic we're carnivores we're not supposed to eat this crap got rid of them and um and then I just started eating a lot more meat and it was night and day my my life changed overnight within two weeks I lost 23 pounds and I started shredding fat and stacking on muscle and I felt like a superhero I could work out for hours and hours and hours and hours and never run out of energy and I never got sore and I put that to the test I did 32 sets of heavy legs and I couldn't get I didn't even wear myself out I just had to stop because I've been there for four hours I'm like I got I've got things to do I got to stop this this is non this is I could just keep doing this all night and I wasn't sore the next day or the day after that and then I had one cup of black coffee and I was sore for two days right so I was just like right plants are toxic I'm not touching any of these damn things and um and that was that was it after I did that 32 sets of of legs and I didn't wasn't sore the next day I'm like yep time to go back to play some rugby and I was back and I was at a dead Sprint the whole time I was just like well what should I do you know should I ease into this I was like no screw that you know when I was in between 20 and 25 I felt like a like a superhero I was just I just felt like a like Invincible I never ran out of energy I could just push myself at a dead Sprint the whole time and I never never worn myself out so I'm just going to do that now I was doing carnivore then I'm doing carnivore now let's just do it I was a dead Sprint the whole time keeping it was halfway through the season and I kept up with everybody um that were professional athletes this is you know my my team in Seattle had gone professional was the uh it was already the top team in North one of the top teams in North America we played in the top leagues in in Canada uh the Canadian Premiership and in America in the super league and in uh the you know division one and things like that and um you know uh now we're in the mlr and won the first two years of the mlr right so again top team in North America and I'm in a dead Sprint keeping up with everybody right halfway through the season I haven't done anything in months I hadn't played a full season in three years two weeks later kept doing training I'm still you know fat and out of shape um but I felt like a a million bucks I felt at 38 I felt like I was 22 again I just felt amazing and then two weeks later after you know sort of four training sessions we did a a um fitness test called the modified bleep test and people have played rugby and soccer probably been had to suffer through this thing it was a breeze I finished like in the top five out of 92 people midseason and I've been training for two weeks but I've been carnivore for four weeks and that was the difference it was all diet it was 100% diet and it was dropping damn vegetables that's what did it I was already not eating carbs it was just vegetables and meat and now I'm eating more meat and more fat specifically and I just Dro those damn toxic vegetables and it absolutely changed my life so that is the difference between keto and carnivore it makes a big difference and you'll see a lot of people uh look keto is great but carnivore is better you know you're getting you're getting into the right metabolic State when you're on ketogen on a ketogenic diet you're eating more meat you're eating more fat that those are all really good things right but these plant toxins are are no joke you know oh well dose makes the poison yeah and the dose is really damn small you know uh you can kill yourself you can die from ingesting 50 to uh 300 milligrams of uh cyanide right 0.5 milligrams per kilograms to like 1.5 milligram per kilogram of body weight right so 100 kilo person can die from 50 milligrams of um of cyanide flax seed one serving a flax seed can have as much as six milligrams of cyanide right and we're saying this is a good thing for people to eat a lot of a lot of vegetarians and vegans eat eat flax seed because it has Omega-3s the wrong Omega-3s it has ala not dat or EPA so that's useless for your brain it doesn't convert into DHA and EPA to any significant degree if at all and some have actually shown that you increase ala and actually DHA goes down so good job good job vegans and uh um but uh you know it's not their fault they've just been conned it's it's really the the vegan influencers that are pushing this crap and pushing his information more directing that at but um you know it's um they eat a lot of flax seed because it has is high in ALA right so they say oh you need those Omega-3s so eat that so they eat a lot of flax seed right okay so so 10 servings of flax seed a day which you know it's a lot that can kill you right right so yeah the dose is bloody ass small and that's a lethal dose right long before you get to be a lethal dose you get to um uh you get you know sub sublethal doses that are that are clinically significant that can cause harm and exposure to uh cyan can cause thyroid dysfunction goiters and neurological damage the CDC and the who say there is no safe amount of cyanide to eat right you just don't eat any right why isn't that warning label on on packs of almonds and flax seed and cassava and apples right because the seeds have cyanide so you get there's a study actually that went to smoothie shops around the US and just checked the the cyanide content in the smoothies that they were selling and they were like super high anything that had flax seed almond milk and whole Apples because it gets the seed in they didn't core the apples they didn't take the seed out oh it's easier just to do it oh who cares not that it's not that bad do makes the poison if dose makes the poison then you had better damn well know what that dose is and if anybody ever tells you well dose makes some poison say okay great and what is the dose if they can't say it then you tell them shut up you know they just that's such a stupid statement dose makes the poison then what yeah what's the dose I know the dose do you you know so yeah it's really damn small so um people get a lot of benefit from this you see people doing a ketogenic diet for years maybe and and they're doing really well and they're really healthy and then they go full carnivore and it's just like whoa I had no idea I had no idea that I could feel this much better so it makes a massive difference it will make a massive difference in your athletic uh career as well and uh I absolutely no doubt of that and um uh good luck with you good luck to you also these these hormonal disruptors a lot of these things disrupt your hormones and um they going to screw up your testosterone like Ryan jumped his testosterone from 760 to 1150 you know and I think you tested it a year later right I mean that I mean how much of an how much of a of a benefit is that as as a as a top tier athlete and you just you know nearly double your testosterone levels I me what the hell is that going to do to your performance I me it's going to go it's just going to go crazy right and so you know and uh and it has and you have all these anti-nutrients in Plants as well so you're not going to be able to absorb all the things properly out of your out of your food you're eating a salad with a steak you're that salad is going to make it so you don't absorb all the nutrients properly from the steak and it's going to come with a bunch of of um of oxalates and toxins and lectins and hormonal disruptors so actually makes a big difference between keto and carnivore so uh you know good you know good luck with that I think you'll be very very very uh pleasantly surprised at how much better you feel from going to keto to carnivore especially as an athlete",

    "body": "member says B12 low somewhat anemic until I'm further into eating right with my carnivore diet should I supplement if so with what um well it depends on howow your B12 is I mean there there are levels that you know if you're below a certain level you can actually get demin of your axons you can actually get nerve damage and um since your brain is made out of nerves you get brain damage right so that's not uh that's not what you want so if your B12 levels are or below sort of a critical point I would absolutely advocate for you know taking supplements under the tongue supplements or even getting an injection um so I don't know where you are um but I can give you some some readings that I would consider critically low so for pea moles per liter anything under 400 you can get demyelination of your axons anything under 500 I probably would still start with an injection and um and then just start adding in liver and and red meat and things like that to get your B12 levels up could be that you have a a a you know something like pernicious anemia which is an autoimmune disease which makes it so it's very difficult for you to absorb um uh B12 through your digestive tract and you may need it under the tongue or you may need it injections and so if you eating if you get an injection and you're getting your levels up and then you're eating you know meat and liver and your levels are still coming down down down down down then you need to be checked for your ab absorption issues as well and you may need under the tongue sublingual B12 ongoing uh and then or maybe even injections um and then in uh so those are the numbers for that so peo per liter is the the units generally found in uh commonwealth countries so like England and Australia New Zealand and probably can Canada as well um I believe but maybe not um if not then there they'll be the same as the US numbers us numbers are P grams per milliliters that's pgml and uh under 540 that's the equivalent to under 400 of of of pea moles per liter so that's that's a critical critically low you know really under anything under 6006 50 you should probably entertain uh getting an injection from that that's that's I would consider that critically low even though that's going to be like right in the center or even in the upper half of what the reference ranges are and that's just because everybody's low on B12 you know so everybody's deficient and um so that's what I would do so yeah if you're if you're way too low on some of these things then I would definitely recommend um then I would definitely recommend uh starting with that starting with a supplement to catch you up out of get you out of that critical State and then just eat meat a bit of liver kidney heart to sort of get you up that is a supplement uh in in for carnivores because it's very nutrient dense and so that's what I would do as well so it depends on how low your B12 is if you're low on the their scale you are freaking low and you need to get an injection right away it's not safe to go around with that because you're actually getting brain damage while you're doing that so um don't do that uh there's a study out of Oxford in 2008 2008 they looked at as part of the study they looked at vegans after five years and they found that their brains actually shrank by over 5% so you know oh this is so healthy you can just do this and it's it's perfectly good for you no it really isn't and it's uh it's really bad for you and it's bad for your brain and so they thought now there's going to be a lot of things they're not getting DHA EPA all these sorts of things probably eating a ton of flax seed and getting cyanide poisoning and damaging their their body and their brains for that reason stew but they also have very low B12 they said critically low B12 they thought that that was the main reason because you get demolin of your axons and that can actually shrink the the body of your of your brain and your and your U nerves you actually see this in neurosurgery people are vegans vegetarians their spinal cord thins out because of that demolation from the lack of B12 and um and I've spoken to other neurosurgeons about this is as well you know um that it's not just uh that hasn't just been you know just one or two people that have observed that that's like a common observation in neurosurgery and um so they thought it was because it critically low B12 and the critically low B12 and this was in the UK so those UK numbers was uh you know anywhere from 180 to 190 which is well below that 400 level but in the UK the range is like 130 to 540 right so they're like oh yeah oh that's that's in that range that's in that normal range in Australia it goes down to like 130 so 130 is normal but these people had such critically low B12 that their brain strength by 5% right so that's that's a big deal so if you're low for their scale then you are even lower than that and that can that can cause serious damage to your brain and to your to your nervous system and so I would 100% % uh take supplements and get an injection if that were the case absolutely 100% so um yeah sounds like a good idea all right and then continue on with carnivore diet with liver and uh and if you if and you may need a couple successive shots you may need a shot every couple weeks for a bit to get your your numbers up um you know in Australia and UK you want to be between sort of 800 and 1200 and um and [Music] uh and um you want to be between sort of uh 12 800 and 1200 in um in American numbers you want to be between sort of 1100 and 1600 that's ideal okay so that's GNA be way above their level and your doctor's GNA look at that go oh your b12's way too high this is dangerous no actually it's not it's dangerous that you actually listen to those those reference ranges that are just averages for the community as opposed to uh have reference range for actual health and unfortunately most doctors don't even know that which is scary uh because you imagine that imagine how much like that was revolutionized medicine just that not not even any of the diet stuff or anything like that just you use reference ranges that actually denoted good ranges for health right and just everyone comes back in their bloods just everything's red like oh my God oh God you know like you'd have to do dramatically different things as a doctor to try to correct all these things you know everything was going to be out everything is going to be out and so uh it would be uh that would be a big big shake up to the medical establishment if we just use reference ranges that equated to good ranges for health so yeah if your B12 is in the normal range it's too low basically uh for for um the standard uh average for the community it's just way too low",

put on muscle easier than you ever have in your entire life you need to eat enough though so you have to find different ways different times of getting food in that isn't going to interfere with your workouts you need to have a good five hours between a meal and your workout or you're not going to have as good of a workout if you're eating during the day you can't eat a big large meal that that stuffs you right like you do at night um but you need to eat enough right so you stuff yourself at night after your workouts and after you go home and then in the morning you might have may be hungry again you may need a little bit more maybe a little more in the afternoon then you have your big workout then you eat again after that right so you you at least eat twice a day and you make sure at least your evening meal you eat until fatty meat stops tasting good that's very important if you're not eating enough you won't have building blocks material to put on muscle um can you bulk faster eating carbs sure but that's not muscle say oh you have to put on fat in order to put on muscle total you're putting on fat not putting on muscle you you get intramuscular fat you get intramuscular glycogen that pulls in two molecules of water with each one molecule of glycogen right so you're getting water logged muscles full of glycogen and water and you're getting fat it's called myosteatosis is something that Lane Norton does not understand I I did a post about this Y what is this about basic as biology Lane I mean figure it out I mean this guy I think he's he must be lying about his credentials because no one with a with a degree in Biochemistry should should lack this basic understanding or at least be dumb enough to argue with a doctor who looks at MRIs on a daily basis and says hey we see myosteatosis there's even a name for it uh which is human marbling you get this fat deposition in the muscles and this is why for the same reason that cows get human that cows get marbling myosis because we give them a bunch of grains and sugar and alcohol same thing happens with us and we see this on M so that's what's happening you're bulking with a bunch of carbohydrates and so sure your your muscles are swelling up you're getting fat but your muscles look bigger but then you go and you lean down and oh all your muscles shrink down so they say oh you have to put on fat to put on muscle and then you're going to lose muscle if you're going to lose fat total  you're not losing muscle and you're not putting on muscle you're putting on fat water weight and glycogen and you're losing fat water weight and glycogen that's all there is to it the muscle was never there in the first place it just looked like it was there looked bigger but that wasn't that wasn't muscle that was garbage and so if you're just eating meat you're only putting on lean body mass you're not going to put on 30 pounds and then cut down 20 pounds to get 10 pounds of lean body mass that's not how it works um that's how it works with carbs and so you might it might look like you're gaining more but it's it's Fool's Gold it's gone in the morning right so it's um you know no that's toal total garbage just make sure you're eating enough and working out and you'll get you'll build more muscle than you ever have in your life uh Ryan talbat was running into that he was he sort of losing too much weight and we were just like look you got to eat more you got to figure out when you can stack in your meals because you're just training your ass off you know and you have to do this then you got to the point where he was eating enough and he said he had to actually pull back on his workouts because he was putting on too much muscle right which is pretty good problem to have for a scholarship athlete in college right so you know he's uh and he's he's gotten invited to to uh train try out try out for the Olympics for the Olympic track and field team so this is this is a worldclass athlete and that's what he that's what he found that's what I found and I I've played at the highest levels of rugby as well and those are my experiences this is everyone's experiences and that's the biochemistry and physiology of it you just need to eat enough so you do the workout and you and you push yourself and you just need to eat enough and so Ryan was actually pulling back on his workouts because he was getting too muscular he was getting too big too bulking he's like he had to keep his musculature down so that his his strength to weight ratio was higher so he could go faster and and be more explosive right he didn't just want to be a you know wasn't going for a bodybuilding competition you know um so uh no the Jim B ros are dead wrong on this one",

    "body": "member says I want to lean up and lose body fat I do 5 days of resistance training one hour fasted walks and walks throughout the day how low to reduce fat intake and kilo calories don't don't reduce your fat intake you'll actually stall your weight loss because you actually reduce your metabolism right so if you starve yourself if you chronically limit the amount of food coming in your body just says oh look we're in a famine your body doesn't know you're trying to lose weight or lose body fat it just knows your inputs and no animal is not going to eat its requisite food it's it's a primary food if it's available and it's hungry so your body's telling you to eat and you're not eating so what does that tell your body it tells your body that you don't have access to food that you're in a famine and you can't eat so what does your body do it lowers down your your output you know calories in calories out yeah well depending on what you do and how much you eat you're going to reduce the calories out right so you know people that uh don't understand biochemistry like you know Mr bio you know didn't study bio Lane um uh don't get that you know but you you'll actually reduce your metabolism and you'll suppress your body's ability to um to burn fat and to uh to lose it so you look at the Biggest Loser trials they uh they had the people on The Biggest Loser on the show classic example of you know eat less move more they had a piece of asparagus and a lima bean a day and they're just cranking out cardio all day and yeah you lost weight and people in aitz lost weight too you know it's like yeah fine you know that doesn't mean it's healthy you can chop off your leg you're going to lose weight also like what's your point you know it's not that doesn't mean that that's a good idea and so they they measured their metabolism after this and it completely destroyed their metabolism it was just it was just bottomed out but then they checked in six years later and they found their metabolisms had never recovered and they had all regained weight mostly and some of them like I think some of them retained um the exercise habits and just basically eating you know uh you know grass clippings and and exercising all the time and they may have have kept some of the weight off but most of them regained the weight um and none of them um regain their met metabolic State they all kept their depressed metabolic state so that's exactly the opposite of what you want to do you want to encourage your metabolism you want to show your body you're not in a famine you want to eat until fatty meat stops tasting good you want to lift weights you want to Sprint you want to go you don't jog you go from walking to sprinting and um when you can if you can or you do bike sprints on a on an exercise bike like a stationary bike things like that but just lift weights and um and eat fatty meat until it stops tasting go do not limit it you need fat it's a it's an essential nutrient has essential fatty acids you have to have or you can get sick and die they're essential fat soluble nutrients and vitamins um that you have to have or you can get sick and die so these are very important things I mean vitamin D is a hormone you know you need this stuff and that comes from fatty meat so if you're doing resistance training 5 days a week you're going to put on muscle and so the weight on the scale may not change all that much you oh my God I'm on a weight stall no unless your weight's going up you are losing fat right because if you're if you're lifting weights to that degree and you're eating enough you are putting on muscle on a carnivore diet 100% I'm assuming you're on a carnivore diet because that's why else would you be here but you didn't say it specific specifically so I'm assuming you are um but if you're on a Carnival diet and you're working out 5 days a week you are putting on muscle and so if your weight's not budging much that's because you're losing fat and you're offsetting it with muscle I didn't lose I I lost 23 pounds in the first two weeks just from dropping greens and eating more meat and eating a lot more meat I didn't limit I was already limiting fat and I couldn't lose weight then I ate a lot more meat a lot more fat and that's when I dropped 23 lbs and 10 days really right and then I didn't lose anything for six months right because the scale is useless I was shredding fat and stacking on muscle and I could visibly see that week in and week out I was getting in better and better shape and feeling better and better too and I never really cared about my what I weighed in fact I want to weigh more so I could you know smash people right have more mass to nail people right but um you know I didn't lose any weight and I knew why because I was offsetting the fat I was losing with the muscle I was gaining right it was again just does away with that whole idea you you're either gaining fat and muscle or losing fat and muscle you can't gain muscle and lose fat all you have to do is just eat meat and work out and you'll do it uh straight away um but yeah you don't need to do that and don't do that um you want to be healthy and uh just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good work out and you'll get good results just be patient just focus on your health and um you'll do great don't worry about it uh do you have any n equals 1 success stories on stopping chronic kidney disease progression or even some regaining function U I've got like n equals 97,000 I mean just look up any sort of uh Facebook carnivore group like zeroing in on health or zero carb health and you you'll see literally tens of thousands of people that have done that um and yes i' i' I've personally seen hundreds of people if not thousands of people that have met messaged me but you know so I mean I don't even know how many of my patients that I've personally tested that have improve their kidney they all they all improve kidney function and but also this is in the published literature higher protein diets improve kidney function that's all there is to it that's in the published l iterature so yes

    "body": "Sally says I have no problem quitting carbs at any given time uh I also uh I also still want to eat carbs on anniversary and holidays how can I limit the side effects uh well you really can't limit the side effects of um of eating carbs you just going to you're going to eat the carbs you're going to have the side effects you're going to kick yourself out of ketosis you're going to get sore you're going to depending on the carbs that you're eating you might get you know muscle soreness and other sorts of issues and not feel great and have other sorts of symptoms you know that come along with the you know those grains and seeds and all that sort of stuff that that's come along with it you're not going to feel their best it's probably going to be you know you know four days or so maybe up to a week or two that you're not going to feel your best and um and then it's going to take a while for that garbage to get out of your system going to be four or five days before you're in back in ketosis and proper ketosis and um you know that's just that's just the uh the name of the game you know if you drink alcohol it's going to affect you for a while actually I I find that just drinking clear Spirits one you know one day not even getting you know you know crazy and drunk or anything like that I'm not hung over the next day I'm just tired and I don't have great energy and it affects me negatively for the next three weeks so you know there's no real way to mitigate the carbs you just have to wait for your body to get out of it and get over that shock to your system and that's pretty much it and so you have to sort of decide if that is is worth it to you if that's you know it's not worth it to me like I have no interest in having birthday cakes or anything like that you know it's nice I'm fine to watch other people do it um but I I just don't want to put that stuff in my body I mean it's like saying you know when people ask me it's like well do you have any cheap days or anything like that it's like no even on your birthday even on Christmas and it's just it's a weird thought to me because these are these are things that are really harmful to the body and it makes me feel like garbage and I have no interest in having them and there are things that people have that same feeling towards and they they would just never consider having it and so I put that into perspective and I say okay well do you do you smoke meth and they're like no God no I was like well well even on your birthday even on a special occasion well what about Christmas you know and it's just like you know if this is something you have no interest in doing then no you don't want to you don't want to do it on your birthday either so this these aren't things that I'm just like oh gosh I just wish I oh God I wish I could just have it and I and I just hold myself from doing it like I have no interest in eating this stuff because I know how bad they are for me and I have and I feel very different when I have them and I just like no I don't I don't want to eat them I don't want to have them in my body um and so that's the thing so that's but if you know you haven't gotten there yet and you haven't sort of seen that you know you have something on your birthday or something like that and you feel like trash and you just go like yeah maybe you know I don't want to do this next year you know and uh and you might get there as well but you know if you want to if you do that occasionally that's to completely up to you and uh and some people do um but uh you're just going to have to wait it out you know it's just it's going to be a little while before it works out of your system and then you get back to where you want to go and that's you know that's that's it so it's just that you got to take it on the chin and um you know and that that's what it is it's just you're going to have these negative effects it's going to take a while for your body to work it out it will work it out eventually but you won't feel your best during that time and there's no real way of mitigating that it's just the way of mitigating it is to to not do it or to eat less of it and not do it again that's the main thing your body will get rid of it but it just takes time and um it's you have to ask yourself if it's worth it to me it's not worth it and people say well you're so you know you're so uh dedicated and and um and have so much self-control and I say no actually I I don't doesn't take any dedication or self-control to do exactly what you want to do it takes no self-control for me to not shoot heroin like it's just like I'm not going to do that you know it's just well what what what if someone's there and they just offer it to you yeah no I no I don't want to do that so that doesn't take any self-control to not do something that I have no interest in doing and that's exactly what it is for for the way I eat this is this is what I found to be the healthiest way that I can eat and I feel the best on it as well so I have just no interest you know if other people want to do that then that's fine me personally I have no interest and um you know so it's it's very easy for me to to not want to do that in those in those situations",

    "body": "Member says thoughts on allulose and the data showing that increases gop1 and inhibits hormone glucagon um Dr bigman videos are drawing a lot of attention to it so I I don't know all all that much about it you know I have a lot of respect for Dr bman I think he's he's he's fantastic um but I I you know I work on the on on the principles that you know I don't want to put anything in my body that doesn't belong there and um you know where was allulose in the you know the mammoth hunting days of your uh you know mean what something didn't exist and wasn't a regular part of our diet in our life 50,000 years ago during an ice age I probably don't want anything to do with it um that's me personally you know some things can be used medically and so if there was some sort of reason you wanted to get the effects of that allulose and from a medicinal standpoint you know that's something you could consider but as far as just eating and uh and have you in your daily life I don't see I don't see the benefit of adding in things that don't belong and at the end of the day it is a chemical that has chemical reactions in your body as we can see it increases potentially increases glp1 and inhibits glucagon okay so that's having excitatory inhibitory mechanisms in your body is that really what you want is that something that you want to do in your body you know so we say oh we get this sweet taste great but it's not sugar so that's okay oh and it does these other things are those things that you want are those the only things that it does and um do you know so we're chemical factories we are not combustion engines we're not steam locomotives we burn things up and so you put chemicals in your body they're going to have chemical reactions and these chemicals increase gp1 and inhibit glucagon maybe maybe they do more things too so on that principle I just avoid these things because that's that's not something that that's disrupting your natural biochemistry so I don't I don't F I don't think that's a great idea if you are otherwise healthy and if you don't want your you know if you're disrupting your biochemistry because you're eating a whole bunch of other crap could the disruption that allulose gives be beneficial in that circumstance potentially but that's like you know giving somebody you know metformin or something other sort of medications for diabetes or you know OIC or something horrible like that um in certain circumstances right because um you know you're doing something to your body and now you're trying to sort of counter that with some sort of drugs okay well just if you're not doing anything un to your body in the first place then you don't necessarily need that anyway so all things being equal when doing a carnivore diet and you're only eating meat I don't think you need to add these sorts of things in there and um you know we're talking about something sweet I mean you know is that really that important to you that you just need something sweet you you know is that something that could you know trigger car you know cravings and you want more sweet things you want more sweet things and so you end up starting craving those things I mean I just I don't know why I don't know I personally don't care to go down that route at all I mean even when I drink milk it tastes like I'm drinking ice cream it's so sweet to me and that's very compelling for me I want more of that and so adding that back in it's just not you know adding in like another compulsion that I want more of something like that's that's to me that's something I I immediately want to avoid and uh for myself and you know we're saying that that well Al it's not sugar and it's not these other things and it's just like okay so it's it's okay and you know you're trying to get off cocaine and so you decide to snort riddlin instead it's like well it's not cocaine it's not cocaine it's it's it's actually better for you it's a medicine it does these things it's like yeah maybe but you know wouldn't you be better off just getting completely out of the situation in the first place and it's not to say that you know alul is the same it's not it's a it's a loose metaphor but it's the same idea you you're trying to replace something harmful with something that you believe is less harmful but is it less harmful or is it just not harmful is it beneficial that's that's the only thing I care about you know I I don't want to put something in my body that's not beneficial you know I don't want to eat something just because it's not as bad as something else I don't want to put anything bad in my body because um you know why would you you know I mean this is this is the vessel that you're in this is this is everything and if you don't have your health you don't have anything you know I mean you know we all have uh have or have had elderly relatives or have seen people in the later stages of their life that are you know not doing so well maybe aren't as healthy as they could be and that's difficult and that's really hard to see your loved one go through that and then you know doing things that so so you know and I want to help them as much as I can and get them as healthy as possible so they can get their quality of life back but also for myself like I don't I don't ever want to end up there I want to be just healthy all the way through and then just one day go to sleep and just not wake up you know and that's what most animals do in captivity they're just healthy healthy healthy adults and then they just one day they just don't don't wake up again and they do that in the in the too if they if they don't get eaten by something so you know adding in things like alose you know just because it may not be as bad of something than something else and you could do that but um we don't know all the things it does we do know it has chemical interactions in your body that's you know part of the the argument for having it and um what else is it doing and do you want those effects maybe maybe not for me I ca n I can do without",

    "body": "member says 5'9 male 30 years old weigh about 190 lbs overweight I'd say consistently losing weight and want to reach 160 to 170 range um want to do carnivore uh diet to treat IBS um but in a dilemma is not sure um what weight loss uh continue on here is going to look like on Carnivore like how quickly and consistently can I lose weight compared to what I'm doing now which is rabbit diet losing weight in a consistent manner any suggestions a lot of people lose a lot of weight on um a carnivore diet and the thing is if you're on a rabbit food diet you'll lose weight just like you anyone can starve themselves into smaller smaller um clothing size but you know it that's not necessarily what's healthy um you we see this in concentration camps all the time it does work you can starve people to death if you want but it slows down the metabolism because your body is trying to stop you from dying and it says oh look we're in a famine we're not getting food we need to slow things down we need to decrease the amount of energy output and that slows your metabolism so you will lose weight um and and weight being the key thing there because you can lose lean body mass as well you can lose muscle and bone as well as fat so do you want to lose weight or do you want to lose fat for me I think that losing the fat part of that would be the ideal part of that equation and you wouldn't want to lose lean body mass and you actually want to gain lean body mass so a lot of people do that on a cornivore diet they actually lose fat gain muscle gain bone density and that's good that's really good and so the weight on the scale sometimes doesn't shift as much or maybe it stalls oh it's I'm not losing any weight it's like okay well how do you feel I feel great are you working out yeah lift weights four days a week and do Sprints okay so are your clothes fitting differently yeah I've going down like a belt loop every couple weeks well you're losing fat then aren't you you know you're just replacing it with muscle and so you know that's what it's really about people lose a lot of weight on a carnivore diet um the vast majority of people will lose a significant amount of weight and it actually ramps up your metabolism so you increase your metabolism you don't depress your metabolism because what you do with a rabbit food diet so yeah you'll lose weight because you're starving yourself but as soon as you start eating real food again your body thinks okay we are still in a famine and we need to store this and and store up um for the next famine because whatever food comes in boom that's going into fat because we need to store this we need to take care of this and um that's what you end up doing whereas with a carnivore diet you're giving yourself proper nutrition and it actually encourages your metabolism and some people actually put on weight but it's like small percentage of people and the majority of people lose weight very quickly and do very well with it um the other people that have sort of metabolic issues and hormonal issues that can they you sometimes test for you can see like o okay you know this might be this might be why you know they're they're having trouble but um you can see that you sign post and say hey look you know your leptin is hugely elevated and you have insulin resistance and all these other sorts of things and so these are signs of of a depressed metabolism and you have these hormonal imbalances that can make make it difficult for you to lose weight early on but these will all come down on a carnivore diet and when they do come down you start to see more and more rapid weight loss and then you get you know you get a lot of weight loss after that so you'll lose weight you know depending on where you are you've been starving yourself and your metabolism is what it is you may you may just consistently lose weight or you may body may say oh oh dear God we need to we need toore some fat because we're in a in a famine but at the same time you'll increase your metabolis eventually you'll encourage your body and um you'll lose weight and you'll lose fat in particular and you'll put on muscle especially if you work out especially if you're living weight especially if you're sprinting and so that's what I would do you know because this is about health it's about long-term health and sort of laying down the patterns of behavior that that will keep you healthy for the rest of your life and so that's what you want to do and it will treat your IBS like your IBS will go away soon as you stop eating plants like it's crazy and so and you'll also lose weight and you'll gain health and you'll gain muscle so I I mean that that is what I would recommend anyway um guys seem to have uh sort of got the long end of the stick on this one um when I see people stall with their weight loss um actual fat loss it's typically women but even then it's it's a it's the minority most people lose weight but you look at Kelly Hogan and she actually put on weight for 6 months and she she said it wasn't all muscle you know I was like was definitely gaining fat and but her health was getting so much better her skin was better her she had boils all over her body they were gone now and she felt much better then after six months then it started going and she started losing a lot of weight so something needed to change in her body her body was healing from something hormones were improving and you just needed to get that pattern of behavior just eating meat until it stops tasting good and eating enough and getting rid of all the other stuff and sodas diet drinks all these sorts of things and you get rid of all that and then you uh and then she started all of a sudden started losing weight and losing weight and losing weight and losing weight and after a couple years she was down to a very very slim uh slim physique and doing great so uh that'll happen for you and most most guys I mean I I had a guy who had uh quite elevated leptin it's like in in the 80s over a 100 and and bariatric surgeons often say that you cannot lose weight without surgery you will not lose weight if you don't get surgery which is not true I've plenty of patients with leptin over 100 that could lose weight but it it took a while they were the slower ones and um and but when that leptin came down then they really started getting better and it's all about health anyway you're improving your health and their health was certainly improving their autoimmune issues were going were going away but this guy had left him like in the 80s um that a lot of people that they won't lose weight very quickly until that comes down um and his insulin fasting insulin should never be above nine really or even six or seven his fasting in was 72 right so his his metabolism was very depressed and he actually lost like you know a big chunk of weight like in the first month you know it actually started very quickly for him so um it you know most people will still lose weight either way there are a few people for whatever reason have a bit slower weight loss but eventually they it all it all comes together and all their metabol metabolic issues and hormonal issues sort themselves out and they just get better and lose weight so yeah I think I would expect that to happen to you and your health issues more importantly will get better",

    "body": "hi doc from Adelaide um 58-year old female B6 is High um hidden as p5p in support or in supplements short-term use swapped out beef for lamb to reduce daily in intake any tips fatigue muscle joint pain vitamin seed deficient to um is there a link um so I I I don't I don't think there's any any issues with with vitamin C anyway we don't need Vitamin C to make collagen you make all the collagen you need from uh you know the the proteins available and the collagen available in the meat that you're eating and so you don't you don't really need it for that anyway and also um your your body absorbs more vitamin C when you when you don't eat carbs and there is Vitamin C in in meat there's actually more vitamin C per gram of liver than there is in apples so you know if you want if you are concerned about your vitamin C issue you know add in some some liver things like that um you know as far as B6 um you know being High um you know High according to to who because you know all these different B vitamins um or all these vitamins in general are are generally um are generally um well the the the reference ranges are for the average person in the community that's how these reference ranges are made and so the average person is Mal nervous and sick and so that's not who you want to be comparing yourself to especially for nutritional deficiencies when everybody's nutritionally deficient and so if you're high probably means you're normal so for like B12 here in Australia the reference range is anywhere from like 130 to 650 or 670 but what I would say is an actual optimal range is 800 to 12200 so that entire range is out of range right and so they get up to you know 700 and that's like oh my God that's too high your B12 is too high right uh actually it's not high enough it's actually still low and then in the UK it goes up to 540 right that's even less so you even get up to 650 which is normal for a lot of labs here in Australia that's too high in UK oh my God it's too high no we have we have absolute levels here that you know I shouldn't say absolute but there are levels here across Humanity that you know below this and above that it's better you know better or worse right so below 400 has been shown to in Australian numbers been shown to cause uh um demolation of your axons right and um and so that can cause nerve damage cause brain damage cause brain shrinking and and um shrinkage of your spinal cord and things like that um so so you know that's obviously very important right um and so that's within that that range right you go from 130 that's normal 131 that's normal but below 400 can cause brain damage so that's not normal it's just the norm right it's just the average for the community but the average person is unwell and so that's not who you want to judge yourself against so you know I don't I don't know off the top of my head the the reference range for B6 I don't check it all that often but if you're if you're slightly high for the Australian reference ranges I I would probably say that that's good a good thing you know I have I have patients that you know like my B12 is high but it's not high it's it's exactly where it should be I don't supplement I just eat normal normal food for a human and uh you know my B12 is you know up above 800 that's exactly where it's supposed to be you you have in some liver you'll definitely be over over that um so I wouldn't worry about it too much the main thing with B vitamins is you want to keep them all relative you want to keep them all sort of balanced because if you get a a one of them way out of balance with all the others that can cause a relative deficiency in the others it's a bit weird they but they all go together and so you want you want all these things coming together so if you're just taking like thiamine on its own you know probably shouldn't do that outside of you know specific um you know medical conditions like someone who has you know alcohol withdrawals and things like that or like you know wores in keytis or something like that some sort of you know alcohol driven thyine deficiency you're sort of getting that up um but you want to keep all these things in Balance so just eating real food and eating meat eating some liver every now and then uh you don't have to have much but but um you having some is usually good especially when people are starting out because everyone's nutritionally deficient if they you know that's what that's what we see in the reference range is everyone's in a state of nutritional deficiency so we're calling nutritional deficiency normal um so obviously that's not normal and so everyone's deficient so you know starting out on a carnivore diet having more Nutri intense things like a bit of liver kidney heart probably a good idea and it'll catch you up or some dead you if you have you're really low you know taking B vitamins or taking I mean liver is a B vitamin supplement but some people you know bulk at that um and but if you're like super low on B12 for instance you get nerve damage like you should probably get a get an injection if it's too low you know like here in Australia I'd give someone an injection if it's below 500 definitely you know that's way too low certainly if it's under 400 I mean that's critically low that's that's that's a true deficiency so if you're a bit high on the B6 probably wouldn't worry about it I probably consider that pretty much normal um for most of these things they are normal if you're above their range so keep that in mind and just try to keep all the other be bees in in um balance as well and that's probably more of an idea the issues with fatigue and muscle and joint pain is a bit weird I wouldn't I I don't know of that being associated with high B6 um but you know I would I would imagine that would probably be something else joint pain fatigue muscle pain um probably something else I mean it can be all sorts of things getting out of your system I don't know how how long you've been doing sort of carnivore um or if you're fully carnivore or whatever but you know you just get rid of everything except meat and water that tends to help a lot with pain uh fatigue can be a lot of different things could be dehydration can be that you're not fully fat adapted yet could be that you're not eating enough could be that you're not eating enough fat either and so there's a lot of these things that you can adjust for as well um I have a a video on frequently ask questions on a carnivore diet and and the Standalone one on feeling tired on a carnivore diet and that can um s go through some things you just sort of try they're very simple things but you know worth going through and to see if they help and um otherwise if you're just eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good then uh and you're just drinking water and nothing else you know you your body should sort itself out fairly you know and you know at some point anyway usually people take week some people take months some like three months some people as much as six months but then they they all come through and they feel a lot better so just just um you know address the things that you can address and optimize the things that you can that need optimizing and go from there",

    "body": "mmeber says mom had breast cancer cut out at an early stage avoided chemo the cancer was caused by high estrogen she eats lowfat High plant-based diet and also suffering from weak bones she has also had gallbladder remove uh help please yeah so you know I mean it is the case that you know plants use estrogenic disruptors they have um hormonal disruptors and a lot of those mimic estrogen and so soy milk or soy in general has a lot of estrogen so three ounces of soy has about half the amount of estrogen that a fertile woman would make in a day and about you know eight eight or nine times as much um uh estrogen as the birth control pill so it's a lot of estrogen uh in fact this is in the published literature that men have actually grown breasts by drinking as little as eight glasses of soy milk a day or as much as a class of s milk a day because that's horrifying but that's how much estrogen is in there flax seed as well tons of estrogen and a lot of other things as well have high estrogen meat does not have high estrogen meat has unpro un hormone treated non- hormone treated beef for 3 ounces of lean beef has about 1.3 nanograms of estrogen it hormone treated be beef has 1.9 nogs okay so it's a 50% increase but Soy has 200,000 nanograms per 3 ounces right and a birth control pills 35,000 and a woman makes nearly 500,000 so you know big difference there you know meat does not contribute to to um UNT estrogen levels it just it just optimizes hormones in in everybody um if eaten on its own so low fat not a great idea either you need the fat it's very good for your body it's very good for your brain your brain's made out of it um and she has weak bones because she's doing that unfortunately the body is is made out of meat and we need certain specific nutrients really from meat that are going to help us build and maintain meat and we we can't do that from Plants we don't make we don't you can't it's very difficult to turn plant tissue into animal tissue it's completely different form of life and um you know some animals can do it but we are not those animals and so the reason she has weak bones is because she's eating these plants they have a lot of antinutrients things like oxalates which strip out the calcium from her blood and so in order to not die her body strips calcium from her bones to raise her calcium levels in her blood again because under a certain level of calcium your heart stops goes into tetany just locks up it just cramps it's like a giant muscle cramp but it's your heart right so that's game over right there and so that is is a direct consequence of eating these plants and getting these anti-nutrients in the plants and so if she removes those plants she starts eating fatty meat which is what we're biologically designed to eat she will reduce her estrogen load from those phyton phytoestrogens and she will improve her bone density I have seen people with osteoporosis elderly ladies with osteoporosis reverse that in a year of a carnivore diet with resistance uh exercises the resistance is important because you're pushing through the your body heals in line heals and grows in lines of stress so you you work on a muscle in a certain direction you're working that muscle that muscle grows it's working the bones in there too you're stimulating the bones to grow and to support that direction of movement and force and weightbearing right so you need the you need the stimulus but you also need the the right nutrition and you need to stay out of your own way you know look up pottinger cats it's very interesting they fed cats cooked meat and raw meat had massively different Health outcomes the cooked meat cats were far less healthy and each generation they got smaller and smaller brains less developed skeleton smaller stature and um and and poorer health and less bone mineralization so exactly the same amount of calcium in cooked meat as raw meat but just something about the nutrition changed and their body wasn't able to mineralize the bones properly went from like 14% first gener you know starting out to then 7% big drop and then the next generation was 3% and and the researchers said their bones were like consistency of foam rubber when they looked at them on autopsy that's pretty crazy and some of these poor little kittens had like upwards of 30 fractures at any given time it was horrible and that's what you're doing right if you you disrupt how your body normally works your body can't work properly and so even if there's enough calcium available your body's just not able to regulate it properly like the like in poers cats so that's what you need to do no gallbladder why why does she have no gallbladder because she's been eating a lowfat diet your gallbladder stores bile but it concentrates there because you don't necessarily get you know predators don't necessarily eat every day and so you have to you have to sort of store this stuff and concentrate it so that you have a lot available so that when you do get food you can absorb a lot of fat you can absorb as much fat as your body needs in that one go and if you just don't eat fat or eat very little fat it sits there and it gets more and more concentrated and what happens any hyperconcentrated solution at rest forms crystals forms precipitate right that's what bile sludge is that's what gallstones are and so that's why she had that you know if you eat enough fat as in as much fat as your body has B for it's physically impossible to form a gall stone even if you were going to form a stone in one day which you don't that wouldn't be compatible with Life you'd be dead in the womb that that you know even then if you just ate enough fat that you had all the fat that you had bile for every day it still wouldn't form Stones you couldn't do it there is no bile in the gallbladder to form a stone so unfortunately the reason that she doesn't have a gallbladder anymore is because she's she was following the diet that she is currently following right now and so that hasn't done her any good and I'm sorry to say it probably led to her cancer as well if you have healthy mitochondria you can't get cancer a lot of these plants have have toxins that directly damage the mitochondria and there's a lot of other things as well um there's there's um genetic issues that can cause damage to the mitochondria also other environmental things but also just not being in a ketogenic metabolic State you you your insulin is high all the time and you can't go about autophagy and replacing your mitochondria as you're getting sort of broken down and broken down and broken down you eventually you need to replace them you say okay well that one's that one's junked we need to scrap it and make a new one right that's called autop that's part of autophagy it's called mitophagy and you don't need to fast to do that you just need to stop eating carbs because it's insulin High insulin blocks autophagy and so if you just get your insulin down you're an autophagy and mitophagy all the time and so in three four months on a on a carnivore diet a ketogenic meat-based diet like a carnivore diet Studies have shown that you'll have four times the number of mitochondria and they're four times as effective so you'll keep your mitochondria healthy you keep your body healthy you'll keep your brain healthy and and you generally won't get cancer because you're not you're not doing the things that insult your body to the extent that they're going to get cancer having a gallbladder removed now is still not a problem going carnivore even high fat carnivore because her liver is still making bile it's just that it's making it in a just dripping out constantly so she may have to split up her fatty meals if she get eats a you know more fat and she gets basically loose jewels from that that's because her body just wasn't able to absorb that fat and it just comes out fine okay so don't eat as much fat split that up throughout the day but a lot of people form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is an out pouching of the common bow duck it works exactly like a a gallbladder does and so she may have that so if she eats a big meal with fat in it and she doesn't get loose stools doesn't like you know running to the toilet you know 30 minutes later then then that's probably what happened and she'll she'll be fine so just just listen to her body but hopefully she hears this and listens to this and gives it a try because I think it will absolutely revolutionize her health",

    "body": "member says on the sad diet um cholesterol was 218 HDL 62 LDL 129 triglycerides 130 glucose 129 A1C 58 versus carnivore for 46 days cholesterol um slightly up HDL slightly up LDL slightly up uh triglycerides down glucose down A1C down are these values okay my doctor has gone up is g to poop out a satin uh no I look I think those are those are excellent remember cholesterol was never the cause of heart disease so we we need to stop thinking in that mindset you know we're we're still you know we're still sort of slaves to that idea that the Sugar Company pumped out there uh that's complete complete fiction you know it was never it was never the cause of heart disease that was that was it was just blame was cast on it to try to take the blame off of sugar and and to point people's eyes in the different R it was a red herring you know that's it and we know that now you know we know that they that they were pushing this out there just like the tobacco companies were putting out false information and studies to to make it look like tobacco wasn't a problem and smoking wasn't a problem and of course it was and of course sugar is and all this junk food garbage that doesn't belong in the human body and you can oh well these studies I don't give a what your study says were we eating it 50,000 years ago during an ice age yes or no if no then don't eat it especially if it wasn't if we weren't eating it 500,000 years ago during an ice Agee when we were evolving into what we are now you know if we haven't evolved to eat it if we're not biologically designed to eat it you shouldn't eat it it's all there is to it you know so you know just uh um you know I wouldn't um you know I wouldn't uh uh you I I wouldn't eat anything that's not biologically sign for you know you know you studies you don't ask a bunch of you we don't ask you know 50 Jaguars what they ate last year and you know see what they you just look at what Jaguars eat in the wild you know you don't need a study to tell you that you don't need like a like an experimental data set you know you just what the hell do Jaguars eat what do what do elephants eat you know you feed them something else or they get sick yes they do okay well don't do that then right so same applies to us that's the only thing you need to know about human nutrition is what have humans been eating the longest and that answer is meat and and that's what we do best on and so that's all you need to know about but yeah no you're looking great so total cholesterol is associated with longevity and living over 100 right High total cholesterol um high LDL cholesterol is also associated with longevity as well higher LD HDL and lower triglycerides is associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk and metabolic health so all those things are great and your glucose is right down and that's the M main thing because diabetes increases your risk of of developing heart disease by a th% that's up there with smoking a metabolic syndrome which you would get if you had low HDL high triglycerides and then diabetes and high blood pressure and all these other things that increases It Again by another 600% right and so even if you had like sdldl and all that sort of stuff which you don't because you have um High HDL and and um and low and lowering triglycerides you know that um you know even if you did that would only increase your risk by 70% right so the hell are we even talking about here you get rid of those other things you get rid of the of the diabetes you get rid of the metabolic syndrome that's what's reducing your risk and you know what the same things that reduce di get rid of diabetes and metabolic syndrome also get rid of the sdldl um you know there's some people out there that are that are just lying and saying that oh the carnivore patients you know raise their sldl and their blood sugar goes up to total  and anyone who says that just call them a liar they are absolutely lying um it's just people trying to spread misinformation um you see it right here in your Bloods 46 days and you have exactly the opposite of what these people are lying about and saying and they're saying oh well you should still do an animal- based diet eat a lot of meat but don't have it be Carnival have veggies and this is that and whatever the hell they they're pushing out there it's nonsense you know just and and anytime you see that call it out because that's that's really really dangerous misin inform that they're putting out there and it's it's just total lie I I I absolutely don't believe a single person that says that you there's a guy saying that all my patients they do 100% carnivore 100% of them get you know 100% of my 100% carnivore patients get nutritional deficiencies and uh diabetes and and their sdldl goes up  anybody who says that is a liar and I'll say that to their face in public in front of their mother they are a liar and an for trying to to for trying to spread that sort of Mis information that hurts people and so you know tell them I said that please because that's total you're doing fine um all of your numbers are improving they're going in the right direction um higher LDL I think is beneficial um but it's whatever your body wants it to do that's what it's supposed to be because this is we're talking about eating what you're physiologically designed for your body's going to do what it's phys logically designed too LDL goes up a bit that's because it wants it to be go up a bit we're looking at this um from from the lens of cholesterol causes heart disease it doesn't so um you know watch my my you know video on the truth about cholesterol and heart disease I go into a lot of this watch Dr Paul Mason's videos on saturated fat and cholesterol and heart disease and all these sorts of things um oh who is it oh gosh why can't I remember his name uh Malcolm Kendrick Dr Malcolm Kendrick in the UK wrote a book called the clot thickens calls all out all this stuff out you know it's it's total crap Dr Sima HRA wrote a book called A statin-free Life calls it all out too it's garbage it's absolute garbage and uh you know so don't worry about it too much and at the end of the day you know your doctor obviously well-meaning watch the best for you and we'll we'll suggest recomend and recommend medications that he thinks are the best for you but the end of the day it's your body you don't have to take medication that you don't want to uh legally and and ethically like you just you take what you want to take you take what's right for you and if you talk to your doctor and he makes a case that's convincing to you and you say like okay I think this is going to benefit me then that's when you take medication if you don't think it's going to benefit you and you think that it's it's going to be negative for you then you don't take it you definitely don't take it that is um that is not a good idea",

    "body": "hi doctor can you please discuss coming off allopurinol while on Carnivore well if you're not having I mean Al allopurinol is typically prescribed for gout and so if you're not having a gouty attack then you know you can you can try coming off and and see how you go the uh some people get freaked out because early on when people go on any ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet their uric acid levels go up and that's because ketones and uric acid compete for elimination in the kidneys and so if you have if you're not keto adapted and you have very high ketones because you're not using them very well you're going to spill some out in your urine and that's going to that's going to block out some of the uric acid and so you're just going to have a bit more that doesn't mean you're going to get gout there's actually very weak association between serum uric acid levels and uric acid gout now remember there's five kinds of gout only one of them is uric acid now they call the other four pseudo gout but they used to be called gout and one of those causes were oxalates the only way to tell the difference those five different causes is by sticking a big old needle into that joint and taking out an aspirate and and testing it no one does this because it's already horribly painful they're not going to stick in needle it and make it more painful so they just say it's it's uric acid has to be there's nothing else it could possibly be and and give you allopurinol and that's of course wrong you know it's it's only 20% chance that it's um that it's uh uric acid and again lowering uric acid levels in the serum doesn't necessarily do anything for the uric acid in your joints if indeed there's any uric acid in your joints so you might see your uric acid come up in your serum but after a few months several months you'll see the uric acid levels come back down to normal levels as you become keto adapted and your body uses those ketones more effectively and you don't start and you don't spill them out in your urine this is why people that have been in a ketogenic state for a long time they don't find any urine ketones which is why that's not a very good marker of being in ketosis or not because you're not supposed to spill out ketones in your urine you're wasting energy this is why the whole thermodynamics calories in calories out you can't destroy energy yeah but can piss it out right and so if you're peeing out glucose and peeing out ketones you are literally peeing out energy and that energy does not get stored type 1 diabetics if you don't have insulin you eat 50,000 calories a day 100,000 calories a day 50 billion calories a day if you don't have insulin you will not store fat period right and you'll pee it out right you'll pee out glucose you pe out ketones so uh yeah you're not destroying the energy it doesn't disappear goes down the toilet bowl so um if you are well adapted into into a ketogenic diet your uric acid level should be down fairly normally anyway allopurinol isn't probably going to be very useful some people find if they have gou they may have a a flare up or two in the early stages of converting to a keto carnivore diet so maybe if you feel more comfortable doing it stay on your allopurinol for a few months make sure that you're not having any outbursts or out or flareups and if you're not and you're feeling good then you can you can try coming off of them and uh you know if you're concerned about it you can always ask your doctor but um you know allopurinol is not like you know these these psychoactive medications that you have to be slowly weaned off of them um and so you know it's something that's uh if if you don't need it anymore is is very easy to to come off of so I basically what I generally recommend is you know work with your doctor but if you if you've gone several you know few months several months without any sort of gouty attacks that's a perfectly reasonable time to to talk to your doctor about you know coming off of those sorts of medications to see if you even need them at all and so that's what I would do",

    "body": "hi doctor I am in recovery from anorexia and I wanted to know if this diet could help with my low testosterone any advice would be appreciated as my doctor wants me to eat carbs thank you uh yeah I mean you know anytime you're coming from from you know disordered eating especially you know things like anorexy where you're eating very small amounts are just like look you just need to eat everything well that sort of the problem in the first place wasn't it you know you were eating everything and that wasn't working and people were feeling sick and they were gaining weight they were like well that's not going to work and then so you went sort of on the other end so you know just going back is is sort of disordered in the other direction you know you're just telling yourself it's okay even though you're getting you know results that you you may not find favorable so I I think it's I think it's uh a very good solution to be on Carnivore in this situation I've seen a lot of people who formally had anorexia fix their condition and and feel a lot better obviously physically but also mentally that they didn't have to to worry about um you know limiting and restricting because they they could just you know eat lot of meat and and and feel great doing it and so you know they were they they were happy to do that um as far as low testosterone yeah absolutely I mean it's that's the only thing that's going to help your testosterone carbs are not going to help your testosterone uh you know going ketogenic can help your testosterone and getting enough meat and fat and cholesterol is what's going to help your testosterone because testosterone is made from cholesterol all your your sex steroids hormones are made out of cholesterol and um you know and it's like it's a major portion of it you know 95% of the of testosterone molecule is cholesterol you know so it's just a couple little additions that that change it up so cholesterol is extremely important and and you get that from from eating meat and being and being healthy and eating a proper human diet so I would absolutely do that so my patients that that go onto a carnivore diet with a lot of fat you know the Fat's very important for your overall health and and particularly your hormonal Health that they uh they improve their their testosterone dramatically and um you know including you know eggs are great in there too eggs have a lot of cholesterol and saturated fat and those sorts of things which are surprise surprise good for you that's why they're in eggs because they're good for animals and that's why they make up building blocks in the physical structures of a baby right and that's why you know eggs have a lot of saturated fat and cholesterol because the body needs saturated fat and cholesterol and that's why uh breast milk is has the highest concentration of saturated fat and cholesterol of any food in nature because you need it and and babies in in particular because their brains are growing and their bodies are growing it's very very important so um yeah I would uh I would just keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good just like just like uh everybody would in other situations and um and uh yeah and and then just see how you go I would I would be shocked if your body didn't start improving uh your uh from all standpoints but especially your your testosterone as well that'll come up sometimes it takes a while for your body to turn on you know so give it a few months uh always check it in the morning first thing in the morning is when you're going to have highest levels of testosterone so always check it at the same time every morning because if you check it at different times you know check once later in the day you're you're always going to have relatively less testosterone than you would have other other wise and so you check it first thing in the morning fasting from the night before 9:00 p.m. only water after that only water in the morning no coffee te vitamin supplements medications until after you take that blood test between 8 and 9:00 a.m. uh get a good night's sleep for several days before no stress no exercise and no sexual activity for 48 hours before your test you do that in that way and that and don't take biotin don't take B vitamins that contain biotin biotin is a B vitamin so any um any B multivitamin or B complex or multivitamin will have Biotin in it and so just don't take that don't take that for uh you know five days before really and um and then you'll you'll get very consistent numbers you'll be able to track what you're doing and and be able to do that more accurately if you do that inconsistently you'll get inconsistent results and it may be that your numbers are changing that and it doesn't have anything to do with your actual production of testosterone Etc so that's what I would do and um you know you check a Baseline and then and you do carnivore and then three months later into carnivore you check it again and you and you see how you feel that's the most important thing and you can check that against your Bloods and they'll get better they will absolutely get better good luck with that",

drive anymore I want to fix this started line diet in June uh 30th well you know unfortunately um I don't have a a a great answer for you because that's not something that I you know I typically treat hopefully you're you're working with your doctr you have if this has been going on for years or your whole life one thing that um I'm glad you're starting the line diet though because one thing that fixing your your diet can do is it fixes problems that we didn't even realize were problems for a long a lot of the time and also fix problems that no one else had any answer for and and an ability to fix otherwise so uh it could very well be that this helps that a lot of people find that their concentration Focus and brain fog improve um tunnel vision there can be a lot of different meanings of the word of of saying that you have tunnel vision if you actually don't have peripheral vision then that's something that needs to get checked out thoroughly um you know if you've had that your whole life then you know maybe it's not as you know something that's that's more cute but if you really actually don't have visual fields on your peripheral vision you know that that can be something more serious like um you know not to not to you know put any any scary thoughts in your head but when someone gets that La that loss of peripheral vision quickly like over the course of weeks and months that can be from a pituitary tumor pushing on the optic kaym which sort of blocks out the peripheral vision so you end up getting tunnel vision you can only see here and then you're you're walking all of a sudden someone's next to you like oh God I didn't see how how'd you get there because you don't see them coming up because you don't have any peripheral vision and you know if you've had that your whole life then it's it's unlikely that's what's going on or maybe you had something that that affected that you know part of your brain previously and then it's just stable um if you'd had something growing there you know since you were a kid and it didn't get addressed it would have probably caused more and more problems however if you have a visual Fields test and you really don't have any peripheral vision you know you know your doctor needs to investigate why the hell that is and so you know I would I would do that I would talk to your doctor get a visual Fields test um and if that is knocking out you know you knocked out sort of your peripheral vision on both sides like that you know you need an MRI and you need to get um you know seeing opthalmologist and other sort of people to see you know get that tested properly and to see what the hell is going on and if there's any sort of particular reason that that's happening that can be reversed or fixed mied or addressed um because that's that's very important to find out so but again you know if this has been going on your whole life it's less likely that something like that but it's still very important to investigate maybe you've already had those investigations done but if not I would highly recommend you do that um you know quickly I I just go in to see your doctor you know straight away just get get the next appointment and um and talk to him about it and say Hey you know I want to get my visual fuels test I can't see out of my peripheral vision and get that tested and maybe it's just a a lack of awareness and that's that's important to know about too because that can be that can uh be other sorts of neurological issues if you just are um you know sort of neglecting certain sides of your body and things like that even though the visual fields are there uh and intact and the retin is intact and the optic ASM is intact and all that sort of stuff so uh all good information but needs to be thoroughly checked out by a doctor um and you know line diet hopefully can help with with um some of this as well but you know it's it's not going to fix everything um it's going to fix a lot of things because a lot of things are being caused by eating a really poor diet and so when you fix your diet it fixes a lot of problems so I think that's great and it's um I would just encourage you to keep going with that a lot of fat high fat and cut out everything else you know that's the idea with flying you it's just red meat and water but you know really really staying with it for for at least a few months you know do 100% red meat and water for a 100 days 100% for 100 days and uh and see how you go and it'll improve a lot of other things as well hopefully it improves this also but um if you are actually getting the point you you don't have peripheral vision like just holding your finger out here like I'm looking straight ahead and I can see my finger moving if you can't do that you need to get it checked out as to as to why that is okay so live says I do think it's neurological it happens when I have something on my mind it's like my peripherals go away okay yeah so so you have peripheral vision at one point and then it goes away it could just be that you're just so focused on something that you Zone everything else out um but if it's if it if it just happens on its own and when you're not doing anything else it could be something else but if it's more that you have something on your mind you're just sort of focused on it you  get you know very heavily distracted away from everything else you know that's uh that's more reassuring that there isn't anything else going on but um yeah there's no harm in in just getting it run by your doctor and just having them do a proper exam and make sure everything's okay and and then yeah and then just doing a line diet and uh and seeing how that can help um you know sometimes like uh you know if everything else is is going well and you're healthy and the doctors do think there's anything that um is particularly wrong that they can help with then um you know like different occupational therapist something like that maybe can help you you know um you know with different sort of exercises and tools to um you know sort of stay more in the moment and be more where around you um that can be something that that can be helpful as well but hopefully diet helps and hopefully there's nothing else going on but you know still worth getting checked out",

    "body": "hi Dr C I talked to a co-worker today regarding one of her relatives um having stage four breast cancer I'm very sorry to hear that they told her she would have less than 5 years to live would carnivore help I think that it it would there are a ketogenic carnivore diet there there is a growing body of evidence in the literature showing that ketogenic animal-based diets like a carnivore diet it doesn't have to necessarily be a carnivore diet but just a ketogenic animal fat diet because it's the animal fats that are good for you and the plant oils are not so good for you and the studies that that show the best results are the ones using meat they're eating animal fats and things like that to get into ketosis and then other other studies on ketogenics you know generally in mice you know giving them a bunch of like Crisco and hydrogenated vegetable oil which does not exist in nature and yet we're giving them to to animals and people and saying H you know we're getting we're getting strange uh and POS possibly bad you know blood markers and biomarkers from this ketogenic diet and it's like yeah well no kidding you're giving them poison and so they're in ketosis but they're also giving them poison and so I'm not surprised that they're getting bad results the ones that that are getting the best results are the high fat animal-based ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet um and depending on the breast cancer too that that's been more studied as well I um you remember seeing a study on triple negative breast cancer responding very well to ketogenic metabolic therapy um always remember that U you know Dr OT warberg showed nearly 100 years ago that cancer is a mitochondrial metabolic disease it's not a genetic disorder uh and then Watson and CRI came along and discovered DNA and everyone just went everything's DNA well every most things are stored in the DNA but that doesn't mean that the DNA is the brain and the powerhouse the mitochondria of the PowerHouse they're actually moving around in the cell and actually uh um you know turning things on and off and running the cell as if it were a ship the DNA and the that information it codes for is very important but it's it's um it's sort of the blueprints it's not the architect and the and the builders right the mitochondria or the workers and The Architects they're using that information and the proteins that it's producing to to go and do work elsewhere in the cell now it's a bit more complex than that because the the DNA can actually you know self-control which proteins get expressed and so and so on U but the but that's like a chemical Dynamic and um based on gradients and other sorts of signals that that the DNA is getting uh the mitochondria actually moving around doing work and so they're very very very important and excuse me and so we have something called the warberg effect which is that cancer cells require 400 times the amount of glucose as normal cells do and so it has um you know has been shown that when you restrict glucose and sugar and you go into a ketogenic State you get your gki low your glucose Ketone index your blood sugar is low and your ketones are high that actually shows a survival benefit in in cancers of you know all different forms I mean there's there's dozens and dozens of studies in multiple different cancers uh like dozens in each dozens of studies in in in each of these different cancers including breast cancer showing significant improvement with ketogenic metabolic therapy all the studies that show the most benefit are the ones that have the least carbohydrates so I have some that have sort of middling like is it all that much uh whe they're having you know low carbohydrate what the hell does low carbohydrate means it's it's ambiguous so some of them like you know below 200 grams of carbohydrates that's a low carbohydrate diet well that's intensely high from my standpoint because I don't have any carbohydrates outside of the glycogen that shows up in in meat and organs um and I don't even have that many organs you know it's really much it's really just meat um so then there's other ones 50 grams or you know 20 grams and 10 grams and zero grams as you go down you know people tend to have better outcomes and so you keep that gki under 2.0 that's considered therapeutic and you do that from a combination of a ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet and uh potentially restricted eating you need to include organs if you're going to do that because you still need the same amount of nutrients you just want less energy coming in and uh and potentially fasting you know if you can't get your gki under two or even under one is is uh preferable uh for periods of time at least so that you can sort of have um this sort of constant pressure of of low access to energy then um you know fasting can can sometimes help that help sort of tip the balance and get you uh into that more ketogenic state so good luck to your friend um maybe show her my my interview with Professor Thomas seed SE YF r i d where we talk about cancer and cancer biology and it's it's pretty amazing it's it's a you know hour and 40 minutes uh long talking about you know cancer biology and it's it's my most watched long video it's like two million views nearly maybe even hit it but that was 1.9 last time I checked and and then my my my lecture at a it was a medical conference in San Diego last year uh and it was just called uh ketogenic metabolic therapy as a novel adjunct to standard of care and cancer bit of a mouthful probably not a Punchy enough name to really make it go crazy on the algorithm uh but it's a good talk and it has good good information in it anyway and um and so I would I would recommend taking a look at those and and um and seeing what she thinks and at the very least it's not going to hurt um it can help actually make chemo and radiation uh more successful by sensitizing the cancer cells to the Chon and radiation and uh protecting her healthy cells from the chemone radiation as well so I would take a look at those and um and maybe show them to her and see how she does because it's it's you know cancer is really nasty and um and you have to throw the kitchen sink at it um otherwise you know you're just sort of giving into fate and that's not it's not a good fate to give into so uh I would definitely try that it's not going to hurt her at the very least and I think it would help yes that's what the that's what the data shows anyway you know and and the thing is to you know you talk to a doctor if your doctor has a particular feelings on oh my God don't do that you you know that's a that's a discussion she can have but the vast majority of doctors that that or an oncologist that I speak to and that um patients speak to they say is there anything I can do with my diet should I change anything they say no don't worry about it eat whatever you want okay well then eat what you want and and if you feel that this is going to help you um along with that then uh you know it's worth a try and that's what more and more studies are showing to be helpful and uh and and increase survival and that's that's what we're trying to do here with things like cancer so good luck to to your friend",

    "body": "why is meat the healthiest and best compared to other proteins like eggs uh what to look for when buying eggs and butter thanks for always uh answering our questions well no problem you're very welcome so uh well just you know eggs are great it's just that some people have U you know a bit of a sensitivity with them particularly with the egg whites they can cause a bit of a reaction in some people other people don't have a problem with them so eggs are great eggs have a lot of wonderful nutrients in them especially pasture raised eggs if the chicken's eating what it's supposed to eat it's going to have you know the nutrients that that are optimal for um for it and the eggs and uh and then just sometimes there's there's different proteins in egg whites that protect it from bacteria and fungus and things getting into the egg and and destroying the yolk and the and the baby chicken so that's uh that's the issues that some people just have a problem with some of those and particularly raw egg yolks or sorry raw egg whites the yolks seem to be fine and especially people with autoimmune issues you know they're they're much more likely to react to eggs um and so it's just just to be mindful of that but I I sort of consider eggs honorary meat you know because it's all the it's all the nutrients that you need to then turn into meat right it's going to turn into a baby chicken so it's it's all the nutrients that that are needed for that uh new new life to come into existence so obviously it's a lot of really good nutrients for us to continue our lives U because that's the unfortunate reality of this uh you know world we live in which is that we're animals are heterotrophs and something has we have to eat other things to uh get the nutrients and energy that we need we can't get it from you know mineral sources and sunlight it would be pretty cool if we could you know that would make space travel a lot easier wouldn't it but um unfortunately we something's got to die for us to live and that's just life you know you the cycle of death and rebirth and this is something that people have been in tune with for as long as humans have been humans and so it's um uh yeah so a bit of a bit of a tangent there but uh eggs are great um you know red meat you know is the ruminant meat they typically well they they are able to ferment and break down and uh the different toxins and extract more nutrients than other animals are and so they they tend to be have a higher concentration of nutrients especially grass-fed and finished ones they just have a higher concentration of these nutrients but it doesn't mean but so objectively there's a difference there but that doesn't necessarily mean the others are bad it's just some are just the best and some are really really good but you know eggs are really really good and so I wouldn't worry about that um for when you're looking for buying eggs you want pasture raised eggs that should is supposed to mean that they're actually out on grass eating whatever they eat now they could be given corn and feed and all that sort of stuff but they're supposed to be giving that out on the grass where they could be eating worms and and things like that and and hopefully they are they U if they're done right in that sort of regenerative fashion where they're out eating bugs and things like that um they're much more nutritious and I think Joel Saladin talked about his eggs uh done that way um compared to USD egg so there was like a USDA egg had something like 41 milligrams of folate in it but his eggs had over a thousand so there's a big difference in the amount of Nutri n there so you look for pasture raised eggs um you get them from a farm that you know how they raise their chickens preferably or have your own chickens that are just eating whatever the hell they find preferably and um and then butter grass-fed butter you want to get grass-fed butter and um it usually going to be a deep dark yellow and that's going to have a better complement of nutrients as well and DHA EPA and the other fats and cholesterols that you want in a good ratio as well so that's what you look for",

    "body": "what's your take on the Sun or sunburns on aging skin well I think it's actually important to get out in the sun you know we're not we're not trog ites we didn't grow up in caves you know like we're terrestrial animals and just like other terrestrial animals we were you know made to be out in the sun you can definitely overdo it you can damage your skin and that can cause uh you know Burns and all that sort of stuff but it's it's so much harder to get burned uh when you're on a carnivore diet because a you're just bringing in a lot less inflammation you have ketones that are up that reduce inflammation even more most importantly you are not eating plant toxins that expressly make you more sensitive to UV light there are different kinds of toxins that do this there's an entire class of plant toxin called furano cumerin that these entire body of plant toxins they they all they do is just damage your body in the Sun and they when UV light hits them they irreversibly bind to proteins and DNA and Destroy them and damage them and this is when you get permanent damage and you get burned and your skin has to peel off because body's like nope these cells are destroyed we got to get rid of them and so that's that's from forano cumerin I mean you can overdo it and and and damage your skin to the point that of no return and it just has to Slough off but it's much more difficult when you're eating things with fanin and you're eating other plant toxins increase inflammation but you know make you light sensitive in particular uh you will just burn much more easily because you get much more permanent damage much more easily and so this is something this is not just this is did not just come out of of of nowhere um this this is actually recognized in dermatology it's called phyto photo dermat dermatitis so phyto coming from Plants photo and the sun dermatitis skin damage right so you get these plant toxins that combine with the sun to damage your skin and cause a dermatitis there's celery dermatitis um and um uh so celery has e fanic cumarin par Snips do all citrus do so the idea that well fruit don't have any toxins is not true uh they particularly have particularly have the Fano cumerin this is why you can't take certain medications with grapefruit because the Fano cumerin in those grapefruit will have to get detoxified by the liver so hey there's is that word toxin it's getting detoxified therefore it is a toxin right that's just a definition in terms and that takes up enzymes that also metabolize certain medications and so then you run out of that enzyme and you can't metabolize your medications properly you get problems uh to do with that and so uh and you know thinking about you know grapes and um avocados just on the fruit topic you know we eat these things okay well those obviously are good for you well actually they'll kill cats and dogs why do they kill cats and dogs because there's toxins in them that are toxic and life-threatening to cats and dogs so that means there toxins in it it just means that we're better able to weather those toxins than dogs and cats are but there's still toxins in there so I I think it's really important to get out in the sun I think it's still important to understand what your limits are but I I I get I did a a video on um YouTube and and um and Instagram talking about the Sun and getting out in the sun and all the different benefits of it you know the UVA UVB they stimulate different uh biochemical processes in your body they're actually really important and um and so it's uh it's good to get out in the sun and uh and so many people there people say hey I'm I'm a natural red head and I've never been able to I've only freckled and burned and now for the first time I'm actually getting tanned and not freckling or burning amazing and so you know it's it's a very different story when you're eating a proper diet which again sort of is is further evidence that this is a proper diet you know our body just works better and you can go out in the sun and you can you can um get much more use out of it but the idea that we just we just walk in the stun we just Scorch and burn like vampires it makes no damn sense you know we should be should be able to be out in the sun and be very healthy because we need to be in the sun where you get um you know vitamin D uh UVA actually stimulates nitric oxide stimulates goes into your retina stimulates your brain to grow and make new new connections and can improve our blood pressure our blood flow reduce clotting I mean this is amazing what the sun can do real important tip your bra your body and UVB stimulates um vitamin D right vitamin D gets made on the surface of your skin as a UV protectant that's your own body's natural UV blocking and that's another thing too when you're eating properly and you have a proper and you actually have olol in your body you can actually make vitamin D and your other hormones right vitamin D is a hormone and so you make vitamin D on the surface of your skin as a UV protectant and uh and then you actually it actually takes hours and hours and hours for this to soak in because you're going out in the morning okay we're going to make some vitamin D now to protect us from the Sun all day because it's expecting you to be in the sun all day and then sort of 6 8 10 hours later it starts absorbing into your skin and into your body and you actually start using it as a hormone and if you go in the sun and you get sweaty and you go take a shower and you wash it off you'll wash off all that vitamin D and we've actually known that since the 1920s we did studies in humans in 1927 where they scraped off the sebum that um the oils on the skin that body naturally produces where the vitamin D is in is fat soluble and scraped that off and gave that to mice with rickets which is a vitamin D deficiency cured the mice with rickets cured the rickets right and so it's just like okay so that's on the surface of the skin in the seum right so it takes a while to absorb and and some Studies have suggested that for full absorption it can take up to 48 hours to absorb all of that in so I'm not saying that you don't shower uh for 48 hours after you go in the Sun but I am saying uh to try not to shower for a good six to eight hours after you go in the sun and and that can help as well and but you know you can overdo it for me overdoing it was two weeks straight uh near the equator in Australia uh in the summer with my shirt off all day every day from dawn to dusk and um and uh at the end of it I was pretty damn red and um and that turned into a tan but I got a bit of flaking on my nose and on my shoulder tips that's it you know I I put Tallow on I always you because if you if your Skin's dry it's it can actually get damaged more easily but I put you know Tallow on every single day I was just glowing and then I kept putting talaan after that to keep my skin uh more moist and healthy and I did bit of flaking dry skin bit on my shoulder tips bit on my nose no sunscreen no sunblock anything like that just Tallow and that was that was you know that was being up in exmouth and Kini uh which are you know Parts up in Northern Western Australia uh in the blazing sun in the middle of the summer and uh for two weeks solid solid and and that's all that's all that happened so you know it's um it's dramatically different",

absolutely it's um you know they're trying to push this you know sort of agenda you know on people and it's um you know and and you know game changers can can say whatever they say all the elite athletes just but you know the all the elite athletes in the world I'm sure they're some that are plant-based or eat more plants and veggies and all that sort of stuff um at the Olympics you know there's always exceptions to the rule but um you even just eating more clean and not eating a bunch of junk food is going to be benefit um I think there's like a fencer that's like plant-based you know that that's that's a skilled position that some that person's been doing uh you know working on that skill for their whole life you know that's um you know diet has a lot to do with how much dedication and concentration can go into that but how long they've been plant-based how long have they been uh doing that and how long um have they been fencing you know some people are just you know very skill at that you know but doing you know long drawn out intensive exercises it's different and so a lot of people at the Olympics they were just saying absolutely not you know we're not doing this and so I think the Australian um tennis team just said screw it we're leaving the Olympic Village we're not we're not staying here and they actually went out to you know just get hotels and and get their own food because like we're not we're not eating this and um you know like the heavyweight uh boxer I think from Australia as well dudes like six foot eight and like 110 kilos and which is like 240 pounds so you know trim taller guy you know I'm I'm 105 kilos I'm 6'3 so um you know it's uh but that's a big guy that's a big guy and they're saying no you're limited to two chops that's it that's all you get and he's just like um no I need more than that and so you know the Olympics are getting a lot of backlash for that and they started uh you know drawing in like thousands of pounds of meat uh more a day is is so because the the athletes are just leaving they're like we're not staying here we're not dealing with these conditions and apparently like the beds are like made out of Styrofoam or something like that they're just like completely uncomfortable and horrible so they're just like yeah we're not we're not we're not living under these conditions like you know these These are these are the the best athletes in the world in their in their um sport trying to compete against all the other best athletes in the world to see who is the best um in this competition and uh you can't do that in um really crappy situations you know you're trying to get the best performance of your life under you know very subpar conditions so um they're getting a lot of backlash for that and I think that's good I think it's good that they're getting public backlash and people are just saying No this doesn't work like we need meat like meat is is uh important and they're not getting the performance uh that they wanted apparently like the swimming um they've been getting uh pretty you know average sort of times and people are just not having good performances they're saying like yeah we don't think it's a slow pool it's not like you know it's thick water or something like that uh it's just that you know people aren't uh able to to perform at their to their best ability because they're getting substandard nutrition they're getting this ideology foed on them and they're they're not able to perform and they're just and they're pushing back they're saying no you know we're not doing this anymore and they're having they're having their own meals brought in and uh and sometimes they're leaving the Olympic Village and just saying screw this you know we're not we're not staying here you know I mean you look at you look at uh you know lonel Messi you know when Argentina when they won the you know the World Cup uh he had shipped in to the World Cup 6,000 pounds of beef right um because it was just like no we're not we're not taking a chance on not having the right amount of food 6,000 pounds I mean that's a massive amount I I I I wonder how much of that they used I you know but you you go back you go back to um um oh God what was his name just you know one of the world's best soccer players um God what what the hell is his name I was after p and they're say oh this is the next p he's like I don't want to be the next p i want to be the next me um damn it but he anyway he was he was um captain of Argentina I think they won a couple World Cups and uh the same thing you know they they just brought in thousands of pounds of meat and they were just grilling up and barbecuing just tons of meat um and that that's what they did I mean this is the original Olympic games that's what they would do they would just eat tons and tons of meat leading up to it and then you the games you you you'd win you'd win cows and sheep and like that that part of the prizes was more meat so you know it's um it's very strange that they're doing this but it's actually I think it's I think it's probably a net positive for the world to see that try to push this ideology and have it fall flat on its face so people can just be like yeah that doesn't work and so you know hopefully some good will come out of that but I feel bad for the athletes that have worked their entire life for this and and are having their their performance uh you know lessened by the um or nutrition that they're being provided at the uh the uh at the Olympics so I feel bad for them but hopefully they they sort that out and people can get back on track",

    "body": "what is the connection between carnivore reducing heart attack risk I'm a 50-year-old male strick carnivore for 6 months and keep hearing about men younger than me having heart attacks yeah it's it's very concerning isn't it and um you know when you consider the fact that the first heart attack diagnosed and confirmed on autopsy in America was in 1912 and there wasn't a single case reported in the literature uh confirmed on autopsy of someone dying from a heart attack then uh you have to sort of wonder why the the hell that is and why 10 years later became one of the biggest killers and then few years after that became the number one killer in America even though we're eating the least amount of meat in America than we were in 200 years before or since and so in the 1800s we're eating far more meat oh people are only living to their 30s well people in their 30s have heart attacks now people in their 20s have heart attacks now uh my friend Dr Anor Verma is an ER physician in India and they eat three Kil of meat per person per year on average and he's seeing 17-year-old vegetarian kids coming into the hospital with a heart attack the hell is that so people just 17's not old enough I guess um it's it's pretty wild uh what people the mental gymnastics that people can do to deny reality in in front of their faces the average like expectancy from birth in 1850 was 38 but the average life expectancy from age 10 years old if you made it to 10 was 56 so and you get to 20 it's 66 and so on so if you get into adulthood and middle age you lived as long or longer than people do now and so it's just that the childhood mortality rate was very high and and early early deaths were high because it's you know it was a hard life you know we have it pretty piss easy now in the west you know you go out go to Bangladesh and uh you know go go see how they live not even in the refugee camps where I was working just go see rural Bangladesh or even Urban Bangladesh the vast majority of people are living under very different conditions than than we are and they have a life expectancy to uh compare that to India their average life expectancy from birth is around 60 60 something right and they're all vegetarians well wouldn't that mean that you know uh that uh you know being vegetarian is that all well but there's infant mortality and there's this and there's oh okay so now now there's a distinction but not when it goes the other way so um why does you know what's the connection between carnivore and reducing heart attack RIS well the simple thing is is that you're you're removing out things that can be causitive you know I mean cigarettes smoking um nicotine can cause damage to the artery lining diabetes causes damage to the lining of your arteries through glycation you're going to keep your blood sugar down you're going to keep your insulin down and uh high fat meat-based ketogenic diets like a cornor diet have been shown in clinical trials in humans to reverse type two diabetes that's one of the biggest risk factors for developing heart attack and heart disease and stroke and um so that would be diabetes metabolic syndrome both of which have been shown to be reversible with ketogenic um uh high fat ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet and people all around the world are reversing their diabetes with by going on a high fat carnivore diet uh that is ketogenic and getting rid of seed oils and these things these Industrial Products that have never existed in nature ever and um then you when you cook with them they can make uh trans fats they can they can partially hydrogenate and you make um trans fats that are extremely toxic they don't exist in nature either and and um you know that's why these things are illegal now because it's such a high risk of developing heart disease and and other sorts of health issues and when you cook with these plant oils they you know uh they can turn into uh trans fats so that's not good you don't want those but I mean the the the plant oils themselves um can be harmful as well so you're just eliminating out all these different things and so it's an Elimination Diet you're just you're just cutting out things that are bad for you so it's like you know what what is the connection between you know um not drinking alcohol and doing drugs and certain Health outcomes well you're just not doing drugs and drinking alcohol which damage your body and can precipitate these health issues same thing with cornivore you're just eating what humans have been eating since humans have been humans and so your body's just going to work normally and you're not bringing it all these other sorts of harmful additives um and for those who said that you know people died in their 30s you know before the 20th Century just remind them that since the 1700s the minimum required age to run for president of the United States was 35 minimum right and you look at all the founding fathers all these like white-haired old men usually wearing wigs because they lost all their hair right so tell me again how we only living to be uh 35 again so um you know John Adams was born in the mid 1700s and he uh was 92 years old when he died Jefferson I think was 6 was 84 and um uh Washington was in his late 60s and then he you know caught pneumonia working out in the field and just getting soaked wet and um and decided not to change because he didn't want to be late to dinner he was very punctual it was just all about gentle gentlemanly manners and and um that was very important to him and um you know it cost him he got had pneumonia and um pneumonia and he got very sick and he ended up dying probably from all the things that they were doing at the time you know all the blood leting and cupping and all that sort of stuff and it was weeks and weeks and weeks before he died uh but yeah he unfortunately died so you know unless something killed them they they lived to be in their 80s and 90s for you know centuries you know and so and yet there were no heart attacks and strokes confirmed on autopsy in America before 1912 and then in the 1920s it's massively increased in the 1930s it's the number one killer in America and it stayed that way and it just sort of kept going up and um you know now the prevalence and incidence the new heart attacks people having their first heart attack is getting more and more um common so you know in the in the 19 you know so you know liars and people that are trying to purposefully mislead you we'll use this line um that uh that the cardiovascular mortality rate peaked in the 60s and 70s and then started coming down right when we started you know going away from eating meat and fat cholesterol and and putting people on statins but that's not what we said the rate the incidence the the you know the how common heart disease was and how common heart attacks was went up and increased dramatically actually and worldwide deaths have increased dramatically as well uh just in America the mortality and these are age adjusted numbers always remember that age adjusted means they've changed the numbers and you you have to you have to sort of say well what did you change them to what are the raw numbers so don't age adjust them why the hell are you age adjusting them just tell me how many people have had a heart attack how many people have died from a heart attack they don't tell you that they only tell you the age adjust it is almost impossible to find the UN unage adjusted numbers I actually haven't been able to find the non-age adjusted uh mortality cardiovascular mortality I have not been able to find them and I've had um you know research assistants and and other people that have not been able to find them either it's very difficult it's almost as if someone doesn't want you to see them um so but that's not we're talking about we're talking about the prevalence we're talking about the incidence we're talking about the percentage of people in society that have heart disease we're talking about the the how many people a year get diagnosed with heart disease well that's just screening that's just better Diagnostics okay what about first-time heart attacks that's going up too so the number of people having their first heart attack and surviving is going up we have better interventions we have better access to Medical Care we have way lower smoking right it's in the 1920s and before when heart heart disease almost didn't exist 80% of men smoked right and so now it's far less than that and yet we have a far higher rate of heart disease and uh and deaths from heart disease actually than in the 1920s when it was 80% uh male smoking rate so you this is back when they were like telling athletes you should smoke because it opens up your lungs and gets your your cardiovascular system going uh just crazy but it um it it is the case that the first people having their first heart attacks is going up so why is that since we're reducing we've reduced red meat by over a third reduced fat saturated fat and cholesterol by the same in increased fruits and vegetables by 30 40% increased heart healthy grains increased um heart healthy uh unsaturated vegetable oils by over threefold and um and replaced uh you know these calories that you're you're missing out from animal fats with plant oils and sugar you know and sugar is supposed to be not bad for supposed to cause heart disease but then why the hell is heart disease increasing why are people having more heart attacks why are people all around the world dying of heart attacks and strokes more than they ever were before and that that and those worldwide statistics you can get and those are increasing and the deaths from cardiovascular disease is increasing beyond the rate of population growth around the world right so you're out stripping just how how how many people are out there right so it's not just wrong numbers it's percentage of the population is going up and up and up and like I said in India there are some of the sickest people and most metabolically sick people they have some of the highest rates of diabetes they're all plant-based right a traditional you know vegetarian Indian diet like I said you know my my friend Dr anchor Verma he's treating 17-year-old kids vegetarians that are having heart attacks 26-year-old lady came in had stroke this is crazy I mean you're destroying the potential that this person had for their whole life you're just destroying an entire life and um and and then people are just trying oh it's the meat it can't be the meat because um or not not the meat alone anyway because these people don't eat meat you know three three kilos of meat per year and 20 years ago they were eating five kilos of meat per year and they were healthier they're worse now the the you know diabetes rates in India for these vegetarian population is 25% and that's in urban and rural areas right and that's published in top journals and recent studies published in top journals um 25% of the population uh is type two diabetic contrast that with America when everybody says oh America they're all fat and slobby and junk food and this and that and blah blah blah and Americans are just the least healthy people on Earth the diabetes rate in America is 9% diabetes rate in India where they're vegetarian and all super healthy is 25% so why doesn't that show up in the blue zones right why why don't we make a movie called the anti-blue zones you have all these places that go strictly against that Blue Zone ideology and blue zones are anti-blue zones too because they they disprove their own Theory because most of them eat way more meat than they said they did um and um and they they lied on a lot of other different fronts as well but um you know you have the entire subcontinent of India oh look at this little population this how about you look at 1.4 billion people who are largely vegetarian and only eat three kilos of meat per year and see that they are the sickest people on Earth how would you look at that and um and and tell me what you think Lena thank you very much for the super chat if you eat ,000 calories usually but burn 2,000 calories as well because you run would you have to eat uh some of that back to keep your body healthy or no you know the thing is is that your your body is way more complex than any simple um formula ever going to figure out you know you have use hormonal um you have hormonal inputs uh you have metabolic inputs depending on what you eat you will influence your your metabolism in different ways if you eat glucose that um is you know you can use that as energy and that can stimulate your mitochondria and it gets used for energy stored into glycogen can get stored into fat if you eat fructose that largely gets turned into fat and it's actually toxic to the mitochondria so the well carbohydrates they both have four calories per gram kilo calories per gram but they have very different effects fructose blocks leptin upregulates gin those are your hunger signals makes you overeat has other sort of hormonal disruptions as well glucose will raise insulin fructose will raise insulin but actually it has a lower glycemic index so it doesn't raise your blood sugar quite as much as fast and so it won't have as much of an insulin respond as fast but it has other individual hormonal um responses as well and again blocks leptin which is satiety hormone upregulates gillin which is the hunger hormone and will turn into fat largely and and causes other sorts of problems as well so a calorie is not a calorie is not a calorie so you know we just saying 2,000 calories and you're burning 2,000 calories first of all it's it's almost impossible to see exactly how much you're you're burning a day because you don't know what your basil metabolic rate is you don't know exactly how much your body is burning if you're in a ketogenic diet or in a state of ketosis you actually uh Studies have shown that you can actually increase your basil metabolic rate by 350 kilo calor cies so just by being in a state of ketosis you will you will burn energy more efficiently and you go into you increase your metabolism so you're burning more energy as opposed to raising your insulin which actually depresses your metabolism it slows your metabolism so you end up storing more than you would otherwise and so your basil metabolic rate goes down and so you're not using as much energy so it really depends on what you're eating and just like every animal in the wild we should be able to instinctually know how much to eat I have never counted calories and um even when I was in cardor I just didn't do it um but I tried to you know maybe restrict or something like that if I was trying to lose weight but you know just not eat as much as I was hungry for if I wasn't working out all that much and didn't want to put on weight or was putting on weight but if you're eating what your body's designed to eat you should be able to listen to your body signals and just like every animal if you look at every animal on Earth you know some reason when they're eating their natural diet they just know exactly how much to eat you know so you don't see koalas uh you when they're just eating eucalyptus you know some are just like fat bloated with diabetes you're like well that one just doesn't have any self-control um or willpower you know they just needs to understand whether their calories and their macros and all that sort of you know they don't have calculators pulling out calculators to figure out what they're supposed to eat they just eat something tells them to start eating something tells them to stop eating and I find that goes by taste for us if you eat fatty meat if you're eating the right stuff and you eat which is fatty meat if you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you don't have to count calories and you're never going to be able to figure out exactly how much you you're burning or doing or using or not using on a day-to-day basis how much you're actually getting in how much that of that is usable and what that's doing in different ways ways you know protein is largely used for structural components it's not used to build energy so all that protein uh calories there aren't calories they're not getting energy from that so okay so how does that work with the equation you know so you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and your body will figure out the rest and um and you'll be fine um you know if you're taking if you're eating other things if you're eating dairy that can increase uh your hunger signals if you're eating carbs it will definitely increase your hunger signals if you're eating fructose it will even great uh more greatly increase your hunger signals if you're on medications such as prazone or prenolone or hydrocortisone that will increase your hunger signal so in you know in special circumstances you may need to sort of play with this maybe not eat as much as your body's telling you to but for the vast majority of people when only eating fatty meat and only drinking water you should be able to listen to your your body and just eat until it stops tasting good and but you really need to go until you get a and it just goes like that kind of just tastes like cardboard I'm not too interested in this anymore and and see how you see how you go and if you're not if you're losing more body mass than you want or you're trying to put on weight and muscle mass um you know just make sure you're eating enough throughout the day it's very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet it's very difficult to overeat because you physically don't want to do it because it starts tasting bad and you're just going no I don't want to do this so it's um it's important to at least eat enough and and and listen to that and sort of you have to relearn your hunger signals so if you're sort of feeling a bit off or low energy or this or something okay am I hunger or getting Cravings especially for carbs or sugar say like oh am I hungry is this what hunger feels like try eating some meat or eggs if it tastes good yes you're hungry keep eating until it stops tasting good and go from there and you'll do great",

    "body": "63-year-old female with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis was in a walker terrible pain on methat trexate and prazone stopped all meds um that's prazone stopped all meds when carnivore on um July 1st and in remission uh that's amazing great job really happy to hear that um triglycerides I'm assuming 60 HDL 85 LDL uh 290 CSC score is five doctor freaks out and wants me on a Statin where CSC score is five I mean that's basically nothing um so there's there's nothing really to uh get overly concerned about there you can always check that again in in a year or two and see what that's doing uh LDL is not a disease atherosclerosis is a disease and your CAC score five shows that you don't really have a burden of atherosclerosis at least not calcified now that doesn't show Soft plaque that only shows hard plaque uh but your triglycerides are very low which is great you know high triglycerides that that can cause disease that actually actually cause pancreatitis so you know that is a problem uh if it gets too high yours is perfect and your HDL is higher than your triglycerides which is perfect and your LDL actually shows that uh we're just seeing more and more data showing that higher LDL higher total cholesterol longer life and so this is just a just a an absolute con you know you're you've just reversed lupus and rheumatoid arthritis which I guarantee you your doctor would say is impossible and you've done it just by changing your diet and your off medications that can cause serious damage to your body as well so obviously Paradigm and understanding is wrong and so you've done something very simple and you've completely revolutionized your health why are we assuming that that's going to kill you by some other means those medications can those medications can cause serious disruption to your to your health and Metabolism they they can kill you eventually um you know but that's not what this is you're just eating real food and you're and these diseases are going away so why are we assuming that you know doing this and just naturally getting rid of the causes of your lupus and rheumatoid arthritis why are we saying that that is going to then cause heart disease you're improving all your health markers are improving and I would say your LDL is improving as well because that is that has never been proven never been shown in a causitive to have a causitive relationship with heart disease and you see it right there your LDL is 290 which is about you know three times what your doctor probably wants you to be at and your CAC score is five it's nothing you know you really don't start worrying about a CAC score until it goes over a 100 so you know if you're if you're really worried you get a get a kateed Doppler you know get a an ultrasound of your kateed that takes decades to build up you know so if you had anything there it's not just within the last year that's been there for a long time then you check that you check it again in a year or two see what happens it's getting worse okay you know then then we need to figure out what the hell's going on you know stress bad sleep other sorts of environmental toxins is it your diet you know it's not but um you know that's something that can be then then addressed you know I mean that's something that's worth addressing at that point right now you have one data point you have a c score of five which is you know nothing to write home about and you're feeling great and you've reversed very serious diseases that are debilitating and can be fatal and so what's the problem you know you're doing great and so um you can use this as a baseline you can check your actual objective markers your CAC score or uh you kateed Doppler and see what's going on I have a number of patients that have been reversing their atherosclerosis this is all anecdotal but this is It's they are reversing it had a gentleman in my my patreon uh chip who had 100% uh stenosis blockage of his right cored artery and a year before he started you know a year ago he was on Carnivore for a year now it's pton again there's blood moving through it so it's recanalized it's actually you know passing blood now so that is reversing right so that's amazing and um you know and so and statins you have to wonder about statins because they've never never shown a cause and effect relationship between cholesterol and atherosclerosis so you know why are we why are we treating something that's never been proven to be an issue uh ever it's never been proven and in fact the only five studies that have ever been done or randomized control trious it could show a cause and effect relationship when they lower saturated fat by replacing it with um unsaturated vegetable oils and margarine and lowered LDL cholesterol they actually found no benefit by doing this or in two of the larger studies that were better designed more people died heart attacks and strokes by doing that okay so they and they buried them because they knew what that showed they knew that it showed that the uh uh the cholesterol uh theory of cholesterol heart hypothesis was complete they disproved their own Theory anel Keys was involved in in the the Minnesota uh coronary experiment uh that was the largest and and best designed one of these and they buried it for 40 years it was only uncovered because the children of one of the original researchers found a box with his old stuff in it and they found the old data and so that's the only reason that we have this data there is in there isn't a single experimental study ever showing a cause and effect relationship between cholesterol and heart disease and so why are we treating it as if there were there isn't a single cause and effect relationship and maybe bring that up to your doctor and just say how do we know that there's a cause and effect relationship have there ever been any causitive studies that show a cause and effect relationship experimental trials randomized control trials showing a cause and effect relationship he will say yes of course there are because it would be crazy for them to be doing this sort of uh stuff if it if that weren't the case but it's not the case and um but because we've been taught to treat these numbers in the way that we are we assume that there must be a good reason for that but there's that old saying you know if you when you make an assumption you make an ass out of you and me and that that's exactly what they're doing and so you ask them is this like can you show me any any cause and effect you know randomized control trials to show a cause and effect relationship between high LDL and total cholesterol and heart disease because you know you haven't been able to find them and the only ones you found actually showed the opposite like the Minnesota coronary heart exper coronary experiment uh actually showed the opposite that had 10,000 patients uh perfectly controlled because they were in they were in institutions and so they controlled their meals you know so it's not like you just go home and Report like the nurses study and just say hey what' you eat last year absolutely useless study and it's designed to be useless so that they can manipulate the data and say whatever the hell they want but when you do a controlled experimental trial with people that you control the meals on it dead opposite results and so it's um it is uh it is the case that there there isn't a single piece of heart evidence to show that cholesterol causes heart disease and in fact there are tons and tons and tons of larger and larger studies showing that higher LDL you live longer you you you don't die of cancer as much you don't die of infectious disease as much and um and you don't die of heart attacks as much so this is just is just a flat out lie uh that has been perpetrated and is repeated so many times that uh it's just it's just in the Dogma but you know you ask them for evidence you say can you show me a cause and effect study a randomized control trial that shows a cause and effect relationship between LDL cholesterol total cholesterol and um or yeah LDL or total cholesterol and uh heart disease they can't do it because they don't exist the only ones that have been done showed the opposite so your doctor is very well-meaning I'm sure is and just hasn't seen the data because you know we don't get taught this in medical school uh which is which is a bit of a of a fraud honestly but um but that's that's the uh that's what the actual experimental studies show is that this is uh this is so good luck with that you're doing great keep it up keep up the good work",

    "body": "uh trying to go carnivore to combat severe histamine intolerance having allergic reactions to meat eggs and dairy can you recommend an allergy specialist who carnivore informed that's a good question um there are lists of doctors that do ketogenic stuff um like on Dr Kilts website so k i l TZ so his website they have list of doctors I mean they have to sort of self sign up so there's different doctors that sort of sign themselves up I'm pretty sure I've signed up on that one but I'm not sure I've signed up on others and um and so you can you can hopefully find someone on that um it may be that there's an allergist in your area but you know that's sort of quite a specific field um but you might be able to find like a like a primary care physician like a GP or Family Practice doctor in your area who is carnivore ketom minded and uh and and the good thing about that is that they generally have networks of people they refer to and so if they're if they're of that sort of way of thinking they're going to sort of come up with other sort of people around them in their area like you know around Perth like you know I know certain doctors that that um you know are of that way of thinking there's there's there's something called low carb Downunder you know the website low carb down under.com . Au has a big list of of doctors in Australia that are sort of ketom minded and and a lot of those would be carnivore and or at least carnivore friendly carnivore adjacent and um and so you can you could you know find different databases like that if you're in um it looks like you're in Australia so I think that's probably the best way is the low carb down under.com auu and look for a doctor in your area if there isn't an IST specifically in your area try to find a GP and then uh talk to them and say hey do you know any allergists that that um you know are on board with what we're doing here and and and they might be able to point you in the right direction or at least help you help you uh search that out um as far as reactions to meat eggs and dairy I would probably start by cutting out the eggs and dairy first and foremost try going to red meat try to go to meat that has not been aged and um yeah try try to S with like beef and lamb sometimes lamb is a little better for the histamine side of things they don't they don't you know hang them um uh after they you know slaughter them to sort of age them a bit uh for lambs they're usually just left and then just um uh butchered fresh and so that can be helpful as well and then you just try different different you know different meats that um that you think you can tolerate and you just stick with the ones that you can tolerate and you avoid the ones that you don't tolerate and so just a bit of self-experiment and self- selection is um is uh is pretty helpful there as well and uh yeah that's pretty much it and then you know getting um you know a doctor on the low carb down on your website that uh that you can uh go to and hopefully help you find an allergist um but I don't personally know any allergists in Australia unfortunately or maybe anywhere yeah it's very it's a very it's a very um Niche uh part of medicine uh but hopefully um there will be one that you can find on low carb down under or on um uh or or one of the GPS can help you so hopefully but you can also do just the self experiment and I would do that too most people react um if they're reacting to things they they will often react to eggs and dairy and then the other non ruminant Meats so things besides beef and lamb and goat so I just try try doing that cut out everything except beef lamb and goat if you can get it I haven't eaten too much goat around here but you never know and um and just go with the meat that you you do the best with and hopefully you can find what works for you and uh and and don't need um yeah I don't even need to get an allergist but you know hopefully hopefully you'll find one anyway all right good luck with that hopefully that helped",

    "body": "our daughter has suspected Ms and also on a waiting list for a gall bladder problems possible gallstone uh how does she start carnivore well specifically for the MS it's a good idea to get on a lion diet so just red meat and water anybody with autoimmune issue like Ms is always going to do best on just red meat and water so beef lamb and water a lot of fat especially for Ms you because that's a that's a dementing disease of the axons and the nerves that come down from the from the neurons and so that's really important those are made out of fat and cholesterol and so you need fat and cholesterol and you want to be in ketosis too because ketones cross the blood brain barrier reconstitute into fatty acids and they make up the physical structures of your brain and so you need enough fat you need enough ketones you need enough B12 almost everybody's low on B12 um I'm assuming that the New Zealand units are the same as austral Australian pretty damn sure and the and the reference range can go from anywhere from like 130 to 100 130 to like 650 700 800 sometimes a thousand but rarely um and uh so what the hell is it where where do you want to go and uh it's way above that anything below 400 can actually cause nerve damage and demelina on its own even without Ms and so if you have MS and you're trying to recover from these lesions and and repair the physical structures and the and the myelination of your axons you need B12 you need folate so you need liver um to make sure that you're getting enough of this because you're you're just going to be low on this so for her I would go on a a ruminant diet so beef and lamp I'd have a bit of liver you know just you know 50 grams a day for several weeks and you can bring that down to three days a week if you want to check the B12 check the folate you'll have plenty of B12 and folate on uh if you're having liver most people will have plenty of B12 f it just on the on the red meat but make sure you know because the depending on the quality of meat that you're getting is going to have more or less B12 and folate in it so you want to make sure you get enough and there's definitely enough in in liver of all descriptions and so uh check it again what you want to aim for for B12 is between 800 and 1,200 that's what you know we typically use as a reference range for optimal in um in our patients so that's what I would look at and I would make sure that she I would just do fatty red meat and water lots of fat being ketosis um just the red meat predominantly and um make sure you're getting enough B12 and vitamin D you should be getting enough from the fatty meat grass-fed butter um I'd avoid other dairies though butter being this the only thing or grass-fed ghee um if she has a problem with butter and um Dairy can definitely trigger autoimmunity and Ms as well so avoid those and uh avoid eggs too just just red meat just red meat and and grass-fed butter and or grass-fed ghee is okay as long as it's okay with her and um and see how you go and just get a lot of fat a lot of vitamin D A lot of B12 check your B12 B12 and vitamin D vitamin D you want to be between 140 and 180 and um a little above that is is probably fine too um up to 250 I've seen uh studies saying that that's perfectly fine even in cancer patient you try to get that up to 220 for instance and that can help so that's what I would do good luck to her um and she can just sort of jump in she doesn't have to like ease into it unless it's unless it's hard for her and she wants to ease into it uh I'd go ketogenic straight away no sugar get some liver in her uh check the B12 and so on but if she if she's able to willing and able can just jump right in I just jump right in and just go straight into it just cut all the garbage out just go be flam and water with a bit of liver and uh and and she'll she'll do well there are a lot of people putting their Ms into remission we just heard from a lady who put her her lupus and rheumatoid arthritis into remission without medication which is astounding um there tons of people that do it with Ms in particular too maybe somebody in this in this chat watching this video has done that so if anybody has had their experience please do share your experience with a carnivore diet and Ms in particular but any autoimmune issues uh as well because that's very helpful and hopefully um let uh you and your daughter see that so good luck to with that and good luck to her I hope she does really well",

doesn't eat can fasting and carnivore reverse all this well you know cancer is is an extremely dangerous and deadly and nasty disease even doing everything as best that we can and fasting and doing carnivore and ketogenics and things like that sometimes it's not enough and um you know there is there is a point of of no return but there are a lot of people finding that they are significantly improving their health issues there have been studies on La small lung cancer and ketogenic diets I'm nearly 100% sure just going back to that lecture I gave I those was some of the studies I came across were for non-s small cell lung cancer and so it's definitely worth a shot the prazone is you know it's it's a double-edged sword because it's reducing the inflammation allowing the their breathing to be easier but what it's doing also is causing diabetes and massively increasing her blood sugar and feeding that cancer and making that cancer much more aggressive and it's also suppressing the immune system which fights the cancer so this is sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy is um you know that she's on those medications to sort of help her symptomatically but they're they're accelerating her demise unfortunately so it just depends on how how much left she has in her how how much she has in her to fight this you know if she comes off the the prazone to get her blood sugar under control and she can fast and eat carnivore and ketogenic um and you know potentially address the you know glutamine action with different sort of medications press pulse um method that Professor CED has outlined in several of his papers and another paper that um I'm actually a part of that will be coming out shortly and um and that I talk about in the uh my uh talk on ketogenic metabolic therapy for cancer and our our um interview my interview with Thomas sea freed uh we talk about all this I think it can definitely help and I think it can definitely help her feel better and get more out of this and uh and be healthier for longer and I can't say that it's going to reverse all this I can't say that it's going to fix her I can't say that um she's going to be able to put this into her mission but I can tell you that others have um and that they are still fighting this you know I mean this you just have to sort of assume that this is always going to be going on in your body you really can't stop and so um you know if if she tries it I think it's well worth trying you know nothing else is really GNA do much I mean they've already given up on her and said that she's terminal and so they're putting on paliative measures and just giving a whole bunch of Penzone which um is just going to jack up her her blood sugar and and accelerate this cancer cells require 400 times the amount of blood sugar as normal cells and so you know you want to do everything you can to keep that blood sugar levels down not up because you take do a pet scan you inject radiol labeled glucose and you see where that goes you see dot dot dot dot dot oh that that's all the cancer cells are sucking up all that glucose so that's what's happening when her blood sugar is high it's just feeding those Cancers and they're lighting up lighting up lighting up so remember that pet scan anytime you have a bagel or a piece of bread or or have your prazone jumps up your blood sugar you really want to keep that down uh because the you're just you're just stuffing energy into these cancer cells which is exactly the opposite of what you want to do so I'm really sorry for your friend that's a very difficult place to be in you know especially because sometimes you know the breathing is so hard that they really can't go off the the steroids and that's that that's really tough and you know it's like for for brain cancers brain tumors you get a lot of swelling in edema you have to go on steroids you have to because the edema can kill you then you do the surgery you cut out the tumor and then you have them on steroids for another you know several days in a weaning dose and uh and then you come off of them you know when that swelling's down you've taken out the tumor so now it's not causing swelling anymore so you can get them off the steroid you don't keep them on for very long if possible and then you do radiation that causes more swelling you put them back on steroids and then you're sort of going down that rabbit hole but it's um it's something that in in certain circumstances when you have brain edema or you have so much edema in your lungs that you can't breathe that sometimes these are these are necessary evils and you know the fasting and carnivore diet being at least ketogenic so you're not adding fuel to I think is definitely going to be a net positive and hopefully it reduces the swelling down enough as well that she can come off the prazone and um and not be so horribly symptomatic that she's that she's miserable or or uh putting herself in danger of respiratory failure hopefully that's the case and and if it is and she can really attack this with you know getting her gki below two or below one if possible with with um combination of a ketogenic carnivore diet liver organs um some restricted eating and some fasting hopefully that that um is enough to start turning the tide back the other way there are people who have done that and it's a growing body of them and there there are there's a growing body of experimental literature of randomized control trials and Interventional trials that um may be you know controll but randomize um you know self- selected uh trials Etc that um that that are doing extremely well and there's a just there's more and more there are more and more of these studies showing that so uh good luck to your friend hopefully she gets a lot of improvement by going carnivore hopefully she's able to get off the praz zone and hopefully she's able to turn this around and um you know I think we're all you know we're all praying for so um good luck with that good luck to her you know and and have her watch and you watch my videos on ketogenic metabolic therapy and my interview with Professor Thomas C freed s y f r i d those are very important ones to know about good luck",

    "body": "carnivore for six months down 35 pounds I'm 47 uh still high blood pressure 160 over 110 my doc wants to put me on amlodipine until root cause is f found uh should I fill and take it uh well first of all congratulations that's absolutely fantastic that's a huge amount of weight loss um and I'm sure a lot of other health issues have been improved as well um I I I would absolutely agree with your doctor on this that um you know and it is important you know to to take uh you know the advice of your doctor way uh more seriously than you do uh internet doctors right because I don't know your full history I haven't done physical exams we haven't spent hours and hours talking to each other over over years to know you know your your specific details I I can only speak in generalities and I can only speak about you know what the data shows on the Aggregate and what my experience has shown in my individual patients and what we've seen and talk about different mechanisms but you know at the end of the day you know getting personalized Healthcare is really important but I would I would definitely agree with this high blood pressure is a major killer and it's a major cause of heart disease heart attack Strokes um and so you you you do want to control that and and even when people go on a cornard diet and they improve their diabetes and imp improve their blood pressure you can't just hop off medications you know you need to you can only do that in uh you know as appropriate you know when your body when it's when it's um when it's time when your blood sugar is down it's oh now it's going too low okay adjust that up keep that in that right range with you know combination of diet and and medications same with blood pressure if your blood pressure isn't being controlled uh then then blood pressure medication can be very helpful in keeping that down so couple things to check first of all there are there are causes of blood pressure uh issues that can be uh reversible call talking about these um secondary hypertension so there's something that's causing it you know like renal artery stenosis foch chromosoma you know different sorts of things that can that can be there that your doctor can check for and should check for it's very important to check for these things you don't just say ah well probably just yeah just high blood pressure is high blood pressure whatever no there there's some things that you can find that actually are reversible and be your high blood pressure being caused by something it's obviously it's all being caused by something but some of these things we know the causes of in other we have no idea um so we need to investigate that so work with your doctor to investigate those things and uh and reverse whatever's able to be reversible um but then the other things to think about high homosysteine can irritate the arteries cause constriction increasing your B12 and folate that will reduce your homosysteine in fact high homosysteine is a better indicator of low or inadequate uh B12 or B12 deficiency than even serum levels of B12 so check your B12 you want it to be on the high end of normal or even above the range for most reference ranges in America you want to be between 11 00 and 1,600 the rest of the world you want when it's so America it's p GRS so PG per ml pgml you want to be between 1100 and 1600 uh the rest of the world most of the rest of the world uses P moles per liter so PML and you want to uh have between 800,00 if it's Peak moles per liter and uh so that's what you aim for and if you do that and you check your homocysteine that comes down that can sometimes get your your blood pressure down also insulin insulin resistance you know it may it may just be that you're still dealing with a bit of insulin resistance test your fasting insulin first thing in the morning if that's above 10 that can also be an a reason why your blood pressure is a little high and if that comes down eventually that comes down that can help normalize your blood pressure as well the other one to not forget is while I don't have a problem with salt and General uh I do have a problem with it in particular cases because um about 20% of people are salt sensitive and can actually get pretty labile blood pressure because they use salt and so I don't use salt at all anymore just because of taste it doesn't taste as good to me anymore um but it doesn't bother my my blood pressure um and other people it does and so you just need to be mindful of that and maybe try cutting out salt as well as checking your insulin checking your homocysteine checking your B12 just cut off the salt see what happens check your blood pressure daily same time same conditions sitting down with feet flat on the floor don't cross your legs and uh deep breaths calm and relax chill out for about five minutes and then check your blood pressure there also something called White Coat Syndrome where you know you just you're just anticipating getting your blood pressure so your blood pressure goes up and you're like oh my God I don't want high blood pressure it's going to be high every time every time you're worried about your blood pressure being high it's going to be high so just chill out relax Deep Thoughts Zen out or deep deep breaths Zen out and just chill and and then get your blood pressure taken and that that that in itself can help and is more indicative of what your blood pressure is like throughout the day when you're not stressing out about your what what the hell your blood pressure is so give all those things a try and and investigate what's going on with your doctor and if all else fails you know I would take medication if I had high blood pressure I would take medication for it and I would recommend that to my patients as well because high blood pressure is a major killer and um and it's and it's a major risk factor for a lot of major Killers as well so um while you know 160 isn't a crisis you know you get over 180 and that is considered a hypertensive emergency that you should go to the emergency room for um you know if it's a true number you're not just freaking out because you're you're worried about something um like your blood pressure but if that's a real number then you know you need to go get that sorted out and quickly and so I would uh I would treat that I would definitely treat that and um you know in myself or in my patients I would make sure that they get on a on a better blood pressure regimen and then go through all those things we talked about to try to get to the bottom of it and um and hopefully you can come off the medications but if you can't you know that's what medications are for that's like the only thing medications are for is for when you do all the diet and lifestyle and uh sort of interventions and there's still something a bit screwy that's what medicine are for that's what medicines are for you know we're just using these as a crutch like oh something happens say Hey you fix my bad habits you know I'm going to eat and drink and do whatever and just trash my body you give me a pill to fix it well there are no pills that fix that crap you can patch it up you can you can cover up some symptoms but you're not going to fix that so you you fix that first with your diet and lifestyle and then if there's something left over that's what medications are for um and so you know you're doing it the exact right way you're doing all the right things blood pressure is a little high great fine take some blood pressure medication as your doctor recommends and then investigate you know why it is up and see if there's something you can reverse and and hopefully it is and hopefully you can you can come off the meds but uh until then probably a good idea",

    "body": "what's the difference between HDL and LDL and their role excellent question that's not um yeah I'm not probably not the best to answer that um but they you know they all have um the major roles of HDL and LDL is are transport molecules they're transporting fast lipids and cholesterol around the body and transporting them to and from the liver from your fat cells to your liver from your liver to somewhere else and then back to your liver again and so uh and there's there's a whole very complex biochemical um pathway and and um flowchart that you can sort of look at and you look at biochemistry books um and Physiology books you could sort of see that you know you start with like you know vldl try to say LDL and IDL and all these LL and all these other sorts of things and uh and there's different sorts of you know when they're when they're picking up and dropping off different amounts of fat triglycerides and and uh lipids and cholesterol and things like that so it's it's quite complex um but that's the main role is they're just transporting fat around the body and so why would it be that you know when we're we just stop eating so they say well when you eat fatty meat you eat more saturated fat all the El goes up because oh there's more fat in your body well you know yes it no you know because when you just fast and you just don't eat at all for 5 days LDL will go up HDL will go up triglycerides will go down that's the exact same pattern that we see when people just eat meat and so why is that well it's a metabolic State change you're running off fat your body needs to move more fat you know fat can't just freely move around the body it has to be carried and transported in HDL and LDL and so now you're running on your fat so you need to move the fat from your fat to your Li to then turn that into glucose and ketones and glycogen and then you know you're you're moving more fat around the body pretty simple um and it actually does a lot of other things as well actually has has a part um part to play in the innate U immunity so people that have lower LDL uh actually have have worse outcomes with infectious disease and uh and die more from infectious disease than people with higher LDL they die more from cancer than people with high LDL so this has a has a big role in your body it's not just moving lipids around your body it's actually involved in a lot of other processes and and where is it moving those lipids too maybe they're moving it to some damage side or some infection side and helping you know the body fight these infections and Cancers off so that certainly seems to be uh what is going on so it's a very good question but it's it's one that you sort of need a whole chapter in a biochemistry book to answer so you know check that out you know you can go and check out you know those different things um uh those different processes and and Pathways um and what they do but that's the main the main thing that they do is they move fat and cholesterol around your body and that's important to do because we need fat and cholesterol all over our body and our brain and uh so yeah your brain makes cholesterol if your brain doesn't have proper cholesterol there are tons of studies showing that if you disrupt the normal cholesterol metabolism of the brain you get serious neurodegenerative diseases and uh even neurodevelopmental issues as and diseases as well and now we're doing everything we can to disrupt and screw up our normal uh cholesterol metabolism of our brain by giving ourselves medications that cross the bloodb brain barrier and stop our brain from making cholesterol which is what our brain is made out of so so that's frustrating uh especially when they're talking about giving this stuff to kids you're like oh my God their their cholesterol is high what you know you breast milk is has the highest concentration of saturated fat and cholesterol of any food in nature good I hope they have high cholesterol because it's not high cholesterol that's a value judgment that somebody put on and they're wrong cholesterol does not cause heart disease it never has it never will has never been proven to cause it it has been disproven to cause it but he well you know that's only showing that th those particular fats were worse than saturated fat well show me one fat that is better than saturated fat show me one example of any experimental data showing that saturated fat and cholesterol cause heart disease there isn't a single one in the entire body of literature anywhere on Earth anywhere in history so why are you saying that it's causitive when you have no reason to say it's causitive um it's pretty frustrating but um you know but that those are the facts and uh and that's just you know as long as we understand the facts we can at least uh use those facts to to help our lives and not be sucked into these uh megalomaniacs who just want control and money so bit of a tangent sorry about that but uh hopefully that was helpful",

    "body": "in your experience how long does it take for Crohn's to go into complete remission on Carnivore I'm 52-year-old male carnivore for three months doctor started me on uh what is it skyzzy that's a cool name uh probably a horrible drug but a cool name um it's marketing that's that's all that matters um but I'm worried about taking biologics long term yeah well you know that's that's the whole idea is that it they can have you know long lasting issues and effects but you know when you're dealing with something like cron is very debilitating very ill makes you very ill and can be very dangerous and um you know it's it's the lesser of two evils in that circumstance but you know in this circumstance not so much so you have to be really strict with with uh any autoimmune issue and you'll notice this on Crohn's if you go off your biologics you go off prazone like that um and you have uh some you really need to be like red meat and water so like beef lamb and water high fat very high fat and you know when you do that you know you'll you'll find that that Crohn's gets into remission very quickly um I when people do a strict lion diet I have I have yet to see it take longer than three months and and typically people do a biopsy of their colon like a colonoscopy and take a biopsy biopsy there's like no inflammation on um on biopsy as well there can be other things if you're really stressed out you're getting poor sleep you're having other sorts of things other negative inputs in your environment that can make things worse um if you're still having a bit of of issues with just beef and lamb go for grass-fed and finished beef and lamb that's going to be the best of the best that's always your Baseline that's always the best you can do and then you know you you adjust from there if uh if you feel that you can usually grass-fed butter is okay but probably avoid it until you're you're sort of putting this into remission and you're off the biologics and you can see how that affects you because you might find and you probably will find that you know you have this in remission and everything's fine and then you have a pork chop and all of a sudden you know you have a bit of a flare up you're like okay get the hell away from that or some eggs and you have a flare up like okay screw that um and so you know you really need to be really strict red meat and water and usually people with crohn's do better because you know if you if you just eat a pork chop or a salad and all of a sudden you have bloody diarrhea for the next next three days like you're you're just never doing that again like yeah screw that I'm never doing that again that was horrible and um so was very easy to see whereas with things like Hashimoto you don't necessarily see it right away it you know increases antibodies that Dam damage your your thyroid start reducing thyroid function and then the coming days and weeks you start having less energy and feeling a bit more leth lethargic and tired and you're like H that's weird why am I not feeling so good well it was from that stupid salad that you had you know a week ago or maybe added back in because you didn't think it was that big of a deal so you've been having it every now and then and so they can be less strict uh with with something like Hashimoto whereas with crohn's you see it right then same with rumor arthritis like you're going to know about it if you eat something your body reacts negatively to and starts creating more antibodies for um so just go really pure pure pure red meat and water really high fat two grams of fat to one gram of protein if you can um and if you've been in you know remission and you haven't had a flare up and everything's been fine for for a few months you can absolutely uh think about you know having a trial off of the biologics and uh and see how you go and uh the you know actually I I haven't really seen anybody have a flare if they did that if they uh just stuck with red meat and water there are people that have been good for so long that they get complacent they think well I can sort of eat outside of that and then they have a big massive flare up and it takes a long time for them to get out of that flare up um but as long as they stay on just red meat and water they i' I've never seen anybody have a flare up otherwise um things can be a bit worse with stress and poor sleep so you know that's important to remember as well but um uh you know that aside just you know if you address that stuff and then just do red meat and water and you and you've had no symptoms you know for a month two months three months definitely uh you know definitely fair to try coming off the sky rezy and see how you do and you have a flare up and things get go horrible you can always go back on the meds you know it's not going to it's not like like playing russan roulette it's not like a this could kill you sort of thing if you have a flare you go back on medication fine you know but uh you won't you know I mean the the vast majority of people are able to put this in transission very quickly with a pure red meat and water diet but it really does need to be strict um you slip outside of that and unfortunately you're just going to get things in your body and your body G to make antibodies towards them and react and damage uh your intestines and um you're going to have problems so do the best you can just to stick to just red meat and water and I think you do really well so good luck with that",

    "body": "been on um PD Dialysis that's um paranal dialysis say uh for three years uh any worri starting Carnival War tomorrow no not at all um you know thing is is like if you're already on dialysis I mean even even if it were true that meat and higher protein damage to kidneys which it is not um you're already on dialysis you know you're not g to get more on dialysis right like it's like if your kidneys don't work they're not gonna you know they're not gonna like get get any worse right you're already there right um is it going to reverse it and can you get off dialysis there have been a handful of isolated anecdotal cases that I've seen of people coming off uh dialysis um three that I've seen and there's one who is on um uh paranal um paranal dialysis um who's who's been on on here and and been to some of my groups and he was vegan for a number of years and and at the you know R old age of 32 he destroyed his kidneys and um neurology and he was actually bedridden and couldn't walk and couldn't use his phone because his hands wouldn't work and he was on dialysis because of his vegan diet which has just destroyed his health and so anybody tells you the vegan diet is healthy you can tell them that um that uh they're out of their damn mind um and you know any diet that doesn't provide you even basic nutrients is a bad diet that like there's there's no two ways about that um and oh but you can supp no no no you don't you shouldn't have to supplement you know if your diet can't you know cannot provide basic nutrients it is a bad diet full stop so he actually is improving uh he's walking again he's working out he's exercising he's lifting weights and he's and he's back having a normal life again he's still on dialysis but he's making he's still able to make urine he's making more urine and making more urine so he's actually on the transplant list to get new kidneys but he is uh giving it a year and seeing if he can you know seeing what he can do in there and it has been improving will improve all the way that he doesn't need the transplant we don't know but uh you know it's certainly not hurting him anyway and it's getting better and um I did an interview with uh Professor Thomas wiim who is a um a professor and research scientist um Prof professor of bi biology and research scientist specifically in kidneys and kidney disease and chronic kidney disease and polycystic kidney disease and at um un University of California Santa Barbara and I just did an interview with him that you should definitely check out and and he's finding that that people are significantly improving their kidney function by going on ketogenic diets high fat meat-based ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet and and so he's a big fan of a carnivore diet as well specifically for kidney disease and chronic kidney disease and damage so it's very very interesting and uh and great to see uh more and more data and and hard research coming out showing that this is this is an improvement and uh so no there's no worries on that make sure you're you're you know drinking water appropriately eating appropriately all these other sorts of things and um and and uh yeah and hopefully I mean you you'll do better in a thousand other ways but it's um you know it it remains to be seen how much benefit you get from your kidney function I hope it works I hope you get off dialysis and don't need a transplant or anything like that um just depends on how much damage is done depends on what was causing it in the first place if it was from polycystic kidney disease that absolutely has been shown to be uh extremely helping in fact they um they they show that actually reversed a lot of the polycystic kidney disease and they they they tried to get another Grant um from the the NIH or whoever and um the the study design was amazing got the highest rating like all the people you know the peer review sort of things that looked at it said yeah this is a great study this is fantastic you should definitely approve funding for this and it went up to the higher higher ones that ended up denying it because they said these results are too good to be true no one's ever gotten results like that so they can't be true it's like it's like what you know it's too good therefore we're not going to do it um well that's why you test it isn't it you know you're not going to get anywhere if you just do the same if you do the same thing that that um people have always done you're going to get the results people have always gotten we're trying something new we're getting different results look at that let's test it let's study it that's why we want a grant and um no no Noe no couldn't possibly be goodness all right uh but that's that's what they're showing is that you know polycystic kidney disease is a major cause of kidney failure diabet diabetes is the major cause of kidney failure they both get taken out and uh can be reversed actually reversed with a ketogenic high fat meat-based ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet so good luck with that I hope it goes really really well for you and then you just have nothing but um good results and hopefully your kidneys get better too fingers crossed",

    "body": "hi doctor I am in recovery from anorexia and I wanted to know if this diet could help with my low testosterone any advice would be appreciated as my doctor wants me to eat carbs thank you uh yeah I mean you know anytime you're coming from from you know disordered eating especially you know things like anorexy where you're eating very small amounts are just like look you just need to eat everything well that sort of the problem in the first place wasn't it you know you were eating everything and that wasn't working and people were feeling sick and they were gaining weight they were like well that's not going to work and then so you went sort of on the other end so you know just going back is is sort of disordered in the other direction you know you're just telling yourself it's okay even though you're getting you know results that you you may not find favorable so I I think it's I think it's uh a very good solution to be on Carnivore in this situation I've seen a lot of people who formally had anorexia fix their condition and and feel a lot better obviously physically but also mentally that they didn't have to to worry about um you know limiting and restricting because they they could just you know eat lot of meat and and and feel great doing it and so you know they were they they were happy to do that um as far as low testosterone yeah absolutely I mean it's that's the only thing that's going to help your testosterone carbs are not going to help your testosterone uh you know going ketogenic can help your testosterone and getting enough meat and fat and cholesterol is what's going to help your testosterone because testosterone is made from cholesterol all your your sex steroids hormones are made out of cholesterol and um you know and it's like it's a major portion of it you know 95% of the of testosterone molecule is cholesterol you know so it's just a couple little additions that that change it up so cholesterol is extremely important and and you get that from from eating meat and being and being healthy and eating a proper human diet so I would absolutely do that so my patients that that go onto a carnivore diet with a lot of fat you know the Fat's very important for your overall health and and particularly your hormonal Health that they uh they improve their their testosterone dramatically and um you know including you know eggs are great in there too eggs have a lot of cholesterol and saturated fat and those sorts of things which are surprise surprise good for you that's why they're in eggs because they're good for animals and that's why they make up building blocks in the physical structures of a baby right and that's why you know eggs have a lot of saturated fat and cholesterol because the body needs saturated fat and cholesterol and that's why uh breast milk is has the highest concentration of saturated fat and cholesterol of any food in nature because you need it and and babies in in particular because their brains are growing and their bodies are growing it's very very important so um yeah I would uh I would just keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good just like just like uh everybody would in other situations and um and uh yeah and and then just see how you go I would I would be shocked if your body didn't start improving uh your uh from all standpoints but especially your your testosterone as well that'll come up sometimes it takes a while for your body to turn on you know so give it a few months uh always check it in the morning first thing in the morning is when you're going to have highest levels of testosterone so always check it at the same time every morning because if you check it at different times you know check once later in the day you're you're always going to have relatively less testosterone than you would have other other wise and so you check it first thing in the morning fasting from the night before 9:00 p.m. only water after that only water in the morning no coffee te vitamin supplements medications until after you take that blood test between 8 and 9:00 a.m. uh get a good night's sleep for several days before no stress no exercise and no sexual activity for 48 hours before your test you do that in that way and that and don't take biotin don't take B vitamins that contain biotin biotin is a B vitamin so any um any B multivitamin or B complex or multivitamin will have Biotin in it and so just don't take that don't take that for uh you know five days before really and um and then you'll you'll get very consistent numbers you'll be able to track what you're doing and and be able to do that more accurately if you do that inconsistently you'll get inconsistent results and it may be that your numbers are changing that and it doesn't have anything to do with your actual production of testosterone Etc so that's what I would do and um you know you check a Baseline and then and you do carnivore and then three months later into carnivore you check it again and you and you see how you feel that's the most important thing and you can check that against your Bloods and they'll get better they will absolutely get better good luck with that",

    "body": "tips for me to stop zoning out and getting tunal Vision um had this all my life can't see objects in peripherals at times uh causes accidents oh goodness that's not good uh so I don't drive anymore I want to fix this started line diet in June uh 30th well you know unfortunately um I don't have a a a great answer for you because that's not something that I you know I typically treat hopefully you're you're working with your doctr you have if this has been going on for years or your whole life one thing that um I'm glad you're starting the line diet though because one thing that fixing your your diet can do is it fixes problems that we didn't even realize were problems for a long a lot of the time and also fix problems that no one else had any answer for and and an ability to fix otherwise so uh it could very well be that this helps that a lot of people find that their concentration Focus and brain fog improve um tunnel vision there can be a lot of different meanings of the word of of saying that you have tunnel vision if you actually don't have peripheral vision then that's something that needs to get checked out thoroughly um you know if you've had that your whole life then you know maybe it's not as you know something that's that's more cute but if you really actually don't have visual fields on your peripheral vision you know that that can be something more serious like um you know not to not to you know put any any scary thoughts in your head but when someone gets that La that loss of peripheral vision quickly like over the course of weeks and months that can be from a pituitary tumor pushing on the optic kaym which sort of blocks out the peripheral vision so you end up getting tunnel vision you can only see here and then you're you're walking all of a sudden someone's next to you like oh God I didn't see how how'd you get there because you don't see them coming up because you don't have any peripheral vision and you know if you've had that your whole life then it's it's unlikely that's what's going on or maybe you had something that that affected that you know part of your brain previously and then it's just stable um if you'd had something growing there you know since you were a kid and it didn't get addressed it would have probably caused more and more problems however if you have a visual Fields test and you really don't have any peripheral vision you know you know your doctor needs to investigate why the hell that is and so you know I would I would do that I would talk to your doctor get a visual Fields test um and if that is knocking out you know you knocked out sort of your peripheral vision on both sides like that you know you need an MRI and you need to get um you know seeing opthalmologist and other sort of people to see you know get that tested properly and to see what the hell is going on and if there's any sort of particular reason that that's happening that can be reversed or fixed mied or addressed um because that's that's very important to find out so but again you know if this has been going on your whole life it's less likely that something like that but it's still very important to investigate maybe you've already had those investigations done but if not I would highly recommend you do that um you know quickly I I just go in to see your doctor you know straight away just get get the next appointment and um and talk to him about it and say Hey you know I want to get my visual fuels test I can't see out of my peripheral vision and get that tested and maybe it's just a a lack of awareness and that's that's important to know about too because that can be that can uh be other sorts of neurological issues if you just are um you know sort of neglecting certain sides of your body and things like that even though the visual fields are there uh and intact and the retin is intact and the optic ASM is intact and all that sort of stuff so uh all good information but needs to be thoroughly checked out by a doctor um and you know line diet hopefully can help with with um some of this as well but you know it's it's not going to fix everything um it's going to fix a lot of things because a lot of things are being caused by eating a really poor diet and so when you fix your diet it fixes a lot of problems so I think that's great and it's um I would just encourage you to keep going with that a lot of fat high fat and cut out everything else you know that's the idea with flying you it's just red meat and water but you know really really staying with it for for at least a few months you know do 100% red meat and water for a 100 days 100% for 100 days and uh and see how you go and it'll improve a lot of other things as well hopefully it improves this also but um if you are actually getting the point you you don't have peripheral vision like just holding your finger out here like I'm looking straight ahead and I can see my finger moving if you can't do that you need to get it checked out as to as to why that is okay so live says I do think it's neurological it happens when I have something on my mind it's like my peripherals go away okay yeah so so you have peripheral vision at one point and then it goes away it could just be that you're just so focused on something that you Zone everything else out um but if it's if it if it just happens on its own and when you're not doing anything else it could be something else but if it's more that you have something on your mind you're just sort of focused on it you  get you know very heavily distracted away from everything else you know that's uh that's more reassuring that there isn't anything else going on but um yeah there's no harm in in just getting it run by your doctor and just having them do a proper exam and make sure everything's okay and and then yeah and then just doing a line diet and uh and seeing how that can help um you know sometimes like uh you know if everything else is is going well and you're healthy and the doctors do think there's anything that um is particularly wrong that they can help with then um you know like different occupational therapist something like that maybe can help you you know um you know with different sort of exercises and tools to um you know sort of stay more in the moment and be more where around you um that can be something that that can be helpful as well but hopefully diet helps and hopefully there's nothing else going on but you know still worth getting checked out",

    "body": "hi Dr C I talked to a co-worker today regarding one of her relatives um having stage four breast cancer I'm very sorry to hear that they told her she would have less than 5 years to live would carnivore help I think that it it would there are a ketogenic carnivore diet there there is a growing body of evidence in the literature showing that ketogenic animal-based diets like a carnivore diet it doesn't have to necessarily be a carnivore diet but just a ketogenic animal fat diet because it's the animal fats that are good for you and the plant oils are not so good for you and the studies that that show the best results are the ones using meat they're eating animal fats and things like that to get into ketosis and then other other studies on ketogenics you know generally in mice you know giving them a bunch of like Crisco and hydrogenated vegetable oil which does not exist in nature and yet we're giving them to to animals and people and saying H you know we're getting we're getting strange uh and POS possibly bad you know blood markers and biomarkers from this ketogenic diet and it's like yeah well no kidding you're giving them poison and so they're in ketosis but they're also giving them poison and so I'm not surprised that they're getting bad results the ones that that are getting the best results are the high fat animal-based ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet um and depending on the breast cancer too that that's been more studied as well I um you remember seeing a study on triple negative breast cancer responding very well to ketogenic metabolic therapy um always remember that U you know Dr OT warberg showed nearly 100 years ago that cancer is a mitochondrial metabolic disease it's not a genetic disorder uh and then Watson and CRI came along and discovered DNA and everyone just went everything's DNA well every most things are stored in the DNA but that doesn't mean that the DNA is the brain and the powerhouse the mitochondria of the PowerHouse they're actually moving around in the cell and actually uh um you know turning things on and off and running the cell as if it were a ship the DNA and the that information it codes for is very important but it's it's um it's sort of the blueprints it's not the architect and the and the builders right the mitochondria or the workers and The Architects they're using that information and the proteins that it's producing to to go and do work elsewhere in the cell now it's a bit more complex than that because the the DNA can actually you know self-control which proteins get expressed and so and so on U but the but that's like a chemical Dynamic and um based on gradients and other sorts of signals that that the DNA is getting uh the mitochondria actually moving around doing work and so they're very very very important and excuse me and so we have something called the warberg effect which is that cancer cells require 400 times the amount of glucose as normal cells do and so it has um you know has been shown that when you restrict glucose and sugar and you go into a ketogenic State you get your gki low your glucose Ketone index your blood sugar is low and your ketones are high that actually shows a survival benefit in in cancers of you know all different forms I mean there's there's dozens and dozens of studies in multiple different cancers uh like dozens in each dozens of studies in in in each of these different cancers including breast cancer showing significant improvement with ketogenic metabolic therapy all the studies that show the most benefit are the ones that have the least carbohydrates so I have some that have sort of middling like is it all that much uh whe they're having you know low carbohydrate what the hell does low carbohydrate means it's it's ambiguous so some of them like you know below 200 grams of carbohydrates that's a low carbohydrate diet well that's intensely high from my standpoint because I don't have any carbohydrates outside of the glycogen that shows up in in meat and organs um and I don't even have that many organs you know it's really much it's really just meat um so then there's other ones 50 grams or you know 20 grams and 10 grams and zero grams as you go down you know people tend to have better outcomes and so you keep that gki under 2.0 that's considered therapeutic and you do that from a combination of a ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet and uh potentially restricted eating you need to include organs if you're going to do that because you still need the same amount of nutrients you just want less energy coming in and uh and potentially fasting you know if you can't get your gki under two or even under one is is uh preferable uh for periods of time at least so that you can sort of have um this sort of constant pressure of of low access to energy then um you know fasting can can sometimes help that help sort of tip the balance and get you uh into that more ketogenic state so good luck to your friend um maybe show her my my interview with Professor Thomas seed SE YF r i d where we talk about cancer and cancer biology and it's it's pretty amazing it's it's a you know hour and 40 minutes uh long talking about you know cancer biology and it's it's my most watched long video it's like two million views nearly maybe even hit it but that was 1.9 last time I checked and and then my my my lecture at a it was a medical conference in San Diego last year uh and it was just called uh ketogenic metabolic therapy as a novel adjunct to standard of care and cancer bit of a mouthful probably not a Punchy enough name to really make it go crazy on the algorithm uh but it's a good talk and it has good good information in it anyway and um and so I would I would recommend taking a look at those and and um and seeing what she thinks and at the very least it's not going to hurt um it can help actually make chemo and radiation uh more successful by sensitizing the cancer cells to the Chon and radiation and uh protecting her healthy cells from the chemone radiation as well so I would take a look at those and um and maybe show them to her and see how she does because it's it's you know cancer is really nasty and um and you have to throw the kitchen sink at it um otherwise you know you're just sort of giving into fate and that's not it's not a good fate to give into so uh I would definitely try that it's not going to hurt her at the very least and I think it would help yes that's what the that's what the data shows anyway you know and and the thing is to you know you talk to a doctor if your doctor has a particular feelings on oh my God don't do that you you know that's a that's a discussion she can have but the vast majority of doctors that that or an oncologist that I speak to and that um patients speak to they say is there anything I can do with my diet should I change anything they say no don't worry about it eat whatever you want okay well then eat what you want and and if you feel that this is going to help you um along with that then uh you know it's worth a try and that's what more and more studies are showing to be helpful and uh and and increase survival and that's that's what we're trying to do here with things like cancer so good luck to to your friend",

    "body": "why is meat the healthiest and best compared to other proteins like eggs uh what to look for when buying eggs and butter thanks for always uh answering our questions well no problem you're very welcome so uh well just you know eggs are great it's just that some people have U you know a bit of a sensitivity with them particularly with the egg whites they can cause a bit of a reaction in some people other people don't have a problem with them so eggs are great eggs have a lot of wonderful nutrients in them especially pasture raised eggs if the chicken's eating what it's supposed to eat it's going to have you know the nutrients that that are optimal for um for it and the eggs and uh and then just sometimes there's there's different proteins in egg whites that protect it from bacteria and fungus and things getting into the egg and and destroying the yolk and the and the baby chicken so that's uh that's the issues that some people just have a problem with some of those and particularly raw egg yolks or sorry raw egg whites the yolks seem to be fine and especially people with autoimmune issues you know they're they're much more likely to react to eggs um and so it's just just to be mindful of that but I I sort of consider eggs honorary meat you know because it's all the it's all the nutrients that you need to then turn into meat right it's going to turn into a baby chicken so it's it's all the nutrients that that are needed for that uh new new life to come into existence so obviously it's a lot of really good nutrients for us to continue our lives U because that's the unfortunate reality of this uh you know world we live in which is that we're animals are heterotrophs and something has we have to eat other things to uh get the nutrients and energy that we need we can't get it from you know mineral sources and sunlight it would be pretty cool if we could you know that would make space travel a lot easier wouldn't it but um unfortunately we something's got to die for us to live and that's just life you know you the cycle of death and rebirth and this is something that people have been in tune with for as long as humans have been humans and so it's um uh yeah so a bit of a bit of a tangent there but uh eggs are great um you know red meat you know is the ruminant meat they typically well they they are able to ferment and break down and uh the different toxins and extract more nutrients than other animals are and so they they tend to be have a higher concentration of nutrients especially grass-fed and finished ones they just have a higher concentration of these nutrients but it doesn't mean but so objectively there's a difference there but that doesn't necessarily mean the others are bad it's just some are just the best and some are really really good but you know eggs are really really good and so I wouldn't worry about that um for when you're looking for buying eggs you want pasture raised eggs that should is supposed to mean that they're actually out on grass eating whatever they eat now they could be given corn and feed and all that sort of stuff but they're supposed to be giving that out on the grass where they could be eating worms and and things like that and and hopefully they are they U if they're done right in that sort of regenerative fashion where they're out eating bugs and things like that um they're much more nutritious and I think Joel Saladin talked about his eggs uh done that way um compared to USD egg so there was like a USDA egg had something like 41 milligrams of folate in it but his eggs had over a thousand so there's a big difference in the amount of Nutri n there so you look for pasture raised eggs um you get them from a farm that you know how they raise their chickens preferably or have your own chickens that are just eating whatever the hell they find preferably and um and then butter grass-fed butter you want to get grass-fed butter and um it usually going to be a deep dark yellow and that's going to have a better complement of nutrients as well and DHA EPA and the other fats and cholesterols that you want in a good ratio as well so that's what you look for",

    "body": "what's your take on the Sun or sunburns on aging skin well I think it's actually important to get out in the sun you know we're not we're not trog ites we didn't grow up in caves you know like we're terrestrial animals and just like other terrestrial animals we were you know made to be out in the sun you can definitely overdo it you can damage your skin and that can cause uh you know Burns and all that sort of stuff but it's it's so much harder to get burned uh when you're on a carnivore diet because a you're just bringing in a lot less inflammation you have ketones that are up that reduce inflammation even more most importantly you are not eating plant toxins that expressly make you more sensitive to UV light there are different kinds of toxins that do this there's an entire class of plant toxin called furano cumerin that these entire body of plant toxins they they all they do is just damage your body in the Sun and they when UV light hits them they irreversibly bind to proteins and DNA and Destroy them and damage them and this is when you get permanent damage and you get burned and your skin has to peel off because body's like nope these cells are destroyed we got to get rid of them and so that's that's from forano cumerin I mean you can overdo it and and and damage your skin to the point that of no return and it just has to Slough off but it's much more difficult when you're eating things with fanin and you're eating other plant toxins increase inflammation but you know make you light sensitive in particular uh you will just burn much more easily because you get much more permanent damage much more easily and so this is something this is not just this is did not just come out of of of nowhere um this this is actually recognized in dermatology it's called phyto photo dermat dermatitis so phyto coming from Plants photo and the sun dermatitis skin damage right so you get these plant toxins that combine with the sun to damage your skin and cause a dermatitis there's celery dermatitis um and um uh so celery has e fanic cumarin par Snips do all citrus do so the idea that well fruit don't have any toxins is not true uh they particularly have particularly have the Fano cumerin this is why you can't take certain medications with grapefruit because the Fano cumerin in those grapefruit will have to get detoxified by the liver so hey there's is that word toxin it's getting detoxified therefore it is a toxin right that's just a definition in terms and that takes up enzymes that also metabolize certain medications and so then you run out of that enzyme and you can't metabolize your medications properly you get problems uh to do with that and so uh and you know thinking about you know grapes and um avocados just on the fruit topic you know we eat these things okay well those obviously are good for you well actually they'll kill cats and dogs why do they kill cats and dogs because there's toxins in them that are toxic and life-threatening to cats and dogs so that means there toxins in it it just means that we're better able to weather those toxins than dogs and cats are but there's still toxins in there so I I think it's really important to get out in the sun I think it's still important to understand what your limits are but I I I get I did a a video on um YouTube and and um and Instagram talking about the Sun and getting out in the sun and all the different benefits of it you know the UVA UVB they stimulate different uh biochemical processes in your body they're actually really important and um and so it's uh it's good to get out in the sun and uh and so many people there people say hey I'm I'm a natural red head and I've never been able to I've only freckled and burned and now for the first time I'm actually getting tanned and not freckling or burning amazing and so you know it's it's a very different story when you're eating a proper diet which again sort of is is further evidence that this is a proper diet you know our body just works better and you can go out in the sun and you can you can um get much more use out of it but the idea that we just we just walk in the stun we just Scorch and burn like vampires it makes no damn sense you know we should be should be able to be out in the sun and be very healthy because we need to be in the sun where you get um you know vitamin D uh UVA actually stimulates nitric oxide stimulates goes into your retina stimulates your brain to grow and make new new connections and can improve our blood pressure our blood flow reduce clotting I mean this is amazing what the sun can do real important tip your bra your body and UVB stimulates um vitamin D right vitamin D gets made on the surface of your skin as a UV protectant that's your own body's natural UV blocking and that's another thing too when you're eating properly and you have a proper and you actually have olol in your body you can actually make vitamin D and your other hormones right vitamin D is a hormone and so you make vitamin D on the surface of your skin as a UV protectant and uh and then you actually it actually takes hours and hours and hours for this to soak in because you're going out in the morning okay we're going to make some vitamin D now to protect us from the Sun all day because it's expecting you to be in the sun all day and then sort of 6 8 10 hours later it starts absorbing into your skin and into your body and you actually start using it as a hormone and if you go in the sun and you get sweaty and you go take a shower and you wash it off you'll wash off all that vitamin D and we've actually known that since the 1920s we did studies in humans in 1927 where they scraped off the sebum that um the oils on the skin that body naturally produces where the vitamin D is in is fat soluble and scraped that off and gave that to mice with rickets which is a vitamin D deficiency cured the mice with rickets cured the rickets right and so it's just like okay so that's on the surface of the skin in the seum right so it takes a while to absorb and and some Studies have suggested that for full absorption it can take up to 48 hours to absorb all of that in so I'm not saying that you don't shower uh for 48 hours after you go in the Sun but I am saying uh to try not to shower for a good six to eight hours after you go in the sun and and that can help as well and but you know you can overdo it for me overdoing it was two weeks straight uh near the equator in Australia uh in the summer with my shirt off all day every day from dawn to dusk and um and uh at the end of it I was pretty damn red and um and that turned into a tan but I got a bit of flaking on my nose and on my shoulder tips that's it you know I I put Tallow on I always you because if you if your Skin's dry it's it can actually get damaged more easily but I put you know Tallow on every single day I was just glowing and then I kept putting talaan after that to keep my skin uh more moist and healthy and I did bit of flaking dry skin bit on my shoulder tips bit on my nose no sunscreen no sunblock anything like that just Tallow and that was that was you know that was being up in exmouth and Kini uh which are you know Parts up in Northern Western Australia uh in the blazing sun in the middle of the summer and uh for two weeks solid solid and and that's all that's all that happened so you know it's um it's dramatically different",

absolutely it's um you know they're trying to push this you know sort of agenda you know on people and it's um you know and and you know game changers can can say whatever they say all the elite athletes just but you know the all the elite athletes in the world I'm sure they're some that are plant-based or eat more plants and veggies and all that sort of stuff um at the Olympics you know there's always exceptions to the rule but um you even just eating more clean and not eating a bunch of junk food is going to be benefit um I think there's like a fencer that's like plant-based you know that that's that's a skilled position that some that person's been doing uh you know working on that skill for their whole life you know that's um you know diet has a lot to do with how much dedication and concentration can go into that but how long they've been plant-based how long have they been uh doing that and how long um have they been fencing you know some people are just you know very skill at that you know but doing you know long drawn out intensive exercises it's different and so a lot of people at the Olympics they were just saying absolutely not you know we're not doing this and so I think the Australian um tennis team just said screw it we're leaving the Olympic Village we're not we're not staying here and they actually went out to you know just get hotels and and get their own food because like we're not we're not eating this and um you know like the heavyweight uh boxer I think from Australia as well dudes like six foot eight and like 110 kilos and which is like 240 pounds so you know trim taller guy you know I'm I'm 105 kilos I'm 6'3 so um you know it's uh but that's a big guy that's a big guy and they're saying no you're limited to two chops that's it that's all you get and he's just like um no I need more than that and so you know the Olympics are getting a lot of backlash for that and they started uh you know drawing in like thousands of pounds of meat uh more a day is is so because the the athletes are just leaving they're like we're not staying here we're not dealing with these conditions and apparently like the beds are like made out of Styrofoam or something like that they're just like completely uncomfortable and horrible so they're just like yeah we're not we're not we're not living under these conditions like you know these These are these are the the best athletes in the world in their in their um sport trying to compete against all the other best athletes in the world to see who is the best um in this competition and uh you can't do that in um really crappy situations you know you're trying to get the best performance of your life under you know very subpar conditions so um they're getting a lot of backlash for that and I think that's good I think it's good that they're getting public backlash and people are just saying No this doesn't work like we need meat like meat is is uh important and they're not getting the performance uh that they wanted apparently like the swimming um they've been getting uh pretty you know average sort of times and people are just not having good performances they're saying like yeah we don't think it's a slow pool it's not like you know it's thick water or something like that uh it's just that you know people aren't uh able to to perform at their to their best ability because they're getting substandard nutrition they're getting this ideology foed on them and they're they're not able to perform and they're just and they're pushing back they're saying no you know we're not doing this anymore and they're having they're having their own meals brought in and uh and sometimes they're leaving the Olympic Village and just saying screw this you know we're not we're not staying here you know I mean you look at you look at uh you know lonel Messi you know when Argentina when they won the you know the World Cup uh he had shipped in to the World Cup 6,000 pounds of beef right um because it was just like no we're not we're not taking a chance on not having the right amount of food 6,000 pounds I mean that's a massive amount I I I I wonder how much of that they used I you know but you you go back you go back to um um oh God what was his name just you know one of the world's best soccer players um God what what the hell is his name I was after p and they're say oh this is the next p he's like I don't want to be the next p i want to be the next me um damn it but he anyway he was he was um captain of Argentina I think they won a couple World Cups and uh the same thing you know they they just brought in thousands of pounds of meat and they were just grilling up and barbecuing just tons of meat um and that that's what they did I mean this is the original Olympic games that's what they would do they would just eat tons and tons of meat leading up to it and then you the games you you you'd win you'd win cows and sheep and like that that part of the prizes was more meat so you know it's um it's very strange that they're doing this but it's actually I think it's I think it's probably a net positive for the world to see that try to push this ideology and have it fall flat on its face so people can just be like yeah that doesn't work and so you know hopefully some good will come out of that but I feel bad for the athletes that have worked their entire life for this and and are having their their performance uh you know lessened by the um or nutrition that they're being provided at the uh the uh at the Olympics so I feel bad for them but hopefully they they sort that out and people can get back on track",

    "body": "what is the connection between carnivore reducing heart attack risk I'm a 50-year-old male strick carnivore for 6 months and keep hearing about men younger than me having heart attacks yeah it's it's very concerning isn't it and um you know when you consider the fact that the first heart attack diagnosed and confirmed on autopsy in America was in 1912 and there wasn't a single case reported in the literature uh confirmed on autopsy of someone dying from a heart attack then uh you have to sort of wonder why the the hell that is and why 10 years later became one of the biggest killers and then few years after that became the number one killer in America even though we're eating the least amount of meat in America than we were in 200 years before or since and so in the 1800s we're eating far more meat oh people are only living to their 30s well people in their 30s have heart attacks now people in their 20s have heart attacks now uh my friend Dr Anor Verma is an ER physician in India and they eat three Kil of meat per person per year on average and he's seeing 17-year-old vegetarian kids coming into the hospital with a heart attack the hell is that so people just 17's not old enough I guess um it's it's pretty wild uh what people the mental gymnastics that people can do to deny reality in in front of their faces the average like expectancy from birth in 1850 was 38 but the average life expectancy from age 10 years old if you made it to 10 was 56 so and you get to 20 it's 66 and so on so if you get into adulthood and middle age you lived as long or longer than people do now and so it's just that the childhood mortality rate was very high and and early early deaths were high because it's you know it was a hard life you know we have it pretty piss easy now in the west you know you go out go to Bangladesh and uh you know go go see how they live not even in the refugee camps where I was working just go see rural Bangladesh or even Urban Bangladesh the vast majority of people are living under very different conditions than than we are and they have a life expectancy to uh compare that to India their average life expectancy from birth is around 60 60 something right and they're all vegetarians well wouldn't that mean that you know uh that uh you know being vegetarian is that all well but there's infant mortality and there's this and there's oh okay so now now there's a distinction but not when it goes the other way so um why does you know what's the connection between carnivore and reducing heart attack RIS well the simple thing is is that you're you're removing out things that can be causitive you know I mean cigarettes smoking um nicotine can cause damage to the artery lining diabetes causes damage to the lining of your arteries through glycation you're going to keep your blood sugar down you're going to keep your insulin down and uh high fat meat-based ketogenic diets like a cornor diet have been shown in clinical trials in humans to reverse type two diabetes that's one of the biggest risk factors for developing heart attack and heart disease and stroke and um so that would be diabetes metabolic syndrome both of which have been shown to be reversible with ketogenic um uh high fat ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet and people all around the world are reversing their diabetes with by going on a high fat carnivore diet uh that is ketogenic and getting rid of seed oils and these things these Industrial Products that have never existed in nature ever and um then you when you cook with them they can make uh trans fats they can they can partially hydrogenate and you make um trans fats that are extremely toxic they don't exist in nature either and and um you know that's why these things are illegal now because it's such a high risk of developing heart disease and and other sorts of health issues and when you cook with these plant oils they you know uh they can turn into uh trans fats so that's not good you don't want those but I mean the the the plant oils themselves um can be harmful as well so you're just eliminating out all these different things and so it's an Elimination Diet you're just you're just cutting out things that are bad for you so it's like you know what what is the connection between you know um not drinking alcohol and doing drugs and certain Health outcomes well you're just not doing drugs and drinking alcohol which damage your body and can precipitate these health issues same thing with cornivore you're just eating what humans have been eating since humans have been humans and so your body's just going to work normally and you're not bringing it all these other sorts of harmful additives um and for those who said that you know people died in their 30s you know before the 20th Century just remind them that since the 1700s the minimum required age to run for president of the United States was 35 minimum right and you look at all the founding fathers all these like white-haired old men usually wearing wigs because they lost all their hair right so tell me again how we only living to be uh 35 again so um you know John Adams was born in the mid 1700s and he uh was 92 years old when he died Jefferson I think was 6 was 84 and um uh Washington was in his late 60s and then he you know caught pneumonia working out in the field and just getting soaked wet and um and decided not to change because he didn't want to be late to dinner he was very punctual it was just all about gentle gentlemanly manners and and um that was very important to him and um you know it cost him he got had pneumonia and um pneumonia and he got very sick and he ended up dying probably from all the things that they were doing at the time you know all the blood leting and cupping and all that sort of stuff and it was weeks and weeks and weeks before he died uh but yeah he unfortunately died so you know unless something killed them they they lived to be in their 80s and 90s for you know centuries you know and so and yet there were no heart attacks and strokes confirmed on autopsy in America before 1912 and then in the 1920s it's massively increased in the 1930s it's the number one killer in America and it stayed that way and it just sort of kept going up and um you know now the prevalence and incidence the new heart attacks people having their first heart attack is getting more and more um common so you know in the in the 19 you know so you know liars and people that are trying to purposefully mislead you we'll use this line um that uh that the cardiovascular mortality rate peaked in the 60s and 70s and then started coming down right when we started you know going away from eating meat and fat cholesterol and and putting people on statins but that's not what we said the rate the incidence the the you know the how common heart disease was and how common heart attacks was went up and increased dramatically actually and worldwide deaths have increased dramatically as well uh just in America the mortality and these are age adjusted numbers always remember that age adjusted means they've changed the numbers and you you have to you have to sort of say well what did you change them to what are the raw numbers so don't age adjust them why the hell are you age adjusting them just tell me how many people have had a heart attack how many people have died from a heart attack they don't tell you that they only tell you the age adjust it is almost impossible to find the UN unage adjusted numbers I actually haven't been able to find the non-age adjusted uh mortality cardiovascular mortality I have not been able to find them and I've had um you know research assistants and and other people that have not been able to find them either it's very difficult it's almost as if someone doesn't want you to see them um so but that's not we're talking about we're talking about the prevalence we're talking about the incidence we're talking about the percentage of people in society that have heart disease we're talking about the the how many people a year get diagnosed with heart disease well that's just screening that's just better Diagnostics okay what about first-time heart attacks that's going up too so the number of people having their first heart attack and surviving is going up we have better interventions we have better access to Medical Care we have way lower smoking right it's in the 1920s and before when heart heart disease almost didn't exist 80% of men smoked right and so now it's far less than that and yet we have a far higher rate of heart disease and uh and deaths from heart disease actually than in the 1920s when it was 80% uh male smoking rate so you this is back when they were like telling athletes you should smoke because it opens up your lungs and gets your your cardiovascular system going uh just crazy but it um it it is the case that the first people having their first heart attacks is going up so why is that since we're reducing we've reduced red meat by over a third reduced fat saturated fat and cholesterol by the same in increased fruits and vegetables by 30 40% increased heart healthy grains increased um heart healthy uh unsaturated vegetable oils by over threefold and um and replaced uh you know these calories that you're you're missing out from animal fats with plant oils and sugar you know and sugar is supposed to be not bad for supposed to cause heart disease but then why the hell is heart disease increasing why are people having more heart attacks why are people all around the world dying of heart attacks and strokes more than they ever were before and that that and those worldwide statistics you can get and those are increasing and the deaths from cardiovascular disease is increasing beyond the rate of population growth around the world right so you're out stripping just how how how many people are out there right so it's not just wrong numbers it's percentage of the population is going up and up and up and like I said in India there are some of the sickest people and most metabolically sick people they have some of the highest rates of diabetes they're all plant-based right a traditional you know vegetarian Indian diet like I said you know my my friend Dr anchor Verma he's treating 17-year-old kids vegetarians that are having heart attacks 26-year-old lady came in had stroke this is crazy I mean you're destroying the potential that this person had for their whole life you're just destroying an entire life and um and and then people are just trying oh it's the meat it can't be the meat because um or not not the meat alone anyway because these people don't eat meat you know three three kilos of meat per year and 20 years ago they were eating five kilos of meat per year and they were healthier they're worse now the the you know diabetes rates in India for these vegetarian population is 25% and that's in urban and rural areas right and that's published in top journals and recent studies published in top journals um 25% of the population uh is type two diabetic contrast that with America when everybody says oh America they're all fat and slobby and junk food and this and that and blah blah blah and Americans are just the least healthy people on Earth the diabetes rate in America is 9% diabetes rate in India where they're vegetarian and all super healthy is 25% so why doesn't that show up in the blue zones right why why don't we make a movie called the anti-blue zones you have all these places that go strictly against that Blue Zone ideology and blue zones are anti-blue zones too because they they disprove their own Theory because most of them eat way more meat than they said they did um and um and they they lied on a lot of other different fronts as well but um you know you have the entire subcontinent of India oh look at this little population this how about you look at 1.4 billion people who are largely vegetarian and only eat three kilos of meat per year and see that they are the sickest people on Earth how would you look at that and um and and tell me what you think Lena thank you very much for the super chat if you eat ,000 calories usually but burn 2,000 calories as well because you run would you have to eat uh some of that back to keep your body healthy or no you know the thing is is that your your body is way more complex than any simple um formula ever going to figure out you know you have use hormonal um you have hormonal inputs uh you have metabolic inputs depending on what you eat you will influence your your metabolism in different ways if you eat glucose that um is you know you can use that as energy and that can stimulate your mitochondria and it gets used for energy stored into glycogen can get stored into fat if you eat fructose that largely gets turned into fat and it's actually toxic to the mitochondria so the well carbohydrates they both have four calories per gram kilo calories per gram but they have very different effects fructose blocks leptin upregulates gin those are your hunger signals makes you overeat has other sort of hormonal disruptions as well glucose will raise insulin fructose will raise insulin but actually it has a lower glycemic index so it doesn't raise your blood sugar quite as much as fast and so it won't have as much of an insulin respond as fast but it has other individual hormonal um responses as well and again blocks leptin which is satiety hormone upregulates gillin which is the hunger hormone and will turn into fat largely and and causes other sorts of problems as well so a calorie is not a calorie is not a calorie so you know we just saying 2,000 calories and you're burning 2,000 calories first of all it's it's almost impossible to see exactly how much you're you're burning a day because you don't know what your basil metabolic rate is you don't know exactly how much your body is burning if you're in a ketogenic diet or in a state of ketosis you actually uh Studies have shown that you can actually increase your basil metabolic rate by 350 kilo calor cies so just by being in a state of ketosis you will you will burn energy more efficiently and you go into you increase your metabolism so you're burning more energy as opposed to raising your insulin which actually depresses your metabolism it slows your metabolism so you end up storing more than you would otherwise and so your basil metabolic rate goes down and so you're not using as much energy so it really depends on what you're eating and just like every animal in the wild we should be able to instinctually know how much to eat I have never counted calories and um even when I was in cardor I just didn't do it um but I tried to you know maybe restrict or something like that if I was trying to lose weight but you know just not eat as much as I was hungry for if I wasn't working out all that much and didn't want to put on weight or was putting on weight but if you're eating what your body's designed to eat you should be able to listen to your body signals and just like every animal if you look at every animal on Earth you know some reason when they're eating their natural diet they just know exactly how much to eat you know so you don't see koalas uh you when they're just eating eucalyptus you know some are just like fat bloated with diabetes you're like well that one just doesn't have any self-control um or willpower you know they just needs to understand whether their calories and their macros and all that sort of you know they don't have calculators pulling out calculators to figure out what they're supposed to eat they just eat something tells them to start eating something tells them to stop eating and I find that goes by taste for us if you eat fatty meat if you're eating the right stuff and you eat which is fatty meat if you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you don't have to count calories and you're never going to be able to figure out exactly how much you you're burning or doing or using or not using on a day-to-day basis how much you're actually getting in how much that of that is usable and what that's doing in different ways ways you know protein is largely used for structural components it's not used to build energy so all that protein uh calories there aren't calories they're not getting energy from that so okay so how does that work with the equation you know so you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and your body will figure out the rest and um and you'll be fine um you know if you're taking if you're eating other things if you're eating dairy that can increase uh your hunger signals if you're eating carbs it will definitely increase your hunger signals if you're eating fructose it will even great uh more greatly increase your hunger signals if you're on medications such as prazone or prenolone or hydrocortisone that will increase your hunger signal so in you know in special circumstances you may need to sort of play with this maybe not eat as much as your body's telling you to but for the vast majority of people when only eating fatty meat and only drinking water you should be able to listen to your your body and just eat until it stops tasting good and but you really need to go until you get a and it just goes like that kind of just tastes like cardboard I'm not too interested in this anymore and and see how you see how you go and if you're not if you're losing more body mass than you want or you're trying to put on weight and muscle mass um you know just make sure you're eating enough throughout the day it's very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet it's very difficult to overeat because you physically don't want to do it because it starts tasting bad and you're just going no I don't want to do this so it's um it's important to at least eat enough and and and listen to that and sort of you have to relearn your hunger signals so if you're sort of feeling a bit off or low energy or this or something okay am I hunger or getting Cravings especially for carbs or sugar say like oh am I hungry is this what hunger feels like try eating some meat or eggs if it tastes good yes you're hungry keep eating until it stops tasting good and go from there and you'll do great",

    "body": "63-year-old female with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis was in a walker terrible pain on methat trexate and prazone stopped all meds um that's prazone stopped all meds when carnivore on um July 1st and in remission uh that's amazing great job really happy to hear that um triglycerides I'm assuming 60 HDL 85 LDL uh 290 CSC score is five doctor freaks out and wants me on a Statin where CSC score is five I mean that's basically nothing um so there's there's nothing really to uh get overly concerned about there you can always check that again in in a year or two and see what that's doing uh LDL is not a disease atherosclerosis is a disease and your CAC score five shows that you don't really have a burden of atherosclerosis at least not calcified now that doesn't show Soft plaque that only shows hard plaque uh but your triglycerides are very low which is great you know high triglycerides that that can cause disease that actually actually cause pancreatitis so you know that is a problem uh if it gets too high yours is perfect and your HDL is higher than your triglycerides which is perfect and your LDL actually shows that uh we're just seeing more and more data showing that higher LDL higher total cholesterol longer life and so this is just a just a an absolute con you know you're you've just reversed lupus and rheumatoid arthritis which I guarantee you your doctor would say is impossible and you've done it just by changing your diet and your off medications that can cause serious damage to your body as well so obviously Paradigm and understanding is wrong and so you've done something very simple and you've completely revolutionized your health why are we assuming that that's going to kill you by some other means those medications can those medications can cause serious disruption to your to your health and Metabolism they they can kill you eventually um you know but that's not what this is you're just eating real food and you're and these diseases are going away so why are we assuming that you know doing this and just naturally getting rid of the causes of your lupus and rheumatoid arthritis why are we saying that that is going to then cause heart disease you're improving all your health markers are improving and I would say your LDL is improving as well because that is that has never been proven never been shown in a causitive to have a causitive relationship with heart disease and you see it right there your LDL is 290 which is about you know three times what your doctor probably wants you to be at and your CAC score is five it's nothing you know you really don't start worrying about a CAC score until it goes over a 100 so you know if you're if you're really worried you get a get a kateed Doppler you know get a an ultrasound of your kateed that takes decades to build up you know so if you had anything there it's not just within the last year that's been there for a long time then you check that you check it again in a year or two see what happens it's getting worse okay you know then then we need to figure out what the hell's going on you know stress bad sleep other sorts of environmental toxins is it your diet you know it's not but um you know that's something that can be then then addressed you know I mean that's something that's worth addressing at that point right now you have one data point you have a c score of five which is you know nothing to write home about and you're feeling great and you've reversed very serious diseases that are debilitating and can be fatal and so what's the problem you know you're doing great and so um you can use this as a baseline you can check your actual objective markers your CAC score or uh you kateed Doppler and see what's going on I have a number of patients that have been reversing their atherosclerosis this is all anecdotal but this is It's they are reversing it had a gentleman in my my patreon uh chip who had 100% uh stenosis blockage of his right cored artery and a year before he started you know a year ago he was on Carnivore for a year now it's pton again there's blood moving through it so it's recanalized it's actually you know passing blood now so that is reversing right so that's amazing and um you know and so and statins you have to wonder about statins because they've never never shown a cause and effect relationship between cholesterol and atherosclerosis so you know why are we why are we treating something that's never been proven to be an issue uh ever it's never been proven and in fact the only five studies that have ever been done or randomized control trious it could show a cause and effect relationship when they lower saturated fat by replacing it with um unsaturated vegetable oils and margarine and lowered LDL cholesterol they actually found no benefit by doing this or in two of the larger studies that were better designed more people died heart attacks and strokes by doing that okay so they and they buried them because they knew what that showed they knew that it showed that the uh uh the cholesterol uh theory of cholesterol heart hypothesis was complete they disproved their own Theory anel Keys was involved in in the the Minnesota uh coronary experiment uh that was the largest and and best designed one of these and they buried it for 40 years it was only uncovered because the children of one of the original researchers found a box with his old stuff in it and they found the old data and so that's the only reason that we have this data there is in there isn't a single experimental study ever showing a cause and effect relationship between cholesterol and heart disease and so why are we treating it as if there were there isn't a single cause and effect relationship and maybe bring that up to your doctor and just say how do we know that there's a cause and effect relationship have there ever been any causitive studies that show a cause and effect relationship experimental trials randomized control trials showing a cause and effect relationship he will say yes of course there are because it would be crazy for them to be doing this sort of uh stuff if it if that weren't the case but it's not the case and um but because we've been taught to treat these numbers in the way that we are we assume that there must be a good reason for that but there's that old saying you know if you when you make an assumption you make an ass out of you and me and that that's exactly what they're doing and so you ask them is this like can you show me any any cause and effect you know randomized control trials to show a cause and effect relationship between high LDL and total cholesterol and heart disease because you know you haven't been able to find them and the only ones you found actually showed the opposite like the Minnesota coronary heart exper coronary experiment uh actually showed the opposite that had 10,000 patients uh perfectly controlled because they were in they were in institutions and so they controlled their meals you know so it's not like you just go home and Report like the nurses study and just say hey what' you eat last year absolutely useless study and it's designed to be useless so that they can manipulate the data and say whatever the hell they want but when you do a controlled experimental trial with people that you control the meals on it dead opposite results and so it's um it is uh it is the case that there there isn't a single piece of heart evidence to show that cholesterol causes heart disease and in fact there are tons and tons and tons of larger and larger studies showing that higher LDL you live longer you you you don't die of cancer as much you don't die of infectious disease as much and um and you don't die of heart attacks as much so this is just is just a flat out lie uh that has been perpetrated and is repeated so many times that uh it's just it's just in the Dogma but you know you ask them for evidence you say can you show me a cause and effect study a randomized control trial that shows a cause and effect relationship between LDL cholesterol total cholesterol and um or yeah LDL or total cholesterol and uh heart disease they can't do it because they don't exist the only ones that have been done showed the opposite so your doctor is very well-meaning I'm sure is and just hasn't seen the data because you know we don't get taught this in medical school uh which is which is a bit of a of a fraud honestly but um but that's that's the uh that's what the actual experimental studies show is that this is uh this is so good luck with that you're doing great keep it up keep up the good work",

Au has a big list of of doctors in Australia that are sort of ketom minded and and a lot of those would be carnivore and or at least carnivore friendly carnivore adjacent and um and so you can you could you know find different databases like that if you're in um it looks like you're in Australia so I think that's probably the best way is the low carb down under.com auu and look for a doctor in your area if there isn't an IST specifically in your area try to find a GP and then uh talk to them and say hey do you know any allergists that that um you know are on board with what we're doing here and and and they might be able to point you in the right direction or at least help you help you uh search that out um as far as reactions to meat eggs and dairy I would probably start by cutting out the eggs and dairy first and foremost try going to red meat try to go to meat that has not been aged and um yeah try try to S with like beef and lamb sometimes lamb is a little better for the histamine side of things they don't they don't you know hang them um uh after they you know slaughter them to sort of age them a bit uh for lambs they're usually just left and then just um uh butchered fresh and so that can be helpful as well and then you just try different different you know different meats that um that you think you can tolerate and you just stick with the ones that you can tolerate and you avoid the ones that you don't tolerate and so just a bit of self-experiment and self- selection is um is uh is pretty helpful there as well and uh yeah that's pretty much it and then you know getting um you know a doctor on the low carb down on your website that uh that you can uh go to and hopefully help you find an allergist um but I don't personally know any allergists in Australia unfortunately or maybe anywhere yeah it's very it's a very it's a very um Niche uh part of medicine uh but hopefully um there will be one that you can find on low carb down under or on um uh or or one of the GPS can help you so hopefully but you can also do just the self experiment and I would do that too most people react um if they're reacting to things they they will often react to eggs and dairy and then the other non ruminant Meats so things besides beef and lamb and goat so I just try try doing that cut out everything except beef lamb and goat if you can get it I haven't eaten too much goat around here but you never know and um and just go with the meat that you you do the best with and hopefully you can find what works for you and uh and and don't need um yeah I don't even need to get an allergist but you know hopefully hopefully you'll find one anyway all right good luck with that hopefully that helped",

    "body": "our daughter has suspected Ms and also on a waiting list for a gall bladder problems possible gallstone uh how does she start carnivore well specifically for the MS it's a good idea to get on a lion diet so just red meat and water anybody with autoimmune issue like Ms is always going to do best on just red meat and water so beef lamb and water a lot of fat especially for Ms you because that's a that's a dementing disease of the axons and the nerves that come down from the from the neurons and so that's really important those are made out of fat and cholesterol and so you need fat and cholesterol and you want to be in ketosis too because ketones cross the blood brain barrier reconstitute into fatty acids and they make up the physical structures of your brain and so you need enough fat you need enough ketones you need enough B12 almost everybody's low on B12 um I'm assuming that the New Zealand units are the same as austral Australian pretty damn sure and the and the reference range can go from anywhere from like 130 to 100 130 to like 650 700 800 sometimes a thousand but rarely um and uh so what the hell is it where where do you want to go and uh it's way above that anything below 400 can actually cause nerve damage and demelina on its own even without Ms and so if you have MS and you're trying to recover from these lesions and and repair the physical structures and the and the myelination of your axons you need B12 you need folate so you need liver um to make sure that you're getting enough of this because you're you're just going to be low on this so for her I would go on a a ruminant diet so beef and lamp I'd have a bit of liver you know just you know 50 grams a day for several weeks and you can bring that down to three days a week if you want to check the B12 check the folate you'll have plenty of B12 and folate on uh if you're having liver most people will have plenty of B12 f it just on the on the red meat but make sure you know because the depending on the quality of meat that you're getting is going to have more or less B12 and folate in it so you want to make sure you get enough and there's definitely enough in in liver of all descriptions and so uh check it again what you want to aim for for B12 is between 800 and 1,200 that's what you know we typically use as a reference range for optimal in um in our patients so that's what I would look at and I would make sure that she I would just do fatty red meat and water lots of fat being ketosis um just the red meat predominantly and um make sure you're getting enough B12 and vitamin D you should be getting enough from the fatty meat grass-fed butter um I'd avoid other dairies though butter being this the only thing or grass-fed ghee um if she has a problem with butter and um Dairy can definitely trigger autoimmunity and Ms as well so avoid those and uh avoid eggs too just just red meat just red meat and and grass-fed butter and or grass-fed ghee is okay as long as it's okay with her and um and see how you go and just get a lot of fat a lot of vitamin D A lot of B12 check your B12 B12 and vitamin D vitamin D you want to be between 140 and 180 and um a little above that is is probably fine too um up to 250 I've seen uh studies saying that that's perfectly fine even in cancer patient you try to get that up to 220 for instance and that can help so that's what I would do good luck to her um and she can just sort of jump in she doesn't have to like ease into it unless it's unless it's hard for her and she wants to ease into it uh I'd go ketogenic straight away no sugar get some liver in her uh check the B12 and so on but if she if she's able to willing and able can just jump right in I just jump right in and just go straight into it just cut all the garbage out just go be flam and water with a bit of liver and uh and and she'll she'll do well there are a lot of people putting their Ms into remission we just heard from a lady who put her her lupus and rheumatoid arthritis into remission without medication which is astounding um there tons of people that do it with Ms in particular too maybe somebody in this in this chat watching this video has done that so if anybody has had their experience please do share your experience with a carnivore diet and Ms in particular but any autoimmune issues uh as well because that's very helpful and hopefully um let uh you and your daughter see that so good luck to with that and good luck to her I hope she does really well",

    "body": "my friend was told she has nons small cell lung cancer very sorry to hear that they've told her that it is terminal and have her on uh prazone causing massive weight gain even when she doesn't eat can fasting and carnivore reverse all this well you know cancer is is an extremely dangerous and deadly and nasty disease even doing everything as best that we can and fasting and doing carnivore and ketogenics and things like that sometimes it's not enough and um you know there is there is a point of of no return but there are a lot of people finding that they are significantly improving their health issues there have been studies on La small lung cancer and ketogenic diets I'm nearly 100% sure just going back to that lecture I gave I those was some of the studies I came across were for non-s small cell lung cancer and so it's definitely worth a shot the prazone is you know it's it's a double-edged sword because it's reducing the inflammation allowing the their breathing to be easier but what it's doing also is causing diabetes and massively increasing her blood sugar and feeding that cancer and making that cancer much more aggressive and it's also suppressing the immune system which fights the cancer so this is sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy is um you know that she's on those medications to sort of help her symptomatically but they're they're accelerating her demise unfortunately so it just depends on how how much left she has in her how how much she has in her to fight this you know if she comes off the the prazone to get her blood sugar under control and she can fast and eat carnivore and ketogenic um and you know potentially address the you know glutamine action with different sort of medications press pulse um method that Professor CED has outlined in several of his papers and another paper that um I'm actually a part of that will be coming out shortly and um and that I talk about in the uh my uh talk on ketogenic metabolic therapy for cancer and our our um interview my interview with Thomas sea freed uh we talk about all this I think it can definitely help and I think it can definitely help her feel better and get more out of this and uh and be healthier for longer and I can't say that it's going to reverse all this I can't say that it's going to fix her I can't say that um she's going to be able to put this into her mission but I can tell you that others have um and that they are still fighting this you know I mean this you just have to sort of assume that this is always going to be going on in your body you really can't stop and so um you know if if she tries it I think it's well worth trying you know nothing else is really GNA do much I mean they've already given up on her and said that she's terminal and so they're putting on paliative measures and just giving a whole bunch of Penzone which um is just going to jack up her her blood sugar and and accelerate this cancer cells require 400 times the amount of blood sugar as normal cells and so you know you want to do everything you can to keep that blood sugar levels down not up because you take do a pet scan you inject radiol labeled glucose and you see where that goes you see dot dot dot dot dot oh that that's all the cancer cells are sucking up all that glucose so that's what's happening when her blood sugar is high it's just feeding those Cancers and they're lighting up lighting up lighting up so remember that pet scan anytime you have a bagel or a piece of bread or or have your prazone jumps up your blood sugar you really want to keep that down uh because the you're just you're just stuffing energy into these cancer cells which is exactly the opposite of what you want to do so I'm really sorry for your friend that's a very difficult place to be in you know especially because sometimes you know the breathing is so hard that they really can't go off the the steroids and that's that that's really tough and you know it's like for for brain cancers brain tumors you get a lot of swelling in edema you have to go on steroids you have to because the edema can kill you then you do the surgery you cut out the tumor and then you have them on steroids for another you know several days in a weaning dose and uh and then you come off of them you know when that swelling's down you've taken out the tumor so now it's not causing swelling anymore so you can get them off the steroid you don't keep them on for very long if possible and then you do radiation that causes more swelling you put them back on steroids and then you're sort of going down that rabbit hole but it's um it's something that in in certain circumstances when you have brain edema or you have so much edema in your lungs that you can't breathe that sometimes these are these are necessary evils and you know the fasting and carnivore diet being at least ketogenic so you're not adding fuel to I think is definitely going to be a net positive and hopefully it reduces the swelling down enough as well that she can come off the prazone and um and not be so horribly symptomatic that she's that she's miserable or or uh putting herself in danger of respiratory failure hopefully that's the case and and if it is and she can really attack this with you know getting her gki below two or below one if possible with with um combination of a ketogenic carnivore diet liver organs um some restricted eating and some fasting hopefully that that um is enough to start turning the tide back the other way there are people who have done that and it's a growing body of them and there there are there's a growing body of experimental literature of randomized control trials and Interventional trials that um may be you know controll but randomize um you know self- selected uh trials Etc that um that that are doing extremely well and there's a just there's more and more there are more and more of these studies showing that so uh good luck to your friend hopefully she gets a lot of improvement by going carnivore hopefully she's able to get off the praz zone and hopefully she's able to turn this around and um you know I think we're all you know we're all praying for so um good luck with that good luck to her you know and and have her watch and you watch my videos on ketogenic metabolic therapy and my interview with Professor Thomas C freed s y f r i d those are very important ones to know about good luck",

    "body": "carnivore for six months down 35 pounds I'm 47 uh still high blood pressure 160 over 110 my doc wants to put me on amlodipine until root cause is f found uh should I fill and take it uh well first of all congratulations that's absolutely fantastic that's a huge amount of weight loss um and I'm sure a lot of other health issues have been improved as well um I I I would absolutely agree with your doctor on this that um you know and it is important you know to to take uh you know the advice of your doctor way uh more seriously than you do uh internet doctors right because I don't know your full history I haven't done physical exams we haven't spent hours and hours talking to each other over over years to know you know your your specific details I I can only speak in generalities and I can only speak about you know what the data shows on the Aggregate and what my experience has shown in my individual patients and what we've seen and talk about different mechanisms but you know at the end of the day you know getting personalized Healthcare is really important but I would I would definitely agree with this high blood pressure is a major killer and it's a major cause of heart disease heart attack Strokes um and so you you you do want to control that and and even when people go on a cornard diet and they improve their diabetes and imp improve their blood pressure you can't just hop off medications you know you need to you can only do that in uh you know as appropriate you know when your body when it's when it's um when it's time when your blood sugar is down it's oh now it's going too low okay adjust that up keep that in that right range with you know combination of diet and and medications same with blood pressure if your blood pressure isn't being controlled uh then then blood pressure medication can be very helpful in keeping that down so couple things to check first of all there are there are causes of blood pressure uh issues that can be uh reversible call talking about these um secondary hypertension so there's something that's causing it you know like renal artery stenosis foch chromosoma you know different sorts of things that can that can be there that your doctor can check for and should check for it's very important to check for these things you don't just say ah well probably just yeah just high blood pressure is high blood pressure whatever no there there's some things that you can find that actually are reversible and be your high blood pressure being caused by something it's obviously it's all being caused by something but some of these things we know the causes of in other we have no idea um so we need to investigate that so work with your doctor to investigate those things and uh and reverse whatever's able to be reversible um but then the other things to think about high homosysteine can irritate the arteries cause constriction increasing your B12 and folate that will reduce your homosysteine in fact high homosysteine is a better indicator of low or inadequate uh B12 or B12 deficiency than even serum levels of B12 so check your B12 you want it to be on the high end of normal or even above the range for most reference ranges in America you want to be between 11 00 and 1,600 the rest of the world you want when it's so America it's p GRS so PG per ml pgml you want to be between 1100 and 1600 uh the rest of the world most of the rest of the world uses P moles per liter so PML and you want to uh have between 800,00 if it's Peak moles per liter and uh so that's what you aim for and if you do that and you check your homocysteine that comes down that can sometimes get your your blood pressure down also insulin insulin resistance you know it may it may just be that you're still dealing with a bit of insulin resistance test your fasting insulin first thing in the morning if that's above 10 that can also be an a reason why your blood pressure is a little high and if that comes down eventually that comes down that can help normalize your blood pressure as well the other one to not forget is while I don't have a problem with salt and General uh I do have a problem with it in particular cases because um about 20% of people are salt sensitive and can actually get pretty labile blood pressure because they use salt and so I don't use salt at all anymore just because of taste it doesn't taste as good to me anymore um but it doesn't bother my my blood pressure um and other people it does and so you just need to be mindful of that and maybe try cutting out salt as well as checking your insulin checking your homocysteine checking your B12 just cut off the salt see what happens check your blood pressure daily same time same conditions sitting down with feet flat on the floor don't cross your legs and uh deep breaths calm and relax chill out for about five minutes and then check your blood pressure there also something called White Coat Syndrome where you know you just you're just anticipating getting your blood pressure so your blood pressure goes up and you're like oh my God I don't want high blood pressure it's going to be high every time every time you're worried about your blood pressure being high it's going to be high so just chill out relax Deep Thoughts Zen out or deep deep breaths Zen out and just chill and and then get your blood pressure taken and that that that in itself can help and is more indicative of what your blood pressure is like throughout the day when you're not stressing out about your what what the hell your blood pressure is so give all those things a try and and investigate what's going on with your doctor and if all else fails you know I would take medication if I had high blood pressure I would take medication for it and I would recommend that to my patients as well because high blood pressure is a major killer and um and it's and it's a major risk factor for a lot of major Killers as well so um while you know 160 isn't a crisis you know you get over 180 and that is considered a hypertensive emergency that you should go to the emergency room for um you know if it's a true number you're not just freaking out because you're you're worried about something um like your blood pressure but if that's a real number then you know you need to go get that sorted out and quickly and so I would uh I would treat that I would definitely treat that and um you know in myself or in my patients I would make sure that they get on a on a better blood pressure regimen and then go through all those things we talked about to try to get to the bottom of it and um and hopefully you can come off the medications but if you can't you know that's what medications are for that's like the only thing medications are for is for when you do all the diet and lifestyle and uh sort of interventions and there's still something a bit screwy that's what medicine are for that's what medicines are for you know we're just using these as a crutch like oh something happens say Hey you fix my bad habits you know I'm going to eat and drink and do whatever and just trash my body you give me a pill to fix it well there are no pills that fix that crap you can patch it up you can you can cover up some symptoms but you're not going to fix that so you you fix that first with your diet and lifestyle and then if there's something left over that's what medications are for um and so you know you're doing it the exact right way you're doing all the right things blood pressure is a little high great fine take some blood pressure medication as your doctor recommends and then investigate you know why it is up and see if there's something you can reverse and and hopefully it is and hopefully you can you can come off the meds but uh until then probably a good idea",

    "body": "what's the difference between HDL and LDL and their role excellent question that's not um yeah I'm not probably not the best to answer that um but they you know they all have um the major roles of HDL and LDL is are transport molecules they're transporting fast lipids and cholesterol around the body and transporting them to and from the liver from your fat cells to your liver from your liver to somewhere else and then back to your liver again and so uh and there's there's a whole very complex biochemical um pathway and and um flowchart that you can sort of look at and you look at biochemistry books um and Physiology books you could sort of see that you know you start with like you know vldl try to say LDL and IDL and all these LL and all these other sorts of things and uh and there's different sorts of you know when they're when they're picking up and dropping off different amounts of fat triglycerides and and uh lipids and cholesterol and things like that so it's it's quite complex um but that's the main role is they're just transporting fat around the body and so why would it be that you know when we're we just stop eating so they say well when you eat fatty meat you eat more saturated fat all the El goes up because oh there's more fat in your body well you know yes it no you know because when you just fast and you just don't eat at all for 5 days LDL will go up HDL will go up triglycerides will go down that's the exact same pattern that we see when people just eat meat and so why is that well it's a metabolic State change you're running off fat your body needs to move more fat you know fat can't just freely move around the body it has to be carried and transported in HDL and LDL and so now you're running on your fat so you need to move the fat from your fat to your Li to then turn that into glucose and ketones and glycogen and then you know you're you're moving more fat around the body pretty simple um and it actually does a lot of other things as well actually has has a part um part to play in the innate U immunity so people that have lower LDL uh actually have have worse outcomes with infectious disease and uh and die more from infectious disease than people with higher LDL they die more from cancer than people with high LDL so this has a has a big role in your body it's not just moving lipids around your body it's actually involved in a lot of other processes and and where is it moving those lipids too maybe they're moving it to some damage side or some infection side and helping you know the body fight these infections and Cancers off so that certainly seems to be uh what is going on so it's a very good question but it's it's one that you sort of need a whole chapter in a biochemistry book to answer so you know check that out you know you can go and check out you know those different things um uh those different processes and and Pathways um and what they do but that's the main the main thing that they do is they move fat and cholesterol around your body and that's important to do because we need fat and cholesterol all over our body and our brain and uh so yeah your brain makes cholesterol if your brain doesn't have proper cholesterol there are tons of studies showing that if you disrupt the normal cholesterol metabolism of the brain you get serious neurodegenerative diseases and uh even neurodevelopmental issues as and diseases as well and now we're doing everything we can to disrupt and screw up our normal uh cholesterol metabolism of our brain by giving ourselves medications that cross the bloodb brain barrier and stop our brain from making cholesterol which is what our brain is made out of so so that's frustrating uh especially when they're talking about giving this stuff to kids you're like oh my God their their cholesterol is high what you know you breast milk is has the highest concentration of saturated fat and cholesterol of any food in nature good I hope they have high cholesterol because it's not high cholesterol that's a value judgment that somebody put on and they're wrong cholesterol does not cause heart disease it never has it never will has never been proven to cause it it has been disproven to cause it but he well you know that's only showing that th those particular fats were worse than saturated fat well show me one fat that is better than saturated fat show me one example of any experimental data showing that saturated fat and cholesterol cause heart disease there isn't a single one in the entire body of literature anywhere on Earth anywhere in history so why are you saying that it's causitive when you have no reason to say it's causitive um it's pretty frustrating but um you know but that those are the facts and uh and that's just you know as long as we understand the facts we can at least uh use those facts to to help our lives and not be sucked into these uh megalomaniacs who just want control and money so bit of a tangent sorry about that but uh

    "body": "in your experience how long does it take for Crohn's to go into complete remission on Carnivore I'm 52-year-old male carnivore for three months doctor started me on uh what is it skyzzy that's a cool name uh probably a horrible drug but a cool name um it's marketing that's that's all that matters um but I'm worried about taking biologics long term yeah well you know that's that's the whole idea is that it they can have you know long lasting issues and effects but you know when you're dealing with something like cron is very debilitating very ill makes you very ill and can be very dangerous and um you know it's it's the lesser of two evils in that circumstance but you know in this circumstance not so much so you have to be really strict with with uh any autoimmune issue and you'll notice this on Crohn's if you go off your biologics you go off prazone like that um and you have uh some you really need to be like red meat and water so like beef lamb and water high fat very high fat and you know when you do that you know you'll you'll find that that Crohn's gets into remission very quickly um I when people do a strict lion diet I have I have yet to see it take longer than three months and and typically people do a biopsy of their colon like a colonoscopy and take a biopsy biopsy there's like no inflammation on um on biopsy as well there can be other things if you're really stressed out you're getting poor sleep you're having other sorts of things other negative inputs in your environment that can make things worse um if you're still having a bit of of issues with just beef and lamb go for grass-fed and finished beef and lamb that's going to be the best of the best that's always your Baseline that's always the best you can do and then you know you you adjust from there if uh if you feel that you can usually grass-fed butter is okay but probably avoid it until you're you're sort of putting this into remission and you're off the biologics and you can see how that affects you because you might find and you probably will find that you know you have this in remission and everything's fine and then you have a pork chop and all of a sudden you know you have a bit of a flare up you're like okay get the hell away from that or some eggs and you have a flare up like okay screw that um and so you know you really need to be really strict red meat and water and usually people with crohn's do better because you know if you if you just eat a pork chop or a salad and all of a sudden you have bloody diarrhea for the next next three days like you're you're just never doing that again like yeah screw that I'm never doing that again that was horrible and um so was very easy to see whereas with things like Hashimoto you don't necessarily see it right away it you know increases antibodies that Dam damage your your thyroid start reducing thyroid function and then the coming days and weeks you start having less energy and feeling a bit more leth lethargic and tired and you're like H that's weird why am I not feeling so good well it was from that stupid salad that you had you know a week ago or maybe added back in because you didn't think it was that big of a deal so you've been having it every now and then and so they can be less strict uh with with something like Hashimoto whereas with crohn's you see it right then same with rumor arthritis like you're going to know about it if you eat something your body reacts negatively to and starts creating more antibodies for um so just go really pure pure pure red meat and water really high fat two grams of fat to one gram of protein if you can um and if you've been in you know remission and you haven't had a flare up and everything's been fine for for a few months you can absolutely uh think about you know having a trial off of the biologics and uh and see how you go and uh the you know actually I I haven't really seen anybody have a flare if they did that if they uh just stuck with red meat and water there are people that have been good for so long that they get complacent they think well I can sort of eat outside of that and then they have a big massive flare up and it takes a long time for them to get out of that flare up um but as long as they stay on just red meat and water they i' I've never seen anybody have a flare up otherwise um things can be a bit worse with stress and poor sleep so you know that's important to remember as well but um uh you know that aside just you know if you address that stuff and then just do red meat and water and you and you've had no symptoms you know for a month two months three months definitely uh you know definitely fair to try coming off the sky rezy and see how you do and you have a flare up and things get go horrible you can always go back on the meds you know it's not going to it's not like like playing russan roulette it's not like a this could kill you sort of thing if you have a flare you go back on medication fine you know but uh you won't you know I mean the the vast majority of people are able to put this in transission very quickly with a pure red meat and water diet but it really does need to be strict um you slip outside of that and unfortunately you're just going to get things in your body and your body G to make antibodies towards them and react and damage uh your intestines and um you're going to have problems so do the best you can just to stick to just red meat and water and I think you do really well so good luck with that",

    "body": "been on um PD Dialysis that's um paranal dialysis say uh for three years uh any worri starting Carnival War tomorrow no not at all um you know thing is is like if you're already on dialysis I mean even even if it were true that meat and higher protein damage to kidneys which it is not um you're already on dialysis you know you're not g to get more on dialysis right like it's like if your kidneys don't work they're not gonna you know they're not gonna like get get any worse right you're already there right um is it going to reverse it and can you get off dialysis there have been a handful of isolated anecdotal cases that I've seen of people coming off uh dialysis um three that I've seen and there's one who is on um uh paranal um paranal dialysis um who's who's been on on here and and been to some of my groups and he was vegan for a number of years and and at the you know R old age of 32 he destroyed his kidneys and um neurology and he was actually bedridden and couldn't walk and couldn't use his phone because his hands wouldn't work and he was on dialysis because of his vegan diet which has just destroyed his health and so anybody tells you the vegan diet is healthy you can tell them that um that uh they're out of their damn mind um and you know any diet that doesn't provide you even basic nutrients is a bad diet that like there's there's no two ways about that um and oh but you can supp no no no you don't you shouldn't have to supplement you know if your diet can't you know cannot provide basic nutrients it is a bad diet full stop so he actually is improving uh he's walking again he's working out he's exercising he's lifting weights and he's and he's back having a normal life again he's still on dialysis but he's making he's still able to make urine he's making more urine and making more urine so he's actually on the transplant list to get new kidneys but he is uh giving it a year and seeing if he can you know seeing what he can do in there and it has been improving will improve all the way that he doesn't need the transplant we don't know but uh you know it's certainly not hurting him anyway and it's getting better and um I did an interview with uh Professor Thomas wiim who is a um a professor and research scientist um Prof professor of bi biology and research scientist specifically in kidneys and kidney disease and chronic kidney disease and polycystic kidney disease and at um un University of California Santa Barbara and I just did an interview with him that you should definitely check out and and he's finding that that people are significantly improving their kidney function by going on ketogenic diets high fat meat-based ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet and and so he's a big fan of a carnivore diet as well specifically for kidney disease and chronic kidney disease and damage so it's very very interesting and uh and great to see uh more and more data and and hard research coming out showing that this is this is an improvement and uh so no there's no worries on that make sure you're you're you know drinking water appropriately eating appropriately all these other sorts of things and um and and uh yeah and hopefully I mean you you'll do better in a thousand other ways but it's um you know it it remains to be seen how much benefit you get from your kidney function I hope it works I hope you get off dialysis and don't need a transplant or anything like that um just depends on how much damage is done depends on what was causing it in the first place if it was from polycystic kidney disease that absolutely has been shown to be uh extremely helping in fact they um they they show that actually reversed a lot of the polycystic kidney disease and they they they tried to get another Grant um from the the NIH or whoever and um the the study design was amazing got the highest rating like all the people you know the peer review sort of things that looked at it said yeah this is a great study this is fantastic you should definitely approve funding for this and it went up to the higher higher ones that ended up denying it because they said these results are too good to be true no one's ever gotten results like that so they can't be true it's like it's like what you know it's too good therefore we're not going to do it um well that's why you test it isn't it you know you're not going to get anywhere if you just do the same if you do the same thing that that um people have always done you're going to get the results people have always gotten we're trying something new we're getting different results look at that let's test it let's study it that's why we want a grant and um no no Noe no couldn't possibly be goodness all right uh but that's that's what they're showing is that you know polycystic kidney disease is a major cause of kidney failure diabet diabetes is the major cause of kidney failure they both get taken out and uh can be reversed actually reversed with a ketogenic high fat meat-based ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet so good luck with that I hope it goes really really well for you and then you just have nothing but um good results and hopefully your kidneys get better too fingers crossed",

    "body": "How likely is it that antibiotics could stall carnivore adaptation one month in and I have periodically um stomach bloating diarrhea as well as a keto rash any advice greatly appreciated well it just depends um you know it's it's not it's not necess going to going to stop your adaptation to a ketogenic ketogenic uh energy metabolism necessarily shouldn't really um but it can certainly mess up your gut and make it so that you're not you're not really feeling your best or having a bit of disbiosis you can kill off a lot of the bacteria that are healthy and are supposed to be there and uh doing good things for you in your body and um and if that happens you can get these sorts of issues uh like you're describing bloating and diarrhea keto rash that well a it could be from you know if you're taking antibiotics and you're getting a rash you you need to ask is it is it a rash from the antibiotics and so you know that that you shouldn't discount that isn't necessarily A keto rash if you're on medication medications can cause rashes especially antibiotics if you're having a negative reaction to that if that rash spreads or you certainly get anything on your lips you're getting tic carrier sort of like like hives and you know big sort of breakouts and that could be like an allergic reaction it could be dangerous you need to go go go see your doctor right away probably go to the emergency room if it's really going crazy certainly it gets on your lips or in your tongue you just call the ambulance right then because that can get down the throat that can close off your windpipe even if you're driving to the hospital it could close off while you're driving you know not safe so anytime you get big swelling on your lips or your tongue or in your mouth you just call you just call the ambulance and you tell them what's going on and they get down there and they give you a shot of a adrenaline right then and there you don't you don't waste time with that so um but as far as bloating and diarrhea yeah that can absolutely come from uh from antibiotics and so if you're if you think you're having gut disbiosis you think you're having a a microbiome issue that's causing these problems because of the antibiotics you can always try to have a bit of fermented dairy so some live culture yogurt Greek yogurt that has very little carbohydrates putting that on meat you chew it up together in the meat so you're sort of burying those bacteria into that bolish of food you swallow that together it protects it from the stomach acid that sort of gets through your stomach acid in first part of your small intestine so you can get that bacteria down to the colon and you know do that for a week or two after that you hopefully things settle down your body can just get you normal and you'll support your microbiome as it's um as it's going to be fed on the things that you eat and what if you're eating what you know it's healthy for you you're going to have you're going to support the bacteria they're also healthy for you to have so um that's what I would do Colin wheeler uh thank you for the super chat again hey Dr chaum 44 started carnivore one month ago was prescribed um sulfam metho whatever the hell that is um for prostatitis a week into carnivore uh 30-day course one week left Jesus 30-day course wow uh worried that prescription is affecting adaptation well yeah so so I think this is sort of a continuation from the the last question may or may not be doing adaptation but a 30-day course is definitely going to trash your microbiome so I would recommend having like the fermented dairy and um and trying and just starting that now really and mixing that in with the meat that you're eating and eating that uh it's going to get killed pretty quickly because have all these antibiotics in your body but you at least you're trying to keep that seated and um and then when you're you're done with the antibiotics you just keep going with it for a couple weeks after that to sort of keep those bacteria in there because the the one one of the major risks is that you can get different sorts of bacteria in your gut that are more resistant to these antibiotics and now they they don't have any competition because you just you just scorched the field and you've laid waste to all their competition and these are a jungle down there and they're they're fighting for resources and now all of a sudden they don't have to fight for resources and they just go crazy and you get you get an overblown um bacterial colony of just one specific thing like Clum dis the seal so C is is a very dangerous consequence of long-term antibiotics uh and and so something you want to think about um is uh is receding your gut microbiome and if you're having too many problems or issues or you're getting sick and you think that there's you're getting bloody diarrhea and all that sort of stuff and you're getting and you're getting more unwell you need to think about you know is are you getting a sort of an opportunistic over bacterial overgrowth in your in your intestine and getting you know something like like a C diff sort of infection as a result of those long-term antibiotics and see your doctor but that's what I would do now anyway is start with with some yogurt it doesn't have to be much just a little dollop on some meat you chew it up together little dollop little dollop little dollop on each bite of meat you know it doesn't have to be a huge amount um and um you just do that for the rest of your antibiotics and then for a couple weeks after and hopefully that settles things down so a question from an Bei who says at a comfortable weight do not want to reduce anymore how do I know that my body knows this sure others have been in a similar boat yeah well you know how that it is an assumption but is an assumption based on on the this phenomenon being the case in all aspects of life in existence so all life knows how to eat in the wild you know they don't have a they don't have a coach telling them well you need these macros and those microbes you have to weigh your food and do all this crap they just eat they eat when they're hungry hry and when food is available and they eat as much as their body tells them to eat and it seems to work out and why wouldn't it right life is supposed to just work all on its own you don't need anyone to tell you what to do if you're doing something that's that's uh is is part of your biology and so it doesn't make sense that we would have to would have required these sort of macros and micros and you have to calculate this and do that because we weren't you people weren't doing this for most of the human existence people just ate until they felt I don't need to eat anymore koalas do the same Lions do the same whales do the same it's just that's how it is and so if your body can't figure that out you know you're gonna die that's it you know you're not going to make it in the wild and so if you have a species of animal that can't do that or you have an individual that has some sort of mutation that makes it so they can't can't do that they can't r regulate the amount of nutrition they can they their body needs they're going to die they're not going to make it Forward they're not going to you know they're not going to procreate and you're not going to have that as a species doing that because it's going to be so inefficient those individuals are just going to die off it's going to weed itself out and we came from other forms of life that were already established that were already there that had already won the game",

    "body": "Dr C can you give thoughts about sunscreen uh what do we need protection uh and do we need protection if going into the Sun for several hours thanks well I think that sunscreen is probably not beneficial for people on a carnivore diet namely because we make our own defenses against the sun because surprise surprise you know we grew up biologically in the sun we're not trogloditas we're not deep sea dwelling creatures that just can't deal with the sun we're supposed to be in the Sun what what damages us is we're eating a whole bunch of plants that are very prone inflammatory it causes a lot of oxidative stress and damage so when we get some sudden damage our body can't heal from it appropriately uh also we're eating plant toxins that are cause direct damage when in the sun they they're UV they make a sensitive to UV light um there's a whole class of these called ferano cumerin they're in all citrus parsnips celery these sorts of things and and a lot of other things as well and they will make you light sensitive UV light hits it and it binds irreversibly to proteins and DNA and permanently damage to them so you get this on your skin got your squeezing limes and that lime juice and oils get down on your skin uh and you're in the sun you will Scorch your hands you you actually get chemical burns uh my little brother actually did that we had lime tree when we were kids in uh growing up in California and uh you know a couple citrus trees and yeah actually we had a pretty awesome Garden actually little strawberry patch and kiwi Vines and and um and uh a lot of vegetables limes lemons oranges and uh tangerines and um yeah it was great it was a really cool little little garden and backyard so it um plums all sorts of stuff but um anyway so he went up and he was sort of picking limes and doing all the sort of stuff he came back and just covered in welts and we're like oh my God you know he's allergic to these keep him away from the from the lime tree and in college I remember I was up visiting him when he was at doing his university and he was like drinking a Corona had alignment I'm like isn't that is that going to kill you he's like I don't know you know maybe the maybe the corona like you know like neutralizes it or something I'm like probably not but all right at least they not dead and um you know so that's what I think may may have happened was that he was actually responding to these rumin and he just got light sensor got on his skin he just got this you know the sun damage the skin damage and that's something can happen it's in the literature it's called phyt photo dermatitis um and called celery dermatitis I spoke with um and I said you know people eating celery in the sun and the kids that are chewing on it and they're drooling and those juices go down their face they get just scorched in the sun um celery Pickers I spoke to a celery farmer who said that was like oh yeah no that's that's well known in the industry you have to wear gloves and long sleeve shirts and you really cover yourself up because if you get if you're picking Celler you get that sap on your skin you'll you'll blister and get horribly skin damaged and get very bad uh burns from that like oh my God and you're feeding this to people you know and they're eating it um so that's that's a major thing so if you're not putting in all these these damaging things in your body Suns fine I just put on Tallow Tallow or emu oil um you know I have a lot of the Tallow um sunkin sort of things that I have from um Stone and spear because I'm I'm partnered with with them and they make very good products they don't have and I I you know they have a whole bunch of things that don't have any sense or anything like that which is what I want and you know I also just get the Tallow that they have and just use that doesn't even need anything else some of them have like Tallow and like a bit of beeswax to give it a bit more form and structure but um or or a better consistency but you know it's um uh you can just use normal Tallow and or emu oil and um you know that's those are things you can do but yeah tall works great tall is the single best moisturizer and um you know it's just the best thing for skin Health that i' I've ever used anyway and um it works absolutely fantastic as far as sunscreen is concerned uh I don't think it's necessar required I personally haven't used sunscreen at all in Australia oh my God there's no ozone layer there is an ozone layer that that's another Mythic came around in the 80s they said there was an ozone layer hole in the ozone layer um over Antarctica and they said o if we don't stop these cfc's in America it's going to make that grow bigger and it could Co you know open up all over Australia well they knew actually at the time that this was seasonal it sort of open up for three months and then Clos and open for three months and then Clos like that so it's like a liquid it's like a liquid sort of ozone layer sort of moves around it's not just static and why would cfc's in America pop open a hole in Antarctica even if it were static doesn't make any damn sense so you know they they they got their wish they banned these things and maybe they are damaging I don't know but you know it's under false pretenses anyway um but that was a that was it it was a press conference oh look this this could go and it could cover open up over Australia and so then became oh there's no ozone layer over Australia that's where that came from there is an ozone layer um maybe it's thinner who knows um who cares you know it's just uh it's if if you're if if you're you know not in in you know you know exposing yourself to these sorts of things then you really don't need it the thing with sunscreen is that they have a lot of things like Benzene that are known carcinogens in the sunscreen that's supposed to be stopping you from getting skin cancer uh and yet as um I saw a graph years ago as hours of sun exposure went down over the 20th century skin cancers went up there it's it's inverse it's an inverse graph so the less sun exposure people have the higher when we were having less sun exposure we had higher skin cancers now that's not necessarily related that's correlation it's an inverse correlation it's not necessarily causation but it certainly doesn't show a correlation with sun exposure and skin cancer in fact it shows the opposite so okay is it just completely unrelated or is the sun actually good for you and protection your skin who knows uh am I saying that you can't get sun damage and that can't be a bad thing of course not of course you can get sun damage I'm saying that if you are on a carnivore diet you're not eating in this garbage and you're having enough cholesterol you're not eating plant steroids which mimic cholesterol so we don't make enough cholesterol vitamin D is made from cholesterol our hormones are made from cholesterol vitamin D is made on the surface of your skin mostly also in the epithelium and that actually is a natural sunblock as well and so you're making vitamin D from cholesterol if you if you have enough cholesterol if you're not eating plant steril and then you get vitamin D and it protects you if you're not if you're wearing sunglasses and with UV blocker your brain doesn't see that you're in the sun in the first place you don't make enough vitamin C you don't make melanin and you burn so if you don't do these stupid  things and you don't eat a bunch of stupid plants you know it's a different story it's completely different game and so um you're just not going to get as damaged like you really have to try to damage your skin uh when you're on a carnivore diet and you're doing it in that way especially if you're putting you know Tallow moisturizer on because it you know helps keep your skin protected and healthy and moist and um sunscreen as well that's something I learned in medical school from our professor of Dermatology she said that um spf15 is basic Bally they actually want to go and that's actually what I I was told by my parents when I was a kid that's what they said that after that it doesn't really do you much good and there's more chemicals and things like that and so that was confirmed by my professor of Dermatology who said that SPF 15 blocks 98.5% of UV raise pretty damn good you go up to U you know SPF 30 it now you're getting 99% blockage and you're using three four times the amount of chemicals to do it SPF 50 SPF 70 you're getting 99.3 99.5 99.7 you're using five six seven times the amount of benzene and other horrible uh chemicals um on your skin that soaks into your body you know there another another phrase I heard from a doctor was never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat because within 20 minutes it's G to be in your bloodstream so you know it's interesting probably not everything but you know it's it's it's it's a good thing to keep keep in mind as well that we do soak in things and absorb things through our skin and so you don't want to do that and um you know so you're you're adding in a whole bunch of chemicals and stuff like that that I I just don't think you need um keep your skin moisturized keep your body protected don't e a bunch of plants that are going to harm you and uh should be fine hey everyone if you need a little extra help getting started on a carnivore diet and my online resources that I have for free aren't enough for you you can go to www.how carnivore docomo challenge where you'll have online Resources Group support weekly Zoom meetings as well as the ability to chat live with myself Simon Lewis and the others in the challenge who can help you and support you and give you extra

    "body": "when starting pure carnivore how long should one expect to expect a temporary worsening of autoimmune symptoms to last and when to expect significant relief oh it's it it really just depends I mean most people when they're going on a a cornivore diet with autoimmune issue actually just get better just get better I mean some things with like psoriasis or something like that that seems to some people will have a bit you get a bit worse and then they'll get better um some people have a bit stubborn case with psoriasis especially and um and it can it can sort of last for months most of the time it clears up before that but some I've seen some people last months and then one gentleman he had psoriasis that lasted like six months it really wasn't shifting and he started using Tallow moisturizer and cleared it up and so that was that was sort of the missing link for him so if you have any sort of skin conditions or rashes I would I would recommend using Tallow as a moisturizer uh for the skin health and um most other autoimmune issues actually do just get better depends on what you eat though if you're having an autoimmune condition you really need to be strict just red meat and water so the lion diet sort of approach that Michaela Peterson talks about for her autoimmune condition where she's just like look I really can't you know she has a pork chop and it just sets her off um really badly she'll have a bad rheumatoid flare up so um you sort of need to be in that category you know maybe down the road you can sort of open it up a bit to other meats but you know at at first it's uh best to just do red meat and water and um and reduce stress improve sleep stress and poor sleep can can also exacerbate autoimmunity so um you know get all those sorts of things you need it's you need to sort of get a holistic approach it's yes diet is I think a number one most important but the other things are nearly as important as well or just as important because there are things that you're doing every single day as well it affects your body and your health and so you know you need to get those things right too um so if you do that and you're just eating red meat and water and you're eating high fat and not taking in anything else you should expect to see autoimmune issues start to get better but skin conditions like psorasis sometimes they're a bit more stubborn you just have to sort of wait and let them go through and uh use moisturizer uh the uh Tallow moisturizer that seems to help with skin conditions so good luck with that",

    "body": "I buy the carnivore arguments but there are so many real life counter examples for example many top athletes in the NBA and NFL eat nothing but carbs and junk food please give a rational explanation yeah it's it's pretty simple you know like you can you can do all sorts of crap it doesn't mean it's the best for you doesn't mean that that's the optimal diet for you you know there was there were you know top marathon runners back in the 80s and 90s who said yeah it doesn't matter what you eat as long as you work out and they drop dead of a heart attack at 40 so you know it's um you know is that is that is it an example of that's exactly the same and it's just as good or is it an example of you know they're working their asses off and they're fantastic athletes and um you know they're able to compete at that level because of all the hard work and natural ability that they have that says nothing about what is optimal for them would they be better on a carnivore Deb 100% I have no doubt of that in my mind and why do I say that because I'm seeing top pro athletes go from a standard diet or even a pretty good diet pretty clean diet or plant-based diet and then they go to a carnivore diet and they have massive improvements in their performance in game you have a lot of you know these GameChanger guys who uh got got fooled into that sort of thinking and you know Cam Newton injured himself out that year he was MVP of the league like two years in a row and just absolutely you know just crushing at every single game and then he was his performance was going down his performance he was getting injured he not recovering from injuries getting worse and worse and he injures himself out on the season and then he's you know had had a difficult time recovering since then I actually don't even know if he ever made a an established comeback but that was right when he went plant-based bad idea so you know you can you can eat crap and uh and still perform it doesn't mean that you're performing at your best it doesn't mean that you're per you're doing the best your body can do um it's not just diet diet is a major factor and it can give you a huge Advantage but you know working your ass off and having the right you know mentality to play these sorts of games is the most important you can have a perfect diet and not have that that instinct for the game and that that sort of killer mentality to go and smash somebody and really relish smashing somebody um and uh you know you're not you're not going to be playing the same as other people you know like your desire and drive and your will to go is uh is is much more important than that so um you can you can absolutely succeed at a lot of things and a lot of Endeavors eating different ways but that doesn't mean that it's that you will feel the best that you can and that you'll perform the best that you can I've seen the difference in myself eating a very clean diet but with meat carbs and veggies almost no sugar ever but sometimes and hardly ever alcohol uh well actually drank usually about once a week or something like that sometimes once or twice a week college and then I decided I'm not going to drink during the rugby season because I just feel so much better they're athletes that drink too they're athletes that do drugs does that mean that that's going to be the best for them of course not if they stop drinking during the season they're gonna they're have way more uh way better performance and they're going to feel much better too so that's be really the main thing you can do it you can get away with a lot but you're hurting yourself and you're not going to be a able to form to the level that that you would otherwise so that's the thing and so it's just a matter of of uh you know people trying that and you know more and more athletes are coming to this and more and more athletes are saying this has completely revolutionized my game and my athletic ability and my and my you know and how much work I've put in you know Ryan Talbot who um who went carnivore and then you know first of all like doubled nearly doubled his testosterone in a year to the point that the NCAA started testing him for for substances and you know came back completely clean and is FSH and LH you know which are the the hormones from your brain that would get suppressed by exogenous testosterone and steroids they're all normal levels they're like oh yeah your body's just making this stuff that's amazing good job and um you know so he he I mean think about that think about that as as already being a top athlete like the guys you're mentioning going to a carnivore diet and doubling your testosterone what's that going to do for your performance right it's going to it's going to absolutely just it's going to be unfair is what it is but um you know that's the thing and also you know everybody else they're competing again is eating this crap they're they're all you know and I mean that's a different Sho because people that have you know like a like a celebrity chef and a PT and all these sorts of people that are that are carefully organizing their meal plans and they're this and they're that and all that sort of stuff and there's the ones that sort of eat more laxidasical well why are why is that one able to compete when this is using all this other stuff it's just about you know just optimizing things and so you know with with Ryan like he said that his game just went crazy and when he got the the balance right on how much he needed to eat he was able to eat enough you know he losing weight at first and we talked about and say you need you need to find meals that you can stick in at different places and that's not going to be too close to your training that you you end up um slowing down your training and so he was able to do that and then he was saying yeah well now a problem I'm putting on too much muscle I'm getting too big I'm too athletic and that's a problem you know and so he want he wanted to keep his weight down a bit so he actually was working out less and getting more that's a good problem to have you know you have all these these athletes that are just desperately trying to put on muscle put on strength and uh and he's having a problem because he's putting on too much muscle right so you know that's that's what this can do for you and that and that's coming from him as a scholar ship D1 athlete at Michigan State right so he went from that level of an athlete to allamerican that year winning the Big 10 setting a School record in the decathlon that year then the next year you know uh getting second in the Big 10 earning All-American honors again and earning a spot on the USA team for the PanAm games and coming in and getting bronze right that was this year and now he's been invited to try out for the Olympics amazing that's what that's what switching your diet to something optimal can do it can turn you to a fantastic athlete to an exceptional Elite top tier athlete and so if you're already in that category um you know being in the NFL being the NBA or something like that and you ratchet up again it's just gonna it's G to turn you into a superhero you know like it does with all of us we all feel like superheroes compared to ourselves and so you know if they're already a top athlete and you Ranch it up from there my God it would just be uh be pretty awesome to watch and we're seeing this now we're seeing this in the Rugby World there's a ton of pro rugby players switching to cornor completely revitalizing their careers and just killing it so you know that's that's what you see is it uh can you do it sure is it the best thing you can do absolutely not would you get better if you went to carore 100%",

    "body": "thank you for the super chat um you say eat till full or food stops tasting good I eat lots of beef and lamb uh to where my uh kilo calorie is around 4,000 plus I've gained uh kgs but always hungry having some self-doubt so it does depend on other factors so if you're on medications if you are um taking any sorts of supplements or anything like that that could offset that then that that can be an issue also it's usually just until food stops tasting good um you don't have to physically fill pack your body but if you get to a point where meat just doesn't really taste very good that's your body telling you to stop you can overeat you can eat more than your body wants but it's it's difficult because it get it becomes unpleasant to do that if you are taking medications though that can cause you to increase your your uh hunger um a lot of psychiatric medicines will do this a lot of um um pain medications that also active psychiatric medications can do this as well and uh obviously corticosteroids like prazone cortisol hydrocortisone those things will absolutely raise your your hunger signals the other side of it is that depending on where you're starting from your hormones can be completely out of balance people get what's called leptin is a is a hormone that is a ctiy hormone released from your fat cells goes to your brain tells you how much energy you have and Insulin blocks that so we're eating a whole bunch of carbs our whole life and that sort of blocks leptin blocks leptin lectins those plant toxins all plants some of them can bind to insulin receptors five times more tightly than insulin and they also bind to leptin and all the other things that insulin uh in is involved in so it shuts down a lot of processes in your body when you eat these lectins or when you eat carbohydrates and your and your insulin goes up one of those things is leptin which is your satiety hormone um and so you can block that out you can get leptin resistance and uh then you don't actually know when you're satisfied when you're satiated and so you could potentially overeat even though you're listening to your body but the thing is is that if you don't check that you don't know um and your body is still telling you to sort of eat and um eventually that leptin will come down it doesn't actually take all that time long but it can take months uh depending on how high it is and how how strict you're being and so that can take some time there are people that do put on weight uh Kelly Hogan is a classic example of this she's done a a video with um Charles Washington who's been like a 20y year carnivore and um you know they talk about this sort of thing but she she put on weight but her health was improving she was improving she was talking to all these long-term carnivores who done this and seen all this stuff before and they were saying look don't worry about your weight don't don't measure just you know eat what's right for your body let your body heal there's a lot of hormones and things that your body needs to deal with and if your body needs a bit more than a bit more you can also try eating a bit more nutrient dense food which is like things like the organs adding a bit of those in because your body is chasing nutrients it's not chasing calories and if it if it will bring in more calories to get those nutrients as well because it needs them so if you're eating sort of less nutrient dense foods and meats it could be that your body's telling you to eat a lot more because of that add in a bit of organs little liver kidney and heart and more red meats especially more fat as well um that can help and so um you know beef and lamb Lamb's great but there are lean parts of lamb leg of lamb uh there's a lot of lean beef so try to get fattier cuts and and try to get some more um nutrient dense Parts like like the organs and just be patient your body's healing there's a lot of things going on if you're on any of these medications or any supplements or anything like that then yeah you may need to Li limit what you're eating because you you won't be able to listen to your body if you're eating dairy stop immediately because that can that can also make you eat more than your body actually wants and um artificial sweeteners as well so anything anything Stevia monk fruit sugar you know Xylitol sorbitol any of those things just get rid of them so just whole meat a lot of fat plenty of water nothing else bit of salt to taste your body will heal it'll get better if you're curious about it you can always check your leptin and if that's elevated you know you have leptin resistance and it's going to it's just going to be a bit more stubborn for you and um you know but it'll happen that will come down uh with any ketogenic diet especially carnivore diet because you get rid of the lectins on a K on a carnivore diet uh as well which you don't necessarily do on a on a just a ketogenic diet that still includes vegetables so yeah that's that's another thing ",

    "body": "people say like well there's no there's no um you know people say well there's no high level evidence to show that a carnivore Diet Works well first of all there's a lot of very good evidence such as your anthropological evidence of fossil record biology physiology um and Anatomy that actually shows yeah well we actually are carnivores and that that is what we're supposed to eat however there are are tons of high level studies that show that a whole food animal-based diet that is high in animal fat is one of the most efficacious and beneficial diets that has ever been studied the ketogenic diet is the most robustly studied diet on Earth in history is the only study that has the multitude of randomized control trials Interventional trials looking at specific Health outcomes and markers to show benefit or harm and it shows benefit and it's gone head-to-head with the DASH diet and you know beat that soundly and and shown again and again and again to be very very healthy now there are fraudulent studies where they look at oh well we look at low carb diets and low carb is not no carb and also you okay what do you look at as low carb they're like eting the same amount of carbs as as the other group so it's like yeah you really didn't actually control for carbs you didn't actually any carbs they're eating like 100 grams of carbs what the hell is that about you know that's not the same thing so they're using the name and they're casting aspersions but it's inaccurate so zero carbohydrate diet those have been shown to be extremely beneficial extremely healthy and while a ketogenic diet just means that you're not eating carbohydrates or sugar alcohol and you're going to be in a ketogenic metabolism you're going to be producing ketones you're going to be making your own blood sugar glycogen but what do they do that with you could technically do that with a vegetarian diet with a plant-based diet it'd be almost next to Impossible though to getting all the energy required from uh plant fats and things like that uh you could do it uh you'd be extremely nutritionally deficient so you'd have to supplement copiously um and but at the end of the day that's not what those studies did those studies did not look at vegetarian plant-based ketogenic diets they looked at animal-based diets they looked at the carnivore diet with salad so the most robustly studied diet on Earth the one that has been shown to be most effective most healthy is a whole food animal-based diet with some veggies and no carbs so carnivore diet with a salad that's the most rigorously studied diet on Earth so the next time somebody tells you says oh there's no there's no highle studies on Carnivore  you know all the best studies all the highest levels of evidence are on a carnivore diet with a salad that's what it that's what it shows so these are the same people that say oh meat's bad for you well no it's not because these studies look at animal-based diets with high animal fat and they all show benefit when done actually in a ketogenic fashion and and um and not you know these these these uh you know these these intentionally false studies so that's what they show so whole food animal-based diets have been shown to be the best diets on Earth they're not damaging to your health they're beneficial to your health and so the next time someone says well there's no high level evidence showing that that meat and carnal DS are good for you you call on that we need to reframe this argument we need to point this out to people that a ketogenic diet that has been studied is an animal based ketogenic diet carnivore light it's carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet so the only difference between these things is just the amount of veggies they eat the meat is the consistency there right so you know you're eating a carnivore diet carnivore light so carnivore with a bit of veggies and things like that we need to reframe this so we need to start you know showing that no an animal-based diet is the best diet it's the most rigorously studied diet plant-based diets they don't have any rigor to them they have no highle study showing that they're better it's only epidemiology these surveys they say oh once a year they say hey what did you eat last year like the nurses study it's nonsense they do that specifically so they can manipulate the data and say whatever the hell they want they call meat pizza and fast food just any fast food so you you buy a large fries fast food y That's meat no it damn well isn't and you know the drink and all that sort of stuff I mean this is this is just nonsense these are people trying to manipulate people for their own gain and benefit either ideologically or financially and uh and it's not the case so they don't do high level studies you have Dr Gardner from from Stanford saying oh it wouldn't be ethical to do a carnivore versus vegan diet oh because I mean you don't even get all these essential nutrients like fiber oh my God how can you get fiber you don't break down fiber you don't get any nutrition from fiber so it's not a nutrient in the first place if it's not a nutrient then it can't be an essential nutrient this is a simple definition in terms so this is this is him trying to escape the inevitability of of his ideology being shown to be completely backwards and wrong um where's the B12 in a in a vegan diet I mean how you oh it doesn't even have oh it doesn't even have fiber your diet doesn't even have B12 or DHA or EPA or retinol or D3 or K2 or thousands of other micronutrients that haven't even been named yet that only exist in meat and don't exist in plants so that's a a copout you know they they know exactly what that would show and that's why they don't do robust studies with plant-based di they don't do experimental data they don't look at fasting and they say oh you get these benefits from fasting do you get the same benefits from eating a plant-based D no no you don't um and so you know they're not doing those studies because you know they they don't want to see the results they want to put out week studies epidemiology surveys that data they can manipulate so they can push their own agenda and their own bank accounts and uh so we need to start reframing this we need to start talking about how the most the most rigorously studied diet on Earth is an animal-based diet is a meat and high a high fat meat-based diet high animal fat High saturated fat diet that's the diet that has been most rigorously studied there are thousands of highle studies on ketogenic diets that show significant Improvement and benefits to health and specific medical outcomes not just looking at correlations saying oh hey we sort of see this and we can sort of extrapolate whatever no we're doing an experiment saying hey this is the health outcome we're looking for let's see what happens right that's high level data that's good experimental data and the most rigorously studied diet on Earth is the animal-based diet the meat high fat meat-based ketogenic diet with a side salad carnivore light that's what it is and when we do carnivore full I think we'll find even more uh more benefits when you get rid of all of that sort of stuff as well but we'll we'll see but at least now the best diet on Earth is an animal-based diet a high fat animal-based diet so that's something that we need to reframe and when you start going into this um when you go into this uh these arguments and discussions with people you make that note we get that arguments out there and we have to shut down uh that sort of side of things where they say oh we don't have any High Lev yes we do there are thousands in fact it's the only diet that has these high LEL studies the plant-based di does not and there's a reason for that because they damn well know that it's ",

    "body": "hey Doc looking for some comparison info on whole milk and lactose free milk free whole milk is lactase any better than lactose so so the so it's yeah so the thing is is that is that people that don't make lactase then they can't they can't break down lactase into glucose and galactose so those are the two constituent uh carbohydrates that make up lactose uh and then you absorb the glucose and galactose uh you can't absorb lactose directly you have to break that break that Bond so it's a disaccharide it's two sugar molecules connected with a bond lactase severs that Bond if you don't have that if you don't make that then you can't can't absorb it can't break it down goes into your colon bacteria eat it they make a bunch of methane and gas and things like that and you get bloated and diarrhea and you don't feel great um and so that that's where that comes from so in in lactose free it's not sugar free it's not carbohydrate free it's just they add lactase in it and so they add that enzyme in it to break down those carbohydrates so now it's just glucose and lactose that's it so it's the same amount of carbs it's the same amount of sugar you absorb exactly the same amount it's just for people that don't make lactase themselves they they have the predigested so they can they can drink that that's really the only difference",

    "body": "what is your opinion on adding fermented vegetables some say gut diversity is beneficial you know we were talking about our our friend earlier in the in the session where they were on antibiotics for 30 days probably need some some help re restocking your gut bacteria I think you can do that just fine with fermented dairy like yogurt and live Culture Yogurt with low carbs low to no carbs hopefully and um but you put that on the meat you chew it up together in the same bite you swallow it together if you have an issue with dairy and you can't you can't really tolerate it I think fermented vegetables is uh is a you know you know is is an option that's available to you not because it's vegetables but because of the the bacteria that's in that and so you can use that as a supplement for the for the bacteria you could do that it's going to be an isolated incidence though I don't think you just I don't think just you just normally need to do this um you know we do see this people going from standard diets or ketogenic diets and they switch to carnivore diets and they check their microbiome before and then three to six months after they get massive improvements in their microbiome when they just go to carnivore so your your microbiome will change and adjust depending on what you eat and so we see in the and it does this actually quite quickly because the the replication rate of bacteria is about once every 20 minutes so they double every 20 minutes so a generation every 20 minutes right so just in this conversation that we've been having today you know me this one-sided conversation me you know listening to me yam on um it's been you know it's been 120 minutes and so you know we've had you know six generations of um of uh of bacteria in our gut right then right so you know they're fighting for resources they're living they're dying they're doing all that sort of stuff so it's very quick very quick turnover and so depending on what you eat that day or the next day and the next day you're going to affect that and you're going to send down different sorts of things down to your gut and your gut bacteria are going to are going to be promoted or or discouraged depending on those resources that are available the Inuit when they're eating just a natural diet they've had very very beneficial and very healthy microbiome when they're when they've been studied and uh and that's what we can expect when we're eating a carnivore diet so if you are you have very bad disbiosis or you're having long-term antibiotics that really destroyed your your microbiome um sure you have some fermented um foods but I would start with the fermented animal foods and you know keep it you know keep it in house and uh and try that but then again you're only doing this for for a week or two and then you should have an established microbiome and then it's just going to be perpetuated because of the things that you're eating I don't think you need to keep doing this for the rest of your life anyway so even if you did decide that fermented vegetables was the right thing for you you don't need to do this more than a couple weeks Max and then because of what you're eating you're going to perpetuate and support the correct bacteria that you want you not the fermented vegetables may not have all the correct ve bacteria you want going to have some you want some you don't want but the food that you're eating the animal food the meat that you're eating that's going to support the ones that you want it's not going to support the ones that you don't want so that's what you do so if you really if you really do feel that that's the right thing to do for you and fermented dairy doesn't work and you've had long-term antibiotics and all these sorts of things and you're having trouble you know sure that's a that is an option but again it's like a medicine you don't take antibiotics unless you have to you don't take you know biological agents if you don't have to you don't take chemo if you don't have to you don't take blood pressure medication if you don't have to and um and so you don't so use these as a medicine that's a medicine so you use it in specific circumstances to get a specific effect and then you stop there's a course to your medical treatment and then you stop and that's how I would approach that with this as well",

    "body": "How likely is it that antibiotics could stall carnivore adaptation one month in and I have periodically um stomach bloating diarrhea as well as a keto rash any advice greatly appreciated well it just depends um you know it's it's not it's not necess going to going to stop your adaptation to a ketogenic ketogenic uh energy metabolism necessarily shouldn't really um but it can certainly mess up your gut and make it so that you're not you're not really feeling your best or having a bit of disbiosis you can kill off a lot of the bacteria that are healthy and are supposed to be there and uh doing good things for you in your body and um and if that happens you can get these sorts of issues uh like you're describing bloating and diarrhea keto rash that well a it could be from you know if you're taking antibiotics and you're getting a rash you you need to ask is it is it a rash from the antibiotics and so you know that that you shouldn't discount that isn't necessarily A keto rash if you're on medication medications can cause rashes especially antibiotics if you're having a negative reaction to that if that rash spreads or you certainly get anything on your lips you're getting tic carrier sort of like like hives and you know big sort of breakouts and that could be like an allergic reaction it could be dangerous you need to go go go see your doctor right away probably go to the emergency room if it's really going crazy certainly it gets on your lips or in your tongue you just call the ambulance right then because that can get down the throat that can close off your windpipe even if you're driving to the hospital it could close off while you're driving you know not safe so anytime you get big swelling on your lips or your tongue or in your mouth you just call you just call the ambulance and you tell them what's going on and they get down there and they give you a shot of a adrenaline right then and there you don't you don't waste time with that so um but as far as bloating and diarrhea yeah that can absolutely come from uh from antibiotics and so if you're if you think you're having gut disbiosis you think you're having a a microbiome issue that's causing these problems because of the antibiotics you can always try to have a bit of fermented dairy so some live culture yogurt Greek yogurt that has very little carbohydrates putting that on meat you chew it up together in the meat so you're sort of burying those bacteria into that bolish of food you swallow that together it protects it from the stomach acid that sort of gets through your stomach acid in first part of your small intestine so you can get that bacteria down to the colon and you know do that for a week or two after that you hopefully things settle down your body can just get you normal and you'll support your microbiome as it's um as it's going to be fed on the things that you eat and what if you're eating what you know it's healthy for you you're going to have you're going to support the bacteria they're also healthy for you to have so um that's what I would do Colin wheeler uh thank you for the super chat again hey Dr chaum 44 started carnivore one month ago was prescribed um sulfam metho whatever the hell that is um for prostatitis a week into carnivore uh 30-day course one week left Jesus 30-day course wow uh worried that prescription is affecting adaptation well yeah so so I think this is sort of a continuation from the the last question may or may not be doing adaptation but a 30-day course is definitely going to trash your microbiome so I would recommend having like the fermented dairy and um and trying and just starting that now really and mixing that in with the meat that you're eating and eating that uh it's going to get killed pretty quickly because have all these antibiotics in your body but you at least you're trying to keep that seated and um and then when you're you're done with the antibiotics you just keep going with it for a couple weeks after that to sort of keep those bacteria in there because the the one one of the major risks is that you can get different sorts of bacteria in your gut that are more resistant to these antibiotics and now they they don't have any competition because you just you just scorched the field and you've laid waste to all their competition and these are a jungle down there and they're they're fighting for resources and now all of a sudden they don't have to fight for resources and they just go crazy and you get you get an overblown um bacterial colony of just one specific thing like Clum dis the seal so C is is a very dangerous consequence of long-term antibiotics uh and and so something you want to think about um is uh is receding your gut microbiome and if you're having too many problems or issues or you're getting sick and you think that there's you're getting bloody diarrhea and all that sort of stuff and you're getting and you're getting more unwell you need to think about you know is are you getting a sort of an opportunistic over bacterial overgrowth in your in your intestine and getting you know something like like a C diff sort of infection as a result of those long-term antibiotics and see your doctor but that's what I would do now anyway is start with with some yogurt it doesn't have to be much just a little dollop on some meat you chew it up together little dollop little dollop little dollop on each bite of meat you know it doesn't have to be a huge amount um and um you just do that for the rest of your antibiotics and then for a couple weeks after and hopefully that settles things down so a question from an Bei who says at a comfortable weight do not want to reduce anymore how do I know that my body knows this sure others have been in a similar boat yeah well you know how that it is an assumption but is an assumption based on on the this phenomenon being the case in all aspects of life in existence so all life knows how to eat in the wild you know they don't have a they don't have a coach telling them well you need these macros and those microbes you have to weigh your food and do all this crap they just eat they eat when they're hungry hry and when food is available and they eat as much as their body tells them to eat and it seems to work out and why wouldn't it right life is supposed to just work all on its own you don't need anyone to tell you what to do if you're doing something that's that's uh is is part of your biology and so it doesn't make sense that we would have to would have required these sort of macros and micros and you have to calculate this and do that because we weren't you people weren't doing this for most of the human existence people just ate until they felt I don't need to eat anymore koalas do the same Lions do the same whales do the same it's just that's how it is and so if your body can't figure that out you know you're gonna die that's it you know you're not going to make it in the wild and so if you have a species of animal that can't do that or you have an individual that has some sort of mutation that makes it so they can't can't do that they can't r regulate the amount of nutrition they can they their body needs they're going to die they're not going to make it Forward they're not going to you know they're not going to procreate and you're not going to have that as a species doing that because it's going to be so inefficient those individuals are just going to die off it's going to weed itself out and we came from other forms of life that were already established that were already there that had already won the game",

    "body": "Dr C can you give thoughts about sunscreen uh what do we need protection uh and do we need protection if going into the Sun for several hours thanks well I think that sunscreen is probably not beneficial for people on a carnivore diet namely because we make our own defenses against the sun because surprise surprise you know we grew up biologically in the sun we're not trogloditas we're not deep sea dwelling creatures that just can't deal with the sun we're supposed to be in the Sun what what damages us is we're eating a whole bunch of plants that are very prone inflammatory it causes a lot of oxidative stress and damage so when we get some sudden damage our body can't heal from it appropriately uh also we're eating plant toxins that are cause direct damage when in the sun they they're UV they make a sensitive to UV light um there's a whole class of these called ferano cumerin they're in all citrus parsnips celery these sorts of things and and a lot of other things as well and they will make you light sensitive UV light hits it and it binds irreversibly to proteins and DNA and permanently damage to them so you get this on your skin got your squeezing limes and that lime juice and oils get down on your skin uh and you're in the sun you will Scorch your hands you you actually get chemical burns uh my little brother actually did that we had lime tree when we were kids in uh growing up in California and uh you know a couple citrus trees and yeah actually we had a pretty awesome Garden actually little strawberry patch and kiwi Vines and and um and uh a lot of vegetables limes lemons oranges and uh tangerines and um yeah it was great it was a really cool little little garden and backyard so it um plums all sorts of stuff but um anyway so he went up and he was sort of picking limes and doing all the sort of stuff he came back and just covered in welts and we're like oh my God you know he's allergic to these keep him away from the from the lime tree and in college I remember I was up visiting him when he was at doing his university and he was like drinking a Corona had alignment I'm like isn't that is that going to kill you he's like I don't know you know maybe the maybe the corona like you know like neutralizes it or something I'm like probably not but all right at least they not dead and um you know so that's what I think may may have happened was that he was actually responding to these rumin and he just got light sensor got on his skin he just got this you know the sun damage the skin damage and that's something can happen it's in the literature it's called phyt photo dermatitis um and called celery dermatitis I spoke with um and I said you know people eating celery in the sun and the kids that are chewing on it and they're drooling and those juices go down their face they get just scorched in the sun um celery Pickers I spoke to a celery farmer who said that was like oh yeah no that's that's well known in the industry you have to wear gloves and long sleeve shirts and you really cover yourself up because if you get if you're picking Celler you get that sap on your skin you'll you'll blister and get horribly skin damaged and get very bad uh burns from that like oh my God and you're feeding this to people you know and they're eating it um so that's that's a major thing so if you're not putting in all these these damaging things in your body Suns fine I just put on Tallow Tallow or emu oil um you know I have a lot of the Tallow um sunkin sort of things that I have from um Stone and spear because I'm I'm partnered with with them and they make very good products they don't have and I I you know they have a whole bunch of things that don't have any sense or anything like that which is what I want and you know I also just get the Tallow that they have and just use that doesn't even need anything else some of them have like Tallow and like a bit of beeswax to give it a bit more form and structure but um or or a better consistency but you know it's um uh you can just use normal Tallow and or emu oil and um you know that's those are things you can do but yeah tall works great tall is the single best moisturizer and um you know it's just the best thing for skin Health that i' I've ever used anyway and um it works absolutely fantastic as far as sunscreen is concerned uh I don't think it's necessar required I personally haven't used sunscreen at all in Australia oh my God there's no ozone layer there is an ozone layer that that's another Mythic came around in the 80s they said there was an ozone layer hole in the ozone layer um over Antarctica and they said o if we don't stop these cfc's in America it's going to make that grow bigger and it could Co you know open up all over Australia well they knew actually at the time that this was seasonal it sort of open up for three months and then Clos and open for three months and then Clos like that so it's like a liquid it's like a liquid sort of ozone layer sort of moves around it's not just static and why would cfc's in America pop open a hole in Antarctica even if it were static doesn't make any damn sense so you know they they they got their wish they banned these things and maybe they are damaging I don't know but you know it's under false pretenses anyway um but that was a that was it it was a press conference oh look this this could go and it could cover open up over Australia and so then became oh there's no ozone layer over Australia that's where that came from there is an ozone layer um maybe it's thinner who knows um who cares you know it's just uh it's if if you're if if you're you know not in in you know you know exposing yourself to these sorts of things then you really don't need it the thing with sunscreen is that they have a lot of things like Benzene that are known carcinogens in the sunscreen that's supposed to be stopping you from getting skin cancer uh and yet as um I saw a graph years ago as hours of sun exposure went down over the 20th century skin cancers went up there it's it's inverse it's an inverse graph so the less sun exposure people have the higher when we were having less sun exposure we had higher skin cancers now that's not necessarily related that's correlation it's an inverse correlation it's not necessarily causation but it certainly doesn't show a correlation with sun exposure and skin cancer in fact it shows the opposite so okay is it just completely unrelated or is the sun actually good for you and protection your skin who knows uh am I saying that you can't get sun damage and that can't be a bad thing of course not of course you can get sun damage I'm saying that if you are on a carnivore diet you're not eating in this garbage and you're having enough cholesterol you're not eating plant steroids which mimic cholesterol so we don't make enough cholesterol vitamin D is made from cholesterol our hormones are made from cholesterol vitamin D is made on the surface of your skin mostly also in the epithelium and that actually is a natural sunblock as well and so you're making vitamin D from cholesterol if you if you have enough cholesterol if you're not eating plant steril and then you get vitamin D and it protects you if you're not if you're wearing sunglasses and with UV blocker your brain doesn't see that you're in the sun in the first place you don't make enough vitamin C you don't make melanin and you burn so if you don't do these stupid  things and you don't eat a bunch of stupid plants you know it's a different story it's completely different game and so um you're just not going to get as damaged like you really have to try to damage your skin uh when you're on a carnivore diet and you're doing it in that way especially if you're putting you know Tallow moisturizer on because it you know helps keep your skin protected and healthy and moist and um sunscreen as well that's something I learned in medical school from our professor of Dermatology she said that um spf15 is basic Bally they actually want to go and that's actually what I I was told by my parents when I was a kid that's what they said that after that it doesn't really do you much good and there's more chemicals and things like that and so that was confirmed by my professor of Dermatology who said that SPF 15 blocks 98.5% of UV raise pretty damn good you go up to U you know SPF 30 it now you're getting 99% blockage and you're using three four times the amount of chemicals to do it SPF 50 SPF 70 you're getting 99.3 99.5 99.7 you're using five six seven times the amount of benzene and other horrible uh chemicals um on your skin that soaks into your body you know there another another phrase I heard from a doctor was never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat because within 20 minutes it's G to be in your bloodstream so you know it's interesting probably not everything but you know it's it's it's it's a good thing to keep keep in mind as well that we do soak in things and absorb things through our skin and so you don't want to do that and um you know so you're you're adding in a whole bunch of chemicals and stuff like that that I I just don't think you need um keep your skin moisturized keep your body protected don't e a bunch of plants that are going to harm you and uh should be fine hey everyone if you need a little extra help getting started on a carnivore diet and my online resources that I have for free aren't enough for you you can go to www.how carnivore docomo challenge where you'll have online Resources Group support weekly Zoom meetings as well as the ability to chat live with myself Simon Lewis and the others in the challenge who can help you and support you and give you extra

    "body": "when starting pure carnivore how long should one expect to expect a temporary worsening of autoimmune symptoms to last and when to expect significant relief oh it's it it really just depends I mean most people when they're going on a a cornivore diet with autoimmune issue actually just get better just get better I mean some things with like psoriasis or something like that that seems to some people will have a bit you get a bit worse and then they'll get better um some people have a bit stubborn case with psoriasis especially and um and it can it can sort of last for months most of the time it clears up before that but some I've seen some people last months and then one gentleman he had psoriasis that lasted like six months it really wasn't shifting and he started using Tallow moisturizer and cleared it up and so that was that was sort of the missing link for him so if you have any sort of skin conditions or rashes I would I would recommend using Tallow as a moisturizer uh for the skin health and um most other autoimmune issues actually do just get better depends on what you eat though if you're having an autoimmune condition you really need to be strict just red meat and water so the lion diet sort of approach that Michaela Peterson talks about for her autoimmune condition where she's just like look I really can't you know she has a pork chop and it just sets her off um really badly she'll have a bad rheumatoid flare up so um you sort of need to be in that category you know maybe down the road you can sort of open it up a bit to other meats but you know at at first it's uh best to just do red meat and water and um and reduce stress improve sleep stress and poor sleep can can also exacerbate autoimmunity so um you know get all those sorts of things you need it's you need to sort of get a holistic approach it's yes diet is I think a number one most important but the other things are nearly as important as well or just as important because there are things that you're doing every single day as well it affects your body and your health and so you know you need to get those things right too um so if you do that and you're just eating red meat and water and you're eating high fat and not taking in anything else you should expect to see autoimmune issues start to get better but skin conditions like psorasis sometimes they're a bit more stubborn you just have to sort of wait and let them go through and uh use moisturizer uh the uh Tallow moisturizer that seems to help with skin conditions so good luck with that",

    "body": "I buy the carnivore arguments but there are so many real life counter examples for example many top athletes in the NBA and NFL eat nothing but carbs and junk food please give a rational explanation yeah it's it's pretty simple you know like you can you can do all sorts of crap it doesn't mean it's the best for you doesn't mean that that's the optimal diet for you you know there was there were you know top marathon runners back in the 80s and 90s who said yeah it doesn't matter what you eat as long as you work out and they drop dead of a heart attack at 40 so you know it's um you know is that is that is it an example of that's exactly the same and it's just as good or is it an example of you know they're working their asses off and they're fantastic athletes and um you know they're able to compete at that level because of all the hard work and natural ability that they have that says nothing about what is optimal for them would they be better on a carnivore Deb 100% I have no doubt of that in my mind and why do I say that because I'm seeing top pro athletes go from a standard diet or even a pretty good diet pretty clean diet or plant-based diet and then they go to a carnivore diet and they have massive improvements in their performance in game you have a lot of you know these GameChanger guys who uh got got fooled into that sort of thinking and you know Cam Newton injured himself out that year he was MVP of the league like two years in a row and just absolutely you know just crushing at every single game and then he was his performance was going down his performance he was getting injured he not recovering from injuries getting worse and worse and he injures himself out on the season and then he's you know had had a difficult time recovering since then I actually don't even know if he ever made a an established comeback but that was right when he went plant-based bad idea so you know you can you can eat crap and uh and still perform it doesn't mean that you're performing at your best it doesn't mean that you're per you're doing the best your body can do um it's not just diet diet is a major factor and it can give you a huge Advantage but you know working your ass off and having the right you know mentality to play these sorts of games is the most important you can have a perfect diet and not have that that instinct for the game and that that sort of killer mentality to go and smash somebody and really relish smashing somebody um and uh you know you're not you're not going to be playing the same as other people you know like your desire and drive and your will to go is uh is is much more important than that so um you can you can absolutely succeed at a lot of things and a lot of Endeavors eating different ways but that doesn't mean that it's that you will feel the best that you can and that you'll perform the best that you can I've seen the difference in myself eating a very clean diet but with meat carbs and veggies almost no sugar ever but sometimes and hardly ever alcohol uh well actually drank usually about once a week or something like that sometimes once or twice a week college and then I decided I'm not going to drink during the rugby season because I just feel so much better they're athletes that drink too they're athletes that do drugs does that mean that that's going to be the best for them of course not if they stop drinking during the season they're gonna they're have way more uh way better performance and they're going to feel much better too so that's be really the main thing you can do it you can get away with a lot but you're hurting yourself and you're not going to be a able to form to the level that that you would otherwise so that's the thing and so it's just a matter of of uh you know people trying that and you know more and more athletes are coming to this and more and more athletes are saying this has completely revolutionized my game and my athletic ability and my and my you know and how much work I've put in you know Ryan Talbot who um who went carnivore and then you know first of all like doubled nearly doubled his testosterone in a year to the point that the NCAA started testing him for for substances and you know came back completely clean and is FSH and LH you know which are the the hormones from your brain that would get suppressed by exogenous testosterone and steroids they're all normal levels they're like oh yeah your body's just making this stuff that's amazing good job and um you know so he he I mean think about that think about that as as already being a top athlete like the guys you're mentioning going to a carnivore diet and doubling your testosterone what's that going to do for your performance right it's going to it's going to absolutely just it's going to be unfair is what it is but um you know that's the thing and also you know everybody else they're competing again is eating this crap they're they're all you know and I mean that's a different Sho because people that have you know like a like a celebrity chef and a PT and all these sorts of people that are that are carefully organizing their meal plans and they're this and they're that and all that sort of stuff and there's the ones that sort of eat more laxidasical well why are why is that one able to compete when this is using all this other stuff it's just about you know just optimizing things and so you know with with Ryan like he said that his game just went crazy and when he got the the balance right on how much he needed to eat he was able to eat enough you know he losing weight at first and we talked about and say you need you need to find meals that you can stick in at different places and that's not going to be too close to your training that you you end up um slowing down your training and so he was able to do that and then he was saying yeah well now a problem I'm putting on too much muscle I'm getting too big I'm too athletic and that's a problem you know and so he want he wanted to keep his weight down a bit so he actually was working out less and getting more that's a good problem to have you know you have all these these athletes that are just desperately trying to put on muscle put on strength and uh and he's having a problem because he's putting on too much muscle right so you know that's that's what this can do for you and that and that's coming from him as a scholar ship D1 athlete at Michigan State right so he went from that level of an athlete to allamerican that year winning the Big 10 setting a School record in the decathlon that year then the next year you know uh getting second in the Big 10 earning All-American honors again and earning a spot on the USA team for the PanAm games and coming in and getting bronze right that was this year and now he's been invited to try out for the Olympics amazing that's what that's what switching your diet to something optimal can do it can turn you to a fantastic athlete to an exceptional Elite top tier athlete and so if you're already in that category um you know being in the NFL being the NBA or something like that and you ratchet up again it's just gonna it's G to turn you into a superhero you know like it does with all of us we all feel like superheroes compared to ourselves and so you know if they're already a top athlete and you Ranch it up from there my God it would just be uh be pretty awesome to watch and we're seeing this now we're seeing this in the Rugby World there's a ton of pro rugby players switching to cornor completely revitalizing their careers and just killing it so you know that's that's what you see is it uh can you do it sure is it the best thing you can do absolutely not would you get better if you went to carore 100%",

    "body": "what is your opinion on adding fermented vegetables some say gut diversity is beneficial you know we were talking about our our friend earlier in the in the session where they were on antibiotics for 30 days probably need some some help re restocking your gut bacteria I think you can do that just fine with fermented dairy like yogurt and live Culture Yogurt with low carbs low to no carbs hopefully and um but you put that on the meat you chew it up together in the same bite you swallow it together if you have an issue with dairy and you can't you can't really tolerate it I think fermented vegetables is uh is a you know you know is is an option that's available to you not because it's vegetables but because of the the bacteria that's in that and so you can use that as a supplement for the for the bacteria you could do that it's going to be an isolated incidence though I don't think you just I don't think just you just normally need to do this um you know we do see this people going from standard diets or ketogenic diets and they switch to carnivore diets and they check their microbiome before and then three to six months after they get massive improvements in their microbiome when they just go to carnivore so your your microbiome will change and adjust depending on what you eat and so we see in the and it does this actually quite quickly because the the replication rate of bacteria is about once every 20 minutes so they double every 20 minutes so a generation every 20 minutes right so just in this conversation that we've been having today you know me this one-sided conversation me you know listening to me yam on um it's been you know it's been 120 minutes and so you know we've had you know six generations of um of uh of bacteria in our gut right then right so you know they're fighting for resources they're living they're dying they're doing all that sort of stuff so it's very quick very quick turnover and so depending on what you eat that day or the next day and the next day you're going to affect that and you're going to send down different sorts of things down to your gut and your gut bacteria are going to are going to be promoted or or discouraged depending on those resources that are available the Inuit when they're eating just a natural diet they've had very very beneficial and very healthy microbiome when they're when they've been studied and uh and that's what we can expect when we're eating a carnivore diet so if you are you have very bad disbiosis or you're having long-term antibiotics that really destroyed your your microbiome um sure you have some fermented um foods but I would start with the fermented animal foods and you know keep it you know keep it in house and uh and try that but then again you're only doing this for for a week or two and then you should have an established microbiome and then it's just going to be perpetuated because of the things that you're eating I don't think you need to keep doing this for the rest of your life anyway so even if you did decide that fermented vegetables was the right thing for you you don't need to do this more than a couple weeks Max and then because of what you're eating you're going to perpetuate and support the correct bacteria that you want you not the fermented vegetables may not have all the correct ve bacteria you want going to have some you want some you don't want but the food that you're eating the animal food the meat that you're eating that's going to support the ones that you want it's not going to support the ones that you don't want so that's what you do so if you really if you really do feel that that's the right thing to do for you and fermented dairy doesn't work and you've had long-term antibiotics and all these sorts of things and you're having trouble you know sure that's a that is an option but again it's like a medicine you don't take antibiotics unless you have to you don't take you know biological agents if you don't have to you don't take chemo if you don't have to you don't take blood pressure medication if you don't have to and um and so you don't so use these as a medicine that's a medicine so you use it in specific circumstances to get a specific effect and then you stop there's a course to your medical treatment and then you stop and that's how I would approach that with this as well",

    "body": "thank you for the super chat um you say eat till full or food stops tasting good I eat lots of beef and lamb uh to where my uh kilo calorie is around 4,000 plus I've gained uh kgs but always hungry having some self-doubt so it does depend on other factors so if you're on medications if you are um taking any sorts of supplements or anything like that that could offset that then that that can be an issue also it's usually just until food stops tasting good um you don't have to physically fill pack your body but if you get to a point where meat just doesn't really taste very good that's your body telling you to stop you can overeat you can eat more than your body wants but it's it's difficult because it get it becomes unpleasant to do that if you are taking medications though that can cause you to increase your your uh hunger um a lot of psychiatric medicines will do this a lot of um um pain medications that also active psychiatric medications can do this as well and uh obviously corticosteroids like prazone cortisol hydrocortisone those things will absolutely raise your your hunger signals the other side of it is that depending on where you're starting from your hormones can be completely out of balance people get what's called leptin is a is a hormone that is a ctiy hormone released from your fat cells goes to your brain tells you how much energy you have and Insulin blocks that so we're eating a whole bunch of carbs our whole life and that sort of blocks leptin blocks leptin lectins those plant toxins all plants some of them can bind to insulin receptors five times more tightly than insulin and they also bind to leptin and all the other things that insulin uh in is involved in so it shuts down a lot of processes in your body when you eat these lectins or when you eat carbohydrates and your and your insulin goes up one of those things is leptin which is your satiety hormone um and so you can block that out you can get leptin resistance and uh then you don't actually know when you're satisfied when you're satiated and so you could potentially overeat even though you're listening to your body but the thing is is that if you don't check that you don't know um and your body is still telling you to sort of eat and um eventually that leptin will come down it doesn't actually take all that time long but it can take months uh depending on how high it is and how how strict you're being and so that can take some time there are people that do put on weight uh Kelly Hogan is a classic example of this she's done a a video with um Charles Washington who's been like a 20y year carnivore and um you know they talk about this sort of thing but she she put on weight but her health was improving she was improving she was talking to all these long-term carnivores who done this and seen all this stuff before and they were saying look don't worry about your weight don't don't measure just you know eat what's right for your body let your body heal there's a lot of hormones and things that your body needs to deal with and if your body needs a bit more than a bit more you can also try eating a bit more nutrient dense food which is like things like the organs adding a bit of those in because your body is chasing nutrients it's not chasing calories and if it if it will bring in more calories to get those nutrients as well because it needs them so if you're eating sort of less nutrient dense foods and meats it could be that your body's telling you to eat a lot more because of that add in a bit of organs little liver kidney and heart and more red meats especially more fat as well um that can help and so um you know beef and lamb Lamb's great but there are lean parts of lamb leg of lamb uh there's a lot of lean beef so try to get fattier cuts and and try to get some more um nutrient dense Parts like like the organs and just be patient your body's healing there's a lot of things going on if you're on any of these medications or any supplements or anything like that then yeah you may need to Li limit what you're eating because you you won't be able to listen to your body if you're eating dairy stop immediately because that can that can also make you eat more than your body actually wants and um artificial sweeteners as well so anything anything Stevia monk fruit sugar you know Xylitol sorbitol any of those things just get rid of them so just whole meat a lot of fat plenty of water nothing else bit of salt to taste your body will heal it'll get better if you're curious about it you can always check your leptin and if that's elevated you know you have leptin resistance and it's going to it's just going to be a bit more stubborn for you and um you know but it'll happen that will come down uh with any ketogenic diet especially carnivore diet because you get rid of the lectins on a K on a carnivore diet uh as well which you don't necessarily do on a on a just a ketogenic diet that still includes vegetables so yeah that's that's another thing ",

    "body": "people say like well there's no there's no um you know people say well there's no high level evidence to show that a carnivore Diet Works well first of all there's a lot of very good evidence such as your anthropological evidence of fossil record biology physiology um and Anatomy that actually shows yeah well we actually are carnivores and that that is what we're supposed to eat however there are are tons of high level studies that show that a whole food animal-based diet that is high in animal fat is one of the most efficacious and beneficial diets that has ever been studied the ketogenic diet is the most robustly studied diet on Earth in history is the only study that has the multitude of randomized control trials Interventional trials looking at specific Health outcomes and markers to show benefit or harm and it shows benefit and it's gone head-to-head with the DASH diet and you know beat that soundly and and shown again and again and again to be very very healthy now there are fraudulent studies where they look at oh well we look at low carb diets and low carb is not no carb and also you okay what do you look at as low carb they're like eting the same amount of carbs as as the other group so it's like yeah you really didn't actually control for carbs you didn't actually any carbs they're eating like 100 grams of carbs what the hell is that about you know that's not the same thing so they're using the name and they're casting aspersions but it's inaccurate so zero carbohydrate diet those have been shown to be extremely beneficial extremely healthy and while a ketogenic diet just means that you're not eating carbohydrates or sugar alcohol and you're going to be in a ketogenic metabolism you're going to be producing ketones you're going to be making your own blood sugar glycogen but what do they do that with you could technically do that with a vegetarian diet with a plant-based diet it'd be almost next to Impossible though to getting all the energy required from uh plant fats and things like that uh you could do it uh you'd be extremely nutritionally deficient so you'd have to supplement copiously um and but at the end of the day that's not what those studies did those studies did not look at vegetarian plant-based ketogenic diets they looked at animal-based diets they looked at the carnivore diet with salad so the most robustly studied diet on Earth the one that has been shown to be most effective most healthy is a whole food animal-based diet with some veggies and no carbs so carnivore diet with a salad that's the most rigorously studied diet on Earth so the next time somebody tells you says oh there's no there's no highle studies on Carnivore  you know all the best studies all the highest levels of evidence are on a carnivore diet with a salad that's what it that's what it shows so these are the same people that say oh meat's bad for you well no it's not because these studies look at animal-based diets with high animal fat and they all show benefit when done actually in a ketogenic fashion and and um and not you know these these these uh you know these these intentionally false studies so that's what they show so whole food animal-based diets have been shown to be the best diets on Earth they're not damaging to your health they're beneficial to your health and so the next time someone says well there's no high level evidence showing that that meat and carnal DS are good for you you call on that we need to reframe this argument we need to point this out to people that a ketogenic diet that has been studied is an animal based ketogenic diet carnivore light it's carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet so the only difference between these things is just the amount of veggies they eat the meat is the consistency there right so you know you're eating a carnivore diet carnivore light so carnivore with a bit of veggies and things like that we need to reframe this so we need to start you know showing that no an animal-based diet is the best diet it's the most rigorously studied diet plant-based diets they don't have any rigor to them they have no highle study showing that they're better it's only epidemiology these surveys they say oh once a year they say hey what did you eat last year like the nurses study it's nonsense they do that specifically so they can manipulate the data and say whatever the hell they want they call meat pizza and fast food just any fast food so you you buy a large fries fast food y That's meat no it damn well isn't and you know the drink and all that sort of stuff I mean this is this is just nonsense these are people trying to manipulate people for their own gain and benefit either ideologically or financially and uh and it's not the case so they don't do high level studies you have Dr Gardner from from Stanford saying oh it wouldn't be ethical to do a carnivore versus vegan diet oh because I mean you don't even get all these essential nutrients like fiber oh my God how can you get fiber you don't break down fiber you don't get any nutrition from fiber so it's not a nutrient in the first place if it's not a nutrient then it can't be an essential nutrient this is a simple definition in terms so this is this is him trying to escape the inevitability of of his ideology being shown to be completely backwards and wrong um where's the B12 in a in a vegan diet I mean how you oh it doesn't even have oh it doesn't even have fiber your diet doesn't even have B12 or DHA or EPA or retinol or D3 or K2 or thousands of other micronutrients that haven't even been named yet that only exist in meat and don't exist in plants so that's a a copout you know they they know exactly what that would show and that's why they don't do robust studies with plant-based di they don't do experimental data they don't look at fasting and they say oh you get these benefits from fasting do you get the same benefits from eating a plant-based D no no you don't um and so you know they're not doing those studies because you know they they don't want to see the results they want to put out week studies epidemiology surveys that data they can manipulate so they can push their own agenda and their own bank accounts and uh so we need to start reframing this we need to start talking about how the most the most rigorously studied diet on Earth is an animal-based diet is a meat and high a high fat meat-based diet high animal fat High saturated fat diet that's the diet that has been most rigorously studied there are thousands of highle studies on ketogenic diets that show significant Improvement and benefits to health and specific medical outcomes not just looking at correlations saying oh hey we sort of see this and we can sort of extrapolate whatever no we're doing an experiment saying hey this is the health outcome we're looking for let's see what happens right that's high level data that's good experimental data and the most rigorously studied diet on Earth is the animal-based diet the meat high fat meat-based ketogenic diet with a side salad carnivore light that's what it is and when we do carnivore full I think we'll find even more uh more benefits when you get rid of all of that sort of stuff as well but we'll we'll see but at least now the best diet on Earth is an animal-based diet a high fat animal-based diet so that's something that we need to reframe and when you start going into this um when you go into this uh these arguments and discussions with people you make that note we get that arguments out there and we have to shut down uh that sort of side of things where they say oh we don't have any High Lev yes we do there are thousands in fact it's the only diet that has these high LEL studies the plant-based di does not and there's a reason for that because they damn well know that it's ",

on positives I'm sure there will be positives I'm sure you'll feel better in a lot of ways I'm sure that objectively you're helpful improve in a lot of ways um chronic a can be there for many many many reasons it can be there for hormonal reasons can be there for metabolic reasons it can be there for infectious reasons and post infectious reasons and and just on and on and on and on and on nutritional deficiencies B12 deficiencies folate deficiencies you get extremely tired when you have these iron deficiencies all these sorts of things even before you get anemia you can get these problems that will later you cause anemia as well so you know it's um a lot of these things take a long time to heal and get back up to normal levels and to normalize to get you you back on your feet but but they often do you know some people with chronic L disease you it would take them over a year before they would get back up to normal energy but you know what they were getting better along the way and so even though they weren't back doing everything that they they did when they were 17 and in perfect health you know they are getting better so focus on things that that are improving focus on the ways that you're getting better and just be positive you know look at other people who have gotten better and say okay you know I'm I'm gonna get there you know you just have to just keep going be you know very strong the more strict you are the more careful you are with what you eat the better you're going to better you're going to be the more better results you're going to have and so to stick with it things like psoriasis that works you that that that responds very well to a corner diet because it's it's really eating these different plants that that are triggering the psoriasis and other autoimmune issues um sometimes psoriasis gets a bit worse before it gets better sometimes it's bit stubborn um and sometimes will actually benefit by putting Tallow like beef Tallow on their skin very good moisturizer best moisturizer you'll ever find as great for your skin that can help as well but just giv enough time most people in fact with psoriasis find that they improve in in the first weeks or months sometimes it like I said gets a bit worse before it gets better but it will get better you know and uh but then address other things in your life too stress levels ru stress levels you know prioritize sleep make sure you're getting enough sleep your body heals when you're sleeping when you're at rest and so you need to you need to definitely prioritize your rest time and your sleep time as well so all of those things and then pain neck pain shoulder pain a lot of these things come from inflammation you can have injuries of course and that those need to be addressed potentially with your doctor but if it's pain without any sort of real cause it's just like you just have a sore neck and a sore back a sore shoulder well you know then that can be undo inflammation from all the different things that you're eating and eventually that will settle down with a carnivore diet it will you're removing a lot of things that cause inflammation and you're also increasing your ketones which will again suppress inflammation on on its own so that can certainly reduce the symptoms of neck pain and shoulder pain as well it's not necessarily going to undo any physical harm that you've had done but it will certainly reduce inflammation can reduce the pain that you're experiencing and some people don't you know it's just sort of you the same thing you know you're not having any symptoms you're not having any problems so it doesn't matter you know what sort of underlying there if you're completely functional you that's that's what matters at the end of the day so a lot of surgeries are done because people just have pain you know compressed nerve it causes pain down that nerve distribution you change your diet it reduces inflammation you don't have pain down that distribution do you even need surgery the compression may still be there does it really matter if you're not having any problems neurologically physically probably not and then same thing with your shoulder or your knee if you have arthritis it's like this is this is really painful and I can't really function I'm going to need a joint replacement okay but then you reduce your inflammation you change the way you're eating and all of a sudden you don't have pain anymore well you still have the arthritis the cage didn't grow back but you don't have the pain you don't have the disability so do you need the surgery many people say say you opt to not get surgery at that point which is great you know you want to avoid surgery if at all possible and that's coming from someone who really enjoys doing surgery and can only do surgery if people want surgery done on them right outside of an accident or something like that so I like doing a surgery but I don't ever want to do surgery on someone who doesn't need surgery I I always try to encourage people to do things to try to avoid surgery and do whatever they can to avoid the knife it's always better do that if you can heal your body and and be functional without surgery then that's the best option sometimes surgery is necessary you just you just can't avoid it and it's the best thing for you but if it's if it's not necessary then it's best not to get it and so this is something that can that can help you and has helped a lot of people so um I would just stay strong and stick with it and keep going and be positive about it and understand this is not going to happen you know is not going to change over that The Closer you are to just red fatty red meat and water as you can get the better your results you're going to be the longer you do it the better your results are going to be so just keep it up and you'll be fine",

    "body": "Oscar says thanks stock also did beef butter for four weeks couldn't go longer due to fatigue uh even though I had plenty of fat had awful diarrhea too how to balance it while simultaneously needing fat for energy that's a good question so the thing is is that you do want enough fat sometimes you can get you know bit weird changes with your stools from from the turnover of your microbiome as you can get you know diarrhea weird sort of things with that as bacteria sort of dying off and and other ones are replacing it and you still need fat and so I would still just eat the amount of fat that feels comfortable for you and that gives you the right amount of energy um a lot more fat than your body can absorb is going to get excreted you just can't absorb it and so that can obviously cause stools and things like that um you know four weeks is is a good amount of time for the microbiome to sort of change over so you can you can try you know sort of pulling back on it and see how you feel and see if that changes your stools also remember that there are other things and this is this is only advised for people only eating meat only drinking water nothing else goes in into their mouth and down their their stomach right so things like coffee tea artificial sweeteners like you Stevia monk root sugar even um and everything else um supplements such as magnesium medications many medications but specifically things like meformin which is used for diabetes all of these things can cause diarrhea they don't normally cause it as much when you're eating a whole bunch of fiber because it just clogs up your pipes you know the fiber just gets there a whole bunch of bulk that you have to sort of move through maybe that's actually helpful in that situation because it keeps things moving doesn't get all cramped up but if you're not eating fiber then it just shoots through you so it's much more much more effective as a laxative when you're when you're not eating fiber when you're only eating fatty meat so think about those things as well if you have any of those in your diets come out and then start adjusting your fat if you're eating so little fat that your body starts getting actually so constipated that you actually get pseudo obstruction and liquid stools are the one thing they can't push it down more they just float around it and squirt around it you'll get liquid diarrhea and every now and then you'll get a hard Rocky Boulder that is very hard to pass and then you get more liquid diarrhea if that happens that means you're so you're so con you're so constipated you're you're basically taking such a low amount of fat that you're very very constipated and you need to dramatically increase the amount of fat that you're eating so that's what I would do um you know it's not you're not sick there's not a problem it's just inconvenient when you have this sort of thing some of it can be die off and other times it's just the fat or or these little supplements and coffee I only have one coffee a day okay it's enough and so people say well I've I've always had that I've actually cut down the coffee right but you also cut out other things that are going to block you up more like f so I would just uh try to get cut out everything that you can cut out and then play with the fat content and you know fat that you're eating to see to see how that affects things and then otherwise it's just a bit of time to let the microbiome change over but four weeks is usually enough and so that doesn't if that doesn't settle down on its own and I would I would address t he other things as well",

    "body": "Member says how best to approach carnivore with symptomatic gall stones I don't want to lose gallbladder well you know sometimes you know the horse can Bolt from the barn and it's sort of too late you know you have to just sort of deal with that um I would not suggest avoiding a carnivore diet I would not suggest avoiding fat because if you avoid fat then that's just going to stay static and you're going to build up more and more bile it's going to get more and more concentrated those stones are going to grow and then you will have a problem you know they're they're too big to pass normally or to break down on their own that's it that's surgery time and one of those may get stuck you may have major problems so there are people that have symptomatic gall stones and go on a carnivore diet and it alleviates their symptoms and they have no problems and I ask you have you gotten a scan since then have the has it cleared the gall stones they all say like never cared to because my symptoms are gone why why do I need to check it yeah it really is academic at that point you know like I was saying you know earlier like if it if it helps your arthritis and you don't need a Jo replacement like do you need to scan it to see that you still have arthritis like probably do just you're not having the symptoms it doesn't matter one way or the other because you're not treating the scan you're treating this the problem you know the problem is in that case with with arthritis pain and so if you're not having problems with the G not getting pain you're not getting instructed doesn't matter if they're still there I would be interested in that because I want to know I want to know what this does I would I would imagine that it it does make them go away you know either if they're small enough that they can pass out they can just sort of be expressed out when a gallbladder squeezes and expresses out B you can absorb fat that some of those little Stones go with it and you eventually just all these little suers out of there or maybe they're just you know less lower concentrated bile solution they just start to dissolve into that solution that would be great but it's hard to tell we don't really know I would I would still eat this way if you are eating fat you're at Le G to be moving that bile moving that b and you might be passing these things if they're big enough and they get stuck somewhere you you're going to need you're going to need a procedure if you get stuck in the common bile duct there's called ercp where they go snake a you know camera down your throat snake up there and try to SN snatch that that stone out of there and that's really important you mean you have to you have to unblock that tube there a lot of tubes in the body and one of the major jobs that doctors have is just like a like any good plumber just keeping those tubes unblocked and that's what um that's actually what a professor of anatomy Dr Thomas frell said in um in medical school is that is that doctors basically body is a system of tubes and the doctor's job is just to keep those tubes moving and unblock them when they get blocked and so he said that we're like plumbers who get paid less just don't get paid as much and um so that's same idea so you just you get that to blocked you need it unblocked and so hopefully that doesn't happen but if you already have gall stones you may have sort of caught it a bit too late but I think that not eating carnal not eating fat you're just now you're you're delaying the inevitable at that point because you're just you're if you're not eating fat the bottle's going to stay there it gets squeezed out if you eat fat it's designed to absorb fat and so the worst thing you can do is just not eat fat because just stays there stays there stays there and just turns into brick it just starts turning into it just gets more and more concentrated more and more concentrated just turns into more Stones so you're going to get more Stones if you don't eat fat so Catch 22 you know if you don't eat fat this is going to get worse if you do eat fat this is going to squirt these things out one of those stones might get stuck but the longer you wait the more likely that is so that's what I would suggest but I would be very cognizant of this because some could get stuck and you may need to get you know to to get into the to the doctor straight away because that that can be a problem so you may not be able to avoid this if you do lose your gallbladder in the end you can still do carnivore liver is still making bile just as not going to be stored in the gallbladder it's going to drip out constantly so you just need to eat the same amount of fatty meat you just need to split it up over the day because you're you're going to have to just sort of catch the bile as it's coming out of your of your liver and into your intestine a lot of people form what called a pseudo gallbladder eventually and this is an outpouching a common bot duct which works just like a gallbladder and so that can still you know act the same way so you can go back eating a big fatty meal and not having your diarrhea as well so good luck with that hopefully you know you just you just do it and it and it never causes your problem again that's ideal",

    "body": "Member says steroid hormone binding globulin and lowered free testosterone I've been seeing more and more on this as it relates to a carnivore diet I feel great so far but the prospect of lower testosterone is terrifying any help I've literally never seen that I've never seen that um I know people talk about it I've I've never seen in practice haven't seen it myself certainly I haven't seen any of my patients and this I'm in a practice that we check these hormones all the time and so we check them before and we say hey these are the lifestyle recommendations that and diet that I would recommend and we try to get you on the plan and if they go for it great if they don't we need find something that will work for them and the ones that are able to do this or even just just Chang you know I had a kid he was you know he his doctors was basically thinking he had primary testicular failure because he was 20 and his testosterone was way way way low I mean just ridiculously low and um know even for their scale which is way too low you know the the normal reference range was way way lower than that and you know what two months on a carnivore diet six weeks two months and and he wasn't even in his mom was like telling me that he wasn't he was like he's not really staying on this like eating more meat and that's great but he eats other stuff too he's not really sticking to it very well and all that sort of stuff and he came in said the same thing but he was even a lot more meat and he just wasn't wasn't wasn't as strict as as maybe he could have been and yet his testosterone still doubled in that time so I've never seen that you know there's a lot of lot of biochemical physiological reasons why that shouldn't happen you know when you get rid of carbohydrates and Insulin your testosterone should go up ferment actually comes down women estrogen goes up and growth hormone goes up in both cortisol goes down in both so um if it's elevated you know obviously if people have metabolic syndrome that can that can actually suppress your cortisol and that can actually come up slightly if people oh my gosh cortisol is going up this is a stress State that's this is your primary State the insulin driven State that's a stress State you are definitely stressing your body there that's that's not what your body is accustomed to is designed for so I've never seen that uh I have seen people's total testosterone go up pre testosterone go up and the steroid hormone binding globuline can sort of we and down for various reasons I've certainly seen it go the other way where someone's total testosterone went up a bit but their steroid hom biing globulin went down significantly and their free testosterone you know goes up massively so i' I've really just not seen that you know there's some people that talk about oh my gosh your testosterone goes down it's like okay well you know they're talking about in themselves and it's like okay well you're one person and is that the only thing that's going on and also what else are you doing you know a lot of these people were eating the ones that I've seen speak about it were the ones that you just but load of liver and organs and things like that well too much of a good thing is a bad thing and too much vitamin A can disrupt your hormones such as your thyroid that's another that's another common one gets maligned is that oh your thyroids got box exactly the opposite I see exactly the opposite in practice I see thyroid function improved dramatically people hashimotos disease Graves disease that actually puts these things into remission quite often and so that's H it's just exactly the opposite of what I see in in real world cases and the know vitamin A you know just too much vitamin A actually suppresses thyroid stimulating hormone so that that's a known consequence of having too much vitamin A and you don't need massively elevated amounts you just need a bit more than your body needs and that just starts to you know start starts putting stress on the system so I have I have yet to see that I doubt I'll ever see that there are other things to stress sleep these things can affect your testosterone most certainly and and the other thing too is that depending on when you your testosterone levels and how you take them you'll get dramatically different results your testosterone boom you get a big dose of that first thing in the morning and then it starts coming down over the day but it's doing its thing it's it's giving the signals that it needs it's turning on the genes that it needs it's stimulating the protein synthesis that it's designed to do and then it levels just go down but the effects of the testosterone are long lasting so you get it tested first thing in the morning it'll be one thing you get it checked from the late morning it'll be lower get checked in the afternoon it'll be a lot lower you get it checked in the evening even lower so it depends on when you're doing that if you have sex if you exercise intently if you are stressed out and get Contract you freak out at somebody who just cut you off you will affect your testosterone levels so even just hydration World matter and uh fasting can even matter how long you fasting all these sorts of things that could affect this so you need to take things consistently first thing in the morning between 8 and 9:00 a.m. fasting from 9:00 p.m. the night before only water after that at least two 8 oun glasses of water an hour or two before you take blood test no more than four glasses of of water at 8 ounces in the morning don't take any pills supplements don't take anything with biotin that's B vitamin and that can disrupt many tests and um you so don't take those for a few days before you you take any blood test really because you it can affect a lot of things and uh you know don't smoke or have coffee or anything like that just just just wait until after you get the blood test done and no sex or exercise the morning of or the day before and just be very sedentary and relaxed for a few days try to get proper sleep and uh this all matters this all makes a big difference and so um you know when people do this in a consistent manner I only see for for men I only see their testosterone going up I see men in their 60s and 70s come off of testosterone replacement therapy because they don't need it anymore and they feel amazing their levels are going too high so you you take them off of that and all of a sudden they actually have a rebounding effect because now their bodies are making the stuff and you've actually rested the organ for a while and actually can make testosterone a little better now and people have this big jump in their testosterone after coming off you know testosterone replacement therapy obviously there's going to be a bit of a dip at first but then your body rebound is able to make make a much better have a much better sort of physiological response so um that's a rumor that's running around I've literally never seen that in my life I've certainly never experienced it you know you see a lot of people in their 20s 30s 40s 50s you know athletes that I work with you know have literally doubled their testosterone as an elite world class athlete and they double their testosterone on top of that I mean imagine what that does to performance to the point that they're getting drug tested because they're like your testosterone just shouldn't jump like that it's like okay well it did because of this you know radical diet change so no I I don't see that and I wouldn't worry about that in fact you'll get the opposite and he does and you know look at Sean Baker guy's jacked and he's you know breaking World Records you know left right and center and he you know he put out his testosterone levels and they were they were fine I me they're not like you know atrociously High you know like a teenager or something like that but he's not a teenager and uh he's he's jacked he's getting everything done he's he's you working out like a boss he's developing muscle he's just getting more and more muscular the more he works out you know what's the problem he's clearly not testosterone deficient and also you get more efficient at using testosterone because your testosterone receptors go up so you don't need as much testosterone even when your testosterone receptors go up because you get you get the more effect when you have more receptors so um we get more of an effect with testosterone receptors being up and so even with less testosterone you may have this a similar effect if you have more receptors and less testosterone you can still get the same physiological effect so there's a lot that goes into this but um that's another thing really just uh just eat meat drink water have some organs every now and then but just don't go crazy just don't don't have too much of these things and um and then work out lift weights and then take your your blood tests in a reasonable manner at the same time consistent Manner and and you'll be fine",

    "body": "good day doc I'm sure it's been talked to death but after reading outlived by Dr AA he mentions the danger of Appo and how the L LDL isn't dangerous but how the carriers cause plaque I mean I don't know why he's saying that because there is there saying cause because there are no causitive studies there none there are no studies to show causation between apple b or any other factor in cholesterol and atherosclerosis so um Apple also how do you measure this you're measuring Apple so you Apple 100 molecule on L um can be damaged through glycation so that's really the problem there isn't it the glycation you have the glucose molecules physically fusing to LDL and knocks off that Appo b00 can't be recognized by the liver and now it's just getting running around and get sucked up by these macrophases but they scavenge your receptors on your macrophases big and those those are called foam cells so that's releasing apple b00 or termed apple b and so that's that's free Apple B in your in your serum but the problem is is that you can't that test doesn't actually distinguish between appleb that's free floating and damaged and the ones that's just on these health healthy carrier molecules so what it which is right and also is it the apple b that's causing the problem is it that free Apple B that's causing the problem or the sdldl that's causing the problem um this is sort of a damaged glycation end product if you will is that causing the problem or is it the glycation that's causing that to get elevated causing other problems right because even sdldl only has a weak association with heart disease it's like 70% increased risk if you have high SD LDL which you shouldn't you should not have that if you're eating a normal diet if you're eating a carnivore diet you won't have unless you're very highly stressed not getting good sleep things like that there are other factors but that's a major one and so metabolic syndrome is 600% increased risk so that's a much bigger risk right and one of the factors for metabolic for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is low HDL and high triglycerides well you get the opposite of that on a carnivore diet on high high fat carnivore diet right so that's actually improving your metabolic function right and you actually improve your St your s will go down as well and then diabetes is is a th% increased risk Association right that's up there with smoking and so the cholesterol part of that is actually very weak Association and so it's a much stronger Association much stronger relative risk as it as these things can be Quantified because you can't really quantify risk without experimental data which we just don't have this is all associative studies which he knows I mean he knows I know he knows you know but I've seen him talk about like well if you understand statistics and Mathematics and you know that LDL is causative to atherosclerosis it's like no no if you understand statistics and Mathematics you know that that's not the case because you can only show causation with certain studies with experimental trials and then you know how how welld designed was the study how you know how closely can we extrapolate this to the real you know general population you know because experiments are not real life right so they they may not actually be uh able you may not be able to extrapolate you know much out of them and so uh I would watch a video by Dr Paul Mason uh who's buddy of mine man's brilliant a guy just he he only works four days a week because he take he wants to spend an entire day reading studies you know this guy is like you will not find anyone else more well versed in the literature than this guy it's just amazing um how how interested he is fascinated he is you know by this whole you know subject of medicine and human health and Physiology like he's just f fated by it he just he just wants to learn as much as he can he's just very interested so watch that is a Quick Clip it's like less than five minutes on Apple B and it just tells you how basically that's a pretty useless uh marker you because you don't know what you're getting you don't know if it's the the free floating damaged epob that's been torn off the LDL or if it's the LDL on the on the healthy molecules that's not going to cause a problem so um I watch that again cholesterol was never the problem it was a scapegoat by the sugar companies why are we still banging this drum why are we still beating this dead horse this has been proven conclusively with their own data their own internal memos showing hey we're gonna pay these people off to say that cholesterol caused heart disease because it's probably sugar and people are on to us so we need to we need to throw the scent off the trip this is this has been long recorded you know this is not a this is not a a debate this is this is a matter of record they did that that happened and so you have to just throw it all out cholesterol was never the problem their own study showed a reverse inverse association between cholesterol LDL cholesterol and and total cholesterol and um cardiovascular disease and risk so what are we doing here like there's no association there's actually an inverse Association in in many trials including randomized control trials where they they give people saturated vegetable oils and replacing out the saturated fats to lower the LDL cholesterol and see what happens and yes indeed you know they lowered saturated fat and they lowered LDL cholesterol and what happened more people died of heart attacks and strokes so bad outcome you know so that's not what I want to do I don't want to lower my LDL I want to leave it just the hell alone and so it can do what it's supposed to do uh it's a molecule that's that's important for your body and it's there for a reason and so I'll just let it be as long as you're not damaging it and getting the consequence of that damage to other parts of your body you'll be fine",

    "body": "Member says uh carnivore is protective against many cancers is it protective against melanoma and other skin cancers potentially I mean there there are more well I mean the studies are in ketogenic diets you we haven't had studies in carnivore diets except for population statistics on carnivorous populations of humans such as the innu who had extraordinarily low cancer rates if any right so Professor V Homer stefanson of Harvard uh lived with the Inuit for over a decade about 12 years learn their language learn their culture and um and there in the early 1900s and and he wrote a book called St of the land saying hey we should all be eating like this we should all be eating meat this is the healthiest way to go this is what we're designed for and also looking at um other things we wrote other books and one of them um if I if I get the name slightly wrong I apologize but it was it was something to the effect of is cancer a disease of civilization or I think it's he was asking is disease a cancer civilization because you just don't see cancers in these populations oh well that's because they die when they're 30 no they don't that's stupid that's an average life expectancy from birth that does not tell you how long people live if they died of old age right so of course there were people that were older a lot older in fact in the in your a tradition if you got old to the point that you wore out your teeth first of all they didn't have dentists they didn't get cavities they just they actually they're chewing on on leather and skins and things like that to sort of you know get them usable as leathers and blankets and things and um we're not rodents so we don't regrow our teeth you're you're going to wear these down eventually so they get to the point they wear down their teeth they can't even chew their leather it's just like okay I'm not pulling my weight here I can't even eat and so I'm just gonna I'm just going to walk outside and let polar bears have mean that's that's that's a tradition in the in uh population when you're especially in the extremes of the north you know when you you just can't you cannot have dead weight hanging around and so what does that mean that means people are not dying in their 30s that means they're they're living extraordinarily long times and they're either being killed by something because INF mortality rates when you're deep in the tundra without a hospital or modern medicine it's High funny turns out that uh that mortality tends to be high in those conditions and uh but they aren't actually dying of old age they're they're killing themselves right so um you no so that's not the case so you know we just don't see this stuff and and as the 20th century progress and the in population became more involved in Western society and eating Western food their cancer rates just slowly but surely started increasing and increasing and increasing and so that's something that that you see and so from that that sort of information you know you can get you can get some decent information now um as far as you know melanoma and other skin cancers I don't know specifically I don't know any specific studies that go into that there are studies with certainly ketogenic diet ketogenic met therapy helping a lot of cancers and if you understand cancer biology and how they're fed with sugar that's you know something good to know about and also being in ketosis is going to help protect your mitochondria keep them healthy and safe and Hallmark of cancer is that they have damaged unhealthy mitochondria and so if you're keeping them healthy the whole time and they're turning over the old ones and replacing them out uh when they need to be replaced then you're probably not going to get into a situation and get cancer at all also remember that as sun exposure has gone down over the 20th century skin Cancers and melanomas have gone up so obviously it's not one toone sun exposure there's something else going on there and there are people there are traditional Muslims in in the Middle East they're where you know the traditional garb there they are not exposing themselves to the sun they're getting uh they're getting melanomas on their on their private areas that are likely never seeing the light of day let alone direct sunlight and so what's happening there we we people with melanomas metastases in their brain and we can't find a primary anywhere on their skin which well they have to have it obviously melanoma comes from melanin in the skin and then it goes somewhere else well maybe and maybe it's just so small that you can't find it but it is interesting that that um I've seen a number of people present their first sign of melanoma is a headful of tors and you know you can't find a primary so it's interesting but it's certainly not directly one to one with the sun it's actually inversely related to that and so there's probably a lot of other things going on we're EA a lot of things that are damaging to our mitochondria dam damaging to us cause cancer I mean that's why I stopped eating plants 23 years ago as my cancer biology professor at one of the top institutions in America certainly for uh biology and medical Sciences it's the number one rated medical school in the country University of Washington in Seattle and it's it's up there tied with John's Hopkins or or above John's Hopkins each and every year um for training for I think it's for training for primary carees how they they market and then um and then research har it's number one for research but university of Washington is like number six for research or at least it was when I was when I was um um back in the 2000s like 2010 or so that was last time I sort of checked top institution and my cancer biology Professor told me Point Blank that you know plants are toxic they have all these poisons in there they are not trying to be eaten they will kill you if they have to and and a lot of these toxins are carcinogenic and that's why I stopped I stopped eating them so you're gonna get rid of a lot of things that could be potentially harmful and you are going to just let your body work normally animals in the wild really don't get cancer animals in the zoo being fed their natural diet don't let  trick you and say oh look at this study it shows that you know these people or these animals get you know different illnesses and Cancers EXT extraordinarily low rates and also they don't control for the fact of what they're being fed are they being fed oh well presumably no F presumably that's that's and you and you know it you know and um you know so so you're just trying to people um if it doesn't say that then it's not controlled for that and you don't know what they're being fed and so obviously they're being fed something else right so you can't but otherwise animals just don't get it the rates of cancer dogs and cats going up and other sort of human diseases is going up well this is because we're aggressively breeding these things if you understand population genetics you Harvey wienberg equation you know that that can't happen um not like that not in that short amount of time but also why would just breeding pure breed like a golden retriever over and over and over again all of a sudden start getting non-communicable chronic diseases like diabetes heart disease cancer autoimmune disease the exact same things that we're that we're getting are we getting these because we're intensively in breeding no you get genetically recessive double recessive um genetic problems that's what you get so is diabetes a double recessive genetic issue is autoimmunity is heart disease is cancer no so they're getting exposed we're getting exposed to something in our environment that's precipitating these things and now they're getting exposed to these things and we're that's that's that's just from this intensive breeding program nonsense that would mean that it would be for us too it's the same diseases right so um yeah so that's sort of a lot more needed for that question but ca ncer is a big subject",

    "body": "Member says thoughts on fiber in our diet I've been full carnivore since December 26 but thought maybe I need to add some Fiber into my diet so added some blueberries today no I don't think you need fiber whatsoever in fact I don't think it's beneficial fiber can block out the absorption of up to 30% of the nutrients you eat according to various studies there's a book by called metabolical by Dr Robert Lusty from UCSF and he quotes that 30% number uh in that and elsewhere and so you know if you're eating a lot of garbage you know a lot of sugary carbs and crap and and much of plants with plant toxins in them sure reducing 30% absorption of that might might be a good thing right um but if you're only eating high quality nutrition like meat why would you want to do that you wouldn't want to actually block out um what you're eating and also You' been you've been on it um since oh December 26 yeah so not that long no you look I haven't eat fiber in six years it's fat that moves your digestion in fact in fact fiber has been showing clinical trials so experimental data randomized control trials in humans you can actually you know show causation with this that that people that had symptomatic constipation you pain bloating constipation blood in their stools all these sorts of things um they were eating whatever they were eating and they one group increase the amount of fiber one group uh stayed the same one decreased and one eliminated completely the amount of fiber that they were eating and wouldn't you know it boun it balanced out exactly the opposite of what they tell us the people that ate more fiber the constipation got worse I mean this is like this is like adding more logs to a log Jam like why why would you think that that would help move things through um that's just GNA make the blockage worse or you know you have an accident on the freeway and there's a big traffic jam okay get every every car available onto the onto the freeway like no you need to go go away you need to unblock that and then get things through the last thing you want to do is add to that it's going to make the problem worse and that's we found experimentally and people who reduced the amount of people who stayed the same stayed the same people who reduced the amount of fiber they ate reduce their symptoms people who uh eliminated out all fiber they actually eliminated all all symptoms of constipation it completely alleviated it and so um yeah that that's experimental data there's an excellent video by uh Dr Zoe harkam who uh does a whole thing it's called one about fiber and that's on YouTube I would highly suggest watching that I don't think you'll be interested in um in fiber after that it's not a nutrient it's so-call an essential nutrient how could it possibly be an essential nutrient if it doesn't even qualify as a nutrient it doesn't give us any nutrition right an essential means you die without it okay what is the nutritional deficiency associated with low fiber or no fiber there is so of course it's not an essential nutrient because it's not even a nutrient and so no you don't need it you definitely don't need it you know anytime you have these questions think of the Inuit living in the North Pole or ancestors living in the ice ages they weren't eating any of these things and if they weren't eating these things it wasn't necessary to them for thousands of generations and it clearly isn't necessary for us either um watch that I also did a a video called fiber constipation and diet where I go through that as well so you you can take a look at that and then watch Dr so Hames video what about fiber it's excellent It's a she gave that at a medical conference um in Australia called low carb down under it's a fantastic talk and and she even talks about there's a study in that with over 2,000 patients and people that had high fiber group actually died more had more cardiovascular death than than the lower fiber group so you know how you know that's not the same as an experimental trial long-term all these sorts of things but um but the associations are pretty negative in that in that study obviously so no I don't think you need fiber just like lions don't just like dolphins don't just like you know different you whales don't 70% of of uh animal species are carnivore and none of them eat fiber to any great extent and they they all do just fine they drive and so yeah don't worry about it",

starting keep so ketovore for four years mostly eating meat cholesterol 399 LDL 294 triglycerides 154 HDL 51 liver scan today show mild fatty liver 67 year old female healthy weight well you know if you if you keep going just carnivore and you eliminate out all these other sorts of things your fatty liver should should improve especially with you know get rid of carbs sugar alcohol these sorts of things seed oils potentially um Can can cause issue as well um some people there's you know recent sort of video talking about how um saturated fat and overfeeding test that saturated fat can be as bad as other things you know as far as causing um fatty liver disease and say with fruit and other things there's similar sort of effects of fatty liver disease and overfeeding okay well why are you overfeeding how about how about when you're not overfeeding how about you're just eating normal amounts and not stuffing your face you know what happens then you know probably a different story very helpful study um but you also need to realize that these These are snapshots in time you know and in order to get a vector and a graph of what's actually happening in your health and to your your markers you need need multiple data points so um I don't know what your Bloods were before they were probably were worse than that you probably would have had more fatty liver you probably would have had higher triglycerides lower HDL and so you know that's something that you you is worth knowing and so you know check these again a couple months see how they go try to clean up your tire really just go red meat and water fatty red meat and water eat until it stops tasting good start exercising try to do anerobic exercise try to do go on to a stationary bike and try to do pedal as hard as you can like a bike Sprint for 30 seconds rest get full rest catch your breath do it again do that 10 times three days a week press resistance exercises failure right push-ups on your knees or with light bands or or whatever is suitable for you body weight squats just standing up out of a chair sitting down standing up sitting down until you just really can't go anymore and then sit down breath catch your breath get on with your day do that three days a week whatever you can do whatever whatever um point that you are at just push yourself and don't hurt yourself you know within reason and um you'll see improvements you will absolutely see improvements of that and you'll see improvements regardless of what your blood say you you'll just feel thousand times better so that's what I would do I would just cut out everything just go red meat and water high fat eat as much as you as you feel comfortable eating as much as tastes good to you and uh start those exercises and I think you'll be I think you'll be fine um you know as The Zeta you know it's not something that I that I really um prescribe it's not really something that that I I would use I don't think you know this is something that's used for um you know cholesterol so it's I like it's um absorption but again I you know this is not this is not a drug that I ever use and and so I don't know all that much about it but I don't I don't think that cholesterol is the problem that we' we've been told that it was and I there's hard evidence for that we actually know that the people coming out with these studies originally were full of crap and they were being paid off and so I just I don't I don't see why we need to lower our cholesterol if cholesterol was never a problem so I I don't personally okay what is the best place to buy meat uh in or around person Western Australia um it depends you know if you want to just go grass-fed and finish or are different specialty butchers you can go to um and there's place called beef shed which is actually great they do bulk and they have a lot of grass-fed and finish as well they just have normal stuff too but it's actually cheap and so I like I like buying in bulk and then cutting up into steaks and things like that myself and they'll cut them for you there too uh they'll cut everything for free which is great and so um that's a good one Costco's great too I do a lot of my shopping at Costco even spudshed spudshed has a lot of good deals on meat and then sometimes you can get a whole like you know New York strip Mo or BH house in Australia um but it's and um you have that whole loin it's like $10 a kilo so it's like that's just dirt cheap and so um that that's a good place to do I think Costco is really good too but they they really like grass bed finish stuff as well but those are the places that that that I would go and those can be very good and and meets he's called like the secret butcher up in Mal something like that um he's a nice guy and he's very carnivore friendly and he's just very friendly he's a nice guy and so I I used to go to him for a while I used to get like specialy ground ground beef so I get like very fatty ground beef he put in sort of one kilo um vacuum steel things I get like five kilos at a time or something like that that's I think that was like the minimum and so those are all great great places to go",

    "body": "Member says uh hey Doc I know it's uh lose lose but what's more harmful out of loads of carbs and sugar for the artificial ingredients in keto type bars uh that are low car love your work do from New Zealand um that's I haven't been to New Zealand since I was 18 loved it absolutely loved it toured around both islands with the the US Junior National Rugby team and just absolutely loved it we were the first we played six game well yeah six games all over the island all over both islands and we ended up in Auckland played at Eden Park which is the all black Stadium there and uh in the Blues we saw Jonah Romo um and the All Blacks play against the Lions when they tour down there and uh we got to meet got to go like a blues practice and meet jono and some the other guys after for practice just the largest human being I've ever met in my life such a nice guy his Cates were like it was like this guy's CS were thicker than my waist you know it's just like she was like I'm I've never seen a larger human being than this and it's just a just a monster and I just couldn't be couldn't have been nicer just such a nice guy such a shame that that man passed away but fantastic fantastic experience love New Zealand um it's hard to say you know I mean one of the one of the good things at least with with the with getting rid of carbs and sugars at least you're in the molic state that you're supposed to be in right I think that I think that's very important this is how harmful carbohydrates are they they fundamentally disrupt and derange your metabolic system right so they put you into entire different entirely different biochemical State that's that's a that's a massive and so if you're EA some of these artificial sweeteners which are not good you know you might at least be in that metabolic state which I think is good so you know and as we know that high insulin levels and high blood sugar levels and being outside of this proper metabolic State causes all lot of metabolic problem I think it is very important to avoid carbon sugar so if you had to I would I would probably side on the artificial sweeteners ver instead of the carbs and sugar but I mean like said it's a lose lose I think they're both awful and you know I mean we don't have much information like oh there's this new one out a r oh that's great you have to keep putting new ones out because the old ones keep getting shown bloody toxic they are and um you I don't want something that's new I want something that's 50,000 years old and has never caused a problem I don't want something that's brand new because you don't have any data you don't have long-term information we don't know we don't know how awful these things are and so could be that they're way way more awful than cars and Sh we don't really know um don't have any data they're new there is a study that I became aware of with stevia equivalent of one diet soda can in mice so equivalent one dioda can for us down to very small can for mice um of stevia was had such a big impact on them that they actually decreased their fertility rate by 55% so we went from 100% the control group had 100% fertility rate and it dropped down to 45% fertility rate in the group it was given just one one equivalent uh portion of stevia a day so that's an animal model you don't know how that translates to humans but it's not good it seems to at least have the potential to disrupt our hormones as well and our fertility what else is it doing so I I don't think it's very good either way again we're not combustion engines and so it doesn't matter about how much heat energy is is produced when when you burn something which is what a calorie is it matter it's a chemical it has chemical reactions in our body Stevia rol you know xylol sorbitol these are all chemicals that are going to have a chemical reaction in our body that is likely going to be negative so I would I would avoid that but if I had to choose um I would still want to be in the biochemical state that we're designed to be in hope that helps and I hope you avoid both regardless",

    "body": "Member says um can you comment on optimizing sleep on a carnivore diet I struggle and no longer want to use Herbal tees like Camile no thanks or supplement s yeah what I think those it's good to avoid um optimizing your sleep optimizing your sleep um you know routine is very important so turning off the lights an hour before you want to be asleep um using blue blocking blue light blocking glasses can be very helpful get away from screens get away from phones get away from computers get away from televisions at least one hour before you want to be asleep that's very important make sure you Le this pitch black want to be a cave even just the light from your phone charging can be enough to disturb your sleep or make you not go to sleep in the first place put on a sleep mask that's just blackout is going to be um very very dark so you want to optimize your sleep routine and start going to sleep at the same time every night uh you can try things like melatonin which is you know a natural hormone that that we make and is actually very important um antioxidant in our brain and so it can help it can help you get to sleep stay asleep and get better rest sleep is not like a you know medication that's going to leave you all groggy and horrible the next day um but if you want to avoid that do all those other things melatonin only works if the lights are off e whether that's melatonin that you take or melatonin that you make it will only work if the lights are off and so even just turning on your lights uh when you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night if you have to wake up to go pee or something that's enough light exposure to drive out all the Melatonin from your brain so you really need to be careful about this it's it's very sensitive to that and yeah that's it and good luck with that hopefully hopefully that helps",

    "body": "member says 50-year-old male eight months carnivore started to see if I could help with acute arthritis helps a little for background normal level born with severe club feet there's no cartilage from the stars um anything you know other than fusion um well you know it can it can help obviously with the expression of the pain and inflammation but it's it's not going to undo the physical structural issues that you have but it can certainly help the pain experienced from them and so that can help a lot of people avoid surgeries you've been eight month carable which is fantastic and if you've been very strict just meat and water especially just fatty red meat and water I would expect that you would have gotten a lot of benefits um from that um but you know if you have you know a severe anatomical issue it's not going to fix the anatomical issue it's just going to reduce the inflammation which can reduce the pain that you experience and can make a tolerable and so some people avoid joint Replacements or other sorts of surgeries because of that but if you you have this this sort of issue you know it may be that you know it's a bit too far gone and it might need a bit of H hopefully that's not the case hopefully that you know you can you can mitigate this enough and not have to get surgery but unfortunately I don't I don't know what else can be done with diet apart from what you're doing you know if you're not doing a strict red meat and water High red meat and water try that and just cut out everything else coffee especially coffee coffee is very pro-inflammatory so you'll still get more pain with coffee even it's just one cup a day and it never caused a problem before well that's not true you don't necessarily know that because you haven't actually cut it out before so cut it out now cut out everything except bread meat and water you at least a month and see how you go and it may be that you still feel that you need surgery but maybe not and hopefully hopefully you do well in a lot of other ways as well even if you're doing surgery",

    "body": "Member says I have Gilbert Syndrome it's carnivore safe for me I have been on Carnivore for three weeks and feel great made this change in diet because I have all issues um yeah I think I think we sort of addressed that um before sometimes it just takes me a while to get to these so people redo the questions that's understandable but uh yeah Bruce I I I I don't think there's any problem with um Gilbert Syndrome and carnivore's plenty of people that I know that have Gilbert Syndrome and do carnivore just fine and um so that's not an issue and the main issue is that you feel great which is good so keep going with that and a strict red meat and water is possible for autoimmunity and uh you'll do you'll do as well as you can and hopefully you've already started seeing a lot of benefits and continue to see more and more okay um I'm going to do two more guys and then and then I've got to run vso thank you very much for the chat hi doc I think I'm having gallbladder issues B sludge Etc any advised carnivore for a week now thank you for all you do um well if you have bile Sledge I mean that would that would have been built up over a very long time and you can certainly get problems from that I would imagine that a corn diet will continue to help that if you have pre if you have sort of stones or sludge in there now you're eating more fat you're going to start squeezing your gallbladder to start pushing out bile which is the entire purpose of the gallbladder that what it's there for and so if you're having all this junk in there and squeezing that can cause discomfort so as long as that's just that and you know discomfort and not anything more you're not g jaundice you're not getting you know extraordinary you know Exquisite pain or fevers or anything else like that they would be quite concerning it can just be that this is just a bit uncomfortable hopefully that passes hopefully if it's just sludge it'll just s work that junk out of there dissolve it a bit work it out just smush it out if it if it can and so they just clears it up and so that that would be my guess is what's happening is it just sort of smooshes this out actually gets that bile sludge out of there if there are stones in there and those stones are big enough to get stuck there could be a problem that you would need a surgical intervention for least a procedure you know down the throat up the tubes snake that stone out of there um so be mindful of that you know if you have these pre-existing issues you know you need to be um you need to be you know careful about that you need to sort of you start having like a lot of pain and you start getting like yellowing to the the whites of your eyes that could be that you have a blockage and violence is backing up and you're getting um jaist Andy skin yellow sare up that might be a problem you get checked out especially a lot of pain and so hopefully this just clears and passes but if there's a stone that's big enough and gets caught then you you be in a in a situation that you need to get help with if you don't do it and you don't eat fat then it's just going to get worse it's just going to build up more sludge and more B more cholesterol stones or whatever it's not all cholesterol it's just bit Bales made with cholesterol that's why they say oh you have too much cholesterol it's just all getting stuffed in there like bile is made with cholesterol right so of course there's going to be cholesterol in there it's not because you're eating too much cholesterol it's because vile is made out with cholesterol and so you're going to get these stones in there and you don't eat fat you're just going to build up more and more of that stuff because it's just going to concentrate and and crystallize right like any hyperconcentrated solution to rest it forms stones and precipitate so that's what F sludge is that's all stones are in my opinion and so if you're if you are not clearing that out it's just going to get worse and so hopefully you're not past the point of return where you can just clear this stuff out and then smooth sailing from there but if you're not and be aware of what the warning signs are in case you need to go get help any you know and when when in doubt you know seek help just get it checked out if you sit there for four hours and it turns out to be nothing great it's better than surgery anyway so but at least you didn't uh leave a problem that should have been addressed okay this is going to be be the last one guys thank you so much um for coming on so last question is from Casey aote or aote carnivore for one year plus only beef and some raw milk or kefir still have greasy stools or diarrhea Dairy seems to help but also cause some inflammation allergic ritis thoughts thanks uh well yeah for some for some reason um milk and cause or just dairy in general can can sort of exacerbate constipation which is interesting you know people that that sort of drink more milk or have a lot of cheese and things like that even when they're eating you know meat uh they can get quite constipated I think it's probably because they're not getting enough of fat ratio and there's something else that's that's slowing things down as well there's there's a mild opiate in milk as well it probably gets the cow baby calf you wanting more and more and more and or the baby enamel wanting more and more and more and so you this can slow blow down the peristalsis of your gut as well and if you're not getting enough fat you know if you have enough fat then it's it's fine it's not going to be an issue however slow it goes but it um it can be a problem if you're not getting enough fat and so if you're eating sort of drinking some milk or some cheese which has fat in it but it's not necessarily as fatty as as like steak or or meat U then it can be a problem so after a year on Carnivore if if you are not drinking coffee not drinking tea not taking any artificial sweeteners or non- sugar sweeteners not taking any supplement such as magnesium not taking any medication such as metformin and you're only eating meat and water then it could be that you're just not absorbing all the fat that you're eating just just pull it back if you're getting intermixed if you're intermixing that with hard dry Rocky stools and that can be that you're so you're so so um constipated that you actually get what's called overflow diarrhea and the treatment for that is a lot fat and then things start start moving uh much much better um so if you're if it's just loose stools though greasy loose stools just just you know pull back on on the on meat that you're eating you know maybe you know drop the raw milk in the keeper for a while and and just see how it goes and just just pull back a bit on the on the on the meat you know I talked to some people and they sort are in this sort of situation and and I'm trying to figure this out by a you know from a carnivore solution and then I find out months later that they're taking you know a bunch of energy drinks with artificial sweeteners this just like why didn't you tell me you were thinking that it's oh no I'm only me I'm only me and they just are not thinking that you know anything they put into their body counts and including these you know diet energy drinks with a bunch of artificial sweeteners which are laxative and then all of a sudden they're oh yeah I think that might have might have been it it's like yeah I think I think that might have been it and then they stop it and it goes away so if you're doing anything else putting anything in your body besides meat and water stop it and uh then see how you go and then adjust the fat from there and then you know how much your body wants and then you you add back in things and they start giving you diarrhea or whatever you at least know it's not the fat you just know that it's that other thing and so that's what I would try okay",
