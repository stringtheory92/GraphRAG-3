    "transcript": "[Music] Dr marola says a carnivore diet is calcium deficit Dr lustig's Facebook post yesterday said that meat drives Coline drives tmao drives heart disease high protein drives mtor uh that's cute I haven't seen Dr lustig's um Facebook post so I don't know uh sort of what he's talking about there but um you know does is you know I first of all who why are we saying that Coline is a Bad Thing Coline is required for your brain now we're saying that's bad apparently you know tmao and and all all these sorts of things these are these are all and mtor and all these sorts of things these are these are one part in a very complex multibillion piece puzzle and uh and machine and so and we're talking about just like one thing clicking off here it's it's really myopic and missing the force for the trees when you just look at this one little thing and this is everything there's nothing else that matters it's just this one little molecule and it's just like so even if it does drive up tmao is that necessarily going to always cause heart disease in all contexts forever probably not same with mtor you know and uh and also that's just it's assuming a fact it's not in evidence there's absolutely no hard evidence that any of that stuff is true um so it's um and and flat Flatout answer is no of course it doesn't because like you know the heart disease rates in Inuit when they when they're just eating meat basically non-existant same with the Messi when they're just eating you know high fat you know uh meat and in their traditional diet now that they' moved to more grains and more sugar and like that yeah that's going up yeah absolutely but when they were only eating meat non-existent you know there's that study um uh I might be able to find it and put it in the chat but um if as a study back in the late 2000s um oh no sorry not the late 2000s the late 1920s that um that uh I actually have it here I'll put it up in the chat in the late 1920s that um put in the chat now for people who want to check it out late 1920s that that found um uh they looked at the Messiah looked at the akiyu and akuu were largely plant-based Whole Food plant-based growing it themselves no pesticides no no pollution anything like that just this perfect idyllic situation they were very sick they got much more sick than the Messiah um and the Messiah didn't barely got sick at all they never really got sick the males certainly were less were the most healthy out of all of them um both males and females from the M Messiah and akuu the male Messiah were the healthiest the female Messiah were the second healthiest and and a way down distant third were the akuu women who had a more diverse plant-based diet and the dead last were The aukuu Men Who at mostly grains I've seen um you know Liars on the internet pushing a vegan diet that that completely lied about that um uh study and said that the the akuu women were the most healthy out of all four complete and utter they were better than the men the akiyu men uh but they were worse than both both the males and females of the Messiah what about the Messiah mtor what about the Messiah tmao um what about the Messiah um you know calcium they drink a lot of milk but where do they get that milk from they get that from an animal well how much calcium is in Grass how much calcium is in meat I mean I get is that enough for bones well I don't know why don't you ask a lion they have bones you know and um you know they drink their mother's milk and so they get a lot of calcium there okay yeah I guess they're drinking milk where did the mom get the calcium to make the milk she's just eating meat she's not drinking someone else's milk she's not drinking her mom's milk it just like this you know wormar robus where they just like you're just just drinking milk milk milk milk milk milk milk milk milk we just drink each other's milk and pass along the calcium to make each other's milk that's not happening right so they're getting the calcium from the meat that they're eating so you're dumb you know so obviously there's enough calcium in the meat right or else they wouldn't have any milk or they wouldn't have any milk they wouldn't have any calcium in their milk and they wouldn't have any calcium for their bones either because um you know baby cats are all mammals they drink their mother's milk and then they get weaned onto their mother's diet when they're very small when they're very young and then they eat that di for the rest of their life when lions are weaned onto and humans are weaned onto meat that they're still very small and so the majority of their bone growth and Bone mineralization happens after weaning happens after they they get off their mother's milk so it's not the milk that's doing it and again the calcium from the milk has to come from somewhere right um so you know the thing is is that you know you can you can say all this stuff and you can say oh well there's not enough calcium in there well okay where the hell does it come from the thing is is that when you're not eating it with plants you're not getting these antinutrients that are blocking out the absorption of calcium you're not getting with oxalates that goes into your bloodstream and strips out the calcium you need way more calcium uh you know in those circumstances just to get anything then you would than you would otherwise also what about bone mineralization you have um PT your cats they fed raw meat and cooked meat the cooked meat ones got sickly got small the Next Generation were smaller more sickly and had less bone mineral dens density and Bone mineralization and uh it was like from 14% to 7% and then the third generation was down to 3% right there's the exact same amount of calcium in cooked meat as raw meat right so it's not about the amount of calcium there's enough calcium there obviously because the raw meat cats had bones and made bones in their kittens and those kittens grew up to be adults with bones um the calcium was fine it was something else that was lacking in the cooked meat that made it impossible for them to function normally in a physiological manner so they weren't able to to mineralize their bones properly to make proper collagen um because you know they have torine and other sorts of amino acids that were getting cooked out that they require so that's that's what's going on so you know you're looking at these things you're looking at at a mixed diet and we're looking at these uh rdas that were made up by some named anel Keys who I I don't trust a damn thing that guy's ever done because he's just a paid shill a sellout and probably a spawn from Satan sent to this earth to destroy humanity and he um he came up with these damn things but he came up with them at a time when everyone was eating a mixed diet and so maybe that's correct for people on a mixed diet but that's not necessarily correct for anybody else because you don't need 10 milligrams of Vitamin C A Day To Save off scurvy on a carnivore diet you just don't you know because you you don't need Vitamin C in the first place to make collagen otherwise I'd be dead right now my vitamin C when I checked it was was Trace right so look at that you don't need that for scurvy right um so it's uh it's nonsense and so these rdas they only matter in the context of a mixed diet so they're saying well there's not enough calcium here because we know well no we don't because you haven't checked the rdas and the requirements for people that don't eat and don't eat plants that have anti-nutrients and block out the absorption of of calcium and strip out the calcium from your body they gave people spinach back in the 1950s spinach has a lot of calcium it's not bioavailable and they come with oxalate so in fact they gave them spinach because of all the calcium and people's calciums went down as a result of that right because none of the calcium was available to them it's not bioavailable it's all locked up in in bonds that we couldn't access right and couldn't break down and then the oxalates would get in the blood strip out the calcium so if you're eating this crap you know uh then you're they going to damage your body's your body in general but you're also going to damage your body's ability to maximize its nutrient profile in in the food that is bioavailable so um and again you know it doesn't matter what any any study says it doesn't matter what any you know really smart guy I have a lot of respect for Dr letic he's a very smart man but it doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is doesn't matter how smart you are if it doesn't agree with experiment it's wrong and The observed phenomena is that when people exclusively eat meat they don't get heart disease there was no heart disease to speak of certainly not rampant deaths from heart attacks before the 20th century in America or Europe just didn't exist in any real numbers there's a couple in Europe in in uh in America the first diagnosed um death from heart attack uh on autopsy was in 1912 it didn't exist before then right they just they didn't see any of these things maybe they happen but they they were doing thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of autopsies um like each doctor would be doing hundreds of these things and uh they just never saw these things and they was like hold on a second that's  you'd see that you it's not a subtle thing someone Di from a heart attack means they have a blockage that kills an area of the heart and that muscle ruptures and has a massive blowout bleed and that stops the heart funny enough or they survive that it doesn't rupture and it scars down you have this whole side of the heart wall just scarred out and thinned out and then it might rupture or it might form an aneurysm out here are very not subtle signs right so you would notice that and yet they you we weren't seeing any of that stuff on autopsy not C certainly not to any great degree and uh and then all of a sudden 10 years later 20 years later it's a number one killer in America that's funny that's odd we don't see any of these things and now they're the only things we're seeing you know it's complete so we were eating plenty of meat before that the Native Americans the Plains Indians these guys were to be 110 120 sometimes 130 plus years where were their heart attacks when they're just eating bison what about the Inuit when they're just eating um you know uh uh seals and everything like that you don't get these things anthropologists calls this the diseases of civilization um you know you get these um populations you know they have like you know uh they get injuries accidents infectious diseases it's only when they they sort of go into society and C cities they start getting the diseases of civilization um and the disease that you see in developed in developed countries and why is that these people are living plenty old but they're they're just not developing these diseases and people I saw this one idiot on um he's a doctor and he's an idiot doctors are people and some people are idiots that's all there is to it U this guy was on Tik Tok can't remember his name maybe someone remembers his name in the chats or something like that maybe they saw it but this guy he looks up something that Paul saladino said about you know there weren't really heart attacks in the 1800s and we were eating far more meat and uh he just goes like a well that's ridiculous people just weren't living long enough in the 1800s to to develop these sorts of diseases that guy's a he's um he's just pushing a really shitty ideology and trying to profit off of it um and he's he's a bariatric surgeon by the way so he's a he's a weight loss surgeon so um it's in his best interest to have really bad advice on weight loss right because um you know if his advice was so damn good he wouldn't need to operate on anybody uh but he does because he's a he's a hack um and he's and he's just too stupid to even just look up the numbers I mean it's really easy I mean it's just like just just Google as your friend you you just look this up I've got the statistics on my phone they've got statistics going back to 1850 through you know the the 19 or the 2010s showing average life expectancy from birth and so it's just like yeah sure you know um life average life expectancy from birth uh in 1850 was only 38 does that mean that people were dying in their 30s that they were just dying of old age in their 30s well that'd be funny because the minimum required age to run for president of the United States was 35 and that rule was come up with they came up with that rule in the 1700s right so that's pretty odd people are just dropping dead of old age um you know or just getting killed by things everyone was just dying in their 30s they just weren't living long enough to develop heart disease and people do die of heart attacks in their 30s right but if the minimum age was 35 obviously that wasn't the geriatric population was it right that was a minimum age hey everyone really happy to announce a new sponsor for the show and for everybody down in Australia Stockman Stakes who are delivering highquality grass-fed and finished pasture raised beef and other meats flash frozen and vacuum sealed tood door something I've been enjoying a lot of myself recently as well they also have a great range of specialty items such as high fat keto mints and carnivore beef and organs mints with liver kidneys and beef heartart as well so use code chaffy today for free order of beef mints or another specialty gift along with your order at Stockman stakes. comom and I'll see you over there thanks guys Ben Franklin was like 64 at the beginning of the Revolutionary War right I mean do I don't I don't I don't know if people actually think anymore you know they certainly don't look up it's really easy they just check while people were dying there but but wait were they do I know that so people speak so authoritatively and and some of these things they have no business doing it some things they they that's the thing people you know um Thomas Soul writes a lot about this about intellectuals you know because they they're really good at their area and they get so used to being an authority figure and just know like well I think this and I I spent 20 years 30 years in my field I know what I'm talking about and they just know what they're talking about so much that other things that they haven't spent 20 30 years looking into they just be like they just they just have this preconceived notion they're like oh yeah people died in their 30s back then yeah authoritatively well did you look it up is that from your years of research and and clinical experience that you're you're coming at this no you just pull it out of your ass and it fits your narrative and so but now you're speaking authoritatively because you've been you so used to speaking in that manner for so long so it's complet completely under garbage uh so no people were not dying in their 30s they were certainly living long enough look up every Founding Father you know um you know John Adams was 91 when he died and he he was born in the mid 1700s right Jefferson was like 82 you know all these other guys were in their 80s and 90s unless they were killed by something you know like George Washington died but in his his what 60s or 70s but you know he he got sick he got pneumonia and they just kept like doing blood letting and cupping and all these sort of horrible things they basically killed him you know they just sort of just ex sanguinated him the poor bastard um he probably would have just been fine just let let the let the poor man rest but um uh he ended up he ended up passing away as a result of these very well-meaning people most likely who knows but um but either way you know he he was he wasn't he didn't die of old age and he was plenty old enough to get heart disease and yet didn't get heart disease and he smoked and he drank four out of five men smoked in the 1800s where was that where where was that with heart disease why is why is why I mean that that should be a high risk and yet people weren't dying from this stuff you see it on on the autopsy you can see some plaques they saw some plaques going back hundreds of years yeah but no heart heart attacks they're just like what's that and they recognize it as pathological they're like that's not supposed to be there that's normally not there that's wrong that's different H I wonder why that is so we documented that we did see this stuff but it never hit the prevalence that it did or or got bad enough to like actually stop people's um you know stop people's circulation and cause heart attacks or Strokes uh until until the 20th century and it's not because we were living longer so if you look at those statistics 38 from birth but infant mortality rate was very high and so that's an average because a lot of kids are dying in infancy the adults have to live a lot longer than that to pull that average up from zero right so you know that's a big difference and so the the PE people taking those statistics were a lot more intelligent than that that idiot Tik Tock doctor um who's like this white-haired guy I mean he's he's a grown ass man he should some grandfather presumably he should know better than to just talk out of his ass and just make up that he hasn't looked up um so the people making the statistics much smarter than that guy who doesn't know how to think um probably wasn't taught how to think um in life expectancy from birth was 38 but if you live to be 10 years old it was 56 big difference right so you made it to 10 years old you make it to 56 you made it to 20 you'd live longer and so if you made it to adulthood you made it out of those early years where you can get killed by something or die in a war a famine or something like that the majority of people were actually living similar ages to to what they are now and that's what this that's what the the statistic showed and that's the official statistics so they went decade by decade of year and decade by decade of life it's a whole big chart and so in 1870 if you live to be 50 you were going to live this long on average again these are averages and they had that go up all the way to the 80s so in 1850 they tracked this out if made it to 80 on average you make it to 86 now it's 88 right not much difference but the simple fact that they kept records and statistics on people getting to their eighth decade means that there were enough people getting their eighth decade that it was worth taking statistics on right so I mean use your head I mean you just look up famous people from that era and how long they lived how long how old was was Mark Twain when he died you know my great-grandfather was was born in 1875 he died in 1975 at home fully complish MST he was 100 years old born in 1875 right and um where where was his where was his uh um you know death at 30 I mean like he should have been I guess dead at the at the you know the turn of the century you know according to this guy this genius I mean how many people you see in these pictures they're just they're old men in the 1800s in the 1700s I mean Socrates was in his 70s and they had to kill him right and he there's no accounts in PL oh my he's just the oldest man on earth I was like no one just could could imagine that anyone would live that long so you know this is just these are these are very very very shortsighted views and I would I would I would say that the marola saying that calcium def deficient is a short-sided view as well because it's not clearly your the observe fact is no it is not you see carnivores eating meat not chewing Up Bones getting calcium where did the calcium from the bones come from you know and of the animals that they're eating and then you know making you know calcium in milk and all these sorts of things and just and just being so reductionist that you say well meat has choline choline will drive tmao TMO will drive heart disease and high protein will drive mtor will it though and will it do all of those things the evidence is strongly in the negative it does not do any of that crap and um I yes I would bet my life on it and I am so thank you very much oh an drives cancer what are they on about yeah they're smoking crack that's all there is to it yeah I actually really like Dr lustic I don't know why why he he's arguing that but you know the whole mtor thing I went into this with with um uh uh Professor bar k um who uh you we sort of went into that the whole idea with mtor is that you eat protein it gets into your large intestine and there's certain bacteria there that could work on that protein that may secrete mtor and that could be absorbed and that may cause a problem a lot of ifs ANS coulds mayz or butts and uh because the butt there is if you don't eat meat with plants and fiber and antinutrients and proteas Inhibitors protein is not getting your colon in the first place you're absorbing it right and so you know you're not it's not going to get down there so even if you had those bacteria which you may or may not because you're eating something different so you may not actually cultivate that bacteria right so even if you had that bacteria there wouldn't matter because the protein's not getting there anyway so it's a moot point and and I think people just really don't understand that um and if you're eating meat in a mixed diet and you have all this other crap in it that's delaying the absorption it's going to get there yeah maybe maybe and does that do something in your body that's negative maybe but maybe not there's literally zero hard evidence of that it's all conjecture and supposition and again it's a moot point because bry's not going to get there in the first place because you're not eating it with a whole bunch of other stuff that's going to delay the absorption marola never really a fan of marola I I sort of half watched some of it things early on really wasn't impressed and just sort of got bored with him pretty quickly um he's he's pretty flighty pretty just goes where the wind blows him so he's all pushing oh keto keto keto and then one guy says one thing about Ray Pete and he's just like oh my God youo so bad you're all gonna die like okay okay you know but um you know I I and then just saying things oh it's it's deficient in calcium and yet it isn't so you know in real practical terms it isn't so there are people doing carnivore right now that have carnivore babies there's the Inuit who exist as a species generationally and their kids eat a bunch of meat they make milk from the calcium they get in meat and the kids eat meat and they build more bones and so it is it just does not fit The observed facts and if things it doesn't matter what your theory is it doesn't matter who you are if it doesn't affit the obs OB erve facts it's a dumb Theory I mean it's just it it's not even like the you know if if it doesn't meet with experiment it's wrong if you if you have a theory and you look out in the world and you see it goes completely counter to that theory it's a dumb Theory you need to throw it away or you need to think about it and go like oh okay I didn't I didn't realize that I didn't think about that um but if it's in your face going like well then how do lions make milk and you trying to make excuses for this or whatever you know it's just like okay well how the Inuit make milk you know if you don't say like okay yeah good point I guess I guess it's not what we thought it is I guess the rdas aren't really what we should judge this by if you can't do that you know it's it's a dumb Theory and if you've looked at all that but no but the RDA the RDA said it you know you're being you're being kind of stupid at that point and it helped but it wasn't until she just went fullon strict that's when all these things went away and um her restless leg syndrome went away her psoriasis went away just sis in sort of the back of her head in her hair and um and her her period pain went away so she"
