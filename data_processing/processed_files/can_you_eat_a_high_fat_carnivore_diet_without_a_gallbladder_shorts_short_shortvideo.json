        "body": "so your gallbladder is what stores bile and concentrates it so if you don't eat fat for a number of days or weeks you'll have more concentrated bile and that will go out and then emulsify fat and bring that in because that's very very important it's an extremely important nutrient and we need it so we can still eat a carnivore diet we can still eat a high fat carnivore diet without a gallbladder but we do need to be mindful of the fact that you're not going to have a concentrated bolus of bile at one time and so you might have to just split up your meals throughout the day and just just space out your fatty meals throughout the day now some people don't need to do that some people form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is just an out pouching and a common bile duct that acts pretty much the same as as a gallbladder it stores bile concentrates it up and then squishes it out so there are actually quite a number of people that do a carnivore diet with no gallbladder and they just eat you know one meal a day so the omad style of doing things and they're able to absorb all that fat"
