    "transcript": "bile will emulsify the broken down fat and it will absorb that when you run out of bile you just have free floating fat that isn't going to be able to be absorbed but it's not it's not going to draw out and pull out other things that stop you from absorbing them like fiber does fiber does that so fiber can prevent the absorption of up to 30% of the food that you eat right so you know that's obviously another another strike against fiber your body's only going to absorb a certain amount of fat so if you eat an excess amount of fat your body's just not going to absorb it but the fat that's in your body in your system is going to get utilized of course it is uh and if you're eating that with carbohydrates yes you're still going to absorb the same amount of fat now you're bringing in carbohydrates which will trigger the Randall cycle which will shut off your cells to more energy and that's going to get stored into thatat absolutely but that's not the Fat's fault that's the carbohydrates fault that's the insulin's fault that's the deranging your metabolism and your physiology's fault so it's not the fat so the fat isn't the problem it's the carbs that are the problem as usual [Music] all right hello everyone and good morning welcome to my YouTube live for April 4th and 2024 and April 5th here in Australia thanks everyone for joining and um yeah let me see how many people do we have here now sorry I'm just going to check this out so we've got a couple questions that have already come in that I'll be answering and then if people have more questions as they come in you can just put them in the chat put Q's next to it so that um you know I can see it and then um I will try to answer all the questions that I can obviously I can't always get to everybody but I do the best I can and always try to at least get all the super chats anyway and um so we'll be able to go until probably about noon today so we got good two and a half hours maybe is a bit more and so uh yeah see how we go anyway so there's a question from Brad um do coffee and alcohol affect triglycerides uh alcohol definitely yes coffee potentially it can screw around your blood sugar and give you uh bit of a screwy time with that but um I don't I don't know that c itself affects triglyceride not I know of anyway uh but alcohol will uh raise those yeah they they generally do and then looks like it's anniversary for PJ equin lady so happy anniversary to you thank you very much for joining on the call and um thank for thank for your support hopefully it's helpful hope you have a really nice anniversary and like a really nice stake between the two of you Sabine youu thank you for the Super Chat need external carbs on ADHD medications doctor says yes no absolutely not uh in fact if you don't if you don't take in carbs generally you don't need ADHD meds um so maybe in that sense they're correct that yes you know you you need to eat carbs so that your brain doesn't work properly so that you have ADHD and then you need meds so for uh you to need the meds in the first place yes uh eat carbs but if you don't want the meds at all in the first place or much less of them potentially then uh no you don't need to eat carbs um I don't and that's the thing it's um it's funny it's funny that that doctors will say that because you know there's like there's no there's I mean where where where are they getting that from you know like is there some sort of study or exper experiment that's shown that uh you do better if you eat carbohydrates when you take these medications no nothing I've ever heard of anyway but there are studies and experiments intervening with people with ADHD and taking them off carbohydrates putting them on an animal-based diet with no carbs and and having that help their ADHD and get them off medication so it's very it's very strange where people get these Notions but it's it's it's something that I've seen a lot with do doors and other experts uh in any any field you know Thomas Soul writes a lot about this about the intellectuals and how you know they're very Adept and and expert in a particular field and then they think that this applies to every other field on Earth and that they're just you know God's gift and they're just expert in anything and everything that they they choose to talk about and so their opinions then become facts you know there's things that they know very well and they are you know ex very very much experts in that field and then there's something else that they aren't an expert in but they believe it to be so because they're so used to being an expert it's just like yep that's what it is and they and they can speak so confidently because they are used to speaking confidently about things I see it I see it all the time and uh and they fall into this trap where they just assume that they know things that are just their own opinion and they forget that it's opinion it's not actually something that they've learned um so that's that's dangerous obviously um so no you don't need carbs for ADHD medications um and um and but you do need carbs to have ADHD um not always but there are there are um a lot of people that are coming off their meds for ADHD and other psychiatric issues um by going zero carb and um animal-based meat-based keto carnivore sort of thing and that's actually been you know this has been done in experimental Interventional trials and there larger rcts being done at the moment over at Harvard and elsewhere so no you don't need carbs no there's no such thing as an essential carbohydrate for anybody at any time anywhere except if someone accidentally overdoses on uh insulin and they're going to die without it right that's the only case but no physiological function requires exogenous ketones or exogenous uh carbohydrates or ketones you just need to eat real food your body will make carbohydrates you don't you don't you absolutely don't need to eat carbohydrates um unless you've done something to yourself harmful such as taking way too much insulin on accident another question from Sabine hey Dr chaffy uh my psychiatrist said that I need extra car so this is part of that extra carbs when I use stimulants for my ADHD won't my liver just take care of it uh and glucan genus gluc neogenesis eyes more glucose P them exactly yeah you'll have plenty of carbs Beth uh ratam mocker thank you for the Super Chat is lamb just as good as beef for strict carnivore or is beef a little better is grass-fed meat critical I have a hard time finding it thank you it's not critical it's object objectively has more micronutrients and has a better omega-3 to Omega 6 profile but it's not critical I mean a lot of people are doing extremely well on on grain finished beef grain finished beef or lamb and so I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about that if it's not accessible to you it is you know really really like that's the best is grass-fed and finish regeneratively raised beef right or Wild mastedon would really be the the top notch but it's um it's not it's not critical it's not like no you have to do this you can't do it any other way no just eat the meat that you enjoy that makes you feel good that you have access to and that you can afford and so if that's grass-fed beef for some people that's great and if it's grain fed beef then fine and if that's pork chicken fish and eggs for other people that's fine too so just it but any meat is going to be better than every plant because all meat is good for you while every plant causes harm so but yes there are there are better or less good uh types of meat so lamb is is pretty much just as good um Salsbury back in the 1800s when he was telling people to go on a just a red meat and water diet he thought that beef was definitely the best and lamb was a distant second and I think that's probably due to age of the meat back then back then they weren't they weren't um you know H I don't I don't think they they ate the steers um when they were you know like yearlings like they do now and so they maybe didn't have enough time to to build up as much nutrients and um so that might be part of it but he thought that beef was definitely better um you know the younger the younger the animal the less time in has to sort of build up nutrients in the body so that could be that could be part of it so um having having um younger animals may not be as nutrient intense I certainly found that the 10-year-old cow that I got was just delicious it was had really very rich beefy flavor it wasn't gy or anything like that it just had more beef flavor there was like overpowered other steaks that I had I I couldn't even taste the beef flavor in those other steaks I think what that what you're tasting there are the all the nutrients that you get out of the meat that's that's what the taste is you're saying you know that's good those are good nutrients and that's what that strong flavor was so in that sense you know an older Animal I think would be better and um you know but that was you know grass-fed and finished for 10 years and had only eaten grass its whole life so you know that's probably why that was that was as good as it was but you know if you if you like lamb you enjoy lamb and you feel good on lamb eat lamb it's great uh Primal Mike uh says how exactly does dietary fat absorption work if the digestion is not disturbed by artificial sweeteners or other factors is all that fat either converted um to BHB or excreted or maybe stored well your your body's really only going to be able to absorb fat uh from your diet with if you have enough bile and if everything is digested properly and then bile emulsifies it then it's absorbed into your lymphatic system as kyom microns it actually bypasses your liver because things go to your liver I either either to get detoxified before it hits the rest of your body uh and or convert it into fat and U for for storage and utilization but if it's already fat your body's like yep get it in that's what we want um that's the important stuff and when you run out of bile then you really can't do that it's very difficult for your body to absorb fat um after that you can absorb a small amount but it's very small amount it's mostly medium chain triglycerides MCTS so when they get into your body your body utilizes them you I I just don't think for a second that your body makes a random amount of B so you get a random amount of fat and then oh my God you've eaten too much and then your body just stores that as fat because you've eaten too much well wouldn't absorb it if it was too much and your body didn't want it so if if your metabolism is low and your body's uh you know thinking that you've been in a famine you need to rebuild up your stores yeah it might store a bit you know a bit of fat this is what those yo-yo diets do people are just chronically starving themselves and burning themselves out their metabolism just bottoms out and then they start eating normally again and their bodies you know so the body thinks that they're in a famine and the metabolism goes down to survive through a famine that's what all animal too um plants do this when they're in a drought they they they slow down the different metabolic processes that require water uh in order to survive we do that all animals do that as well metabolism slows down and we store our fat and and hang on to our fat stores very jealously and then when we start eating food again our body say okay that needs to go into fat we need to you know might be the next famine is right around the corner maybe we're still in a famine you just got a chance to eat so we need toore just hang on to this we're going to keep that metabolism low um and so you might put on fat so you know your body's going to decide you know what it uses for energy what it uses for fat what it uses for you know building blocks of material and um so just I just let it you know our bodies know a hell of a lot more about you know what it's doing than than we do like we're never going to understand things to the extent that our body can you know we're making billions trillions of calculations every second um on exactly how to keep everything in Balance like you think you're going to figure that out I don't think so it's never going to happen and trying to figure well just this this very simple equation one gram of this to one gr it's never going to be that easy your body knows um your body knows what it's doing though so you don't you don't need to figure it out what you need to figure out is that our bodies know what the hell is going on and so if you're eating what you're supposed to eat your body's going to do what it's supposed to do it's going to absorb the amount of fat that it wants to absorb almost all of the rest of it's going to go out and then your body's going to use that maybe store some of it for later use because that's what it does you put gas in the gas tank and then you run on that throughout the day and the week and the month and so um that's supposed to happen that's normal the only time you're going to absorb more fat than your body wants and store excess fat on top of what your body thinks it should is if you do something silly like take Ox bile and then you're forcing your body to absorb more fat than than actually is designed to and then you can then you'll yeah you'll store fat and that will um that will not be what you want necessarily Kim Walters Dr chaffy are you aware that synthetic vitamin B12 contains cyanide hydrochloride which is toxic to humans and used in chemical warfare I am led to believe that the FDA has it listed on the website um so yeah there's different kinds of B12 so um there's like cyano cobalamin that has um some cyanide in it and then there's um was it hydroxy or hydr cobalamin hydroxy cobalamin and methyl cobalamin so um I would only use the methylated forms the methyl cabalin that's the one that's the one that works best in your body anyway uh so yeah just don't don't take cyal cabalin you know if you if you're worried about that um you know some of these things they have like a cide you know molecule in there but they're bound up in such a way that it doesn't get like released as cyanide or or or um act in that way but uh yeah you know it's um and you know if you're getting a bit of this stuff you know how much is it going to harm you can your body handle it probably but on that same principle of why I don't eat lettuce I don't want any toxins in my body so yeah absolutely I wouldn't I wouldn't um uh give somebody cyano cabalin I certainly wouldn't take cyano cabalin and um not that you need to really you know some people don't don't methylate um you know have like MTHFR and they need a bit more fol or and or B12 and so those people just need to to add in a bit of liver every now and then and then your B12 will be fine and so I've never seen anybody not be able to maintain optimal B12 levels even if they have MTHFR as long as they're adding in a bit of liver every now and then and most people don't even need that most people do just fine just eating muscle meat and um um so but if you're in that category where you're not you're not quite there you know adding in a bit of liver and and especially people early on everyone's deficient in B12 because everyone's deficient in almost everything and then you go to your doctor and you say yeah can I get a B12 and they're like yeah it's it's right in the middle of the range you're perfectly fine well the entire range uh I've never seen a range anywhere in any country that wasn't out of range right so their range of this is normal the entire thing was way too low in my opinion and and most of that range was was critically low So Below 400 in Australia um and the UK is a basically you can get demalation of your axons you get nerve damage right and most people are under that so the range here in Australia you know is different for every lab and that's the problem it's just an average for the community it's not an actual range of good health is um you know 130 to 650 sometimes uh 750 right that's the highest I've ever seen it um below 400 can get nerve damage brain damage brain shrinkage uh spinal cord thinning and we're calling that normal no of course not that's a that's a clear deficiency in the UK and in parts of Europe that I've seen in in France and possibly Switzerland B12 was like 130 to 540 so it's even lower and so they're saying yeah 600 that's a that's too much like no um everything in that range is way too way too low right um so what I would say is a is a better range for the UK um and um Europe and because I think they use the same units and Australia New Zealand is actually 800 to 12200 right so like they don't even get into that range so you know if you're if you're just coming to a carnivore diet you are likely extremely deficient and if you're under that 400 or in America under 540 you know you should think about taking you know getting a shot to bump you up you know because you you have an actual an actual deficiency that that can harm you and so yes you know going on to meat only and adding in liver that will catch you up it'll just take a bit longer and so you know it's up to you really but um if you're really low if you're like you know well under 400 then you know I would give somebody a shot of methyl cabalin just to just to get them out of that that danger range you know um but methyl cabalan not cyana cabalan hey everyone really happy to announce a new sponsor for the show and for everybody down in Australia Stockman Stakes who are delivering ing high quality grass-fed and finished pasture raised beef and other meats flash frozen and vacuum sealed tood door something that I've been enjoying a lot of myself recently as well they also have a great range of specialty items such as high fat keto mints and carnivore beef and organs mints with liver kidneys and beef heartart as well so use code chaffy today for free order of beef mints or another specialty gift along with your order at Stockman steaks.com and I'll see you over there thanks guys Aaron key says um since starting carnivore I have peripheral edema I barely have ankles I'm sorry to hear that I'm well hydrated I'm taking Dr Berg's electrolyte powder and two tablespoons of no salt trying to get potassium with no relief well it may not be the potassium or the electrolytes and um you know it's strange that people that that you would get peripheral edema after going carnivore that's that's generally the other way around if you're concerned about electrolytes I would check your electrolytes I don't think you necessarily need to take them um just just for the fun of it um also it depends on how long you've been carnivore most people only need um electrolytes early on and so I wouldn't um you know if if you've been on it for a while most people don't need it after that um there can be other reasons for peripheral edema you can certainly get uh shifts in in um fluid shifts between tissues because your body's just trying to reimagine how the hell it works now and so that that can be a temporary thing that then resolves itself you know if you're having this sort of Edema you can also think about getting compression stockings and just s trying to keep those things together while your body's trying to figure itself out and try and and getting um its fluid balance and fluid shifts a bit more under control there can also be underlying issues um that you related to your heart or other sort of issues that that may just be presenting now and just sort of being uncovered and so you know this persists you know don't um you know don't don't forget to see your doctor and make sure that there isn't anything else that could be causing this and um hopefully that just goes away sometimes you do see that it sort of swells up for a bit and then it and then it goes away on its own but you can do the compression stockings and uh don't forget to see your doctor if this persists or you have other sort of symptoms that you're concerned about so um karami or kame thank you very much for the Super Chat feeling good with six hours of sleep on Carnivore concerned regarding studies linking sleep deprivation in men to lower testosterone do carnivores require less sleep does eight hour recommendation only pertain to people who eat a a standard diet and how long do you sleep people do tend to to sleep or need less sleep and get more restful from less sleep and be able to handle less sleep but um typically people still need sort of seven to eight hour range there are some people there's a there's a sleep scientist or neurobiologist at Berkeley who um you know wrote the book on this and um I forget his name but he's he's an interesting guy I've seen a few um interviews he's been in and he was saying it's like it's very rare I mean there are people that that actually don't need more than four or five hours of sleep but it's like one in 6,500 the other ones are people that oh no I'm fine I only need that whatever they think they do but in fact they're actually harming themselves and they increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's by like sixfold and yes you know you need you need proper sleep to get proper hormonal function growth hormone being actually more important than than testosterone but if you're chronically under sleeping your cortisol is going to be elevated that's going to screw up your other hormones as well you can give yourself pre-diabetes and it yes can lower your testosterone so if you are doing everything you can to get light out in the you know get out in the morning get light in your eyes so your brain says oh it's morning time start the clock on your day get out you know when the sun's going down so your brain says yep okay we need to make some melatonin and all these sort of things you don't have bright lights everywhere as you're as you're winding down for the night you you're turning off the lights or using blue blocking glasses are just turning off the damn lights and getting off of TVs and screens and and uh phones and things like that using a sleep mask blank out all light you know if there's any light in the room at all if you can see the silhouette of your hand in front of your face it's too bright it should be pitch black and so if you don't have it pitch black which no one does you know put a sleep mask on and then make it pitch black uh you'll find that you'll sleep much better that way uh what you really want is you want to be able to sleep until you wake up and so you wake up naturally doing all those things and um and if that's six hours then that's six hours you know I mean can't really force yourself to sleep longer than that but uh you want to get as much sleep as your body requires so whatever that is that's what you want and if that's six hours then you know lucky you you're one of the lucky few that gets a couple more hours in their day everyone says like there needs to be more hours in the day and well you know you got them so you know take advantage of that um if that's really the case that you know you're doing everything right and you're just that's just how much sleep your body wants great uh get up do things you know you've got two extra hours you can write a book do it go to the gym and you get get a lot more done you have two extra hours of the day they can be very productive with those two hours uh don't waste it on your phone it thank you for the Super Chat a popular Health blogger recently stated that beef fat from grain-fed cows can lead to fatty liver how important do you think 100% grass-fed is and why would he say that I don't know why he said that um I don't agree with it um you know if you had you know grain finish you know it might be higher linolic acid you know maybe you could you could argue uh that that that that contributes I don't know you know what sort of evidence they have um one thing I have heard by from Dr lustig was that you know he's mentioned um some studies that Associated grain finished beef uh having higher BCAAs the branch chain amino acids and those had some sort of correlation with fatty liver um but I didn't he he mentioned these but it didn't have links to the studies he was talking about so I don't know if uh which ones he was talking about directly but the ones I found I tried to look that up um they they were just sort of just associative studies that weren't really uh very strong and so at least those ones I didn't I didn't I wasn't all that convinced by them and so you know you never know I don't think that um uh I'm not too worried anyway and you know I've been eating you know grass grass-fed beef for years and years and years I I I I've found a source of um grass finished beef now it's actually um be a new sponsor that that I'm bringing on now it's called Stockman stakes and they're just here in Australia Unfortunately they don't ship to the states or or elsewhere at the moment but they might later and they um they do just grass-fed grass finish P raised meat beef and other meat so you know that's great you know so I'm I'm going to be getting that and so I've started ordering from them more and if you want to do that they can actually check them out it's just Stockman stakes. com.au and you can use discount code chaffy you get like a free bag of mints or something like that uh or or something you know there's like a free gift involved right now it's it's mints and they have like fatti ear cuts and things like that for carnivore people and you can just buy chunks of grass fed beef fat and uh carnivore um mince like ground beef is going to be has a bit of organs in it and a lot more fat it's like 75 35 so you know i' up until basically now you know I've been eating you know grain finished beef predominantly I don't have fatty liver all my liver function tests are perfect in my patient population I don't tell them they have to do grass finish to tell them it's the best but you know most most people can't afford it or or don't have access to it I don't have anybody with deranged liver function I don't have anybody that has has um gotten fatty liver as a result of going carnivore I think there all the other things that you eat along with it that's causing fatty liver I don't think it's I don't think it's the cow itself and um at least I haven't seen it and um the other things that you're doing are also going to mitigate any of these damages because you gotten rid of all these things you got I mean fructose directly causes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that's been proven in uh studies with biochemically but also in studies with um uh in humans in pediatric population shown reversal of metabolic syndrome and fatty liver disease by just the removal of fructose and and still keeping carbohydrates and not losing weight right so you know that's um that that satisfied the Bradford Hill criteria for causation and um and then alcohol obviously causes fatty liver disease and that's why fructose causes fatty liver disease because fructose and alcohol are metabolized into the same uh byproducts as um yeah fructose as each other right and so part of that metabolization is is dropping out a fatty droplet and that gets stuck in the liver and that built up so I don't know I've heard that I've heard that claim before I don't really buy it and I certainly haven't seen it in my patient population you know if you're if you're eating grain finished beef and um you know most people's fatty liver disease goes away you know that's what happens um if you start to develop this and and you don't know why fine you know switch to Grass finish beef and see how you go I mean that's that's definitely the Pinnacle you know if you're having any issues that's where you go from there as you go to grass-fed and finished but um you know I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about it uh Tony uh pemsel from Facebook says Hi I atherosclerosis is carnivore safe for me type two diabetic CAC score of 10 and uh non-alcoholic fatty liver disease it's not only safe for you it is uh probably essential for you it will reverse your type two diabetes and uh and your non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as we just said your CAC score that can go up or down for a lot of different reasons U it's only looking at the the hard plaque the calcified plaque not the soft plaque so we don't know how much soft plaque you have and um and so you know could be that you have a lot of soft plaque and if that starts receding but it starts calcifying at the same time your CAC score can go up even though your soft plaque is going down or your CAC score can go down while your soft plaque is going up there's really no way to tell um but it is it is pretty good um useful information anyway and a c a score of 10 is very low so uh yes um oror that is safe for you and it's going to be healthy for you it's going to be healthy and safe for everyone because this is really is our biological diet this is just how we're we're we're built and um uh so you know we're purpose built to eat meat and we get harmed from eating plants it's pretty much that simple RB thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat that's very kind of you uh hello Dr chaffy my wife who has Crohn's disease started carnivore about three weeks ago she is gaining weight and very concerned she only eats beef eggs fatty pork and coffee nothing else what can be the reason for her weight going up well it's uh you know as I was talking about earlier uh in this talk you know talking about metabolism you know when you're starving yourself starving yourself and chronically undereating you actually slow your metabolism down and then you all of a sudden you get real food in your body oh thank goodness like okay we're going to store on hang on to this you can also put on muscle bone things like that three weeks you know you will you know sort of tighten up the muscles but you know it could be that she actually is putting on fat there's there are metabolic reasons for this and hormonal reasons for this there are some people that put on weight early on or even ongo for about six months or more in some cases um and this is largely hormonal so you know you can check things out you sort of see how our thyroids doing um um check her leptin and her fasting insulin these sorts of things are good indicators of her metabolism and is her metabolism in a in a depressed state or in an active State the higher the insulin is the lower her metabolism is the higher her leptin is the lower her metabolism is and the more difficult is going to be to lose weight even on a carnivore diet but the good news is is that on a carnivore diet a ketogenic carnivore diet so no carbs no sugar nothing like that no artificial sweeteners and no Dairy that comes down fasting insulin comes down relatively quickly and fasting lefting comes down more slowly but it happens and it's when that comes down significantly and the metabolism improves then you start seeing more of the weight loss so it's very important to think about this as a as a medical intervention this is for her health first and foremost so for the Crohn's disease I would really stick to just beef I would cut out the eggs and the pork and definitely the coffee all those things can be pro-inflammatory can trigger her Crohn's disease if she just goes red meat and water so the ruminant Meats like beef lamb goat and venison she will have a much better response to this I mean she'll improve dramatically just doing that but she will have far better results if she cuts out everything except uh ruminant meat the beef and the lamb things like that that and and just water no coffee she will do best on that hands down and so doing that seeing how her Crohn's is doing making sure she's doing well also you know if she's on medications for the Crohn's like prazone Picone other cortico steroids she's going to gain weight because that's those medications make you do that but hopefully she'll be able to come off those medications by doing these dietary interventions and basically putting her Crohn's disease into remission which it does I mean that's in that's in the that's in the clinical literature that people going on Elemental diet where you're just eating macros and micros you need nothing else that this is a better treatment for an acute flare up of Crohn's than prazone right so it's just not eating certain things is a better treatment than steroids right so that's showing that cause and effects relationship as well you know you remove something the problem goes away you bring it back the problem comes back that's a and affect relationship so focus on her health you know focus on getting better focus on the Crohn's going away the weight will come the weight will happen if you're worried about it you know check the leptin check the insulin check the thyroid check her her vitamins minerals B12 D3 those sorts of things or or d25 those things are uh very uh useful to the body and most people are very deficient and so you just just optimize these things you optimize her health getting a bit of liver every now and then and make sure that her she's not at some critically low nutritional State and then you just let her body get on with it and she will lose weight you know she will it just may take time and if her lepin is elevated shouldn't really be above five and um you know then that's you know that's going to take time to come down it's going to take more time for her to lose weight it just is um so I would just check those things out and just be a bit patient with it um it's about healing it's about health first and foremost this is not you know this isn't a crash diet to just try to lose weight um it's it's about optimizing your health and when you know you get your health improved your weight tends to improve as well um and remember that muscle and bone also have weight and so you can improve your lean body mass percentage and you can gain weight or not lose any weight and you're losing fat at the same time so you go by how you feel first and foremost very secondarily you go by body composition how your clothes are fitting Etc never do you worry about the scale right if you are putting on fat Okay um likely metabolic issue hormonal issue all the rest just give it time you know the most important thing is is putting nutritious food in the body and allowing it to heal it needs it needs to heal we've been hurting our bodies for decades we need we need to give it time to uh to let let that undo the body fat percentage comes with that but it comes with the healing it's not necessarily the first thing that happens for a lot of people it goes along with it and it happens really early not everybody and those are some of the hormonal reasons why that can be and um you know women tend to do more of the starvation yo-yo dieting sort of things and then going back to carbs and sugar and things like that and then starving themselves and that and they tend to be the ones that are that have a bit more difficult of a time uh losing all the weight because they they sort of that that sort of behavior can really trash your metabolism so just give it time focus on health focus on really healing the Crohn's disease stick to beef lamb and water and um you know you can check you can check those Bloods if you want to and uh and just to give you an idea but eventually it'll happen make sure you're eating enough as well chronically undereating even if you're eating the right thing will again tell your body that you're in a famine your body say no we gotta hang on to this so eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good don't eat anything else try to stick to beef and lamb and just give it time it's this is a long game it's not uh you know it's slow and steady wins the race okay and good luck to her Milo foam Bill thank you for the for the um Super Chat your thoughts on polyunsaturated fatty acids Omega 6es and inflammatory yeah I think that there's a lot of um evidence to that uh to that um uh to those being pro-inflammatory and there's others going in the other direction and you know who do you trust well you know uh I trust biology and Physiology and um evolutionary biology and um you know how much do we normally have in our body and our system not much less than 2% one to two% and the um Omega sixes that we we get from meat are things like Arad IC acid which yeah we do need but only in a small amount um we don't need linolic acid at all we only need linolic acid that's the plant version of omega-6 is if we don't have enough arachadonic acid then we turn lenic acid into arachadonic acid but it's um you know you sneeze and and you mutate this stuff it's very unstable it can cause neuroinflammation and breakdown products and free radicals in the brain causing distress to the brain um Dr Georgia e talked about this she's a psychiatrist from Harvard and how omega-6 is lenic acid specifically is quite toxic uh to the brain causes neuroinflammation and and so for her field and in Psychiatry um she's she's very much against it and you know these polyunsaturated fats you know as we've increased these things and decreased animal fats and saturated fats um you know heart disease rates have gone up Alzheimer's has gone up cancers have gone up all these other things have gone up these are all associations but it's not going the other way animal fats goes the other way as we've reduced animal fat consumption over the 20th century and into the 21st century heart disease rates and non-communicable chronic diseases cancers uh Strokes Alzheimer's autoimmunity they've all gone up right so that's that's an inverse relationship so we know it's not that we know it has nothing to do with meat fat and and animal fat I should say um how much of a role does Omega 6 play and the polysaturated fats play I think probably a significant role uh but it all comes down to the the over overarching premise of we're eating things that don't belong in our body we're eating things that don't belong to our species and we're getting sick as a consequence and Omega 6 is are part of that you know you're eating these things out of proportion of what we would in nature what we've ever done in our biological past and we're getting harm that's all there is to it um Dr Chris Kenobi has written a whole book on this he thinks that that's the main driver of disease nowadays is is the omega-6s and the polyunsaturated fatty acids you know these seed oils that were industrial lubricants you know like the Germans invented krisco I believe in 1911 they use it to like lubricate their uots the submarines that were going around in World War I and uh then they ended up selling the the recipe uh to Proctor and Gamble then Proctor and Gamble paid the American Heart Association $20 million in today's valuation to uh to lie and say that it was better for your heart than than animal fats so it's just like you know the this the aha I mean I literally just don't believe a word that they say everything they say is uh you have to hold and with a lot of contempt and scrutiny because they've just been there's so many examples of them being paid off by different Industries like the sugar like Proctor and Gamble and then the sugar companies um you know paid them to say to lie about things like the Framingham study and say that you know it said that um that uh uh cholesterol increased cholesterol cause was associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease mortality and was like no actually showed the opposite of that you know so that's that's um uh you know just a completely corrupt organization from the GetGo and you shouldn't believe a damn word they say there are also studies the only uh randomized control trials Interventional trials looking at LDL cholesterol polyunsaturated fats saturated fats and cardiovascular disease and mortality rates um there are three of them and they were all buried because they didn't give the the outcome that the authors wanted and and they admitted to that decades later when these got uncovered um and they found that replacing um saturated fat with polyunsaturated fats in one case linolic acid which is Omega 6 from plants that this did indeed lower uh LDL cholesterol but ended up killing pe a lot more people of from heart attacks and strokes from cardiovascular disease so what do you want is LDL just LDL just no nothing else just LDL causes heart disease right higher LDL causes heart disease okay well we lowered LDL and it lowered heart disease you know or sorry we lower we lowered LDL and increased heart disease right so that's not the case we had higher LDL with less heart disease with less heart attacks with less Strokes right and so you lower LDL and heart disease goes up Strokes go up heart attacks go up okay I've seen some people say like well you know all that shows is that linolic acid is worse than LDL okay well what do you want you know it's like you're saying that LDL causes heart disease okay so are you saying now that linolic acid causes heart disease as well okay well then then what you know when you when you're getting these polyunsaturated fats they come with a lot of linolic acid it's what the hell are you supposed to do right what are you supposed to eat that's natural first of all seed oils aren't natural you can't get those things naturally um and so you know what would we have been eating biologically that wouldn't kill us historically you know you got nothing you know and so you know this is is um it's a bit of a force you know it's just it's just a bit of a mess around you know there's there's nothing that that we're eating now that even existed 50,000 years ago besides meat it just isn't right and so you know the idea that that um we have to eat all these things that didn't exist you know 100 years ago let alone 50,000 years ago um is a bit is a bit ridiculous you know just we've just been unhealthy and miserable and dying of cancers and heart disease you know this whole no you know nature is you know the natural state of all life is is healthy because unhealthy species as a species they don't last and in fact they don't exist in the first place because they come from species that were healthy and survived and adapted to some situation and changed a bit and changed a bit and changed a bit so you know all life comes from those survived all life so we have to be descending from people who were healthy and if we're eating a lot of meat and exclusively meat for a long time we must have been healthy doing that and so uh now we are getting very sick as a population and we are hurting ourselves and yes we're surviving but it's very clear that we're getting a lot worse and it's not going to go very well and fertility rates are going down um diseases are going up and so we're you know if we were doing that during an Ice Age good luck making it through an ice age uh you know fat sick and miserable like that it's not going to happen Sally yo 1985 thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy became sterile from chemotherapy oh I'm very sorry to hear that to stem cell transplant and countless other chemotherapies can carnivore reverse my sterility um unfortunately you know there is is such a thing as damage done and you may not be able to undo all the damage that you know that happens to your body especially from you know really really nasty noxious things such as uh as chemo uh it's it's very harsh stuff and um you know the idea is that you want it to be harsh so it kills these cancer cells but it kills your cells too unfortunately and it and it can sometimes kill kill people the hope is that it kills the cancer cells before kills the um you know the host the patient you um and so you know I I don't know you know it's um you know nothing else is going to do it anyway and it can at least give your body a chance to heal from things and recover from things you know it's there is such a thing as damage done though and if it's it's completely destroyed your ovaries it may not come back but there are a lot of people that have improved their fertility and and been able to come out of menopause and you know men in their 70s that patients of mine that their testosterone goes from bottomed out to that of a healthy 25y old um is uh you know that that happens but if you know if it's if the ovaries are have been compromised to the extent that they they can't recover even in optimal circumstances you it may not come back so I would still definitely try a cornivore diet just because it's going to make you so much more healthy in all other respects it can hopefully help you keep uh cancer into remission because you know the principles of ketogenic metabolic therapy of starving out those cancer cells uh of glucose and other sorts of things and get keeping your body healthy so it can keep that suppressed keep those cells suppressed and you know if you get a a reversal of your condition and you uh reverse your sterility then that's just a bonus but I would consider it a bonus I would do this for other reasons I would do this for your other healthy reasons optimizing your health and then you know if you do and so don't get your hopes up on these things because you know you you can permanently damage yourself with something like chemo and so you know you just have to look at this as like okay I'm doing this for my health and optimizing my health and I'm not expecting this to get better from a sterility point of view but if it happens great but if not you know then not so don't don't get your hopes up but I would still try anyway because it's going to help you in so many other ways as well Terry thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat it's very kind of you uh Terry says no question just supporting a cause well thank you very much that's very sweet of you and it's nice to see you here thank you for joining Terry Brown thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm getting ready for a kidney transplant in two weeks is carnivore still safe after a living donor transplant yes absolutely and it can absolutely help your kidney function so it's um you know it it's said in in certain circles and just repeated that higher protein diets are actually harmful to your kidneys is completely untrue the evidence in medical literature shows the opposite shows that higher protein diets actually improve kidney function it doesn't depress kidney function and again this is this is what we're designed for this is our optimal biological diet for all human beings and so you know especially in in times of extremity like getting a kidney transplant or some other sort of major issue uh that's exactly what you need you need to be eating your optimal diet you need to be putting in perfect nutrition for your body and getting rid of everything else that can cause harm uh as much as you can just in the world we live in you're always going to be exposed to awful things and um but you know all these plant toxins uh can be very nephrotoxic they can be very toxic to the kidneys things like oxalates they directly harm the kidneys and so they will they will shut your kidy or they'll slow your kidney down and and in fact a lot of people with ckd4 ckd5 so chronic kidney disease four and five have have been reversing this by going on a carnivore diet so yes it's it's it's not only safe but encouraged for people in any extreme medical condition to to go on you know to get optimal nutrition and feed their body exactly what it needs and get rid of everything else and that and that absolutely applies to uh kidney function because it it helps kidney function so good luck with that um you know it's a it's a shame that you weren't able to try this before the kidney transplant or or if you're donating to someone um that they weren't able to do try this before because you know if they're on full-on dialysis it's you know it's not you know that's pretty far gone and again there can be permanent damage done but if they were sort of before that and their kidney still had some function a lot of people have recovered a lot I've seen a couple people um three in fact be able to come off dialysis which is never supposed to happen um but you know there there are and a fourth now is is making more urine maybe maybe not you know maybe they will be able to come off maybe not hopefully but if not then you know and the transplants is is certainly uh his best option but at the same time you know if you're not at that point yet a lot of healing can be done and so um you know just just uh but either way you know once you get the surgery you know this being you know having optimal nutrition is is definitely going to help recover from surgery and and be as healthy as you can going on tulsi's next X thank you for the Super Chat hi doc 6'3 uh 256 lb male 42 I ate about 270 g of protein and maybe 200 grams of fat daily should I cut down the protein to lose weight um you know it's um it's it's one of those things like you need you just need enough protein for your body's biological demands you need enough fat for your body's biological demands so you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good generally a good ratio for people that aren't like you know competitive bodybuilders is about one to one grams of fat to protein or even more grams of fat to grams of protein if you think about it that way um you're gonna if you're eating more grams of fat than protein you're actually going to get a lot more calories oh my God calories are so bad calories don't weigh anything but if you're eating more grams of fat you won't need as much grams of protein for energy the majority of the protein that you take in is not being used as energy so this whole calories in calories out model is is ridiculous because you don't use most amino acids as energy you use them as a physical structure and building components of your body every single molecule that your DNA codes for is a protein it's strings of amino acids and so that's what protein amino acids that you bring in get used for is to make all the molecules and and um chemicals that your DNA codes for right those are all amino acids those are all proteins right it's not just protein or muscle every molecule your DNA codes for is a protein and you need proteins for those building blocks and so they don't get used as as energy right so if you have a lot more protein that your body demands then you're going to you can turn you can't really store protein very well so you you convert that into glucose and then into fat and you just store it right so if you're having a lot more um then yeah you don't need it it's an excess and then you start using the protein as an energy source okay um is that too much energy will that get stored or will it just get used it depends it depends on how much you're getting in but if you're getting the same amount of calories a day and you're getting more of those calories from fat you're actually bringing less grams right because protein when converted into energy um is about you know four 3.4 um calories per gram whereas fat is nine calories per gram what there weighs anything it's the gram right so you flip that around it's one gram per 9ine calories for fat three grams per nine calories of protein right so very different right so you have to take in more grams more weight of protein to get the same amount of energy right so don't do that get your energy from fat don't get it from protein and you will lose weight you will just physically bring in less volume of um you know less matter less Mass into your body and uh and you can weigh less as a result of that if you're you know if you want to check this you can check your your urine um um studies so your your kidney function studies sorry um in your in your blood test and if your Ura is going up independent of your creatinine um if your creatinine is going up then you just need to drink more water but if your Ura is going up independent of your creatinine then that can indicate that you're you're converting more amino acids into energy because you don't you're not getting enough fat to meet your energy demands so don't do that so you can raise your your grams of fat that way but just listen to your body you want to get enough fat want to get enough protein so you want to keep eating fat nothing else or meat and fat nothing else but water um and then you tell by your stools if you're getting hard dry constipated stools you need more fat your body's absorbing it all and there's not spill over your body can only absorb a certain amount of fat and there's a spill over right and so um that spill over keeps your stool soft and that's how you tell and so you want to keep your stool soft and as long as you're doing that you're not taking things that can that can can make you have loose stools such as coffee tea uh artificial sweeteners um magnesium supplements things like metformin and other medications those can all uh make your stools more loose U but if you're not doing that you only need medium water you go by your stools and so if it's nice and soft you're eating enough fat that's all there is to it if it's dry and hard you need more fat that's all there is to it so I just go by that you can you can Tinker with things if you want to but just make sure you're eating enough fatty meat um that it it satisfies your hunger and you stops tasting good and you should be fine and you can check your Ura too if you want uh Dr good thank you very much for the Super Chat any tips for someone with frequent urination due to head injury U being on the carnivore diet been on it for three weeks and am having a hard time losing weight well it's early days so just you know just keep that in mind make sure you're eating enough make sure you're eating enough fat um and just just give it time you've had a head injury that can affect your urination it may not get better even on a carnivore diet because not everything is is a product of a of a bad diet other things can be from a direct injury sometimes your body can heal from these things and you're in a better position to heal from them when you're on a on a proper biologically appropriate diet like a carnivore diet for El it's a carnivore diet um and U but it's not it's not guaranteed you know neurological structure are very difficult to heal a lot of them can though I mean some of these neurological issues that people have had long standing for years uh heal and it's crazy you know maybe they don't get perfect but they get a all a lot better than they were before and then some don't at all you know it just depends on if your body has any capacity to heal that anymore or if it's just permanent scarred down it's not going to get better uh so hopefully it does get better in your case as far as losing it's concerned you know like I say before there can be hormonal reasons metabolic reasons and all these other sorts of things just give it time give your body what it needs and also gaining weight losing weight is um yes hormonal but also muscle weighs things bones weigh things and so if you're working out you're going to put on muscle you're going to not see the same amount of weight loss as you would if you weren't putting on muscle uh but at the same time doing things that put on muscle will actually help you help you use more fat as well so go by how you feel go by how your clothes fit and also give it more time than three weeks that's still very early days and uh good luck with it I'm sure you'll do great Peter Brown say is his birthday tomorrow he's going to be turning 75 years old well happy birthday Peter that's awesome and I hope you have a great day and a big old steak for your birthday put a you know couple candles in it and call it a day uh great stuff H good to see you here thank you for joining Justine uh rates ratn thank you very much for the Super Chat uh last year I developed uh reticular vericose veins on my right leg and a few more visible veins on my body I was eating high carb diet now carnivore is it is it possible to improve vein Health on Carnivore uh it is but you know once you've already sort of put down these physical structures you know they may not actually go away but uh some people have found they've improved their varicose ve but you know again you know we can we can do things to our body that that make permanent changes but there are some things in you like skin tags a lot of these things go away those sort of um uh you know sort of darkening in our Aila or around the neck and things like that that can go away as well that has to do with high insulin and rectal polyps you know or colon having these little pops and growths those can go away so a lot of these things can go away potentially those but you you just have to see and you know if there not there are treatments to get rid of those things you can get um you know sclerotherapy where sort of inject this sort of stuff and it and just sort of shuts them down um and uh you know good friend of mine from from medical school he does that now too he's a he's an Interventional radiologist and he just sort of fell into that and he sort of enjoys it so it's uh it's very possible to sort of get that done just with a percutaneous procedure as well and um uh you know and so see how it goes with the carnivore give it you know six months a year or something like that and if it's it hasn't really improved in that time you know you can always look at alternative methods but you know your body will get a lot better and um you'll feel a lot better and could very well help that as well uh but let us know see what happens and then let us know how you go um Bachelor Jun has a thank you for the Super Chat I'm not seeing a question uh here we go uh question is I'm just having a tough time getting off cannabis dropping my sugar drinking too much heavy whipping cream you know it's difficult to come off these substances uh we we become very used to them we become addicted to them and so um you know it's um it's just one of those things that that we just have to sort of have a good reason for coming off of them you know feeling better wanting to improve our health in in whatever ways having more mental Clarity all these sorts of things um whatever whatever reason you have just you know focus on that remember that these things you know do get better over time if you if you go to these things as a crutch or whatever you know find a different hobby find a different crutch find a different something that that that fills that same Gap and and go to that instead of um instead of the Cannabis and the sugar and the heavy whipping cream eat a lot of fatty meat if you're ever having a craving or whatever eat fatty meat eat it until it stops tasting good and then that often will suppress a lot of these um a lot of these urges and Cravings so hopefully that can help as well um good luck with it you know it's difficult coming off of any any substance um I mean I mean not even Canabis just sugar and all these other sorts of nicotine and and and caffeine and all these other sorts of things it can be very very addictive and harmful to us and you know but good for you for for trying to come off this stuff you'll get there it'll be fine and um you know you can do this usually after about two weeks these things go away so it's a light at the end of the tunnel if you can get to two weeks the chemical addiction is going to be gone and it's just about the mental addiction and and going to this in certain circumstances when you when you feel uh you know like you know depressed or sad or whatever you know and you go to that as a crutch go to something else go to the gym go to the beach go do Sprints something like that go see friends uh replace it with more healthy uh habits and uh and then you'll just make yourself better and better and better and you'll get away from that sort of unhealthy past good luck with that there's another one down here from from him as well from bachel Bachelor or Junior I don't know how to pronounce that does Dr CH have any plate screws or implants from rugby life I do uh or I did I had a plate and six screws in my right fibula because I I broke my leg and Ankle I actually had it broken for me some bastard in Canada um I I ran the ball like s of Sho string tackled me and then when I was sort of being pinned down he just took my leg and just like alligator rolled and just snapped my leg um really pissed me off it's one of those things that that when you get like a serious injury like that you don't feel it it's just all of a sudden go you just get this charge of adrenaline and you just you can't feel anything in your body your heighten is super heightened awareness and you just go something's wrong okay and I was thinking I was like I think it's something to do with my ankle um but I can't feel it it doesn't hurt there's nothing there and that's what these natural opiate receptors are for that's what opiates work on these receptors and that's what therefore you have some crazy injury your body goes oh no you don't want to feel that and just shuts it down and and um and I tried to to to walk on it and I put my foot down and I put some weight on it and I could feel my foot slipping away from my leg and I was like oh that's not good and I was like thinking I was like okay you know I was thinking I was like oh sh shoot can I keep keep playing because this was in the finals this was in the finals um up in up in Canada we're the only American team in this league and they hated us for it they did not want us there there was a lot of um um hard feelings that that um uh that we were there and now we're in the finals and they were really pissed about that um refs hated us too we we had very very one-sided games uh that's why I got into as many fights as I did um in in these games because I just I would not accept people being cheap and dirty and throwing punches or stomping on heads and all those sorts of things so I was just like yeah you're going to do that I'm G to knock you out it's like that's all there is to it and um I I would not accept people hitting me illegally and um uh so yeah had a couple like bench ing fights and things like that too um but uh but this time they yeah very dirty very very dirty um uh at that time anyway and obviously very dirty move to intentionally break someone's leg like that and so I was sort of going like oh can I still play and I felt my foot sort of slipping away and I was like oh can't really do that and um uh and um so so you know I was um I saw sort thinking I like oh probably can't play on this and there was like you know only a few minutes left in the game and and we were down by one point and uh my fullback Ryan Bishop just I just hear him screaming was like chy get in there and I'm like right guess I'm playing staying on and and I just sort of hobbled over to the side of the Rock and like they they had the ball so I was I just got down on my hands and then on my left leg and I just like sort of curled hold my right leg up because that was the broken one up behind me because I knew if that if that hit the ground it would just my foot would just rip off and so I just did that and someone's running up and I just threw myself into their legs and um and just kept my foot up and sort of like three post bear crawled over to the side again did it again did it again did it again and um hey no and um and um so um uh then you we got the ball and my buddy's just like hey you know run this move with me and I'm like I I can't run I do not give me that ball like my leg is is done he's like all right well just just be a dummy for me and so he like got the ball and I'm screaming for the ball and everyone just like shifted down onto me and uh passed it out we made a break started going up and then um trying to complete a pass to beat the fullback and and win the game and the fullback intercepted it and then scored a try against us and that was it and it was like damn it so ended up losing and getting a broken leg which really sucked and uh I was I went into the um I really couldn't walk after that and um I went into actually went out the trader put like a aircast on it and so I was just I was really really bummed by that and so um I ended up going out that night and um you know I didn't drink during the rugby season I'm like well you know my season's over my leg's broken so you I'm not going to be playing so I might as well drink and um and so like yeah went out and was like walking on this thing really shouldn't have and went into the ER the next day and um and they took the aircast off it was just black you know and uh but like the the resident was just like that is BR K and um and the attending was like well no you know think of your Toronto ankle rules you know he came in he walked in here he's didn't come in he came in the day after on the day of and all these different sorts of things and and um so you know realistically he doesn't even qualify for an x-ray it's probably not broken and but we'll do an x-ray just in case and yeah just gone and um you know spiral fracture all the way up you know an unstable spiral fracture um and my you know you have your tib fib and your foot sort of sitting there my foot was out here you know so it was completely out of joint and I was in to see an orthopedic surgeon the next day and he just said look you know if the the broken bone is one thing but you know this is out of joint and if it if it doesn't get put back into place and repair the ligaments that are supposed to hold it there uh you'll never move that ankle again without you know so you need surgery you'll never move that ankle again I was like right when do we do surgery and he's like well do it uh yeah two hours I'm like sounds good let's do it so I was like it was in surgery that day and I got a plate in six screws and I did not walk for 5 months after that I couldn't walk and my my leg became skinnier than my arm it was really freaky uh because it was um it's uh that's not normal and um uh yeah that was a lot of pain that was hard to that was hard to get over um I've since got that those that plate and screws taken out and um and then I detached my bicep tendon from the bone um just arm got sort of Tangled around pulled around in a in a tackle and um and so I got that so I finished the game it's already it's not going to get it's not going to get more torn off the bone it's already off the bone so I finish finished the game and um you know talked to the trainer I was just like yeah I think I'm pretty sure I torn my bicep off off off the bone they're like no no you wouldn't have no you know and I was just like well I can't feel the bicep tendon and and I'm flexing and my biceps muscles rolling up my arm so kind of feels like that's what it is and they're like oh God all right yeah okay and um again I was in surgery a couple days after that so I have like a post in there so they drill a screw in there that has like really strong uh suture material back there and you cut off a bit of The Frayed tendon and then you suture that down to the bone and you just have to leave it there for like six weeks you can't have more than a pound of pressure on the arm that was very difficult because I was supposed to go to Thailand the next week so I sort of put it off another week and actually went to Thailand with this little weird arm arm brace on so sometimes people see them on my um Instagram way down at the bottom is with that is with that that arm brace on and that's what that's from but um yeah it's not fun but um it's uh uh you know it's possible it is possible to get to get over these sorts of things um yeah did I frame my x-rays no I didn't I didn't prame my x-rays I don't even know if I still have them um but yeah yeah I think I still have that maybe it's on my record somewhere back in Seattle but but um uh no I didn't keep it anyway I think I still have the plate and screws though so I sort of I sort of kept those um oh I got them taken out um so Michelle Peterson says thank you Dr C for all you do I've lost 60 pounds off my thyroid and asthma meds feeling amazing that's great that's really great to hear I'm so glad to hear that and um you know really you know congratulations on on losing that weight and and and reversing your oh Jesus come on buddy oh stop wher and um you know congratulations on that that's really uh that's that's really a great accomplishment keep it going oh so Terry Brown this was about um uh the transplant so thank you Terry Brown again for the the Super Chat saying asking uh because carnivore is not the renal transplant diet protocol yeah it makes sense uh but it should be it damn well should be the renal diet protocol and every diet protocol because that's what's going to be best for your body and for your kidneys as well um and or or you know whoever else is involved as well um so that I I would personally well I I personally do do that and uh but if I was in that situation that's exactly what I would do um and I would uh yeah I would recommend it to anyone and everyone yeah so there's a question over from Facebook um yanyan eblas Tamar tamz I'm sure I butchered that name I'm sorry about that um hi Dr chaffy I have healed a lot of health issues in carnivore but this thing one of my concern my magnesium doesn't absorb well enough because my gut issue use still healing is it okay to supplement some probiotic called Synergy well I don't I don't know what Synergy is most probiotics aren't aren't that great you know if you want to get more healthy bacteria down there just use live culture plain Greek yogurt that has as little carbohydrates or no carbohydrates if you can and put that on meat chew up the meat with the yogurt together swallow it in the same bite to try to hide some of those bacteria to get it past your stomach acid and get down to the lower intestin and and that can help with that but just long-term carnivore is going to improve your your gut health and bacteria um other things can can strip out magnesium caffeine will strip out magnesium but also coffee and tea decaf versions of coffee and te can strip out magnesium as well um different sorts of plant toxins all that sort of stuff they they strip out magnesium and other nutrients and vitamins and minerals and things like that or stop them from being able to be absorbed in the first place um there was an interesting study with uh zinc they had people that ate um ate a bunch of oysters and they saw their zinc go up because oysters have a lot of zinc and then they uh gave that zinc with like Black beans or something like that and it only came up like one quarter of the amount this they're checking their serum zinc in real time and it only came up like one quarter of the of the peak that um that then you know oysters on their own did and they give them with like like corn tortillas or something like that or something similar to that uh didn't come up at all it was just Flatline so they didn't absorb any zinc at all so it matters it matters what you eat this stuff with and what you eat later because the coffee can just strip this stuff out so you know if you're having coffee tea caffeine anything like that just get rid of it anything else except meat just get rid of it if you need to supplement some magnesium to start try to get that up you know sure um animal organs have more nutrients and are much more nutrient dense as well so you can just sort of add those things as well and generally you you can get get up to normal levels and um it's also it's also the case that um uh that it takes it can take months and months and months even doing everything optimally to get your magnesium levels up again so just be be patient with that um okay so wir Fox from X says is the reason for cutting out veggies due to the quality of the soil and growth no unfortunately it's just due to the plant itself most plants will kill most animals almost every plant on Earth is in edible meaning that it's so toxic that even a small amount will kill you um but the ones that are so-called edible are just less toxic it's not that they're not toxic it's just we have more ability to detoxify them in fact they will still kill other animals so the plants that we eat will kill her other herbivores like a koala right um you know grapes will kill a cat avocado will kill a cat I think they'll both kill dogs too and so you know there are toxins in these things that that the plant naturally makes themselves yes we make that worse with soil quality with lack of of biodiversity of the micro of the microbiome in the soil of pesticides insecticides and fertilizing all this garbage these herbicides and glyphosat-prozess [Music] [Music] conference called plants are trying to kill you and I have one on my channel too called plants are trying to kill you but I like the lecture form better it's just tighter um um it's less of a discussion it's more of a tight sort of presentation and so uh go to that it's on the low carb down under YouTube channel that's the medical conference and they uh they have great videos on there also by the way everyone should should watch those thoroughly and um and uh yeah you check that out and look at the the the video I did on called plants are trying to kill you and that'll that'll sort of tell you uh probably more than you want to know about about the subject dark sky thank you for the Super Chat is it possible for inflammation to affect the heart without having myopericarditis or endocarditis I have arhythmia without any findings except a high ESR well it can certainly it can certainly affect you not have fluid um you know cardio inflammation cardiomyopathy or inflammation endocarditis is you know a very serious infection myocarditis and pericarditis more inflammation of the heart muscle or the pericardium that surround the heart muscle and that can cause a lot of problems as well and uh it can be very very serious um it depends on what your arhythmia is it depends on what's causing that it may be due to inflammation it may be from something else um you know either way if you're just eating you know proper human diet a biologically appropriate diet you know you're going to reduce a lot of inflammation your ESR is going to get better interestingly enough um I I had a patient that came in who did Blood smears um and there were some some doctors in Perth down in freemantle um markets they have sort of a little stand there and they do just a blood panel smear and they'll look at it under a microscope and take a picture they're sort of all clumped up and weird so they can tell you sort of different things about your body and hers were all clumped up and stacked up really bad which actually would give you a high ESR which is the sedimentation rate of of your red blood cell of your of your blood of your blood panel right um so it's called ESR is arthrite sedimentation right so it's red blood cell sedimentation right how how long they turn into sedent and just sink down on their own as opposed to being centrifuged um the quicker that is the more inflammation you have and and the red blood cells just get sticky and stick together you can see this on the blood panel and the hairs were all stacked up and sticky and stuck to each other as well you know increase your risk of clots and heart attacks and strokes and things like that because they're all sticky and clumped and then you have a bit of a reaction and it clots and it goes and all this sticky blood just doesn't go anywhere right um that's a problem and then she went uh carnivore for like six months or a year or something like that and just perfect and like to the point that that um you know they saw her before and after and they're like how'd you do this what' you do we've never seen a recovery like this in this fast we've never seen that what did you she's like I just went on a carnivore diet and they brought some of the other doctors around like look at this check out her blood panel you know we've never seen this before so there can be a lot of things that can benefit from just lowering that ESR and lowering your in in um inflammation levels will it help your Rhythm I don't know because I don't know what your rhythm is and I don't know what's uh what's causing it so it's always worth a try um and um you know but you can have an underlying arhythmia that's that's separate from from uh uh you nutritional abnormalities um you know always remember there are there are real things there are real medical issues that that aren't a consequence of our diet but 90 90 plus percent of the issues that we are treating nowadays are absolutely caused by our diet get rid of those and deal with the the 10% that can't be addressed by a diet that's you know that's where we want to get to he boy what are you doing shock industry thank you for the Super Chat 14 days in uh love how I feel however I'm taking CBD oil at night to help with insomnia any opinions on this uh thanks eat meat um well you know I I tend to you know like to go away from those sorts of things you know using something like else like melatonin which should be a bit more natural can help you sort of sleep you know optimizing your sleep routine turning off lights using blue blocking glasses getting away from screens getting away from phones and TVs and things like that keeping the lights down very low using yellow light not white light um getting outside in the day getting sunshine in your eyes letting your brain know what time it is our brains tell the time by the frequency of light that's coming into it and so we get on these screens with all this blue light and we get on on on uh just most of our um most of our our lights lighting now is all all blue lights and all that sort of stuff and um you know it's um it's it's uh it actually makes more of a of a difference to our our sleep and our health than we realize so doing that getting away from all those lights getting to bed at a certain time using a sleep mask all those things can really help and you may not need the CBD oil CBD oil again going back to that guy from Professor of neurobiology from Berkeley that I was talking about he's a sleep expert he was saying that you know people use CBD oil to help them sleep and it can help them get to sleep but they actually get lower quality sleep and they don't get into the lower um levels of of sleep that they need to that are the really important restful parts of sleep that that are very important for your brain and your brain recovery so I would I would avoid that if uh if you can because I don't think that it is uh it's optimal hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys great so uh question from carame thank you for the Super Chat will a little whiskey every week ruin my results well it's it's not going to help uh it's not going to be as bad as a lot of whiskey more than once a week um but you know alcohol takes like three weeks to get out of your system so you know having a bit of that it's it's going to slow you down um if you're having a bit of whiskey on a weekly basis or a monthly basis that's obviously going to be better than drinking more whiskey more often and or the same amount of whiskey and eating all the other crap so you know you're you're getting rid of more and more things and so if you're only eating meat and you're having some whiskey on the weekends that's definitely thousands of times better than just eating a whole bunch of normal garbage um because you're not going to be getting the proper nutrition and you're going to be bringing in a lot of other things that are harmful to you so it's it's not good uh it can also lower your inhibitions for eating garbage and eating junk food and sugar and all that sort of crap it will read adddictedtomacintosh alol is one one of the most common ways that people go off plan and they they start drinking alcohol and then they just they go back to just eating W well whatever I tried it didn't work you know and um it's a major reason why people go off so um you know cutting out the whiskey is probably a good idea I really don't drink it all anymore um it's very rare very very rare and if I do it's something you know like just just straight Spirits like whiskey or generally like the clear liquid clear spirit it's like vodka something like that you just have a few of those once every few years and and that's it and but it's been a long time I don't even remember the last time I had a drink it's like it's at least two years now I'd say so um you feel a lot better and it takes like three weeks to feel back to where you were before you drank not hung over I don't get hung over just tired I don't have good energy and so um you will find that that it does actually slow you down a lot but obviously it's better to be carnivore with you know uh you know a little bit of whiskey on the weekends than than um than just you know going to town on everything else as well so question from Stefan uh bannett thank you very much for the super chat um what are your thoughts on pregnant alone DHEA melatonin could any of the them still be beneficial on carnivore they be harmful on Carnivore I don't think they'll be harmful on Carnivore um unless you're just taking too much pregnant alone DHEA uh are both hormones there's a there's a sort of a a uh what is it oh a spectrum of hormones you're starting from cholesterol and they turn into one hormone that turns into another and another and another and another and another and then you get to testosterone estrogen way down at the end of that chain and um so you know cortisol is in there progesterone's in there and DHE and pregnanolone are in there um they're all hormones in their own right though they're not just a reservoir for the next hormone down the chain just like you know uh you know testosterone turns into estrogen but testosterone isn't there just to turn into estrogen it's there to do its own job and so same goes for pregnanolone and DHEA so if you're low on those things and so and some people are um even on a carnivore I I do check for things like DHEA I don't I don't know tests for pregnant alone but maybe there's maybe you can um but it would be sort of rare that a lab would do that but you can get Labs will do DHEA and what I see people going to carnivore diet is is their DHA actually comes up quite significantly and many get back to you know levels that you'd expect you know in your 20s and 30s and so you know those people would not need to get um take DHEA um so you know you can check you know if you've been on Carnival for a long time and you check your DHEA levels um you know and and you wanted to supplement you could I mean it's it's over the- counter in most countries uh prescription here in Australia but it's just you can just you know get a GNC or off Amazon in America uh I wouldn't take it unless you needed it though like anything else you know you don't want to be super physiological in these sorts of things um especially for women because because this can convert into testosterone because DHE turns into andrine andrine turns into testosterone then testosterone turns into estrogen um but you know some people do take this as like a you know a hor part of like hormone replacement therapy um or they just you know take because you know it's over the counter um so some people take it I don't think it's harmful unless you you're taking more than your body needs and you're sort of out outside of the the proper range which obviously is above where the the standard um lab range would be um melatonin is very safe I don't I don't know of really any problems with that one thing that melatonin can do is block cortisol and so if you take too much you just sometimes it's hard to wake up in the morning you don't have that cortisol boost in the morning and you just feel a bit groggy and tired um and it takes a bit longer to wake up but it's not it's not harming you um and it can help you know it can help sort of reset your circadian rhythm and help uh your body produce growth hormone when you go to sleep uh at Ma at optimal levels and um you know it sort of helps with your sleep wake cycle it's not the you know it's not like a just a this is going to make you fall asleep sort of drug um it uh is just it's more about neuro protection hormonal regulation and it's a it's your brain's best antioxidant so those those are all good things you know people you know the dose for jet lag is like 60 milligrams that's a lot a normal dose for uh melatonin would be anywhere from you know 3 milligrams 5 milligrams 10 milligrams you know would be like a bigger dose um and yeah you can take 60 milligrams for jet lag and you know I've done it I've had like the best night sleep of my life you know and um and uh so that was that was nice so you know um you can take things like that sometimes but you know if you're doing well if it helps you sleep and it it it helps you in those ways and helps you get over jet lag I don't really see a problem taking things like that I've done that occasionally um I I'll sometimes take melatonin if I actually know that I can get sleep and I want like good quality sleep um but I sleep really well anyway um especially with like the sleep mask so it's um um yeah it's just up to you really I don't I don't see too many problems with that as long as you're not taking uh too much carnivore mom 81 thank you for the Super Chat I'm not seeing question oh here's one here well thank you for the super chat again hi doc um I'm in my fourth month of meat diet my magnesium looks like already depleted because too uh many meds before so can't absorb by taking uh magnesium supplements is it fine to take probiotics to heal my gut first I think we already did this question didn't we um uh I mean yeah so so again um you don't want to take the commercial probiotics they they haven't been shown to really be any good and just a bit of a waste of money maybe can make things worse so I wouldn't I wouldn't go with those I would go with just um uh plain Greek yogurt with live cultures in it um with no carbs as little or as little carbs as possible and then you uh put that on meat chew it up together with meat swallowed together and that can help uh get your the bacteria down below into your lower intestine Matt Staten thank you for the Super Chat is carnivore okay if I have gallbladder sludge or gallstones yeah so you get the gallbladder sludge and gallstones because you're not eating enough fat and we're told don't eat fat don't eat fat don't eat fat well what happens then is your B is they're sitting there waiting in your gallbladder to absorb fat and you don't do it so actually gets more concentrated so in you know physiology textbooks you say you can go up to 20 times the concentration of you know than when it comes out in your liver because it needs to be concentrated so that when you get a lot of um fat if if there like a week between your kills or something like that then you need to get you need to get a lot of fat in one go and so if you do that um and you and you're concentrating that bile um you know what happens to any hyperconcentrated solution at rest forms crystals it forms precipitate that's what gallstones are that's what what bile sludge is and so if you don't eat fat those are going to get worse guaranteed now those stones might be big enough that they can cause a blockage in which case you'll need you need to get uh intervention to get that taken out um and so you need to be aware of that you know if you start having problems you know you need to get it checked out uh if they're small enough or it's just sludged you know hopefully that can clear and pass safely and then you can just sort of get rid of this stuff A lot of people do a lot of people have symptomatic gallbladders they have sort of pain and sludge and little stones and things like that they go carnivore they start eating a lot of fat and it clears up but you need to be aware that if the stones are big enough they can get stuck but if you don't eat enough fat they're going to get bigger and they're definitely going to get stuck eventually and you're going to have to get that taken out so um you may be in in a state that you can sort of reverse this and I hope you are um if you don't if you don't eat more fat like on a carnivore diet it'll definitely get worse though so you're sort of at that precipice and hopefully you can come back but you know it may still get stuck you may still have to get surgery so you know don't um you know do go in to the doctor or the hospital if you think there's something going on there and you need help okay um okay there's a question from Isabelle B uh how to gain weight my 7 year-old father has been on Carnivore diet for four months and is borderline anorexic please help he needs to eat more it's very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet and this is very important especially in the elderly because you're just not going to well I just I'm just not hungry I'm just not hungry I'm not going to eat I'm not going to eat that much have a couple bites I'm fine it's not about being fine it's about eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good that is very very very very important that's something that uh my father unfortunately fell into he was not eating enough because he just didn't feel hungry and his whole life was about Temperance it was about Mo you know moderating the amount that he ate so that you know he could stay healthy because he was you know concern he wanted to be healthy and so I was just like no I don't need to eat anymore I feel fine and so that's what he was doing he's just like he doesn't feel hungry he's not going to eat you know he's not going to eat all that much and so you know he lost a lot of weight which was healthy then he kept losing weight which was not healthy so I had impress upon him hey you need to eat and and uh you have to eat every day like it's your job and so you know when I go back there sort of once a year once every two years um I sort of try to you know reins this with him and if my sister's listening please go tell them again eat like it's your job and eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good that's what that's what the hunger signal is is the Taste if it tastes good you're still hungry you need to keep eating get a lot of fat the brain's made out of fat you need fat your hormones are made out of fat uh cholesterol specifically and so they need that and so get all of that and they will be uh much healthier and they'll be able to put on weight your seven-year-old father will be able to put on muscle if he eats enough fatty meat and exercises you can put on you can put on muscle at any age as long as you eat right and uh and exercise good luck to that Stags thank you very much for the Super Chat uh bing carnivore uh for three months I want to get lean and struggling with my weight going up uh definitely know it's body fat I eat all Meats red meat eggs chicken fish Etc how can I find a balance um well again you know this is this this can be hormonal and this can be metabolic and so you need to just let your body heal from these sorts of things and let your metabolism recover as well it can take a long time and uh it's rare that people put on weight but it does happen um Kelly Hogan has a great in um discussion with Charles Washington who's uh been you know carnivore what 15 20 years almost and uh he's in he's um in charge of the zeroing in on health Facebook group which is a carnivore Facebook group before it was called carnivore was called zerocarb and so there's a lot of zeroing in on health zero carb Health those are two great Facebook groups and so he um he and Kelly Hogan talk about this and people put on weight she put on weight for like six months and some of that can be muscle and some of it almost certainly is muscle after three months but um some of it can be fat you have to you know check your leptin check your fasting insulin that after three months your fasting insulin is probably okay but your leptin may not be and that can be a sign that your metabolism is still depressed and you just need to eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good eat more fat F than Pro than protein you'll bring in less grams into your body and you'll get more energy from the fat and you bring in less weight and W less grams into your body um and so you can just eat until your body's satiated if you're undereating you're going to slow me your metabolism so just keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good um and just give it time you know eventually it'll it'll sort it sort it out if this keeps going on and you're still worried about it get your leptin checked get your thyroid checked get your um nutrients and hormones checked your B12 all these sorts of things make sure you're not missing something that is holding you back and um you know add in a bit of liver you know High your body tracks nutrients it doesn't trct calories right and so if you're eating more High nutrient density things like a bit more liver like you're just not going to eat as much because you're not going to be as hungry because your body's going to be satisfied of those nutrients quicker and um you know so just keep that in mind as well and and you'll be fine just keep going cut out everything else any dairy gone any artificial sweetener gone all those things are are major uh weight loss stalls and so uh you don't want to don't want those in your body the claim Squad Public Adjusters thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy been following you for a year now I'm active and eat fruit honey after working out are you still not in favor of fruit and honey not a big fan um I don't think you need them I certainly don't think you need it's interesting you're doing that after working out some people do it before working out just to give them that bit of a of a hit in a buzz um and um you know if you're doing it after you're working out you don't you don't need that to you know Drive in muscle like yeah that that will technically raise your insulin insulin is anabolic and Insulin does you know um help Drive protein into your muscles um but it's it's anab you know anabolic isn't just about muscle growth it's also about just growth in general fat growth so you're GNA you're G to you're just going to put on fat as well um you'll put on muscle but you also put on fat and you don't you don't need the the insulin Boost from carbs to to drive protein into your muscles you're already designed for that and so if you eat just eat fatty meat after you work out you know you're going to get a bit of an insulin bump because protein will slightly raise your insulin as well and that will drive that protein into the cells it'll be perfectly fine you have plenty of insulin you don't need to to micromanage it by eating carbohydrates or certainly not taking exogenous carbo um um insulin which some bodybuilders do which I think is a really bad idea um bodybuilders powerlifters you know just people trying to put on muscle um I I don't think that's a good idea um I have a I have a uh video on YouTube called fruit and honey or not carnivore I still uh I still hold to that and I I think that you'd be better off not doing that um see how you go you know try it for a month and see how you feel and see what your results are you know remember that that um you know when you raise your carbohydrates you raise your insulin it's going to look like your muscles are bigger but a lot of that's going to be excess glycogen which draws in water there two molecules of water come in for every molecule of glycogen right you have more glycogen your muscle you're going to have more water in your muscle it's going to look bigger that's not muscle that's just that's water right um that's just you know Dead Space right but you're also going to put down fat it's called myosteatosis is what marbling is on Cals and we see this on MRIs all the time everybody has myosis it's pathological it's always pathological and so when you're eating this stuff you're going to you're oh my muscles are getting bigger well no there's going to be intramuscular fats mosis right and you're going to have glycogen and water so your muscles may look bigger but as soon as you go keto shrinks down oh I lost all this muscle you haven't lost any muscle you didn't have it in the first place right it was fat glycogen water weight inflammation and that's gone you don't want that you want lean body mass you want lean muscle mass you want real muscle real strength real weight and and that's how you get it is just by just eating meat just eating fatty meat and exercising and um you know you'll be great you you'll do a great job and um uh there'll be you know no issues uh with that and so that's that's my my opinion anyway and um I think you'll do uh much better without it and enjoy it more too I mean you know Sugar's Sugar's Pleasant to eat you know and and we enjoy that for the experience of it but food is about you know getting nutrition it's not about enjoyment you can enjoy I've enjoyed every steak that I've ever eaten but that's not why I eat it right it's because I want proper nutrition that's why I eat it cats are nice meow thanks for the Super Chat is there a concern of mRNA in meat sold at stores I mean there's a concern because we have no idea what the hell it's going to do and we don't know what these people are doing they've lied to us we have no idea um if they're going to be putting these things in there if it's trying to inoculate us through the food there certainly something they've spoken about trying to make GMO plants and vegetables that actually produce sort of mRNA sort of uh things in it and uh so who knows who knows what the hell this stuff is so yes I mean it's definitely a concern because we don't know what the hell they're doing we don't know why they're doing it and we don't know what the consequences will be because we've never done it right if you have something new you can't just experiment on the world that that's what the Geneva Convention is about you don't get to do that so until you know what this does in long-term studies you don't just get to roll this out to the public that is that's a human rights violation and it's strictly against the Geneva Convention uh so yes those would be my concerns on that we have no idea what the hell this is going to do could be fine could be a miracle to to Modern civilization but we don't know that and so unless you test that in in appropriate ways not just testing it on the public and and destroying people's lives potentially uh you can't do that you can't say that and so you can't trust it definitely can't okay uh Victoria Scott thank you for the super chat um I'm not seeing a question let me see if it's down here more I'm not H not seeing one okay um well if it if it comes up um I'll try and catch it but thank you in any case Damen Williams thank you for the super chat um Daman says thank you for your amazing content um you've helped me to refine my carnivore lifestyle my example and your videos uh have inspired my older brother and he is now turning heal around so thank you that's really great to hear I'm really thank you very much for for that and thank you very much for sharing that um that's amazing I really appreciate that I'm really I'm really glad that my videos have helped it's sort of funny to think that my videos help anybody um it's just you know there's things that I think about and things I've come across and things I've found to be useful in my life and in in the life and health of my patients and my family and I think it's important that people know about these things and uh and and have the tools available to them to be healthy and not just sit around in misery and just you know get put on more and more medications and have have worse and worse outcomes I just I just you know obviously we're going in the wrong direction that way so something has to change and I'm really glad that people have been able to find this and and be brave enough to give it a try you know you see these people going oh this is this is garbage and all that sort of stuff and they're saying all these things they never tried it they have no idea you know they're they're too close-minded to actually look at the evidence with an open mind and actually think about things they have a discussion they just they just want you to be wrong because people like being right you know they like feeling like an authority you know if they don't have much power and control in their in their own life they feel a bit you know um you know battered around and and they don't feel like they have a lot of control over things in their life or a lot of authority in their life you know they see something like this and go oh that's it's calories in calories out oh plants you have to do that everyone knows this now they're in authority on something and now they get to tell you for sure and it's um you know it's it's um it's understandable it's it's just part of human nature but it it closes them off to something that could actually really help them and and it's sad it's sad to see that I don't get mad at them you know unless someone's like you know overtly rude to someone you know then then that pisses me off but then I'll say something about it but you know if people are just close-minded it's I actually just feel bad for them that they're not they're not willing to try something new and think about something in a different way they could potentially they will not there's no potential about it they will completely dramatically change their lives and their healths in a revolutionary sort of ways so thank you Damen for for that thank you for trying this out thank you for sharing this with your brother and and helping him as well you understand your Ripple effects of every single one of you is is so much more broad than you realize um you know I only have the reach that I have because you all have influence people around you and you've sent these videos to other people and you've talked to them about it and you've tried it yourself and you've had a great results with it and other people have seen that say what are you doing again what's that about you know and and um you know can you send me some resources on it that's the only reason that I have the reach that I have is because you all have influenced have been brave enough to try this yourself and that has influenced people around you to try for themselves that's the only reason this is not me doing I'm not doing anything you know you all are doing this it's your reach that's having an effect and so thank you all for doing that and being brave enough to try this and to to be that example for people in your family and in your in your spheres to uh to just give it be that Beacon of HK and say whoa Dave is looking great what what the hell happened Dave you lost like 100 pounds it's like yeah just been doing this meat diet isn't that crazy I feel great off all my blood pressure medications not diabetic anymore I'm going to the gym and everything's great in my life you know and so you know people see that and they they want that for themselves and so you know uh thank you all for being open-minded most people in here have come from like a vegan vegetarian background and they've been sick and they've been unwell and they've s like okay this isn't working what the hell else is going on the intentions are there you know the good intentions are there you want the right thing for your yourself and your family for the planet for the animals all these things we're all on the same page about um but then you realize like okay you know doing it with a vegan diet actually that doesn't actually help me or the planet or the animals as much as I thought it did Um this can do it better so you know please you know if anybody else has had you know similar experiences please write down in the comments you know let us know what sort of issues you helped you know do you were you coming from a vegan background or a vegetarian background or a plant-based background or a sad background most people say the only benefits that people get from carnivore is because they go from a standard processed food diet and they cut out the processed food and they go meat based which is just projection like that's the only benefit you get from going vegan is if you cut out the processed food it's not cutting out the meat that doesn't give any benefits to anybody ever at any time um it's cutting out the other garbage and they have that honeymoon period where they feel a bit better and they cut out alcohol and cigarettes and sugar and all that sort of stuff and they think oh got rid of meat and I'm feeling great no you got rid of crap and then you're feeling great unfortunately you threw the baby out with the bath water so please leave a comment if that was you you know see what you come you know where you came from um you know they say like oh only people coming from a standard process through down I'm like no that's not it there's people doing vegan vegetarian plant-based diets um or just eating like a like a healthy clean omnivorous diet and they cut out the plants and it just revolutionizes their health and uh that happened for me that's happened for my family that's happened for my patients and that's happening for hundreds of thousands of people millions of people around the world now so please uh let us know in the comments you know were you were you um from the standard food diet or were you from a PL based di where did you come from because I think a lot of this is uh people coming from uh healthy diets um or that they thought were healthy diets and um did as hard as they could you know did everything they could to be healthy and then you know they weren't they weren't as healthy as they could be they did they went to a meat-based diet animal-based diet carnivore diet and they became healthy then so you know do let people know and let everyone else know like hey it's not just cutting out processed foods that's that's the benef it's just it's just going to meat and cutting out everything else all these other things can cause harm it's not just processed foods and processed foods are plants anyway they're all processed plant Foods you know and uh and always remember that the most rigorously study diet on Earth with the highest levels of evidence with randomized control trials with Interventional trials in both humans and animals is the key to genic diet ketogenic diet is just cutting out carbs what do you replace carbs with you replace it with fat and protein but where you could do that on vegetarian diet but they don't it's almost next to impossible to do that safely and effectively and so they don't the ketogenic diet uh in these studies that they St that they test is replacing carbs with meat with animal fat with animal protein so it's a meat-based diet so anyone says oh there's no evidence for this carnivore diet it's the most rigorously studied diet on Earth and it's been shown to be the most effective and healthy diet on Earth be Dash do head to head and had for specific medical outcomes like diabetes Alzheimer's um autoimmunity and many others this shows significant clinical benefit in humans when they go on to a high fat animal based diet with a side salad maybe if they want it it's a carnivore diet light carnivore with a side salad but it's a ketogenic carnivore diet with some veggies if you want them which I don't and I I think you do better without them so the most rigorously studied diet the most beneficial diet ever studied in the literature is a whole food high fat animal-based diet that's what's in the literature don't ever forget that and don't let people uh try to say like oh there's no there's no high level studies first of all there's no high level studies for a plant-based diet second of all the only diet that has thousands of high level studies is the animal-based ketogenic diet always remember that don't give people an inch on that because it's garbage Jim coffee uh Jim coffee the second thank you very much for the Super Chat hey Doc as a carnivore mindful of calorie intake I'm considering whey protein powder to balance protein without excess calories your insights oh I wouldn't worry about that you know again calories don't weigh anything right so uh you want you're worried about grams so you want to bring in less grams right you want the same calories less grams um you have two glasses of water one is hot one is cold cold one has less calories than the hot one does that weigh less than the hot one no they weigh exactly the same for the exact same amount of milliliters of water because you know grams have weight calories don't have weight so again it's calories per gram it's actually grams per calories you get one gram per nine calories of fat or you get three grams per 9 calories for protein for getting energy from protein and the vast majority of of the protein that you're eating is going to be used for your for you know to make molecules in your body anyway so that's not being used as energy so um I I wouldn't use whey protein powder I mean it's it's sort of a I mean you want Whole Foods right so just try to eat naturally try to eat meat um and if you really wanted to eat leaner meat you could but you're G to eat more of it because your body does need energy and and to get the same amount of calories you're going to need to eat three times as much lean meat as you know fat right so um I would just focus on uh fatty meat you will actually eat less and you'll actually lose more weight um in that regard and so if you have the same amount of calories if you're getting more of those calories from fat you'll bring in less grams and grams are what way something calories don't um there a comment from the real deal says um so much appreciate how much I've learned uh from you over the last 20 months uh Anthony chaffy um MD and you continue to be a veritable Fountain of of valuable information thank you well thank you that's very kind of you to say um SEL cat thank you for the Super Chat serious question what does carnivore diet why does carnivore make by JJ have a weird smell how can it be remedied I don't know um I don't know that it does I don't know that that's that's what's causing that could just be coincidental um but you know the thing is too is that you know when you're eating different differently your body can have swap out sort of the microbiome of oral biome is going to change your colonic microbiome and your lower intestin is going to change and that can also affect the biome in your V JJ potentially so um possibly something to do with that um but I'm not too sure that's that's definitely a new one so um think about other reasons why that could be could be the case um and um you know if you are concerned about it as well you know do see your OBGYN to to see if there's there's something else going on but I don't I don't think that it's going to that doing a carnivore diet will harm you in any way from a from a biome own point of view or any other point of view and so I would expect it to just help maybe there's just a bit of a balancing act your body's doing at the moment and that's causing hormones to change a bit I mean that does happen I mean you're going to have you can have disruptions in your cycle as well um Sometimes women have irregular cycles for um a few months uh after starting a carnivore diet and then it sort of stabilizes off about four five months um and that's just your hormones are just sort of getting into balance and uh so that can change things around that can that can actually change um the the smell of uh everything as well so maybe that's it too that should if that's what's happening then that'll stabilize on its own that'll sort of sort itself out and um you know any concerns then you know just see your OB and or yeah chologist really and see um you know see if they have any reason to suspect there's something going on and if they think yeah no look it's fine and I just give it time and and Hope it just sorts itself out uh rjg thank you very much for the Super Chat uh A1C is 8.5 as of three weeks ago carnivore for three weeks now um have noticed my blood glucose drops significantly after I eat but if I fast it stays high should I start eating breakfast to drop my glucose faster in the morning hm that's interesting you know um actually it's it's sometimes it's the opposite sometimes people will have a bit of a bump in their blood sugar um after they eat um it's you know not a not a major one but but a slight one um are you taking any insulin with your meals because obviously if you're taking insulin with meals that's going to drop that as well um so think about that also um don't just eat just so you can take more insulin um and think about you know what medications you're on for your for your blood sugar and your diabetes and remember that at some point you're going to need to start weaning off of these things so you need to work with your uh Diabetes Care team uh to safely do that and come down so you're not getting too low but see how you go you know if all all else being equal if you're just eating you're not taking medication and that's just your blood sugar is dropping a bit sure if that's if that makes you feel better if that makes you feel good and that's giving you better result you can try it out I mean I I I still think you just eat fatty meat until it's stops tasting good you do that as many times as your body requires you during the day and I think you just go with that I think that's the main thing um is is doing that if if you're having a remarkable difference in your blood sugar then maybe it's worth doing that but you're also trying to lay down a pattern of behavior so that you can do this ongoing and you can do this for a long time and um and so um you know if you do that um what was I going to say if you if you if you sort of eat in this pattern of just eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good and as many times your body is asking you for then you get into that pattern ongoing and then when you sort of revers your diabetes and all these other sorts of issues and you're out of stable weight you're still used to um doing that you're still used to eating in a specific pattern and and that's going to be that healthy pattern long term but see how you go if it's making like really dramatic difference and it's not medication related sure you know see see how that affects you and and go from there but yeah good luck it's already you know it's great to see that you're you're already getting a better uh blood sugar control even with um you know only three weeks in so that's really good um just looking at the time here everyone probably need to um stop the super chats I only have about 50 minutes left and we've got a number of Super chats left so uh let's probably just cut those there um if people can um uh yeah probably we'll just try to get through all the rest of the super chats because there's actually a number of them and um and uh maybe just leave it there and um and I'll try to get to all of these uh as best I can and um and uh if I don't get any any of these I'll I'll try to get on the next one but I'll I should be able to I should be able to get to all of them but I'll I will need to leave at some point because I have patience this afternoon um John Kinsley um actually might hold on I'm going to I'm going to pause real quick just to let the little boy out of the room he's he's he's being patient one second okay oh a sh uh so John Kinsley thank you for the super chat um John says my mom was recently diagnosed with diverticulitis her doctor said avoid red meat and eat lots of fiber including taking medam daily could you please explain if that information is incorrect I I certainly disagree with it anyway um and um you know I I've spoken to you know coloral surgeons who are just like yeah absolutely not that's not what you should do for people um and uh and a lot of colorr Surgeons that are now carnivore and recommending carnivore to their patients and um and for all the reasons that we we discuss um red meat does not cause diverticulitis it does not cause diverticulosis it does not cause any health issue or ramification in your entire body at any point any time for anybody anywhere um dtis is is a infection of of uh damaged colon they have these outpouchings called diverticula um and that's called diverticulosis and then when that that's a sort of weaken stretch tissue and that's easier to get a bit of a tear and that can get infected and that gets diverticulitis which can be very dangerous what happens what happens when you when you get diverticulitis um exactly the opposite I have never actually heard a coloral surgeon say that when you have diverticulitis you should eat more fiber in fact they say the exact opposite they say go on a on a low residue or or no residue diet right residue being fiber residue being things that you have to pass through your bowels because you can't absorb it because it's useless and you shouldn't have eaten it in the first place like if you swallowed you know like a toy figurine that's just going to come out right well why because it's not food right and so your body doesn't want it doesn't need it and it has to pass it out right H that's the same with fiber fiber is useless to your body in fact and it can cause harm there were studies there was a study with over 2,000 patients they did uh um colonoscopies for and they found and they looked at all sorts of different metrics and they found the only associations uh with developing diverticulosis was more fiber in the diet and more bowel motions um like more than 15 a week on average right so just over two a day on average um that's the only thing that they found constipation was not a factor meat was not a factor fat was not a factor none of those things were factors just fiber and increased bowel motions you're overworking the organ you're going into organ failure you're going into colon failure you overwork your heart you get heart failure gets baggy and and worn out and it doesn't work as well now you get that with your colon as well so that's the problem all right um so no I I completely disagree with that and in fact uh for diverticulitis for for an acute presentation of that that actually is that is strictly contraindicated of having a high fiber diet that's exactly what you don't do when patients come into the hospital with diverticulitis they say Don't eat fiber you eat a low fiber diet so uh no and then they and then they you know get better and they go home and they say okay now get back to a high fiber diet like okay but avoid nuts and seeds and all these things that can get stuck in the diverticula and maybe tear them and all that sort of stuff so it's just it's just you have this counter um you know these count these messages going counter to each other but I have never heard someone say that they should eat more fiber when they have diverticulitis actively I've never heard that and so no that's wrong and that's that's strictly against the um even the conventional uh guidelines for dealing with diverticulitis and um and I would certainly say um trying to avoid diverticulite is you want to follow the same same rules of don't eat any fiber because it's just going to make things worse and we're designed to eat meat red meat does not cause any problems certainly not in your bowel um so no the doctor's U full of crap Mike m thank you for the Super Chat being carnivore for and blood stun hb1c 5.1 LDL 7.6 HDL 1.5 triglycerides 0.9 fasting insulin three fantastic why would my insulin be so low and is it healthy thanks for all you do your insulin is low because you you don't require anymore as your body's making the amount that your body requires fting insulin of three is fantastic um there's different ranges that people would would talk about but um you know speaking to to to um Casey means Dr Casey means um who I had on my podcast um uh she has a company called levels where they they try to address metabolic Health her her brother is CI means who's uh been made a lot of headlines recently because he's he's been a whistleblower for the um you know food big food and big Pharma companies showing that like these guys know that they're causing harm they know they're hurting people and um and they are are happy because they're profiting from it and he said you know paraphrasing but he said he said I know they know this because I've been in the boardroom meetings with them when they said it right so um she has a company where they're just looking at insulin fasting insulin and and blood sugar and cgms and all that sort of stuff uh called levels and people can check out that that interview that we did she's very interesting bright lady and um and she was saying that the range they use as optimal as I think something like 2 to six or 2 to s or something like that mine is like 3.5 you know so no you're you're you're fine you know that's where that's what your body wants there's going to be fluctuation that's fasting insulin so you eat protein or you eat a big meal that insulin is going to come up a bit you know because you know is protein is insulinogenic to to a degree it's not massive but to a degree it does because you know you want a bit of insulin to force that that protein into cells or or help transport it into cells uh so no I think that's perfectly fine I think all your numbers are absolutely fantastic um and uh yeah I mean your HDL is nice and high triglycerides are nice and low LDL higher LDL is associated with with longevity so you know all those things are all all winners from what I can see and I should say as well um there was a study out of Sweden last year with 44,000 patients that um participants looking at blood results and looking at at blood markers to say what would what were the best biomarkers blood markers that people could use to predict um predict living over 100 or or increase your chances of living over 100 in longevity and I found the two best biomarkers were um low fasting insulin and high total cholesterol so you're right there so I think you're doing you're doing really well from a Health and Longevity point of view just from those two markers anyway anyway s gooligan uh 90 thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Anthony do you think mainstream nutritionists and scientists will one day advocate for a carnivore diet and why I do because a lot of them are coming around to that because that's what the evidence shows and suggests and recommends um the nutritionist now the curriculum is a plant-based Dogma based on the work of the Seventh Day Adventist Church who still control the curriculum they founded the curriculum they founded the nutritional sciences and nutritional um Academia and um the a the American nutritional dietetics Association was founded by the Seventh Day Advent church member Lena Cooper so um it's just a matter of un undoing that crap but you know more and more nutritionists are graduating with a degree in nutrition from an Ivy League school and they're doing exactly what they're told to do from their their uh classes they should be perfect health perfect nutrition and they're not and they're sick and they're fat and they're dying you know some of some people like um Sally Norton she has a degree in nutrition from Cornell and uh she was plant-based vegetarian vegan because that's what she was taught and she was doing all of that and she nearly died from the oxalates and plant toxins that were in the food that she was eating and she was like can't do that so she's come around she's nearly all carnivore um and um uh you know Dr Sarah zivar she has a PHD in nutrition and she was doing everything exactly the way that she was taught to do it and she was not healthy and she was getting worse and she started going like well hang on a second I'm doing everything right and things aren't things aren't working right things aren't working the way I told they would so what's going on and she looked into it and found like Yep this was all crap and now she's carnivore right and she's doing a lot better as a result of that and now she's teaching that in her classes uh at University and so um I think it will come around there's more and more people coming around to this more and more nutritionists dietitians are coming around to this more and more PhD students and PhD candidates are coming to this and they're doing their research in the carnivore diet and in the meat-based diets and animal-based diets and so I think it absolutely will come around because the truth will out and this these are facts so humans are carnivores it's just the kind of animal we are and no animal is going to do better eating a alternate diet than the one that they are biologically adapted for by definition right right so that goes for us as well and so you know you don't need a study to tell you what an animal eats you just go out in the wild and you look at what they eat right and you give them something else and they get sick it's not that hard right um you do that with humans what do you do you go out with the innuit they're just eating meat okay historically what do we eat before the well we know we know what people were eating up until the Agricultural Revolution and then beyond right and so we have clear records of this and we have clear records in the stable isotope studies and and um and uh just the historical record and then prehistorical fossil record you know we have clear evidence there too so it's it's not it's not unclear what humans have been eating since we've been humans and how we've changed over the over the Millennia and how massively that's that's damaged our health and development our brains have shrank by 11% for men 177% for women overnight it didn't take hundreds of years or thousands of years it was night and day pre- agriculture post agriculture bam and that's persisted until today but happened in all the different places that they independently went to agriculture they shrank by 5 six inches the brains got smaller their teeth got crooked and crowded they had a whole bunch of of health issues and abnormalities to and signs of chronic disease to the skeletons and so that happened independently everywhere you look in the fossil record or in the anthropological record when happened more recently like with the Native Americans and native Australians when they got converted over to a more Western plant-based diet because they were forced to um stop eating their their traditional food either by wiping out the bison or being torn off their land here in Australia and and forced into British schools and and go and and become involved in British Society you know like that's that that completely damaged um entire generations of people and we see clear disparities you know between the before and after right so this is it's not hard we know what we're supposed to eat we don't you don't need a damn nutritional St study or scientist for this and people are seeing that and so nutritionist are seeing that and nutrition students are seeing that and going like because they want to know actual nutrition they don't want to be like oh I want to be indoctrinated I want to do what they're doing no they want to know nutrition they want to know what's right for human body to eat they want to know how to to help resolve health issues with nutritional methods and interventions they don't they don't want to just you know have a degree you you know most people don't they want to actually know what the hell is going on and so that's why they're doing this and when you see this for yourself you're like yep that's not it and so it is turning and when we we uncover why this has been um kept from us for so long I think it pisses people off certainly pisses me off and so that's we just need to get that out there that you know we've been duped you we've been had for these religious ideological reasons and and those those reasons have not left you know it's not just this was pushed out in the 1800s and now it's just sort of self-perpetuating no they are still actively trying to push a vegan ideology on the world because of their own religious ideology and that's not to say anything about the individuals in the 7day Adventist Church I know a lot of Seventh Day Adventist Church members they're lovely people they're just normal people right it's the the the powers that be that are in charge that are pushing this Doctrine um because that's their whole tenants was was their their self-identity was about um you know getting getting rid of meat and things like that and they push on the Blue Zone studies I mean they paid for that Dan Butner is a Seventh Day Adventist Church member and then he sold the rights to the blue zones to the seventhday Adventist Church for like $70 million right this is this is a scam and uh and people are coming around to this and that includes nutrition students and and current nutritionists um who are in charge of doing the research and in char of teaching the next generation of of nutrition students so uh yes I do think it will will come around it already is Andrew thank you for the Super Chat carnivore for three months over the past three days I've had six migraines uh mostly Aura very little headache follows uh seems to be triggered by screens any ideas um you know avoid screens obviously that's that's a low hanging fruit um be as as strict as you possibly can be with the carnivore diet it's not going to cure all migraines for everybody but there's hundred years of data and literature on ketogenic carnivore diets right because a ketogenic diet is basically very close to a carnivore diet it's a meat-based high fat animal fat diet uh with no carbs and you know vegetables if you want to but why would you want to I don't know and so you know they they help and I find that people people are more helped by getting rid of the the vegetables as well so you're you can still get triggers there there can be other triggers for migraines sunlight screens other sorts of things that can trigger them so you just try to avoid all your triggers so you've already removed a lot of triggers from your food that's great um you know if you're having coffee things like that get rid of that crap because that that's a major trigger for migraines as well dehydration is a major trigger for migraines it's actually the most common cause of headaches of any description is dehydration so make sure you're getting enough water make sure you're eating enough make sure you're eating enough fat you want High ketones uh because that can help suppress uh headaches and migraines in particular and epilepsy as well and um and then the screens just get get the hell away from the screens you know maybe blue blocking glasses will help uh with that or blue filter on your phone or screens maybe that can help as well but if they're triggering migraines just avoid you know maybe that that forces you to to go back to reading books and actually becoming intelligent again and getting off these damn social media things and and just surfing all day and doing that nonsense you know because that that's just like the bane of my life right now I haven't you know been able to get get off these things because I'm just you know it's just part of my work I have to answer a bunch of messages and put post up and things like that but then you get sucked into that and then you're just you're just so you I have to do something I have to do something so always on there look I always have messages to answer and things like that but um you know just get away from that you know you don't want to be on there anyway and so if you can get away from screens your brain will be better for it you'll be better for it your hormones will be better for it your health will be better for it it sounds like your migraines will be better for it too so maybe just take that as a sign to you know just get back to living like humans are supposed to live and getting away from all these screens and stuff hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own questions please please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest of the Q&A Dylan Verrett thank you for the Super Chat uh I have two patches of eczema on my hips and um that singly will not go away or seemingly I'm I'm assuming will not go away did strip carnivore for two months with no improvements any thoughts um we'll keep going um you want to be um um um you know keep going with it be very strict just red meat and water you need to be very strict uh red meat and water nothing else no coffee tea sweeters Dairy eggs anything like that with autoimmune issues or rashes or the eczemas and psoriasis all these sorts of things are very sensitive and so you need to be as strict as you can also um something that's interesting that I've that I've spoken to a number of people about when they have real um uh you know sort of trouble eczema or psoriasis is uh using Tallow beef Tallow as a moisturizer and just rubbing that into your skin best moisturiser you'll ever find in your entire life it's absolutely fantastic and uh and your skin will just be glowing as a result of that so uh try that and put that on the eczema put that on your body and and uh just red meat and water only nothing nothing nothing else and hopefully it clears up sometimes it gets it's it can be very stubborn and it can take a while sometimes you're you're losing fat you can be releasing toxins from your fat that can exacerbate the eczema or cause other sorts of weird rashes call like a keto rash all that sort of stuff just from losing fat and releasing fat um toxins so um you know try all those things and hopefully that clears up it does for most people sometimes they have a bit more stubborn case so just keep that in mind Laura Smith thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy I'm 68-y old female 5 fo 300 PBS I feel great but I look too thin keto for seven months uh would like to gain a little weight what are your recommendations uh just just eat a lot eat a lot of meat you got to eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and uh try to do some uh resistance exercises if you can try to do um sprinting if you can I don't know um if what your your physical uh status is but if you're able to sort of get out and walk do that if you're able to run try to skip straight to sprinting obviously only if it's safe for you uh what you can also do is you can go on like an exercise bike like a stationary bicycle and you can do sprints on there and um uh and that can do the same thing you're just going hard as you can for as long as you can and you just wear yourself out if you can go longer than 30 30 40 seconds maybe not working as hard as you could and you just really try to wear yourself out and um catch your breath do it again try that 10 times twice a week you'll you'll stimulate a lot of u a lot of healthy changes in your body as well as muscle growth try resistance training either body weight exercises or resistance bands or or weights or whatever that's suitable for you going to failure you know that's how you're going to stimulate muscle growth and then you eat you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you eat twice a day to see uh to make sure you're satisfying your body's ability or your body's demand for uh nutrition and putting on muscle and you you'll put on weight but you want to put on healthy weight you want to put on fat then eat carbs if you want to put on healthy weight then you just eat enough meat very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet I can't stress that enough and so you need to make sure you're getting enough just keep going until it stops tasting good do it twice a day at the very least and more if your body needs it tkm uh 7211 thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffie what is your opinion on some chicken liver pate or fua gr from time to time I can't stomach beef liver thanks yeah liver you know any any sort of liver is fine you know the Pates are going to have a whole bunch of other stuff added in if you're Mak your own pate and you only put in salt and things like that go for it I I tend to avoid  because it's just pretty cruel the way they um uh you know feed the the Ducks and the geese you know tube down their throat you know it's really uncomfortable and you're just dumping grains down them um and and you know it's it's not necessarily all the healthy fats it it um it's fatty liver causes fatty liver and then we're wondering what causes fatty liers in humans like maybe the same damn thing um it would be a guess would be a good guess and um uh so yeah definitely you can have liver from from other animals that's not a problem um and so yeah chicken liver is perfectly fine Dallas par thank you for the Super Chat uh does the Randall cycle store both energy coming from carbs and or fat if there is too much if so why do you say that excess fat is removed by a number two if there is too much fat so it's not about too much fat in your system it's about more fat than your body can absorb your body's only going to absorb a certain amount of fat so if you eat an excess amount of fat your body's just not going to absorb it but the fat that's in your body in your system is going to get utilized of course it is uh and if you're eating that with carbohydrates yes you're still going to absorb the same amount of fat now you're bringing in carbohydrates which will trigger the Randle cycle which will shut off your cells to more energy and that's going to get stored into fat absolutely but that's not the Fat's fault that's the carbohydrates fault that's the insulin's fault that's the deranging your metabolism and your physiology's fault so it's not the fat so the fat isn't the problem it's the carbs that are the problem as usual uh Preston Meyer thank you for the Super Chat uh hey Doc I'm doing carnivore to get off meds for bipolar um should I abstain from plain Greek yogurt sour cream cheeses pretty much all Dairy I mean I would at least for now and um you anything with carbs obviously you just want to stay away from um you know a bit of green yogurt or something like that you know as a condiment uh sometimes you know maybe but see how they affect you I mean if you're if you're getting rid of of all the carbs you know that's that's the major one and you're going to improve your biochemistry you're going to improve your mitochondria and hopefully improve your bipolar um should do most people do and so um maybe just go clean just just meat and water of of whatever meats you want fatty Meats a lot of fat and you know butter probably fine most people do fine with butter and um do that for a few months see how you feel then add in a bit of Greek yogurt I would never use any of these things as more than a condiment you know you can compulsively eat these things they have ques morphins that will um act on your opiate receptors and and they just they're just a bit addictive they're not much you're not going to get like high off them but um you will uh you you can stimulate your body to to eat more than than your body wants so you know just do that and uh on just a straight up meat and water diet at first and see how you go and um and then uh uh and then you can add some of those things back as a condiment you know just a bit of cheese melted onto meat a bit of sour cream mixed in with some ground beef and uh you know same with the yogurt that sort of thing and see how you go and if it if it is adds something to the flavor and you enjoy it and you're not worried about it and it makes you feel good great and if it makes you feel not as good then you know that's a good piece of information to have but you won't know unless you try it without Todd boo thank you for the Super Chat 10 months carnivore and I just started adding in vegetables I can't believe how awful they taste I used to love them uh yeah 100% I mean that's the thing we get so used to them it's a Stockholm syndrome we're like oh yeah I like these no you don't like them you just like them you you dislike them less and the other vegetables and so you you can stand some of them and then you get them again you're like oh my God what is that but just remember when you were a kid you know most people hated the taste of vegetables when they were a kid I loved broccoli when I was a kid I could not stand it um then as an adult I was like yeah I mean I guess I can have it it was never interesting to me it was never like yeah I was like you're supposed to eat vegetables I guess I can do broccoli I guess I can eat some of this garbage and um hated it as a kid just absolutely hated it and U you know then you get you get away from this stuff and you taste it again you're like yeah there it is you know there's that nasty taste get and there's that that bad taste is is your brain warning you that there are chemicals in there that are harmful know definitely good idea to listen to that so yeah sometimes it's good to to um see that contrast and see what it does to you again just make sure that you're actually actually on the right track um so uh Louis Roy or Louis Roy thank you very much for the Super Chat uh hello two months on a carnivore beef butter bacon and eggs my biggest challenge is constant constipation I need to stay to defeat autoimmunity any suggestions please two suggestions one with autoimmunity it's really best if you just stay on red meat and water so just uh beef l lamb goat venison really beef and lamb is what most people are going to have access to cut out all Dairy even eggs and and bacon pork uh things like that butter is usually fine but stick to the ruminant animals the the red meat sort of animals um constipation means you're not eating enough fat by definition now that's for actual constipation for actual hard dry constipated stools some people think that just because they're going in frequently that's constipation that's not constipation constipation is dry hard constipated schools um and that means you need to eat more fat by definition if you are getting that kind of constipation you have to eat more fat um and because your body has limited capacity to absorb fat then it's a spillover mechanism and that excess fat gets into the stools and uh keeps it soft so U if it's just infrequent uh don't worry about it because you're just you're just uh going less because you have less waste because you're you're eating less uh fiber and garbage like that that your body didn't want in the first place so uh yeah that's what I would do and I would I really just stick to um red meat and water um Leon Flores thank you for the Super Chat I'm not seeing a a question attached um but maybe there's one down the road thank you very much uh Jonathan noers thank you for the Super Chat uh good morning from Rivervale uh thoughts on strict carnivore beef jerky uh salt and beef uh it's allowed me to maintain a healthy size whereas before I couldn't eat as much fresh meat any thoughts nutrient wise uh no it's fine I me know as long as it's clean it doesn't have a bunch of of uh you know whatever soy and sugar and garbage like that um and also you know beef jerky is generally pretty lean so just be just be mindful of that U but you dried beef you it's like it's like a big chunk of meat Shunk down because it takes all the water out so it's actually quite nutrient dense and uh no I don't think you're losing anything from a nutrient standpoint um apart from not getting as much fat and if it has soy and sugar and all that sort of garbage then that's less good as well so that that most that's bad I would I would not eat that uh so yeah but yeah no that that's fine if you want to eat beef jerky make sure you're getting enough fat too though um Mitch thank you for the Super Chat I have a friend who tried carnivore and his gout flared up does gout get better sticks with it yeah generally so um some people find that they might have a a a flare up or two of gout uh after they go carnivore and it tends to to go away after that so just stick with it um remember that there's five different causes of gout not all of them are uric acid crystals right only one of them is and so it could be it could be something else you know people get oxalates are actually a cause of gout or it's now called pseudo gout um but it used to be called gout it used to be five causes of gout now it's one cause of gout uric acid and then there's other ones are pseudo gout it's all gout and um oxalates are one of them and so if you're get oxalate dumping and things like that you know potentially you can get like a flare up like that um you I was talking to someone too there was like oh they were getting their gout and they were getting kidney stones all I was like that's not gout like that's oxalates you know they're getting kidney stones they like calcium oxalate stones and they're getting calcium oxalates in their joints you know and uh and that that goes away If you're sort of persistently having problems you can look into Sally Norton's work and see about um going on a protocol very low amounts of oxalates you know like 50 milligrams a day and that can Slow Down The Dumping if there's like sort of big problems with that but uh no in general people uh have a maybe a flare up or two and then it goes away and stays away and they may not even get a flare up but you know if you do it's usually limited Chase thank you for the Super Chat can being on beef only diet cause hair loss also are there any micronutrients missing that are worth mentioning uh no there's no micronutrients missing from meat you get everything you need in the proportion that you need it um if you're eating good quality meat now the meat that we're eating it's not necessarily pasturas or it's not wild game or anything like that where it's not eating what it's supposed to eat so it's not going to necessar have the same micronutrient profile that it would have if it if it were and so keep that in mind if that's the case and you you want to add in a bit more nutrients you add in a bit of liver kidney and heart it doesn't need to be much they're very nutrient dense but you add some of those in and that that that will sort you out um as far as hair loss is concerned no beef only diet won't cause hair loss um but unless you're not eating enough you're not eating enough protein if you're basically starving yourself um but you know fasting studies when people have gotten hair loss um eating at least 100 grams of protein and really nothing else that has stopped those side effects like hair loss so if you're eating enough eating enough meat eating enough fat um no you're not you're not going to get it from eating meat now maybe you have a thyroid issue maybe you have some other sort of issue that can cause hair loss check that out make sure that that's not the problem if th those aren't the case then then no um but what it can do uh any sort of ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet uh can trigger a Fallout phase of your hair so you can get some hair falling out early on but then it grows back and it tends to grow back thicker women uh this becomes much more uh noticeable because they have longer hair so it's much more noticeable when that's coming out and then it takes a lot longer to fill back in because it's has to grow has take years to grow back and so you know you're just seeing but but look for little buds of hair and smaller hair that that's what people normally do see is that they'll have some hair fall out now maybe your low on fola or B12 or something like that so check that and if you are have some liver add in liver couple times a week two three times a week chicken livers are fine and so you know do that make sure that you're getting enough of these nutrients and if you are then don't worry about it it'll grow back and it tends to grow back thicker uh from for most everybody Carly a thank you very much for the Super Chat hi doc how do you feel about using castor oil to moisturize and using essential oils I'm 65 years old mostly carnivore female I drink mushroom coffee um well probably have more of a problem with the mushroom coffee than the than the the castor oil but I would I would probably avoid the castor oil and essential oils as well basically don't put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat because most of that's going to soak in and be in your bloodstream in 20 minutes anyway so those essential oils that can get into your body they can actually become hormonal um disruptors endocrine disruptors and screw with your hormones and so you really don't want those you don't want those scent candles and air fresheners that can actually mess with your hormones it's Absol absolutely crazy um and so putting that on your skin can certainly do that a lot of these scents and and fragrances and things like that that we use can absolutely disrupt and screw up our our hormonal health so I would I would actually avoid that the best uh things to put on your skin are animal fats so Tallow emu oil things like that ostrich oil you can get these things um very readily you can make it yourself you can you know use uh you know Tallow or lard or whatever that you just buy you know my I have a a partnership with um with uh um Stone and spear Tallow and they make tons of of Tallow products with with no you can get them with scent you get them without scents I get them with without scents and and Tallow soap as well that's what I I I really much prefer it doesn't dry out your skin as much you know it doesn't get it all just horrible dry and nasty um it's much nicer on your skin um and I prefer it and so you know you can get those sorts of things but just just animal fats in general are going to be much better you want to get them without the essential oils and the and the scents and things like that Stephen uh hadhazi thank you for the Super Chat when you consume excess fat and your body expels the Surplus does it also expel other essential nutrients like protein or even medications you may have ingested alongside your meal no you shouldn't it shouldn't um you know take you know the good with the with the excess um it's just a matter you're just eating this and you're and there's all this stuff in your small intestine bile will emulsify the broken down fat and it will absorb that when you run out of bile then you just have free floating fat U that um you know isn't going to isn't going to be able to be absorbed but it's not it's not going to draw out and pull out other things that stop you from absor absorbing them like fiber does fiber does that so fiber can um you know prevent the absorption of up to 30% of the food that you eat right so you know that's obviously another another strike against fiber uh but no fat fat won't do that um let me see here so sorry just just going to read this here okay so um so Harry W thank you very much for the super chat um have a have a mate's body seems to go through cycles of not wanting meat uh can't stand the smell or keep it down uh for a month or so uh has to revert to a veg diet um until her body says give me meat what could be going on or the remedy could be that her body just telling her to fast um you know sometimes when your body's telling you don't eat meat it's not telling you not to eat meat it's telling you not to eat because your body is designed to eat meat supposed to eat meat um and so if it's telling you not to eat meat it's basically telling you not to eat so you don't have to eat just for the sake of eating unless you're like very emaciated there might be something else medical going on but that's very very uncommon um so uh what I would do is if for body selling or like you know don't eat meat just don't eat you know you know fast for a day or two you know or whatever it takes and then you meat's going to taste good again it's going to smell good again um sometimes in pregnancy that happens as well people have meat aversions and um you know I've sort of been of that opinion that it's probably just your body telling you to fast and just not eat anything I've spoken to a number of other doctors and OBGYNs who use carnivore diet for their their pregnant patients and and to help people um become fertile and get pregnant in the first place and they say the same thing you know like Dr Kilz said the same thing that's just your body telling you to fast and you just you need to stop eating anything it generally last a couple days and then it goes back so um that's that's what I would try is just you know try not eating anything just try fasting uh for a day or two until her body wants it you know I've done that where when I was my body was losing weight where I had fat to lose and I started you meeting I was like oh my God no I don't want this like why wouldn't I want this I love steak um because my body didn't want it I didn't need the I didn't need the nutrients I was good and so that's proba that's usually what happens and so um that sounds like a pretty extreme case but I would bet it's the same um result is that if if she just stops eating all together the next day it'll probably taste fine or maybe takes another day or something like that eventually it's going to taste fantastic and um but I wouldn't eat poison until it does so comment from DS 111 um doctor months ago you asked or I asked if carnivore would benefit my 86-year-old uh dad with his unmedicated curosis condition you said yes that meat is nutrient-dense um and goes on to say and it has helped his liver function increase that's fantastic I'm really happy to hear that um you know curosis is one of those things where it's a permanent scar ing you can't undo that scarring but there's still parts of the liver that function hopefully because you're not in complete liver failure and need a liver transplant so um those parts that are still working hopefully can can get back to normal working order and and uh and recover and then you know take up the slack for the part that has has been uh has died off so really glad to hear that uh it's great job and hopefully he's found a lot of other benefits from from that as well good stuff thank you for sharing and any other any other sort of success stories that people have please you know share Down Below in the comments because it's always great for people to see this when they're thinking about like what do I do and uh they see like oh that's the problem I have and that's helped 30 people here so yeah I'm that's that's something that's very helpful for people Nick Jennings thank you for the Super Chat keep spreading the news of this life saving tool I'm one year in and down 206 lbs holy good wow that's great um was 430 lb now 224 pounds diabetes is gone and sertic arthritis is non-existent among many other changes thank you that's fantastic Nick that's really great to hear amazing job I mean you've lost you've lost a whole people you've lost an entire Nick Jennings and that is that's amazing so you know that that that's got to be amazing feeling getting off of all those meds and getting away from those these diseases and getting all that excess weight off uh really really well done I hope you just really enjoy uh you know just being happy healthy and um and and able to be more active and that's fantastic thank you so much for sharing that I hope that um other people are inspired by that I'm sure they will be Bree Miss Ireland thank you very much for the Super Chat it's difficult sticking to carnivore I'm a sweet lover how can I cut sugar cravings especially late at night when I want a bowl of cereal thanks need to eat more so eat more fatty meat um and a lot more fat as well you know that's how you get rid of those Cravings uh sometimes Cravings can just be something as simple as your your brain wants more energy and so it's telling you to get energy and and one of the only ways it knows is is to get carbs um also that addiction is an addiction and So eventually you can break that addiction but it's um you know it's it takes some time usually about two weeks and so you just eat a lot of fatty meat until you have less and less Cravings if you ever have a craving yeah telling your body's telling you eat something eat but eat meat eat fat um animal fat and and that should help with the cravings and you know drink plenty of water and eat plenty of fatty meat and after about two weeks they should be gone but e just doing that will will suppress them significantly and uh and you won't have as bad of cravings and yeah you get Cravings late at night eat meat and that should hopefully uh take care of it at least to get get to bed and not have to not have to eat some cereal in the middle of the night like Kellogg's seemingly wants us to do the CEO of Kellogg saying oh yeah you know we we we care about people and their plight so you know in this hard economic time so you know you can just eat cereal for dinner like oh yeah it's great like you get the hell out of here yeah like you give a about people in their plight you just want to sell more goddamn cereal and um and it's this stuff is poison and you know it's poison you know it's making them sick and uh and you don't care because you just you profit from all of that you can just tell he's just had this little you know snarky cocky grin on his face oh yeah we just eat cereal you know he's just at a face you want to punch you know and it's like um you know so yeah don't listen to that garbage garbage monsters and just eat meat be happy be healthy and then you get out of the clutches of these these you know demon Bond villains low carb low drama thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat that's very kind of you hi Dr jaffy um is there more El tript toan in grass-fed meat than grain-fed meat to help with sleep I appreciate your passion and generosity in uh sharing your nutritional info uh to help improve People's Health all power to you um that's that's a very good question I believe I believe that is the case but I'm actually not sure unfortunately I wish I had a clear answer for you um but [Music] um um I'm not too sure I'm I'm not I'm not 100% sure but I I do think so because tryptophan is a bit is a bit uncommon in general and so you know the it would it would um make sense that it's going to be in more high quality meets but unfortunately I actually don't know and I feel really bad because you did such a big super chat and I don't actually have uh the answer for you but I'll I'll see if I can look it up and report back but um it might be possible to look up you look up tryp toan levels in um you know USDA beef they should have tryp toan levels on USDA should have that on their average things and then you look up grass finished grass bed finished regeneratively raised sometimes there not there aren't there aren't many resources on that sometimes it's individual Ranchers have published their own data for their their meet um and it's not necessarily like a whole big database that that that it would be up on so that might be the best way to look I'll see if I can find it if I do I'll I'll try and chime it in sometime and hopefully hopefully you see it um and you know but that that that's a place that you could Google around and try to find as well Jennifer Ray thank you very much for the Super Chat I started uh beef butter baking in eggs two weeks ago and my lips are extremely dry I'm drinking enough water but I feel dehydrated if you feel dehydrated you're probably not um hydrated uh so you know thing is is that we can we can drink a lot of water and still not have adequate amount you know again when you're when you're changing your diet like this you're changing to a ketogenic diet you might be losing a bit more electrolytes early on that'll bring water with it you might need a bit more water if you're taking a whole bunch of electrolytes you'll you'll need more water actually you you increase your body's demand for more water and so uh if you feel dehydrated drink more water eat more fat fat is very good for your skin Health sometimes we'll have dry skin it's not it's healthy they're not eating enough fat and that that can be very helpful to their skin their lips but if you're getting chapped lips you're probably dehydrated and should drink more water so just try that um it may be that your body actually needs a lot more water than you think it does most people drink too little water they just do and and I talked I defin I drink a lot of water okay how much you drink oh like a liter liter and a half a day and I'm like that's not enough water so you know it's um especially when you're having symptoms like that you know that that are quite commonly associated with with um dehydration you feel dehydrated your lips are dry you know just just um address that and if that's not that's not the the culprit then you can try eating more fat as well do both increase the fat increase the water should sort it out plant sparing carnivore nice H hi Dr CH thank you for for the Super Chat sorry um hi Dr chaffy in my opinion Blue Zone thing is not even a study thank you so much for all you do I 100% agree that's not a study it's propaganda it's a marketing term it's a Flatout lie they went around to Sardinia and all these places during Lent when they weren't eating much meat and they or they just lied they flat out lied you know they said that sardinians oh they don't eat meat only eat meat like once a week it's all plant-based otherwise that is a Flatout lie you know uh Professor Bill Schindler went to Sardinia and went to the same area that danam dner went to and they were even saying why does everyone think we're plant-based like what the hell is that about he was even saying like why is that that's really weird that's funny because that's not that's you know that wasn't what we told Dan so he's a liar he's just a liar and an idealogue he's a Seventh Day Adventist church member he's one of the high-ups he's trying to push this Dogma on people and profit off of it he made $70 million off the Blue Zone Studies by selling it to the Seventh Day Adventist Church and they probably funded the whole thing anyway he is a con artist and um and a flat out lie so no that's not a study that's a propaganda piece it's a Flatout lie and he's an and uh please tell him I said that uh Kareem and Millis uh thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm not seeing any question attached or down below um so sorry for that if there is something maybe pop it up but um not seeing one anyway um bushie DOI thank you for the Super Chat thanks for busting your busting your ass on studying the carnivore subject and going through med school you are one resilient person I'd hate to play a sport against you well thank you very much I really appreciate that look it's just something that interests me and medicine's always interested me and and just being healthy is always interested in me and just helping people is always interested in me you know you sort of um you sort of feel that if you I've always felt that if you have the ability to help someone you have a responsibility to help them and um you have to do what you can uh to to reach out and help people in your community we have a global Community uh we're able to connect on on uh social media and through the internet as we're able to reach everybody around the world and and help them and so I I think that you have to and so it's important to me to to be able to do this and to bring this to people and I'm just very thankful that it has helped people and that that people are taking this and sharing it with other people and helping other people because again it's all about your spheres of influence you know it's about you doing this having good results other people seeing that getting interested and you encouraging them to try it um you guys are all the ones doing this it's not it's not me you know I I have a platform that people can go to and look at for advice and for help but you're the one who has to do it you know and it's you doing it that then sets the example and the and and The Benchmark for people around you to say you know I want that you know that's something that can work okay you know Dr chaffy yeah well he plays Sports he works out he does probably does steroids all these sorts of things so maybe can't trust that but okay Dave you know Dave lost you know all this weight you know we had um you know our friend before lost you know 206 pounds I mean good Lord you know I mean in a year so you know and is healthy reversing diabetes all these sorts of things you know that's um that's great you know and people see that and they notice that and they take they pay attention to that so like okay well if that if if a normal person can do this then why can't I you know and and you can everyone can and um and you will you just eat real food real food for humans you know real food to a koala is not just Whole Food it's eucalyptus or meat any animal can eat meat you know because you're trying to turn whatever you're eating into yourself and you're made out of meat and so any animal can eat meat herbivores uh do opportunistically eat smaller animals all the time and uh and that's because that's the most nutrient-dense food out there is other animals and um some animals can turn plant tissue into animal tissue but it's very difficult 70% of animal species are carnivores for exactly that reason they can't turn an plant tissue into animal tissue they need to eat other animals to in order to get the nutrients that they need so all animals can eat meat but only some animals can eat plants and when they eat those plants it's specific plants so the plants that koala eats are different from the plants that that nearly every other animal on Earth Eats I don't know another animal that eats eucalyptus you know maybe some bugs but uh it's pretty much pretty much the koala you know that's it and uh that's the thing so that's food do Koala this is food to us you eat real food for your species which is human and that's meat then you're going to get healthy you're going to get healthier a lot healthier than you were before and um and then you know and we get back to you know as doctors to treating the things that are actually uh something that we can help with accidents emergencies injuries um child you know pregnancy and child birth congenital and genetic defects um infectious disease poisonings you know snake bites malnutrition those sorts of things that's real medicine you know that's real Health Care you know dealing with diabetes and autoimmunity and heart disease and cancer you know that that's just that's treating the effects of um bad advice and uh and and an inappropriate diet and and toxic exposure that have built up to the breaking point and so the the treatment for that is to remove the exposures just like you have lead poisoning you get rid of the lead right you get rid of the exposures that's that's number one what you do you have some medicines to help you get through it great but first thing you do is you get rid of the exposures and so that's what we're doing here you're getting rid of all the as many exposures as you can so you can be as heal healthy as you possibly can be and that's what we're trying to do so thank you all for helping me with that I really appreciate that um that's uh we sort of come to the end of the Super Chat sort of right on time uh just at the the 12 o'clock Mark we're nearly three hours now thank you all uh to everyone who's stuck with me um throughout all of this I know it's a long long sort of thing U it goes quicker than you think though uh three hours just sort of went pretty quick for me anyway you guys may have been bored as hell but um thank you very much uh for all of that uh and please do yes well thanks for everyone watching please do hit the like if you're not subscribed maybe think about that check out my other videos um on getting started on a carnivore diet there's a whole playlist there playlist on cancer there a playlist on Athletics and building muscle and all these other sorts of things people are interested in uh they can find those there and try to be curated so it's not it's not just I mean there's just too many videos I've I've actually often thought about maybe not doing more videos a long cat's out of the bag now but you know it's um just because I didn't want to water down the message you know I like I had these these specific videos I thought were really good and really important I was like that's what I want people to know about um and you know if I keep doing these things it's just going to sort of um you know then it can uh just water down and and and maybe make it so people don't see those so go to those those um go to those playlists the getting started on a carnivore diet those ones I think those are some of the most important videos that that I've done and or they're not even all my videos they're other other people's videos too um and then things on cancer and things on um you know Athletics and building muscle and those sorts of things so you check out those playlists as well please do share this with people and um thank you all for joining um for people that are still interested in going to uh the regenerate conference that'll be April 20th 21st in Melbourne so you know check out the regenerate uh website and see if you can um still get tickets it' be great to see you guys there thank you all everyone I really appreciate it we'll see you back here in three days for the premiere and the next release of my next new video and then the lives next week as well thanks everyone really appreciate it great to see you all [Music]"
