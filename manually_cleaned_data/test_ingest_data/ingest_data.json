      "text": "foreign who comes in and don't get going on the 60 minutes recap and get the live questions [Music] hey everyone thanks for joining um today I'm just going to do a live to go over the 60 Minutes Australia interview that I did and that just came up this weekend or just last weekend so for those who haven't seen it you can go to 60 Minutes Australia YouTube channel I've links for that in well I'll put it I'll put it in this as well but it also have links in my uh different posts and everything like that but you can just go to 60 Minutes Australia and it's it mentions carnivore diet and uh it sort of lumps it in with uh different sort of fat diets and things like that but we'll get to that so the you know my experience with it was was really great it was really positive you know everyone on the 60 Minutes team was was excellent they were they were all really really nice people they were all genuinely interested in uh what we had what we were talking about obviously there's a bit of skepticism with something as as uh new and different as uh eating this way and that's totally understandable but they were awesome they were really really good uh we we spent the whole day in Sydney starting in the morning we did the interview face-to-face interview part we spoke for about 20 minutes and then we went off and did sort of like a workout on Bandai beach at the open air gym and then went and had some steaks at um I think massaria if I'm pronouncing that right just down on Bandai Beach which is awesome and the the owner met there and I spoke for a while as well he's a really nice guy and has a great set up there people hasn't haven't seen that that's it's like a butcher but you know you can go into like a normal butcher shop but then they'll just cook the steaks for you too so you can you can buy meat and go home with it or they can actually cook it for you and so um just a quick question there I just saw here someone said you know when do you typically see Improvement in health being on a carnivore diet generally pretty pretty soon so usually about two weeks you get most of this junk out of your system you feel a lot better and and then you start just feeling better and better and better you need to make sure you're eating enough make sure you're eating enough uh fatty meat get enough fat eat till full eat till meat stops tasting good and yeah but generally people will see significant improvements within a couple weeks and then they'll just get better after that so um the uh the interviews all went fine and and you know at first you know there was quite a bit of skeptical sort of questions like really and what about this and that but at the same time you know as as the day wore on and we talked about more things behind camera behind the camera people were getting more and more interested sort of you know sort of sent people different different links and things like that that they could sort of check out and what do you know at the end of the day when everyone's having their lunch everyone's ordered steaks and they didn't get anything else so uh at least for the you know the camera crew and things like that that you know at least they uh certainly seem to be interested in that as well so hopefully they'll look into that more and um but someone said I should invoice them for my time now it's um no you know the thing is though is that this is going to be met with skepticism from the mainstream of course it is you know and so you know when we um when we uh you know our first sort of making an appearance on the mainstream venues and things like that it's going it's going to be questioned that's just that's just how it's going to be and so we have to we have to sort of expect that and but hopefully just enough people will see that and maybe you know be interested or intrigued enough to then say okay well what is this guy that sounds really weird but maybe I'll go see what he has to say or maybe I'll go see what he has to say to see just how full of it he is and then they go see and they go actually you know maybe that that makes a bit more sense than I thought it did or that I thought it would so I think that's that's what we can hope for at the moment and even um and even when people even when people are are you know skeptical of this and putting out you know posts that are just like well is this really the right thing to do other people get interested and so I've had other news outlets um well one in particular that's um that wanted to you know do another interview with me to to talk more about it so that's good so it opens the door for more things now as for what they sort of put out there um obviously it would have been nice if they were very positive about it they weren't negative about it in the sense that they said this is a bad idea but they had they you know lumped me in with a lot of other groups that were not necessarily something that they were speaking positively about so I sort of got lumped in with with people that they were saying oh these people just they're just sort of after a diet fat to try to sort of you know get money out of people and you know sell their products or something like that where the whole idea with the cardboard that is there's no product there isn't a product that you that you have to have and that was one of the things that they talked about with that Dr Ed's character uh who people you know would probably know he did a video about me that he had no basis for doing just sort of made up a bunch of nonsense uh having not actually watched the video and so it was very easy to just do a response video to him showing that he was quite ignorant on that subject and um you know really needed to do a better job at uh of researching what the hell is going on and um hey Rory good to see you buddy and um so you know they were saying there's like yes well you know they come up with this problem that you have that you have and only their solution will fix it and so you know then they'll they'll sell it to you which is actually the vegan crowd because they say you know like like look at the um the game changers documentary they said that well you need protein and but you can't get it from me because meat's really bad for you and it's toxic and these people that go away from meat they do so much better and look at these just top athletes and they're so wonderful but you need protein so where are you going to get it well it just happens to be that um you know that uh uh James Cameron who's the executive producer of Game Changers just happened his own 140 million dollars worth of op protein company which wouldn't you know so you need protein can't get it from me just happen to have this product right here for you so that's not what the carnival guide is the longboard diet is you don't need these products you don't need to do anything you just need to eat meat you just need to eat the right thing and that was actually something the doctor had said say hey you know the secret to health is very easy you just have to eat right and move your body I agree with that we just disagree with what eating right is and um you know and uh if we're both sort of doing the same thing you know I think our results speak for themselves you know I you know I've been doing this for a very long time he's been doing what he's doing for a while and our results are entirely different so you know I think that that can uh tell you something there as well and um but the idea is the same you don't need a product you don't need to sell anything you don't need anything extra and we actually talked about that in that 20-minute segment and then we actually talked more at the restaurant and so obviously there was a good 30 minutes of our discussion that that didn't get used fine but we did cover this and we did talk about how you know there was a lot of you know cover-ups from the food industry pasting over you know 100 years of medical literature and Science and saying that that meat wasn't good for us and that was bad for us in order to protect their product and to push their own agenda and that's not good and that's something that's that's well documented it's in the peer-reviewed literature this is not a question this is not up for debate this is a historical fact and we have documentation of this in in the published literature so you know that's not really uh in question um so you know me saying hey you know you can we can actually we're actually spending trillions of dollars a year in America and around the world treating medical conditions that are a direct result of eating the wrong thing and all we have to do is eat the correct thing to our biologically appropriate design and you don't need any of these and we save trillions of dollars that's redirected and much more worthwhile and fruitful directions right so so I was arguing that you you can get away from these things you can get off these medications you can get a better life and uh Better Health and and save money save a lot of money uh by just eating properly so I didn't think it was entirely fair to lump me in with uh these other people that they were saying you know these guys are just scamming you and they're just trying to you know get your money and have have a product and things like that um and so you know that's uh you know I didn't think that that was entirely Fair now they didn't say that well this is Anthony and he's trying to sell you something you know but that was the premise of the entire show and so that sort of that sort of the sort of guilt by association in that uh in that regard so which was a bit disappointing but at the same time you know it got some people out there thinking about this sort of stuff and at least being you know made aware of it made aware that there there is a discussion and there are people sort of doing this and I think there was there's been a really good response to uh these you know you know these these videos by people going in and commenting and saying hey you know I've I've you know gone on Carnivore and it's changed my life I lost you know 120 pounds I've reversed these these illnesses I've come off these medications and this has really helped me this is really changing people's lives and you guys shouldn't be uh you know uh you know critical of it well you should be critical of anything but you shouldn't be uh you know derogatory and you should at least give it a chance and uh and allow people to to you know see what they think or at least look into it more you know it was great that they had me on for a conversation it would have been even better if they had you know actually published that entire conversation because I think it would have been much better for people I think it would have been interesting for people to actually hear the entire arguments I mean I think they did choose some good choice uh lines and good choice arguments that I made but they certainly weren't the you know the whole body of arguments and certain certainly weren't the whole you know the whole totality of our discussion because we spoke for 30 minutes on camera you know like 20 minutes in that original segment and then like another 10 minutes uh when we were when we were eating steaks and we're talking about you know these different you know these different facts that you know like the sugar companies paid off all these uh horrible professors and this is this is published in the medical literature and the general American Medical Association and uh you know and a lot of other things as well so I think it's important to have those conversations and hopefully this this opens the door and then subsequently The Daily Mail in the UK actually ran with a story basically taking sort of verbatim What was was said in in that and um and uh sort of published it but it was sort of funny they said you know this bizarre contention of eating only meat from a doctor hasn't eaten vegetables in five years or something like that I thought it was very funny and obviously people lost their minds in the comments oh my God what the hell is this but at the same time then people came on and and replied they were saying hey this is that there's actually more to it than this and there's actually something here and people are getting a lot better I'm getting a lot better I get it I've gotten improved my health by you know you know all these different metrics so it's really good I appreciate everyone who who did that who went on there and told their story and and said how how much this has helped them because it's really important when people see these these videos and these and these stories they're going to be very very taken aback me like this is crazy this goes against everything my my mommy told me and so therefore it has to be wrong and so um and so being able to go on there and people saying actually this isn't this isn't a problem you know your mom did the best she could but she was she was told a lie too and you know and this is this is how it is and people's lives are getting a lot better because of this so um you know so the um you know so I think that's great and I think getting that that conversation out there in the open air and talked about more it has been great so that's been awesome so if people have questions about that uh happy to field them or if they have other questions we'll try to try to field those as well and we can just have a have a bit of a talk I do have to go in about 30 minutes because I have an interview to do um but uh we can we can certainly chat until then um just uh a question here from uh vizian air why am I not losing weight I feel amazing by the way well the main thing is that you feel great the main thing is you focus on your health there are a lot of people that will lose significant amount of weight early on and that's great but you also have to understand that this isn't always the case that people will lose them away immediately but uh it will happen eventually you know if you have excess fat to lose that that's going to come off the people that have a lot of hormonal disruption and a lot of problems with their metabolism and their health that their body is saying hey you know we need to hold on to this because they've been starving and fasting and eating the wrong things for so many years that they're that their metabolism is just shot and their hormones are shot and they're in a state where their bodies in in a state of Perpetual panic and fear that you're in a famine because that's what you that's the signals you've been giving it is that there isn't enough food there is not enough nutrition available and so it needs to sequester and store and hang on to this extra fat because you're going to die otherwise right and that's it that's just how we work and So eventually those hormones like leptin will start normalizing and other things will improve as well your thyroid function will probably get better as well metabolism will start ramping up and and then all of a sudden the fat will start coming off also remember that it's not about weight loss you're you're worried about fat loss and body composition and so um when people are going on this it's actually a lot easier to put on muscle mass and you actually and people actually do increase bone density as well and that's something that people say you can't really do after 25 [\u00a0__\u00a0] I see it happen all the time um and so if you're eating a proper diet and especially if you're exercising you're doing resistance training you will put on bone density and and even if you're osteoporetic or a osteopenia you can improve your bone density even in middle age or late age I see it happen all the time and so uh don't don't don't listen to um people that say that because that's in the context of eating stupid things and eating the wrong thing and eating the wrong diet and not being healthy eating a whole bunch of plant-based blah blah blah yeah well if you're eating that you're not going to be able to put on bone density I agree with that and you're going to strip your body of minerals and uh yeah and your bone density will go down so don't do that eat a proper diet and your boat Nancy will go up your muscle density will go up and therefore your weight will go up as well and so you may not lose weight but are you not losing weight because you're not losing fat or you're not losing weight because you're losing fat but you're also gaining muscle and bone density and so that's something you have to think about as well so when I first started this uh I just stopped eating vegetables and I lost 23 pounds or 10 kilos in 10 days and then I stop losing weight I I lost no weight I stayed exactly the same weight for months after that but my body was completely transforming I was just stripping fat off my body and gaining a lot of muscle so I I just exactly matched uh my muscle gain and fat loss don't know why don't know how that that you know why it was just a perfect one for one like that but it was and so I gained uh no weight but I lost no weight at all but I lost a ton of that and so that could be happening as well so look at how your parents take monthly and I mean monthly don't take daily or weekly you need to just you give it some time and take monthly pictures you know in the mirror uh with you know sort of you know less clothes on so you can see your body and see the changes that are being made because you might be changing your body habits you might be changing your body composition you can also get a dexa scan body composition scan now and then in six months this isn't this isn't going to happen overnight for some people some and even for me you know I was it took eight months before I got to a stable body fat percentage and and then just maintain that eight months but you know what it was a dramatic difference all the time so I got I got a very very big results pretty rapidly just from like lifting weights and that I was back playing rugby as well uh and then I you know hurt my knee and I couldn't play rugby anymore so I um after that I was just lifting weights and that's actually when I started losing weight was when I stopped being able to play rugby and do squats because I wasn't I wasn't able to do squats I was able to run so my late I actually lost muscle mass which is why I lost weight and so that wasn't what I wanted to lose so you know you don't actually necessarily want to lose weight you want to lose fat and you want to put on muscle and you want to put on bone density so just be mindful of that but number one first and foremost think about your health you feel great that's great make sure you're eating enough make sure you're getting enough fat especially because this is an important nutrient it's not just it's not just a calorie Source it is a an essential nutrient of essential amino acids or sorry fatty acids and uh fat soluble vitamins so it's very very important to give enough fat it's very important to get enough meat and if you do that continually you will stimulate your metabolism to ramp up and you will lose fat and so you will but you know look at Kelly Hogan you know she has a very good story of it she actually gained weight and she thinks she was actually not only putting on muscle but probably putting on fat as well for about six months and then overnight all of a sudden it just things just started just dumping off of her she's been very very slender for you know the next 13 years and um and has been you know you know very good since that so you know and being able to maintain that that uh body happiness ever since then and that's and that's what people notice this is this is you lose the weight you gain the health and you can maintain it and sustain it for the rest of your life because this is not a diet you're not dieting you're just changing the way you're eating you're changing your lifestyle and that's and that's and you're going to perpetuate that so these are new habits these are new uh this is a new way of living and and that's how I look at it I'm not on a diet this is just how I eat you know a lion is not on a diet that's just how they eat you know cows are not on a diet they're oh they're so restrictive they're only eating grass they have good that's because that's the only thing that's food for them and uh and then that's the way they eat and so this is the way I eat and this is the way I think biological and humans are meant to eat and so you know if you are eating that way good things will happen and so even if you're not losing weight even if you're not losing fat right away eventually it will eventually will happen so focus on your health first and foremost how you're feeling your energy levels Your Sleep Quality you know medications you might be coming off of the money you're saving from not going to doctors and getting all these expensive treatments and all these benefits in your life focus on that as a distant second think about your body composition never at all does does weight on the scale make the list okay that is not something you should ever worry about if you're ever going to worry about something like that you worry about body composition not weight on the scale okay because the weight on the scale doesn't matter with your health matters and not everybody's going to be able to to get back down to you know an ideal teenage body fat percentage unfortunately um people's bodies are made a bit differently the things we've done to our bodies are different and so sometimes that you can't undo all of that but what you can do is you can maximize your health and you can maximize your energy and you can you can get off a lot of medications a lot of medications and you can stop in their tracks a lot of these chronic diseases and stop them before they start or in many cases reverse th em um David thank you very much you just give me a fan",

    "question": "What is Dr. Chaffee's opinion on fruits for someone who is extremely active?",
    "topic": "Fruits",
    "date": "2023-03-13",
    "body": {
      "text": "em um David thank you very much you just give me a fan em um David thank you very much you just give me a fan Super Chat thank you so much I appreciate that all right so let's see if we have any more questions here oh goodness okay so Nat Lavelle asks uh Dr chafee what is your opinion on fruits for someone like myself who's extremely active and trains a lot you always mention that plants are bitter and don't want us to eat them but uh fruits are sweet so fruits are delicious yeah but but Sugar's a drug and that and that's the main thing so this is why yes you know if something tastes bad that's your brain and your tongue giving you a clear signal inside that there's something bad in there and it says don't eat this spit this out right um so if something tastes bad then I would say you really don't want to eat it that's a very good rule of thumb but that doesn't mean that everything that tastes good necessarily is good for you there are outliers like sugar and fructose in particular is very very sweet most of the carbohydrates are mildly sweet at best and well like I said when you go on a carnivore diet then your taste of sweet gets a lot stronger so like when I drink whole milk it's like I'm drinking ice cream it's crazy you know and I don't want to stop so I lit I don't let myself really do that but fructose is much much sweeter much sweeter and this is thought to be because we recognize that as something safe that we aren't that isn't going to kill us if we eat it right so we don't know of any plants that contain fructose that are acutely poisonous that will kill you that day if you eat it okay that doesn't mean there are no defense chemicals in it like citrus fruits all citrus fruits have purana coumarins which are UV sensitive and can burn your skin you get it on your skin like you're squeezing lines that are notorious for this you squeeze those they get on your hands and it gets in the Sun and you blister and get second degree burns um and if you eat them you'll get more more sensitive to these these uh to the UV light as well overall and grapefruit is another one um all citrus all citrus had these coumarines but specifically grapefruit is a good example because this is something that has to be detoxified you have to detoxify these if you're on a coumarins and your liver does this and there's certain enzymes that do that and those certain enzymes also are the ones that metabolize certain medications and I believe statins are one of them so you cannot eat grapefruit with a number of different medications because it will use up too much of that uh that that enzyme and you will end up either not metabolizing the you'll not metabolize the medications properly you should either have too much or too little right and so you can get toxic or ineffective doses of the medications that you're on so that's that's you know to do with that but whether or not they have those things sugar itself fructose in particular is not good for you first of all slams up your your insulin you don't want that that puts you into a fat storage metabolism as opposed to a fat burning metabolism it blocks proteolysis it blocks lipolysis so you are not able to be uh you are not able to access your fat stores if you if you raise your insulin up okay so you even if you eat fruit and you're active yeah okay look you're going to burn off those carbs great but you know what you're not going to be able to do is mobilize your fat stores for the rest of the workout so you're going to have to keep having those little orange wedges or juice or or you know Carby supplements to keep perpetuating your energy because once you run out of your glycogen in your liver and your muscles that's it you're tanked you hit the wall and that's it so if you're doing a shorter workout fine okay it's not going to be a big deal but if you're doing a longer or more heavy workout or playing like a you know a rugby game or you know AFL game NFL game whatever you're playing you're gonna you're gonna run out of glycogen and you're going to feel that garbage and so uh if you don't eat any carbs whatsoever you don't you don't fall into that trap and you will always run on your fat stores and you're not going to run out of your fat stores not not anytime soon anyway you can push yourself as hard as you want to and fructose has been shown to be addictive in the same way as cocaine heroin and meth and shown on MRI studies to kill the same areas of your brain as meth to the same extent as meth okay this is bad this is bad stuff and it also is metabolized and broken down into the same byproducts as alcohol so it goes into the it turns into the same offshoot chemicals break down chemicals as alcohol and so it causes the same damage from those chemicals as alcohol Okay so fatty liver disease sclerosis diabetes heart disease even implicated in things like cancer and Alzheimer's disease so this is not a good thing and so that's why I avoid so my hard rule is no plants no sugar nothing artificial that goes for sauces seasonings and drinks as well but obviously people can do whatever they want you're going to be less damaged by it if you're if you're um you know if you are working out active and you're just having some fruit maybe not as much fructose as if you're drinking fruit juice obviously that's going to be a lot more fructose and some of the fiber and things like that actually block the absorption of fructose fine but it's not ideal it's not exactly what you want to do and you get enough this stuff it will screw up your insulin and your metabolism so for me I don't think it's really worth it but to each their own um David asks d o you ever eat sardine and thank you very much for the",

      "text": "o you ever eat sardine and thank you very much for the o you ever eat sardine and thank you very much for the Super Chat David I appreciate that um do you ever eat sardines or fish to get your Omega-3s yeah sometimes you know I I do um I like sardines and so you know maybe I get them sometimes beef has has plenty of Omega-3s it has a lot more Omega-3s if it's grass finished so you know it's um it's something that some people do where they'll you know if they're not if they're not having all you know grass finished beef um that will have that will have a good omega-3 content maybe they'll just eat some sardines or something like that with their steak so that they have a good omega-3 to omega-6 or ratio when they're eating and so I think that's a that's a fairly decent thing to do uh you want to get make sure that you're getting sardines that are just packed in water uh without a bunch of seasonings and garbage and things like that especially not packed in oil because they don't pack them in fish oil they pack them in sunflower oil or soybean oil or some other god-awful seed oil so you don't want that but you know so you want to get it you want to get it in water um if you can and or you know Cod Liver I think tins of cod liver and have it in their own oil probably not a bad idea as well I honestly haven't noticed too much of a difference in How I Feel adding in sardines um to just eating beef but you know I mean some people that do like sardine fast and things like that they think that works really well for them I haven't looked into that too much myself um but you know you can experiment with things and if you like adding in fish and sardines you know go for it I mean I do like fish I just like beef more and I feel I feel the best on beef but um you know and if you're getting grass-finished beef you'll get you'll get plenty of Omega-3s that'd be fine um okay it was one look up here from Instagram greetings from Greece tell us about carb Cravings after eating beef and salt only how do you get over it well usually those um usually they go away so usually um you can uh you can sort of get over in the first couple weeks so carb Cravings will stay on because again these things are addictive especially sugar is addictive fructose is addictive just like cocaine and meth and again gives a dopamine hit to the addiction centers of your brain right so it's a drug and it takes a while to get over drugs and but it but just like any other other drug abstaining for a certain period of time you will get away from that chemical addiction and your body can recover and so for most people carb and sugar Cravings last about two weeks in general that's a rough sort of thing for people and um and so you feel good uh after that you generally don't need need uh to worry about it after that but if you are getting craving sometimes that can just be your brain say hey we need more energy we need more food and um and uh and so maybe that can be a hunger signal you have to relearn your hunger signals going on a carnivore diet and so it could be that um so it could be that uh you're just hungry and so if you're getting those carb Cravings maybe think okay am I hungry maybe I should eat meat and so you eat meat and you go wow this tastes good that means you're hungry if meat tastes good you're hungry it doesn't taste good you're not and that's how you should that's how you should relearn your hunger signals uh meat tastes good when you're hungry and your body's giving it positive feedback right it gives positive feedback with sugar as well the difference is the sugar is a drug and that things that are drugs give you positive feedback and then they take give me more give me more give me more give me more give me more they never stop right but if something's good for you like me and it's giving you positive feedback as you give it more that positive feedback is less and less and eventually it goes away and then you don't have any positive feedback and your body just goes yep we have enough stop eating in fact if you keep eating meat after that it will start tasting bad and you will not enjoy it so you know it's uh that's how you tell the difference between uh something that's good for you giving you positive feedback something bad for you just give me a positive feedback that's bad for you giving you positive feedback it's going to keep giving you that feedback it's not going to go away like a drug right so if you are if you are having carb Cravings eat more right and make sure that you're eating enough and generally when you eat enough especially fatty meat and you eat till you're full you eat until meat stops tasting good generally you won't really have many carb cravings and after about two weeks they just go away and you'll be good after that so go od luck with that uh David thank you very much for the",

      "text": "od luck with that uh David thank you very much for the od luck with that uh David thank you very much for the Super Chat I just said awesome uh thanks a lot doc great point no problem glad I glad I was able to help um Cali Cali girl asks do you recommend counting calories if you want to lose more than 100 pounds on Carnivore no I don't recommend counting calories ever I recommend just listening to your body your body knows what it wants and knows how much energy it wants and you will you will find that probably aren't eating all that much in comparison um and so you know it's um it's actually okay so you can you can listen you know maybe some days you're you're eating a steak and it's just like this it really isn't enjoyable I don't really like this and um and that's okay you don't have to eat you don't have to eat that day but you should eat as much as your body is asking you now some people find that they aren't eating enough and maybe they count calories they realize like oh Jesus I am really under eating and I should really eat a lot more and so that can be helpful but I would never limit the amount of calories just because they're calories first of all calories are stupid metric really really really not great because these are complex organic molecules they have complex chemical interactions in your body there are dozens of different uh carbohydrates they all have ex they all have unique chemical properties and interactions there are dozens of different amino acids they all have unique chemical interactions and properties there are hundreds of fatty acids and they all have unique and individual chemical reactions you cannot you cannot boil these down to just the amount of energy that is released when you burn them because that's what a calorie is so that's not a good metric we are not combustion engines we are chemical power plants right and so these you eat these things you can't just say oh a calories of calories a calorie is a calorie because that that's honestly just insane and so you know if someone is saying that and they're a doctor and they've taken Biology and they've taken biochemistry and organic chemistry like they need to go back and and revise those books because that is a remarkably ignorant statement that it all comes down to just the amount of energy that's burned off from from burning these sorts of things there's a bunch of calories in Wood all right does that does that mean anything significant to us no because they're they're bound up in ways that we can't access and don't matter to us but there's a lot of calories who cares so it's important to um it's important to understand that and it's important to understand that uh you know these are nutrients your body's going for nutrients that is a nutrient proteins are nutrients these vitamins and minerals are nutrients and your body wants nutrients it's not going for calories it's going for nutrients and so you need to give your body enough nutrients and nutrition and so if you are doing that you will actually stimulate your metabolism you actually have you um have your metabolism ramp up and you'll actually lose more weight you know we know this like they're you know bariatric surgeons and things like that will tell people after they've gotten a bypass um that you have to eat at least 1200 calories a day I believe that's for women maybe more from men but anyway for women it's 1200 I remember one telling me and they said below that you won't lose weight so why is that you're eating less calories and all and we're just combustion engines so you're eating less calories and you're not losing weight why is that well because we're not combustion engines we're very very complex biochemical creatures and so you actually reduce the amount of energy available and you're going to reduce your metabolism your body's gonna go hey we're in a famine we're we don't have resources we need to shut this down we need to slow everything down so that we don't run out of resources and die because it's about self-preservation your body is smarter than you are all right it's going to let us know what to do so you need to give your body what it needs and your body will do what it needs to do and it sort of it goes against everything we've been told but again all of this does and everything we've been told for the last 40 years is complete carbons and verifiably garbage so see for yourself um you know and and make sure you're getting enough nutrition you know your body will stop you it will start tasting bad when your body says that's enough and so you can listen to that if you're eating correctly if you're eating a biologically appropriate diet you can listen to your biology all right it's one of the major senses taste right and that and that will d ictate we'll tell you what what it wants to do okay um",

    "question": "What are the potential risks and benefits of a ketogenic diet for individuals with epilepsy?",
    "topic": "Benefits",

      "text": "ictate we'll tell you what what it wants to do okay um ictate we'll tell you what what it wants to do okay um super chat from uh Christina Perez thank you so much uh what is your experience with carnivore and epilepsy my son 17 is getting flat from his dietitian while his dietitian used to read a damn book because there's a hundred years of medical literature on the subject of epilepsy and ketogenic diets in fact that's the only treatment we had for epilepsy for God knows how many decades and before that it was fasting and I figured out that you can have this ketogenic diet and mimic fasting really fasting mimics ketogenic diets but we have literally 100 Years of very robust scientific literature and experiments showing that epilepsy is is helped uh to to a large extent and sometimes cured not always but sometimes cured by going on a ketogenic diet carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet unless you're in the fruit and honey Camp which I would not recommend for people I don't think that that's the right way to do it I think that sugar is not good for us and especially if you're talking about epilepsy or cancer or something like that absolutely not you do not want any of that stuff in your life and so if someone has epilepsy being on a carnivore diet is going to be exceptional for ketogenics right being a ketogenic state which is better for your brain you're feeling your brain in a better Manner and this this seems to help with epilepsy but number two you are also eliminating a whole bunch of other neurotoxins that can interrupt your your normal brain chemistry and um you know think about caffeine caffeine it was developed as a neurotox it is a neurotoxin it was developed as an insecticide to kill insects trying to eat the plants right that affects your brain and that can that can act an excitatory sort of manner that is the last thing you want to do if you have epilepsy if you have a predisposition to get your neurons so excited that they that they start a seizure um that is not what you want okay so I have seen a lot of people help with a ketogenic diet and I've seen some people that a ketogenic diet improve their epilepsy significantly but wasn't quite enough to get them over the finish line and then going on a carnivore diet seemed to help and then one gentleman mentioned that the caffeine thing he had he had a cup of coffee and all of a sudden he had a grandma seizure bad bad bad bad thing to do so he was like this stuff's toxic I'm not going anywhere near it he was keto this wasn't sugar-filled coffee it was black coffee right so that's something to think about as well and so if the dietitians say oh my God you know that's not good for you they need to read a damn book and that and that that really bothers me because they if someone is a dietitian working with epilepsy patients they should damn well know that um that is that is not a new thing that is a very very well established thing and it's not even and it's not even like oh it wasn't as good as medications no it was great in fact some cases was even better and you know there's people that are on four different medications and they're still having seizures and they go keto and uh and it goes away right um Johns Hopkins still uses a ketogenic diet to treat epilepsy number one Hospital in the world ranks quite often you know changes every year but you know quite often there there are the top hospital if not or one of the top hospitals in the world they still use a ketogenic diet or at least last that I checked I saw a paper from them I guess that's older now it's probably like 10 15 years old but you know they at that time they were still using a ketogenic diet this is in the damn literature it works the reason that they switch to pharmacology is a big influence by big Pharma saying hey you should do this you should just use medications it's so much easier blah blah blah I think and it is easier that's what people said don't worry about ketog diet we have a pill now they're safe and effective and it's easier it's easier to just give someone a pill instead of counseling them and talking to them and trying to get them to change their diets radically right and some people don't want to do that but you know what a lot of people are fine and I spoke to a lady her daughter was having seizures and um and I just sort of mentioned to her I was just like you know actually you know there's there are a lot of different uh there's tons of data on this where where you know for 100 years we have literature that a ketogenic diet can actually significantly help um uh you know epilepsy especially in pediatric populations and um and I just said so you know something you can look into just ketogenic diet just cutting out carbs I can actually significantly help uh epilepsy and she went oh oh really wow yeah no that's great yeah no we'll try that like that so easy it's no problem right um we don't realize how willing able and eager people are for straightforward Solutions like that and not having to dump in a bunch of chemicals in their body or their kids bodies and if they knew that there was a solution that is so elegant as just this dietary remodeling that is going to help them in so many other ways as well you know if you don't even try that I think that I think that that's um that's a failure of of the doctor and the clinician you know that after that you know if they were like yeah no it's not really working for me fine you know they're immense there and but that's a second line to me and then some people I've heard some people say that their neurologists say no you don't want to go on a ketogenic diet because if you come off and ketogenic diet there's a rebound effect first of all [\u00a0__\u00a0] that's not true um uh in fact the longer you go without a seizure the less likely you are to have a seizure again okay um and uh you know it's like it's the same idea with medication or if you come off your medication uh for epilepsy well then you might have a seizure like okay well then don't come off your medication right don't come off the ketogenic diet you know you're not going to have if you have like a candy bar once and all of a sudden just when you primed to have a seizure that's not the case you know if you if you go off of it and continue to stay off of it yeah you're gonna you're gonna undo some of the goods you did for yourself but um so anyway uh I I take Serious exception to people trying to dissuade people from especially clinicians from dissuading people to do do a ketogenic diet and actually get off meds and actually help themselves I mean I think that is just so irresponsible I honestly consider it malpractice um because you know these medications do cause harm they're not benign and they're not they're not free from a health perspective or a pocketbook perspective and so this comes at a cost to people it comes to the cost of their lives it makes them feel horrible they have you know it changes their cognition they're tired all the time they gain weight it's not good and so you know not being on these things is better if they if they can be I think it's they're very important if you need them but uh you don't always need them um okay so there's a couple other super chats thank you so much I I I'm gonna have to go after these two so um maybe don't give me more super chats um because I may not be able to answer them guys so um one from uh hendo uh says calcium scans 149 and 59 year old male no cardiac symptoms not diabetic 95 carnivore should I be concerned being on a carnivore diet no I don't think so at all um you know you're having that calcium scan um that's that build up takes years and years and years you know when you were not carnivore also you know that's a that's a that's a snapshot in time and so you take that picture now you stay on Carnivore that number can come down and I've seen it come down it comes down a lot of people and we even seeing on uh angiogram things like that blockages actually restore um Dr um Dr Sean O'Mara has done studies with over 6 000 patients looking at abdominal MRIs looking at visceral fat found that like blockage interest cerebral blockages uh actually reverse when you when you get that visceral fat down and he says not my words he says and he's the visceral fat expert carnivore die is the best diet to get your visceral fat down and then exercise you want you want high intensity anaerobic exercise like sprinting hit training so high intensity interval training or weight lifting those are the best best things to do to reduce your visceral fat and you reduce your visceral fat you can reverse these blockages and uh and uh uh calcium scores so that is um so that's something you should look at and think about it um and then there's",

    "topic": "Intermittent Fasting",
    "date": "2023-01-19",
    "body": {
      "text": "okay finally going Live on YouTube that took way longer than it should have sorry about that talk about sorry talk about proteins and fats for weight loss percentage grams uh wise please so it you know it it does change it um it doesn't uh it's not the same sort of gramage for everybody okay so uh you just need to get enough protein you need to get enough fat your body will tell you that if you're not eating carbohydrates you're not eating a lot of other you know lectins and things like that that are going to disrupt your hunger signals that are going to disrupt your digestion and your energy absorption or your or nutrient absorption you can generally just listen to your to your body so you eat enough you keep going uh while meat tastes good and it's satisfying uh to you and then it'll stop being as satisfying and you'll just stop and so you can just listen to your body you can eat intuitively if you're eating a natural diet so I would just do that but you need to make sure you get enough you know people are trying to limit all the things that they're eating in order especially in order to lose weight but that's not what your body's asking for you're out your body's asking for nutrients if you're giving it the right nutrients it won't let you overeat you know generally there are people that have different sort of conditions and are on different medications that may change that and alter that but that is it that is a general rule so I would just eat enough protein and enough fat uh that's going to be different for everybody okay I'm just going to start with uh some questions here um that uh we had submitted from my patreon group and if you want to be a member of these lives and part of these lies we do these every week or twice weekly and you can submit questions and we can go through them and talk more in depth as well so we'll start with those and so that's on my patreon account that's just Anthony chafee MD if you guys are interested in checking that out so to start things off I'll ask one of the questions here from Carmine who says a few weeks in and I know that I have increased my consumption of fat and it is filling but I have I have to force myself to eat sometimes my fear is that I'm not eating enough protein especially since I have returned to the gym is this a common occurrence and how do you cope with it uh yeah so if you're if you find yourself forcing yourself to eat that means your body is telling you to stop that means your body's telling you hey we've had enough we don't need this anymore you know please stop um it meat should taste good you should be getting that positive feedback that reward for eating meat and fat and so if you're getting to the point where you're like Ugh you know it's not really tasting good anymore and you're forcing yourself then that you're actually forcing yourself to overeat okay so you don't need to do that and uh you probably don't want to do that either especially when you have excess body fat your body's not going to want as much as you think that it might you know so you might think well I'm really working out a lot I'm doing all this I need all this stuff um uh I'm doing all all this work and all that sort of stuff I need more energy I need more food well you clearly don't if your body's telling you to stop eating okay so you shouldn't force yourself to eat ever okay um so that would be what I would do is just listen to your body and if your body's telling you to eat less eat less so a question from Mike after the body uses available dietary protein to build repair of the body on a plant-free carnivore diet What Becomes of the remaining protein does it become glycogen glucose fat excreted if a combination uh what are the approximate percentages I don't know percentages um I do know your body can store and sequester protein and um so it's not just like this perfect level that you here's all this protein and then and then it all gets shoveled away so your body is able to to conserve protein and store it away and so and use it at later times this is why you know we eat meat in one go and and then we use it throughout the day or throughout the next day or the night and we rebuild our body and rebuild these structures so your body is able to store protein just like it is able to store fat and carbohydrates as well um some of it will turn into uh you know glucose and glycogen but that's generally um need driven as opposed to substrate driven so namely that you're just because you have a lot of extra protein that doesn't necessarily mean that's just going to automatically turn into glucose and things like that uh some of it will it seems but it's um it's more demand driven than anything um so I guess there's a sort of an add-on to sort of those hunger Hunger questions if you've had issues with food before how do you know if you're just misinterpreting hunger cues that's a good that's a good question you know it's it's difficult sometimes when people come from different ways of eating or they're eating too much or too little for whatever reason um and having disordered eating patterns generally people get less disordered eating on a carnivore diet on a natural diet because you're more satiated you're more satisfied you're not feeling bloated you're not getting overweight you feel good and you're getting healthy and it's also good for your mental health as well uh significantly uh better for your mental health and so you you will have to relearn your hunger signals you will have to to relearn what it feels like to be hungry um and what that means and so I think going by taste is uh really important so if meat tastes good I think that that means you are hungry if you are only eating meat if you're not eating carbohydrates if you're not taking different medications that can increase your appetite um and uh so if you're doing that then if meat tastes good I think that means you're hungry and once it stops tasting good it means you're not and then you start paying attention to that and then relearning your hunger signals um just a quick question here just type 2 diabetes um you know can you eat on a carnivore diet yes you absolutely can it's very very helpful there are there are actual you know big studies showing that just going on a ketogenic diet is very very beneficial for type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes really normalizes blood sugar hpa1c and makes it very very controllable blood sugars which is this is the important thing for diabetes and you can come off a lot of your medications and reduce your insulin if you're insulin dependent a lot of insulin dependent type 2 diabetics can come off of insulin not everyone but but a lot of people can so yes it's very very beneficial and it's very beneficial to everyone in every condition at every stage of life because this really is our primary evolved biologically appropriate species-specific diet that is the the most optimal for the human beings for the human animal I truly believe that I truly believe that that's what the evidence shows um so another question from our patreon members Jeff he says I know someone who after some misdiagnoses now is diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia and is going to discuss surgery is this something that can be addressed first with diet maybe I you know I haven't really come across this before but I think that in in the context of a carnivore diet and um you know I have a strong suspicion that it will I haven't seen it specifically but your body's going to optimize it's going to start working better when you're on a biologically appropriate species specific you know uh proper human diet as Dr Berry says so your body's going to work better and so your your hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia that is going to optimize as well is that going to fix it I couldn't say but is are you going to work as well as you possibly can given your genetics and your situation yes and so can that help things like that it wouldn't be the first time something like that happened so I wouldn't uh I wouldn't put it past it I would certainly try it before I started getting surgery to rip my uh um you know parathyroid uh glands out of my neck and um you know so I would I would definitely give that a shot does carnivore diet help with Hashimoto's disease yes it seems that all autoimmune disorders seem to respond very very well to a true Elimination Diet like carnivore where you're eliminating out all of the unnecessary unwanted and unhealthy different foods that we eat that can precipitate different diseases like Hashimoto's so we have a number of Hashimoto's patients at the functional medicine clinic I work at and they have all been doing very very well uh it's it comes off a bit slower Hashimoto's responds lower than say like Crohn's and ulcerative colitis or even rheumatoid arthritis but it does respond and it does improve and people's thought um antibodies go down and their thyroid function goes up and you can have permanent damage you may have to take different medications ongoing especially early on or even permanently but it can significantly improve things and I've every single one of our patients is improving and that's that's what I'm reading from other clinicians around the world that are doing this as well so yes Hashimoto's and all autoimmune diseases that I've seen respond very very well to uh carnivore Elimination Diet um uh let's see uh D Ford asks are electrolytes necessary usually not usually you'll get everything that you need from just the meat that you're eating because this is actually what we're designed to eat and so you should get everything that you need you shouldn't have to supplement if you're eating a biologically appropriate diet right you know animals in the wild they don't supplement they just eat so electrolytes generally no you don't sometimes when you're transitioning from eating carbohydrates into any ketogenic diet because of the drops in your insulin sometimes your body has a bit more difficulty regulating your electrolytes and so you might have a bit of a disturbance early on generally that corrects on its own if it happens at all most people it doesn't happen some people it does and maybe you just have to take some electrolytes for the first couple weeks generally you don't have to after that um but you know if you're having a problem and you have a deficiency and you actually take a blood test and you actually have you know a you know a low electrolytes on uh your blood tests you know take some electrolytes it's not that big of a deal most people will equate cramping with low electrolytes that's not always the case quite often that's dehydration not getting enough water and you can see this by the fact that a lot of people will just take copious amounts of electrolytes and they'll still be getting all the cramps they'll still be getting all the nighttime crayons they'll still be getting the exact same uh experience with it and so well obviously it's not the electrolytes then because they're taking electrolytes and nothing's changing right so then you tell those people hey drink a lot more water and they go away so that that's quite often what happens uh what to do with a knee with no ligament and arthritis in the hands well you know there there is damage that you can do to your body I have damage that I've done to my body from you know years of sports and uh doing stupid things and um you know so those aren't necessarily those aren't going to heal themselves you know you're not gonna you're not gonna you know regrow ligaments necessarily you know the body can do some amazing things but you know it's um it's uh that's a you know not something that I would I would hold out much hope for uh arthritis you're not going to regrow your cartilage that that we know of but you will significantly by going on a carnivore diet or even a ketogenic diet you're going to significantly reduce the inflammation in your body ketones just having higher ketones significantly reduce inflammation in your body and you're also eliminating out a lot of things that cause inflammation in your body so you will experience the pain and discomfort and disability of arthritis far less and so I think your life will improve a lot from that as well um let's see so hi doc question how how does it work to be on a carnivore animal based and also play sports do we need a bit of carbs I always feel a bit shaky with no carbs at all uh no you definitely don't need carbs I um I think that it actually detracts from your performance because when you eat carbohydrates you raise your insulin insulin blocks proteolysis it blocks lipolysis it stops your body from being able to produce energy from fat and so the only energy you have available is in your muscle and liver glycogen and that will run out that runs out in a couple hours so if you're doing really high intensity work you're going to you're going to hit the wall and you're going to crash um if you're fat adapted and you're on keto or carnivore you make all the blood sugar liver glycogen muscle glycogen and ketones that you need instead of only running on the glycogen and glucose that you have in your system and you're tapped into your fat Source you're constantly replenishing all your glycogen and glucose and ketones so you will not run out right like you have even the very slender person has has weeks of fat reserves left over unless you're just completely emaciated and on the verge of starvation and death um you you have weeks of energy left in you and so no you know exercise or or sport or whatever is gonna is gonna crash you out because you're constantly uh tapping into your fats fat stores this is shown by Professor Tim Knox who is one of the top the world's experts in exercise physiology and sports medicine and he was one of the guys for like you know 30 years who was saying you need carbs to burn carbs you've got to do these high performance athletes that you have to have carbs you have to have carbs you have to have carbs and he has you know in the last you know decade or so come out and said like oh my god I've been lying to people for 30 years I'm so sorry uh no you don't need carbs in fact you don't want carbs for the the reasons I just mentioned he's done randomized controlled trials where you have people who are eating athletes who are eating carbs and ones that are keto adapted fat adapted and they have the exact same ability and output in their in their performance initially and then going longer term the keto adapted fat adapted guys do way better because they never crash they never hit the wall they just keep going and then they switched it so the people that were keto adaptive fat adapted they had them eating carbs and then they got the other guys fat adapted and then they ran the tests again they found the same results the ones that were on carbs and the ones that were off carbs they had the exact same uh exercise potential and output until they hit the wall and then the fat adapted guys took over so that's um that to me is is sort of a uh you know end of this story but really for me I I just me as an athlete I have never performed better and felt better and could go longer and go harder and get better results than when I was on a pure carnivore diet when you eat carbohydrates that shuts that down you can think of it like you know when people go on you know running marathons or doing you know Iron Man and things like that they're talking about hitting the wall you know you go and you go and you go and you have to carbo load and fill all that because you don't want to hit the wall you want to push the wall as far away as you can but eventually you hit the wall and you feel like garbage and most people stop and sit down and and that's where they they call it a day then other people that are you know more determined they're pushing they're pushing they want to push themselves until they push through the wall and they say that you can you can push yourself and you can break through the wall and um you can break through the wall and then you get your second wind and your Runners high and you just feel amazing and you can just go forever and go forever and the harder you go the better you feel right well what that is metabolically is you're eating a bunch of carbohydrates your insulin is high it stays high for about 24 hours and then what you know you will run out of your liver glycogen and muscle collection and you'll run out of energy your blood sugar will drop and you'll hit the wall and you'll feel like garbage because you cannot replenish your blood sugar and you cannot replenish your glycogen and you cannot tap into your fat stores normally this is going to take about 24 hours before that resolves but if you push and you push and you push you can actually force your metabolism back in to start mobilizing your fat store so you don't die so that's what's happening so I live in my second wind I am always in my runner's high when I start working out I'm always burning fat and I'm always feeling better so the harder I push myself the more energy I burn the better I feel and the harder I want to go and the more energy I burn the better I feel the harder I want to go so it's a positive feedback I just want to go and go and go and go and so you know I don't run into the wall I don't uh have to you know uh crash and force my way through I'm always feeling amazing so for high performance athletes or any athletes or any sport you have a monster Advantage when you're keto adapted fat adapted on Carnivore when you're eating what you're supposed to eat okay um you know I know I know several Sports Medicine doctors in Australia who work with some of the top rugby players in Australia and New Zealand and I can tell you that some of the top players in rugby league league and Union are on carnivore and they are not telling people because they don't want people to know about it because this is their this is their secret advantage and they are taking full advantage of it while they can and revitalizing their careers and just crushing it and you know some people have actually come out and spoken to the papers about it and um you know and there are a lot of others who are not talking about it because they don't want the secret to get out and so you know yes this is uh this is something that is really going to benefit you in sports and everything else um so a question here is like do you what do you think about the whole fat debate uh what fat percentage do you roughly recommend for men versus women so for me that that debate isn't isn't really a debate it's just you need to get enough fat and you need to get enough protein for your body and your body's going to have different demands depending on if you're a man or a woman depending on your goals depending on your exercise level and whether you're pregnant or not and and all these different sorts of things so I think that you can you really can eat intuitively I don't think you have to just you know count your Macros and and pick what you're doing I think that you know if you if you need a calculator to figure out what to eat that you're probably eating the wrong thing and that you you shouldn't have to do that you know gorillas and koalas and lions they don't count calories they don't count macros they don't you know pull off their calculator to figure out you know how much you know nutrients are getting in they just eat you know they eat what they're supposed to eat and they stop when they don't feel like eating anymore so they're not forcing themselves to eat and I think that's what that's what we need to do as well it does turn out that usually it's like one to one you need one gram of protein for every gram of fat that turns out to be around 70 calories from fat 30 calories from protein roughly that's going to change depending on the person depending on their situation so maybe aim for that and then adjust you know I do a a bunch of videos on how to figure that out um there's carnivore for beginners um you know tips tricks and pitfalls and another one called fiber constipation and diet and where I go and try to tell you to how to figure out how to get enough fat basically it comes down to your digestion if you're only eating meat and water then your body has a limited capacity for absorbing fat okay you make bile bile emulsifies fat that's how you absorb fat you really can't absorb fat otherwise you can absorb you know you have some natural abilities of of absorbing like some medium chain fatty acids but a very small percentage of them so when you're eating when you're eating um you know fat and you run out of bile your liver only makes a certain amount of bile use about 800 milliliters to a liter depending on the size of the person a day and so when that's gone you know you really can't absorb fat so what happens that excess fat goes out of your body you you literally cannot absorb it right and so you know I think there's a sort of this overflow valve uh that's how I think about it is overflow valve on fat where it's really you really can't overeat fat because oh you don't want to eat too much fat what what does that mean your body can only absorb a certain amount and your body's very efficient it's not going to make a bunch of bile if it doesn't want you to absorb fat with that you know I think that you know our bodies are very very efficient they know they don't just make a whole bunch of products just for the hell of it just to get a random amount of fat you know they they your body made that amount of bottle because it wanted that amount of fat and once you get that your body's like yeah we don't need any more and so it just goes out right that excess fat is what keeps your stool soft so if you have dry hard stools which is what constipation is it's not in frequency of stools it's the consistency of the stools you can easily go on a carnivore diet only once or twice a week and very small volume because there's just not much to go because you're absorbing 98 of the meat that you're eating that's a good thing you're supposed to absorb the things that you're eating you're not eating rocks here we're not eating dirt and wood you know you're eating things that you're supposed to absorb otherwise why are you eating it um so you want to absorb this stuff and you know you're going to absorb every ounce of fat that you eat if you're you're not getting enough fat your stools are dry that means you're absorbing every ounce of fat that you're eating and you probably need more you probably have you know more bile available for you so you want to keep eating fat until you have normal stools normal soft consistency stools if you're eating a lot more fat then your body can absorb then you can get loose stools okay this is like what that's saying is like fat through a goose where you you give you know Goose a chunk of fat just out of it's out through them in a you know a minute or two right you know they can't absorber just shoots right out of them that happens to you the other side of it is if you're really not getting enough fat you can get so constipated that it causes a blockage and only liquid stools can get around that and you get what's called spurious diarrhea or overflow diarrhea and so that alternates between these dry hard pebbly uh stools and like liquid stool so that means you're so constipated there's like liquid coming around um so yeah so it says hi can I go for a marathon with just a half marathon three weeks before or unless I run a 32k first so I'm not a distance Runner I've never trained for uh those things before I've just you know just played rugby and done a lot of you know just training for that and Fitness training for that so I don't know the best uh best uh advice to give you there but you know uh the best way to to train for anything is to do it you know so if you're running if you're you know running a marathon before you compete I mean like I'm I'm playing I you know I'm playing scrimmages I'd you know uh do Sprints and drills and all these sorts of things to get in preparation for the games and playing practice games and practice matches and things like that in order to play the game so if you want to get better at running marathons run more marathons that's that's my advice oh goodness um move what's happening here sorry okay all right oh let's see the next question is thoughts on autophagy and related research by David Sinclair so I don't know all of his stuff but I don't know exactly what you're referring to with David Sinclair but Sinclair is a professor at Harvard he's done a lot of research into anti-aging and actually reversing the aging process which is really interesting and uh you know and I'm really excited to see where he goes with that and what he ends up figuring out because I wanna I want I want in you know and um uh an autophagy so you know autophagy or autophagy which I think is probably more uh proper way of pronouncing it is um is when your body's clearing out these sort of you know older run down uh cells or even the parts they're in so the different organelles are just sort of run down and worn out like different you know macrophages or sorry um uh mitochondria and different sorts of organelles and things like that so you're sort of recycling these things and you're and you're rebuilding new ones that that work better and are tuned up and that's really good that's really important and we find that you don't really do that when you're eating carbs okay you're eating carbohydrates you're eating sugar your body just shuts down those processes and you and you can't really uh recycle these these dead and dying cells and organelles uh so when you go when you fast we know that you get a lot of this turnover the cell turnover and these organelle turnovers uh autophagy and um but you also get mitophages so mitochondria doing this and all the different organelles uh you know are going to be recycled and they're going to work better and they're going to be more efficient and they're going to be and you're going to be more healthy and more more vibrant so we also know that it's not just fasting it's just being in the metabolism that you're supposed to be in any way I don't think that that's a fasting metabolism even though that's what I was taught in Biochemistry I think that that is our that is our primary metabolic state that is the metabolic state of all basically all animals in the wild including humans because humans just eat meat in the wild right uh can you heal fatty liver on Carnivore yes you can um fatty liver is just caused by eating certain things and so you stop eating those things and fatty liver goes away but so back to David Sinclair you will on a carnivore diet on a ketogenic diet or just fasting you will go through autophagy you will stimulate stem cells you will do a lot better health-wise and so you know people are just literally aging backwards and you know we know uh as geneticists for 20 years now that human beings are designed to live 120 years right so why are we dying in our 60s and 70s right I mean that's literally middle age so why aren't we getting there you know that's because we're eating poison and slow poison is still poison you die 40 years early you've been poisoned all right um so you know I think I think a major thing that David Sinclair should look at is is things like that I mean he I don't think he's from from listening to some of the things that he said on diet he said that from what I know from one of the things I've heard maybe changes my sense then but from the things that he said uh it was just like well you know I haven't really looked into diet and all that sort of stuff but you know this the the all the studies say that like a Mediterranean diet is the best okay so that's where he's going on he hasn't really looked into this and uh looking at nutritional studies and epidemiological studies not great evidence you know so you need to look at better evidence and you look paleontological record you need to look at uh you know comparative Anatomy you need to look at our physiology and a lot of other things as well and you can look at the these carnivorous relatives of bars like the Inuit the Maasai hadza the Nanette many many more examples and they are very healthy they don't get the diseases of the West End Australian aboriginals obviously um all these all these people did not get all these Western diseases now called human diseases because now animals are getting them they're like oh we only see these in humans they're are human diseases and what are you doing why why are zoo animals getting human diseases because you're feeding them human food you're feeding them things that they don't eat in the wild you're feeding dogs and cats things they don't eat they shouldn't eat normally and then getting human diseases we're eating things that we don't in the wild we're eating things that we didn't evolve on we are getting these human diseases as well because as I've said before I don't think that these so-called chronic diseases are diseases per se I think that there are toxicities and malnutrition toxic buildup of species inappropriate diet and a lack of species-specific nutrition so namely too many plants that were not evolved or adapted to to eat and safely and break down and detoxify their their poisons and extract nutrients from and not enough meat which is what our Vital necessary nutrition source is so those are my thoughts I think if you combine the work of David Sinclair with a carnivore diet you're going to be doing a lot better than anyone else has in a very long time since like Methuselah um do you drink raw milk and thoughts I don't drink raw milk I generally don't drink milk at all if I were to have dairy I would aim to have raw dairy um but I just tend not to eat dairy I just eat meat and and drink water generally sometimes have you know some cheese with meat or whatever I very very rarely will have milk raw milk's not really available in Australia it's a crime apparently and so um that's a bit rich but it's um it's better than homogenized pasteurized milk but I don't think that it's really ideal you know and you will still have enough lactose in it that you'll get an insulin response and you'll disrupt your metabolism and metabolic State and so I tend to avoid it for those reasons um next question here do I have a salt routine is it something you track I don't so I don't track it I just salt to taste I've just noticed my tastes are just changing where I'm getting I'm using less and less salt as I go you know I stop using salt off the other for a couple weeks or maybe I think I made it about a week just to see how it was um things tasted you know uh sort of bland but still okay a lot of people will say that when they give up salt you know for a couple weeks it it tastes pretty bland but then things actually start normalizing uh in your taste I didn't have any downsides um at all I wasn't getting cramps I wasn't having low energy I didn't feel bad at all so um it looked fine or it felt fine um and then I just sort of lightly salted things because I sort of like to use the salt to sort of dry out the meat a bit when I put them on the racks in the in the fridge that just sort of helps it you know sort of preserve longer and age a bit better uh does carnivore help with underactive thyroid yes it does I generally see patients you know underactive thyroid is and Hashimoto's is very under diagnosed it's something that people don't always always look into and um and uh and think about uh as as being something that can affect them and affect their health but it is definitely something that um uh you know shows up a lot more than people realize and so we see a lot of this in in our functional medicine practice because people are coming to us because they're just basically you know they're just sort of fed up and they just feel sort of not their best and they've heard that you know we can make them feel better and optimize their health and they come in and we check a battery of things and one of those things is we we thoroughly check the thyroid and a lot of people have underactive thyroids and we put those people on even other just diet and lifestyle changes getting people to exercise more intermittent fasting you know eating Whole Foods not a bunch of processed garbage or carbs they will all improve their thyroid um carnivore absolutely does that as well it really helps thyroid as well so yeah I think that that's something that and there's different causes of of thyroid dysfunction any sort of problems but for the ones that are caused by disruption of the of eating the wrong things then 100 carnivore can help that um well carnivore diet help silence my tinnitus it can it depends on what's causing your uh tinnitus but it's um you know there are different sorts of inflammatory processes that can cause uh tinnitus and you will reduce significantly the amount of um the amount of um inflammation that you have and so I would uh yeah I would uh I would definitely say that that can be helpf ul um carnivore down under thank you very much for the",

      "text": "I did it's by pure luck uh thank you very much for the I did it's by pure luck uh thank you very much for the Super Chat uh they ask why does the brain naturally prefer sugar if it's bad so that's the thing you know that's something that people say it naturally prefers but it it doesn't actually it depends on how you look at it or it depends on if you look at it if you look at it you'll see that even if when your blood sugar is high if your ketones come up to a certain level it'll dump out the glucose and just run on ketones so once you reach a threshold your brain will exclusively run on ketones certain parts can only run on glucose the majority of it this applies to with the ketones so it is claimed I think erroneously that the brain's primary resource and fuel is sugar because when we're in our primary um primary metabolic State you know when we're eating we're in a Fed State uh your brain is mostly running on glucose it is still running on ketones your brain always runs on ketones it has to run on ketones to a certain extent um that they're like okay well this must be what it primarily runs on because this is your primary metabolic State So that's its primary nutrient Source but again I disagree with that I don't think that's our primary metabolic Source I think that our so-called fasting metabolic state is our primary source I think we call the FED say our primary State Because by the time we're able to look at biochemistry at a molecular level everyone was eating carbs right and so I said oh when you eat it looks like this and when you donate it looks like that it's like yeah when you eat anything except carbohydrates it also looks like that and you know when I eat 5 000 calories in rib eye I am not fasting that is not a fasting metabolism right so that is misnamed right so when you're in your primary metabolic state or just have higher ketones your brain will quick click over and just run on ketones and those certain areas of the brain will run on on glucose um also it's not that blood sugar is bad or carbohydrates per se are bad it's that exogenous carbohydrates exogenous sugars eating foods containing sugars plant sugars because there are carbohydrates in meat of course and glycogen and things like that but plant sugars and plant carbohydrates the reason that the that is bad that is not what your body wants that disrupts your body's normal um biochemical processes and so your blood sugar goes up artificially your body freaks out goes oh my goodness this is going to kill you because high blood sugar damages your body these glucose molecules physically fuse to other molecules called glycations non-enzymatic binding of those uh carbohydrate molecules to other molecules and it damages them irreversibly in most cases so um that is harmful and so our bodies look at that and go sweet Jesus what is this idiot done and it slams up your insulin to try to get this stuff out of your system as quickly as possible but that insulin disrupts a lot of your uh hormonal and biochemical processes a lot of them you know it can precipitate you know blocking the conversion of testosterone into estrogen and the ovaries in women so they get you know too high AI testosterone to low estrogen they can develop PCOS and everyone it can actually precipitate high blood pressure as well it can cause a lot of problems a lot of problems and so it's um it's just something to understand that it's not something you want to take in we make all the blood sugar glycogen and and ketones that we need you know we don't need to bring in extra carbohydrates we make carbohydrates you do not need to bring them in Brenda shoot thank you very much for the",

    "body": {
      "text": "and black tape green lime thank you again for for the and black tape green lime thank you again for for the Super Chat uh they ask thoughts on Thor's on women I'm assuming that's thoughts on women on keto carnivore women's hormones do play a huge part on cravings and energy levels do you think we should approach the diet differently no I don't I don't think you have to approach it differently you know there's no examples of of females of any species that eat differently than the males right so you may eat less but you still need to eat the same thing and again you need to get enough meat enough fat enough protein and yes it absolutely uh will optimize your hormones for men and for women like I mentioned just getting rid of carbohydrates really helps with PCOS which is the leading cause of infertility in women and again insulin blocks the conversion because women first of all you start with with cholesterol so you're not getting enough cholesterol not get cholesterol in your diet you're not going to make enough hormones because your hormones are made from cholesterol we make about we only make about 70 of the cholesterol that we need you need the rest from your dietary intake Okay so you need this for your normal hormonal health so you're not getting enough cholesterol and you're not getting enough fat you're not going to be making the the the hormones that you need there are many many hormones between cholesterol and uh estrogen the last one being testosterone so women make testosterone first and that gets converted into estrogen in the kidney and then the ovaries insulin blocks that so insulin will block the conversion of testosterone into estrogen so the testosterone will be much too high estrogen will be much too low and you will get serious hormonal dysregulation so that and many other reasons you know there are different plants that are hormone disruptors there's a lot of phytoestrogens like in soy you know there's there's I don't know 10 or 20 times the amount of phytoestrogens in three ounces of soy than a fertile woman will make in a day there's 50 times more phytoestrogens in those three ounces of soy then in the birth control pill so these are these are not what you want in your body if you're wanting to optimize your hormonal health and there's other things that can block your estrogen and block your testosterone and derange things in other ways because the plant is trying to mess you up the plan is saying you eat me I'm it's going to cost you all right they do not want it to be advantageous for you to eat them because they die when you eat them so you know just like you know animals can run away or fight back they've got horns they can kick they can fight they can bite they have defenses they have ways of stopping you from eating them because they don't want to be eaten either no living thing wants to be eaten okay so you know you need to understand that and different living things have different defenses and the defenses of a stationary plant or fungus or algae is that they use these toxins and these biotoxins and defense chemicals to stop you from eating them and to get sick and to get poisoned if you do and to sequester nutrients and make it hard for you to function properly and to get any nutrients from this a lot of the nutrients are are bound up in ways that we don't have the enzymes to break down because we're not designed to eat those plants they have other things like phytic acid oxalates tannins that bind to different nutrients and make them completely unavailable we cannot get rid of these sorts of things someone's asking about estrogen and raw milk I don't know how much estrogen raw milk but it's it's nowhere near the amount that's in um that's in soy and one of the things too that people talk about you know like red meat I actually had a a patient that had breast cancer and her oncologist said you know don't eat red meat because it has all this estrogen in it so it was already supposed to eat about a bunch of plants basically right seed some tofu my Jesus there's 3.9 nanograms of estrogen in a hormone-treated cow in three ounces of lean hormone treated beef okay there's over a million nanograms of phytoestrogen in uh three ounces of soy okay little different the birth control pill depending on the pill has about 35 000 nanograms of estrogen a fertile woman makes over 150 000 nanograms of estrogen so you go so 3.9 nanograms in in meat like who cares that that means nothing it means nothing you know and yet we've been told that this is a big deal all these hormones that are put into it no no this this is a drop in the bucket it's not doing anything and it's a it's a con it is just a con and it's a a marketing trick to sell their garbage and their slop and just don't buy it meat is our natural diet meat is good for you meat is what we're evolved to eat meat is what we're supposed to eat we are not supposed to eat plants we are not designed and adapted to do that safely like a cow is but cows are not designed and adapted to eat all plants they eat very specific plants they eat grass and they don't even need all grasses they eat specific grasses so you know sheep and cows you have them in the same pasture because they eat different grasses right so they can coexist they're not competing for resources okay so this is very very important to understand this uh and Esther borosh oh very good to see you thank you very much for joining um says Dear Dr Chaffey have you checked out the the dutronomics course by Dr Wars I haven't yet but that is something I definitely plan on doing um deuteronomics is the study of deuterium um and biology in our body very interesting for people that are interested in that uh please check out the interview I did uh with with um Dr Laszlo borosh who's a professor emeritus of pediatrics at the school of medicine at UCLA as a research biochemistry researcher there at UCLA for for decades and now he's um uh teaching deuteronomics uh in in Hungary and um and so that's something he has a course that you can check out online and that's something I'm going to do but uh do check that out um check out that interview I have with him and um and uh Dr Gabor Somali who's also uh you know one of the world's experts in uh deuterium so very very interesting stuff in how this affects your health and when you're in ketosis when you're in ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet this actually improves that side of things as well so another another piece of the puzzle as well okay all right guys well if we if we don't have any uh more burning questions I think we might leave it there it's been sort of an hour and a half and um L's passed out on on the couch next to me so I should probably uh get going but uh thank you everyone uh for for coming by I hope that was that was helpful for people and if you you like that and you thought this was helpful you know please share it with people and let them know um uh where they can sort of find these things and I'll somehow try to put up some some tags on the questions and things like that and or if someone is able to do that um and put up the the sort of the um uh the the timestamps on all this so I can put it on YouTube so people can uh you can sort of see the the questions and Skip and Skip around to them uh that would be very very helpful uh thank you guys very very much I am going to try to do these more uh you know potentially every uh sort of week or two and I'll do obviously I do these every week with my patreon group and so you guys are more than welcome to come there but you don't have to you don't have to pay for anything that I do that's just something that um can provide a little more support and so if that's something you want then then please come by but uh otherwise we'll see you here next time okay all right guys thank you very much and um we'll see you later and please do you know hit the bell and like And subscribe that really does help uh you know grow the channel and and get this out to more people the more people that are engaged the more people that like and uh comment uh the more it helps the algorithms and you know so if you're just I mean just say whatever just comment whatever just say anything the smiley face fire symbol like whatever the hell it doesn't matter it just it does help and it picks things up in the algorithms and and it helps get things out to more people so thank you very very much everyone I really appreciate it and uh looking forward to seeing you guys again yes I do want to do the quiz all right thanks guys",
