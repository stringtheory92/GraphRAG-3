    "transcript": "I was just reading them on my own all the time and uh when we threw out the idea in the book club I thought it was a great idea good opportunity to get the points of view from other other folks that we read the book with and it's kind of become a family to me they're not all Conor they're they're whatever they are but we like their ideas and we learn from them that's great about book book Bo so what were some of your thoughts on that discussion and that idea that we should be investigating other people even if we don't agree with them hello and welcome to another episode of

would an absolute honored is to welcome you back to balance body radio thanks for having me back uh one of my favorite people to talk too and one of my favorite things to talk about so I'm very excited to be here Ah that's great I I've Loved hanging out with you we've got to hang out in person twice um it was a little bit warmer in San Diego than it was in Denver in February so that was really nice to sit by the beach by the water and um have lunch and hang out and chat and yeah I love chatting with you we had this idea actually to do a kind of special episode today about the book club and I want to just kind of tee this up by saying like all of us in the low carb or carnivore space we have our heroes right like we've got Dr Anthony chafy we've got Dr sha Baker we've got Dr kenberry and Kevin stock and all these guys and and you know women in the space who are doing such amazing work they're all super fit they look amazing and yet there's also this the the community underneath that is following all these people they're just kind of everyday people and the book club has been such an amazing collection of people around the world who have amazing stories to tell and it's just been really interesting to kind of participate in what has been your experience with hosting this book club it has been a fantastic experience I think you summed it up so perfectly there I think we are in a really strange like place and time in our in our human existence is kind of how if I take a step back and look at it where we've all seemed to have you know especially anyone in this nutrition space woken up to a time and a place where what we're supposed to eat is just a big question mark and if you're lucky you know most people don't even know that there has to be questioned and we are for those of us who have realized that there are different ways to eat that can really improve our health we're trying to figure out well okay if this works for me now and I'm in this community and I've had this experience and I'm feeling so much better how on Earth am I going to make sense of the rest of the world and exist in society around me when I'm so different to everyone else and look at you know every time we go to the supermarket you're in this position where you're looking and staring at all these products in the aisles and you're going what is all of what is going on you know and as you said there's many experts that have helped us get to this point and it's fantastic that they are that they exist thank God they do um and they've allowed us to reclaim our health but once you've done that I think what people are finding is that they're in this position where they don't know what to do next they maybe want to question some of the things that they think they know because they've kind of appreciate that they've stumbled upon it out of out of kind of luck maybe and the YouTube algorithm how they found some of these people that helped them through um but maybe they could have done gone down a different path and maybe they would have been a totally different diet so it almost is the whole kind of happen stance of it I think has left people a little bit unsettled by where we're all at and so we're asking questions and people are asking questions about well okay I feel amazing but why is it that this person also says the opposite and he feels amazing and they have an argument that seems to be evidence backed and and they make sense as well and how do I reconcile it with what I've heard and and you you left kind of asking these questions and you're also left in you know having to interact with people around you and justify yourself and I think that's how um this kind of came about is we're asking questions because we want to be able to uh be able to put forward what we're doing with conviction and be able to explain it to people and you know just it's just like a language if you understand a language and you can hear it it's not the same as you know talking the language yourself and having the confidence to do that and so I think we've all just kind of come together in this journey we're in this community um as part of Dr Anthony P um ch's Patron as you mentioned and it's a fantastic Community amazing people as you said but we just found ourselves asking about the same kind of questions about the same kind of time so we started to read books and then we realized that we're all reading the same books at the same time so we thought um you know one of my ideas was well let's just run a book club and and do it together and and have conversations about what we're reading and I think that just it just evolved because the need was there and people are in the situation together and you know we happen to have some fantastic people in the community and um and and so yeah about a year and a over a year ago uh we we put together this book club and I'll tell you some stories about how it started out it wasn't as good as it is now um but we've been you know reading away meeting every week asking questions of each other I'm probably a little bit of an antagonist in the mix because I like to really challenge everyone even though I think we can be at risk of sitting in our sitting on our Laurels a little bit feeling a bit confident that we you know our health is so great um and we need to kind of question it we solved it but I think we should still always be ready for what what people will do which was is to question us at some point in time um so I I always have that kind of Devil's Advocate position and was try and like make sure that we're not getting dogmatic about what we believe and that we're open-minded and that we're really challenging ourselves and and looking at all points of view so we've even done a book that which is like the total opposite to everything we we think and believe and that was pretty challenging month um but it worked in the end it worked so so so we've yeah we've kind of evolved and we found ourselves here and it really works really well everyone is very very tight-knit and really knows what what's going on in everyone everyone else's life and um and we chat about everything that we are everything we're reading you know the kind of questions that are naturally brings up for us the experiences that we relate to within the book and um and we're just learning so much along the way so yeah it's working really well at the moment I love that well I'm so excited to ask you more questions about the book club we've got a special format today though where we're going to be inviting in some of the members of the book club my I don't know if it's graded or not if attendance is graded my attendance is less than Stellar in the book club as it falls in a very tricky time in my schedule so as you're talking about the community it makes me very jealous because um it's it's a wonderful community at the times that I've been able to participate you really get a sense of you know the people that are in the community and asking really genuine questions and so since you know these people much better than I do I'm going to turn the microphone over to you a little bit more I might have some questions here and there and again I'll have some questions for you along the way but um we're going to invite our first person in to our conversation which is Mike I believe um and so we're going to let him in now there we go hello Mike hey Casey Olivia how you guys doing very good like the hatot mik oh yeah good one well welcome to the show Mike we're honored to have you and I believe Olivia might have some questions for you and we'd love to hear your story about how you found the car diet in Cha's book club okay thank you I'd love to talk about it might give you just intro yourself and um and tell us what you what you think so far of it all uh yeah yeah I guess uh U thanks for having me first all um my name is Mike uh I live in Las Vegas I've been in keto more seriously uh since about 2012 and carnivore since 2018 uh the highest weight weight I ever measured was about 415 PBS uh when I started this current lifestyle and maintained it ever since though I was about 380 because I got down about 380 through keto uh and then from 380 now I'm down hovering around 220 uh and I'm just healing I'm just taking my time I'm not in any hurry the weight's just a side benefit but you know I'm just healing from everything I did up through my 40s so I'm 57 now um but yeah I've watched a lot of Casey's videos that you know I got into this whole lifestyle from or when I started doing carnivore I I I watched a lot of videos Casey has so many great guests on and it gives me an idea of where to start and then I search from there because the guest giv such great information and then um you know I get a just go from those opinions and move on from there um as far as book club which is I love um I was never in a a book club prior to this I was just reading them on my own all the time and uh when we threw out the idea in the book club I thought it was a great idea good opportunity to get the points of views from other other folks that we read the book with and it's kind of become a family to me so I I I pretty much go to Discord every day and then I look forward to book club every week it's very nice of you to say that Mike but that wasn't the experience at the start was it so tell us what it's been in month one no no no no no in the beginning um I gota say yeah our first book was uh Guns Germs and Steel and I remember I didn't really agree a lot with the author he he kind of has some ideas but I was like well and I thought I I mentioned to you and I think Jared Offline that I don't know if I'm going to continue doing this I don't agree this guy just rubs me the wrong way I don't like his ideas and you said um uh you know you reminded me you know unless we Embrace other ideas we can't just you know be in a vacuum and learn from what and how they originate how they got to where they are see the full picture um I I decided to continue on I did that and I'm glad I did because we learned so much from other views it helps us you know if we just read the same thing we always read we don't learn we just confirm and I like that part the confirmation confirmation but I really enjoy the the growing the learning the finding out how much better things can be putting it together yeah also felt very sorry for me that month because I was picking on you to say things in book club all the time and if you left we had no book club and so I think you just took pity on me at that point uh no I I was I appreciate you you're you're the best best thing this our Discord has and you you brought the book club here and you know you you bring in authors we had you know another another thing was we we were reading the Big Fat Surprise and Olivia gave us a Big Fat Surprise with nah the author actually showing up to our final meeting so it was like holy cow we we got an author who who we've been reading and sitting there and answering questions I was like what book club does that I don't know if they all do but this was great I was like Wow and ever since then for like the last 10 12 book we I think we've read about 10 or 12 we've we've had the authors there we've had like bman we've had I mean every everybody can think of they all they all show up so what a great opportunity pick their brains see what they're doing and uh wow I'm just impressed like I said it's very and then I feel like the the authors are kind of in the family because we just talk with them they're they're not you know they can be themselves a little more than trying to appeal to a larger audience we're we're like a niche group they're not all carnivores they're they're whatever they are but we like their ideas and we we learn from it that's great about book club book club is awesome yeah I mean I was just it just kind of happened that way because I was working with Nina at the time and and we were doing her book and I said to her would you be able to come along and just talk to us and let us ask you questions so I didn't tell anyone in the group that we were going to do that um but I said just make sure you're there please just make sure you turn up um and and so it was nice to to bring Nina out that was our first that was our second book so not the one that Mike described as being very difficult to start with but the second one we went from basically a really difficult book to start with that we all found hard to read to having Nina on for the second book which was a big fat surprise so that kind of set itself on this path of saying well let's just keep asking the authors along and we happen to know quite a few of them from my work and through Anthony as well and they've just been showing up and it makes sense from their point of view because you know we're giving you know their book a lot of attention and then U we can ask them questions and they get to speak to real readers that have read that book and are coming up with real you know genuine questions it's not like any other kind of format so that's what that seems to have just continued to to be a feature and you know I think I've ruined it for anyone else who wants to join a future book club because why would you read a book if you can't ask the author with questions at the end so yeah that's worked really well that's amazing Mike what were some of the other authors that really stood out to you um well you know got them all here I mean like uh we just did Lear Kei last book uh she impressed the the heck out of me um her story her her struggle where she she was almost dead and she said she was almost dead she spoke to this Guru guy and he kind of could send her whole thing where she was your dad inside basically she's like whoa took the change she went she was vegan vegan vegetarian went carnivore healed her up she looks great she is so vibrant so energetic uh I think she was great um B bigman was great uh let me down here bigman's great um yeah Diana Rogers uh Robert lustig bman Malcolm Kendrick valy Norton Jane buckon Chris Palmer uh Jared Diamond uh Will Harris we're on him now we're reading that one his uh a bold return to giving a dam great book we're almost done with that but um you know we also read Simon Hills book oh that one um the proof is in the whatever something anyway none of us really agreed with him obviously he's he's got so many he throws out these straw man arguments he's just very you know just watching a lot of his videos as well but we we wanted to bring it in because he's different let's hear what he's got to say maybe you know maybe we might learn something uh you know about ourselves and about each other because we get in discussions and sometimes times the discussion branches off from the book we have these little side conversations and and it it it's like I said it's a family thing it's like than Thanksgiving family sitting around table we talk about everything but um yeah just just great authors all those authors they're all great they they have so much knowledge so much to share I'm glad we got to share and meet them we met just about every one of them so it's really great awesome wow well Mike your story is absolutely incredible so grateful to be able to meet you um I'm just really close to you in Salt Lake City so um I'll be visiting Olivia sometime to watch Formula 1 in England and I'll be visiting you sometime to watch Formula 1 in Las Vegas um besides that thank you so very much for coming on our show today and sharing your story um it's it's just it's really inspiring it's really inspirational and I really respect that you were able to take on content that you wouldn't necessarily agree with but to be able to hear it and understand the differences and just appreciate it for what it is I think that takes um a lot of courage and I I just really respect your story so thank you so very much for coming on and thank you for the kind words thank you Casey appreciate it appreciate you and Olivia both of you bye well thank you so much bye bye well that was a cool start Olivia yeah yeah probably worth me saying just um uh on on the time zones I think you said it was a global a glob um Enterprise this book club um but we are pretty much uh we have people from and you'll see Chris joining us next is in Melbourne Mike is kind of West Coast or Vegas and on the West Coast time zone then we have every single time zone in between the kind of landfilled way around the world so we are um we're going from East Coast Australia to West Coast USA all of Europe and everything in between and everyone from those that kind of range of um locations DS in every week for our book club um and so it does mean especially this time of the year when the way the clocks are you've got a massive difference in time so we've got people Jo joining at 11: p.m their time Mike joins at 400 am his time and and people getting up for it because they just want to be part of it um there's another lady Leanne who's wearing my kit and she decided to stay up the other night and she hadn't done the reading she knew she was going to be joining at 4:00 a.m. so she just read all through the night to catch up and then came straight into book club at 4 a.m. and was ready for book club because that's how dedicated she is be part of it like it just amazes me that people like people would not normally join calls at this time of the day in any other Walk of Life but people just love being part of this and having our discussions each week so it's just it's incredible to see to see that's amazing that's yeah that's exactly why I wanted to do this and bring these people in it's so inspiring um I I love Mike's Point about reading again some of the things that he didn't necessarily agree with and you're the perfect person to ask about this since you helped to host the public health collaboration debate um that was hosted earlier this year with um you know carnivores and plant-based people so what were some of your thoughts on that discussion and that idea that we should be investigating other people even if we don't agree with them oh I mean it's I guess it's just part of me to do that like I've always wanted to seek the opposite view it's it's you know even when I was very involved in in my previous life and kind of in political arguments and being being kind of close to one side of a political debate I was always always like actively seeking out the opposite side because until you have listened to the opposite side if you until you've lived in it until you have spoken to people and kind of breathed it you don't actually always get it like it's very easy to judge it from one side when you have a perception of what people think on that side and it's very easy just to put put that all down to people being ignorant or stupid or um you know just not having a worldly view or whatever it might be I hate when people are biased in that way or have a bias and they don't actively seek to do anything about it like everyone has a bias that's just natural but I think you have to make yourself understand the other side of the argument because I don't think your your argument is particularly good if you don't understand it and you can't um if you can't argue against it yeah it just means that your Viewpoint is is just is just your own um you know personal view which isn't that informed um so you know that comes through in the public health collaboration as well last year was the first time this year was the first time that we staged a debate and uh a discussion as we' like to call it and brought in people with differing views on purpose and it was a big question mark as to whether it could work because it could have gone really badly wrong there could have been you know there could have been you know very un conflicting views in a way which comes across as aggressive and it isn't positive and a good experience for people to learn and that's not what we wanted to do we wanted people to actually be able to to see all this information laid out side by side and get those those that kind of back and forth going so they can actually they can actually um just kind of qualify all these viewpoints they keep hearing once once they're put up against each other so I think I'm just naturally unfortunately like this I've pulled everyone into it even though they hated me for making them do the Simon Hill book and I said look we can do it we can get through it but um yeah probably some they're going to walk out I just had big hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just your meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys I think it's really important it's like Mike said like he was able to recognize that there were St men arguments they weren't very convincing and that's really important and and everybody is so unique and individual that carnivore might not work for everybody it's hard to imagine ourselves in other people's lives and so I I do think that Viewpoint is really important and on that note we've got our second guest ah here she is hello hello hello thank you so much for joining us join us in her pajamas every week and today is no exception what time any different except that I made sure I put on my finest robe for you we really appreciate that thanks for clasing up our show today what time is it where you are Chris just it's uh 25 2 in the morning but you know the things you do for book CL Club I know Mike gets up early for me every week so I'm happy to take one for the team wow you certainly are it's true to say we have never seen Chris not in pajamas so we don't know whether that actually is something she she does ever Venture down that road of dressing up but it's either really early or really late for you so so anyway that's we are so Chris I was just going to ask you a few questions to to share your experience with book club that we've been talking about um what just tell us you know a little bit about your journey what your overall thoughts are on the book club so far oh I love it I love it um it was one of the first things I didn't know about it when I joined the patreon group I joined the patreon group because um I was just so excited to have a um Carnival influencer in Australia even though he um Anthony does hail from America he I felt like he was close to home so I was um looking forward to supporting him and I just really loved his message and um then then when I joined and um book club had only just started you guys were just finishing your first book and um from what I what I read in the group it wasn't um super well received but you were going to persevere and uh try another one and um I love reading and um I really like uh trying to figure out how things work so I I have an engineering background and um so you know human bodies are so complicated and uh so are people in general and society and the way things work so I've really enjoyed learning more about um nutrition and all other aspects you know the way people think and how I've been LED down this this road of um mainstream uh nutrition you know it's just been like ey opening so I've really enjoyed learning all the different aspects um about uh about Carnival really well it's not even really about Carnival actually we're talking about nutrition and environment and everything in general uh so yeah I've just really enjoyed that you joined at the right time because that was the the month we had Nina on and what was your your reaction to that when it happened yeah so it was a you're very sneaky CU we had no idea and then there was going to be some sort of surprise like you were were really emphasizing that we should come to that session so there was going to be some sort of surprise and then I saw like a person join and I thought it was going to be Anthony because he hadn't been to book club then and I was like Yay you know this is this is excellent and then you know it wasn't Anthony it was her and it was like it was amazing and just the way that you are so well connected and you managed to get authors to come on and speak to us it is just invaluable because you know you you've read their book they've slaved away at this book and you know given us all this amazing information but you know especially someone like me often have some questions um didn't quite get everything there or maybe I got a bit confused about some things and to be able to ask the person directly who wrote This Book is just amazing it's and you know now the pressure ever since then the pressure's been on to you for you to to um we can only pick books basically where you're connected to the author pretty much sometimes I say look I really think we should read this book this month out there because I'm working with that but so anyway so yeah and then um I think I was just remembering like the time when we had Jane on and she was again I think one of the first authors and Jane has by the way become a little bit of an adopted book club member she turns up when she likes she's kind of an honorary status with us um and she's fantastic and we love to book and but I remember you challenging her on that book and we didn't know well at that point that was the first time we met her and just like you just said you had you had questions for her I had questions I'm like there are some in there are some inconsistency I'm really sorry j I actually hers is one of my favorites that we've covered I really really like her book she is very very thorough and covers all aspects of um you know uh food in terms of nutrition in terms of environment and in terms of ethics and that was the first book we did and her detail and her research is amazing um and because of that you know she might have put in extra detail or something anyway I'm like I'm a little bit confused why you I think it was about um I I don't remember some of the nutrients you know that are necessary in plant if you're in a restaurant and you don't you can't get the right Meats then order veg should choose the the vegetarian option and I'm like no surely not and then uh yeah and she said oh actually um I think she said her daughter picked up on that as well and anyway it was it was she was beautiful the way she you know she explained that she had to she couldn't go too extreme because she didn't want to lose too many people and you know we have to walk a very soft path when talking to other people about these things you know we we can't go too hardcore um so and she's not a carnivore herself but um yeah she's just yeah it was it was great and you know um she took my question and she answered it and was yeah I really appreciate appreciate that yeah yeah I think she even said I think you she said you're totally right I I shouldn't have done that and now that I'm looking back I wish i' written it differently and and we like and like I feel bad because it was such an amazing book like literally one of my favorites that we've covered so yeah no Jane's amazing um and then the other thing that I think is really good about our club is that everyone not only are we from all these different time zones which makes it very challenging to find times of the day I was saying how Leanne stayed up the other day all night and then um came straight to book club at 4:00 a. um but the other benefit of that is um is that we all have really interesting perspectives because we're in different places we've got different cultures we've got different backgrounds and experiences and so you're getting such a rich conversation that's qualified by such different experiences and um and maybe this is not the best example of it but for when we going through kind of the agriculture topic we can all check in on each other's countries like what happens in this part of farming in your part of the world and we thought that you know animals got treated this way and so people can go and check on that um and so that's that's definitely a benefit of of of having this kind of global footprint but I do remember one time where you were educating us Chris about um some of some Australian um habits yeah yeah we were talking about we were talking about fertilizing and natural fertilizers and um I don't know we always you know we always segue into all sorts of topics you know far beyond what the book covers and um we were something about um how we we might be able to fertilize our own ground and I'm like oh yeah you know like lemon trees you know you we on lemon trees and all of a sudden I realized from looking at all the faces looking back at me that perhaps that was just an Australian thing and so I then had to explain to everyone how you know in Australia most backyards have a lemon tree and after a bar you know at a barbecue you know the men don't bother going inside the house if they need to we they just we on the lemon tree and that's just like normal like uh so normal that I thought it was worldwide but apparently not so that was um that was quite funny but yes it's it is amazing to hear from all different people around the worlds with their cultures and their different um sort of life situations as well I mean we've got a couple of people who sort of are connected to Farms um and we've got some scientists and stuff in our group as well and you know other sort of lay people and just different people from all sorts of different Industries which really makes it interesting because all of a sudden you can see things from different perspectives as well so it's really amazing the diversity we have and everyone's just so lovely like I mean you guys figure I'd ask a lot of questions and you know there's I don't feel silly for asking questions it's really it's really very um welcoming group yeah it's so great to hear love that yeah I me you even pop in from time to time Casey so it's good to see you there too very occasional unfortunately yeah Casey comes along we have the author so he can just say hi to the author because he like he knows them so like yeah I can get like a virtual autograph that's what I'm looking for yeah bit of a selfie on the YouTube screen exactly exactly well Chris you mentioned lovely people in the group and you are absolutely very lovely as well so thank you so much for staying up in an ungodly hour to come on the show today and talk about your experience um I think it's really important to highlight the members of the community and you are a great example of that so thank you so very much for coming on to our show today and sharing your experience in the book club we really appreciate you okay thanks so much for having me on and I'll go back to bed now back to bed get some sleep thank you so much see you bye bye uh well Olivia that was a really cool example of um you know hearing some different stories and obviously we cover some very serious subject matter you cover serious subject matter you challenge people on their ideas but just like Chris said there's there's also like some funny things that happen so what are some of your favorite like funny moments over the course of of Hosting this book club I'm sure there's a few oh god there have been so many um there was one time we were like really really digging into the topic of cardiovascular disease and really trying to understand why you know why does it that this disease start and we we just thought that the more that we studied cardiovascular disease we were going to find the answer we were going to figure out what is the actual root cause of cardiovascular disease and we were we knew malol Kendrick was coming on we'd read his book some of us went off and read more of his books so really in the serious topic and um delving into it and one of our book club members an who's French and is just hilarious she was telling us about her previous heart attack and she'd had a stent put in and we we asked her you know what happened to the stent did it get taken out after I think it was like 10 years ago and she said no she went and had a checkup and her stent had disappeared and so then we were all all just sitting there wondering if that was good or not and whether Anne was going to be you know falling apart during book club and and and so I said well are you going to be okay okay like do you need to go and find your stent and figure out where it is or what is and then Roger another guy who's Scottish just said something and it set me off laughing so hard I was literally crying my eyes out and I had to leave the room and I had to ask someone to take over like I couldn't stop and every time I tried to restart book club I was crying with laughter because of this whole serious serious situation about an stent but her being so casual about it like it's just it's somewhere yeah gonna get dodged anytime soon is something gonna happen that's gonna kind of poke out your ear what's gonna happen we've had so many silly silly moments like that um gosh I don't even think of anymore but you know there's the one that Chris said about um about the lemon tree we were actually having a discussion at that point about would we or wouldn't we urinate on our own vegetable patch and then consume our like is that a good thing or not if if we're in this kind of cycle of trying to reuse things why is like human urine any worse than any other plant um kind of fertilizer which has animal um fees and urine in it and you know it's just a really like weird things that we kind of we spent like about 10es all debating that there just been so many silly moments like that as Mike said it's just like people chatting a lot of the time we keep it very well I can tell like even just with the two people that have popped on so far today they're so comfortable with you and around you and just answering questions like they're not normal like podcast guest you know what I mean they're not on major platforms trying to share their story but coming onto our show they're like super comfortable chatting with you you can tell that you guys have done an amazing job building Rapport and and making a safe place where where again like Chris said like I feel comfortable asking questions here they could be silly questions or I could challenge something and that's okay to be able to do that and so I think that goes um you know to you to show how well you've done hosting and how well you've done you know integrating everybody in from all kinds of different places and cultures and on that note we've got our third and final guest of the show which is Kim so let's let Kim into the room um as we were waiting for you to jump on today Olivia Kim was testing out her camera and her so we got to have a lovely little chat off of the record um so that was a lot of fun and here is Kim now hello Kim hi Casey how are you hi Olivia hi great glad you made it back glad we got everything tested and it was lovely to chat with you before and um yeah I believe Olivia is going to be asking you about your story awesome yes just to tell everyone where where you're from a little bit about your story and what you think of book club okay well first of all I want to start I brushed my hair this morning for everybody wow thank you it looks great you look different so so first of all um carnivore was my last stop for health and weight loss and probably a little bit more on weight loss than than health but it's turned out to be more on the health than weight loss and uh also to I've been a biohacker for probably 8 10 years and uh I have to say by the end of my biohacking my realization was it all came down to it wasn't the supplements it wasn't all the little hacks that I learned and stuff like that it was uh what I was eating and that was the real turnaround in my life for health I was probably heaviest at 200 15 and I'm a veteran of the military I've never been overweight in my whole entire life uh I was always active I was into weightlifting and and running and all kinds of stuff and I was also a heavy smoker which really surprises people because I don't come across as a smoker I quit in 2004 and uh yeah so when I when I uh retired from the military of course I gained all kinds of weight and that started me on my my biohacking course so then I uh got into carnivore and I started with one individual and ended up with Dr Anthony chaffy and it changed my life and what even more so is our beautiful International wonderful book club and it is amazing I came in about halfway through so the first three or four books actually the first I think five books Olivia can correct me I I wasn't a part of but the latter part I've been soaking them up like a sponge and uh first and foremost Olivia is an absolutely amazing leader she uh when she does the synopsis of the of the book seriously I mean you don't even have to read the book it's like you've read it when she does it and then we all jump in and then give our two cents or as I say 5 cents 10 sense whatever of the book um one of the biggest things do you want me to keep going Olivia yeah keep going okay so one of the biggest things I find well there's a couple things I find out of the book club that I think is just absolutely amazing the first and foremost is that Olivia has this I don't know how she does it because I know many many many people that are involved in a book club first of all it's not International second of all is she gets these authors to to join us at the end of the book club and every book is very subjective and I think you both can agree on this and uh so when the author comes in all of us give our our interpretation of the book and that's what makes us so subjective so we we com Olivia compiles these these questions and when the author comes on we we present she presents these questions and sometimes we ask her questions as well and it just brings this book into perspective and now we understand where this author is coming from so then our interpretation has been clarified and it almost becomes objective it doesn't it isn't subjective anymore which is how many people get that opportunity not many and all the book clubs that I know of they don't so I think that's very powerful the other thing that's very powerful too is it's when the book club it's not just about the book we learn from each other because we are international we get to learn about different uh the countries and the politics of the country and and things that are happening there that's where a lot of my true learning has come as well and uh I mean I'm when when when we close for that Monday or or Wednesday which oh my gosh I just miss it I wish we could do it every single day hours a day I wish that was my job with our book club because I just my heart just like oh I can't take it that we're finished I want just want to go on and on and on and on so it's like and we so we go down these rabbit holes and everybody like Nori and Olivia and Mike and all of and Chris and everybody we just dig even deeper because sometimes it's just not enough we want to know more and more and more so that's quite amazing and my last thing I want to point out is I'm a military girl and I'm I'm a pretty tough chick I guess you could say I don't have a University degree but I do have a degree in life and and all of us do and I think that's probably the like my 60 years of living that's what I think I bring to the club and and all my experience that I bring I don't think there's a textbook or an education that will ever Define or replicate that type of teaching and that's what we all bring to this book club so that's my my final that I want to say about it and I mean you can't you just can't replicate that you just can't so that's my final say on it thank you Kim oh my God you made me cry we have this running joke about we're going to miss each other if we don't like in August because we were on holiday and we were going places we said we'll have a rest in August and Kim was like really do you want I'm gonna miss you too much and then in December coming up we've got another I guess low month where I said you know it's Christmas surely everyone wants to be a family we you know like and our clubs go on for like two and a half hours the other day we were still talking so and that's weekly that people are spending that much time with it so I'm very conscious about people's time and you know in December everyone needs to be their family so I said let's have a rest in December and everyone's like well can we still do something like what can we do I said okay fine everyone just read what they want to read and we'll have one session it'll be like a Christmas party and we'll all bring whatever insights we got from that book together and do some kind of like um kind of review them all and then every was like well can't we do that every week rather than just the one session we're ending up with like the same situation that we normally have so it's very hard to stop these people you know they're just on a roll these these Kim people yeah it's such a pleasure and it's one of the highlights of my week as well so I can't say it's any different and before I go H again Casey I love what you're doing and like I said Olivia introduce me to you and and like I say it's an ongoing thing that I always joke about is I'm going to be like 175 or 200 years old by the time I'm finished watching all these podcast and reading the books but I'm so glad that you're in my back pocket and I get to watch you as well so and and thank you thank you for everything that you do as well cim that's really amazing and very kind thank you so very much I love your story and I love that you've been able to come on here and share that with us it's very very inspirational I've loved talking to all of you and and we mentioned in the episode my attendance is a little bit subpar due to my schedule but the times I get it come on and learn from you guys I I really do get very inspired with with the people that are asking very sinc and genuine questions have been through quite a bit of suffering in their lives and so thank you Kim so so very much for taking the time to come on our show today we just really appreciate you thank you thank you Olivia thank you Kim see you soon see you in Discord she like gets sad when it's not book club I know it's just incredible I don't even know how it's all worked out this way but you know I I remember having a new resolution I don't about 10 years in a row that I was going to read more books and I never really got around to it so I was in this like myself in this position that I never read and I felt bad about it because I love reading and since book club has come along what Kim was or Mike was saying about I do a synopsis of each chapter so I kind of play it back for people in case they're listening later and they haven't read the book you know so and then we discuss it and so I've gone from Reading never to reading and having to like make notes about the whole book as I go so it's for me a huge benefit because I'm really getting I'm spending my time doing something I know I want to do anyway and we've got the added kind of richness of everyone else's input on top of that so I you know I I can't say everyone's saying how much they love it but to me I think it's probably more rewarding than for anyone else because I'm getting all of that depth as well so wow so these synopses you are actually making them creating them yourself it's not something you're taking cutting and pasting sticking together you're actually creating all these yeah yeah so um yeah it's just because we go chapter by chapter through the book like we really do analyze a book very deeply um and so we T we maybe group the chapters but we tend to have a chunk that we'll do each week and I'll summarize what was in there so I have to make those notes so that I can summarize what was in there and as I'm summarizing I'm thinking what kind of questions does this bring up how does it relate to other things we've talked about and think about the discussion points that I'll trigger I'll trigger off normally people like oh that's just a bit way out there I'm like yeah we just think about it and and you know see what see what you think so yeah so some people are saying well we don't even need to read the book if you're going to be doing these synopsis I'm like no you still need the book I'm not here to like get you get you off the hook on that everyone has to read and come with their thoughts so no it's it's just such good fun that's I think that's why people like it it's just good fun that's great where were you when I was in high school and had to write book reports and I never read the book like I could have really used those I would have really help my grids out quite a bit that's amazing um I do want to ask you about a few more stories but before I do we've heard from three amazing people who really have stood out have been in the book club for a very long time what's maybe another person that really stands out to you as having a really special story and having a story especially of like healing through carnivore in the book club you mean yeah in the book club gosh there's so many um I mean there so someone that I I'm very close to as well um who is in the book club but also in the community in general is someone called Wendy and she's on her own journey and it's an incredible incredible journey I wish one day that she will tell it properly um but she was she had some serious serious mental health issues and um you know found herself one day in a very very compromising position and she's got eight lovely boys but she wasn't able to really be there for them with all of these problems that she had she's exmilitary as well and um and Carnival has really allowed her to reclaim her life back and her mental health back and what she's doing now is she's absolutely thriving like she's she used to stay in in the house all the time she's traveling all over the states she us to be scared of the cold we're convincing her to get an ice plunge and she's kind of going for that now um she used to not want to converse with people and now she's doing all of these ma major kind of ballooning um events where she's you know helping and working in a team and like pulling ropes and all this kind of stuff like and her and Mike have met up around that Vegas area and you know the connections that people now have through this community and how we're all healing each other every day and having these discussions every day and Kim herself has is as you saw very inspirational she's very inspirational in our community and she's helped people along their own mental health issues as well I just find the whole thing such a such a joy every day like seeing people like Wendy just have an amazing life like they should do and it just confirms to me that there is so much work here to do and so much potential out there in the world in human beings that is not being realized right now because of what is just unacceptable levels of misinformation out there that we need to do something about so everything kind of connects up for me you know reading these books having these conversations with people learning together improving our own lives and a big part of why we're doing this is because it's not enough for us to just I don't think anyone is going to be really happy being the last person standing every one that they know everyone wants their own family to come along this journey at some point we don't want to push people we don't want to be you know kind of know it alls or anything like that but we've got to figure out how we bring this message out in the open a bit more in the mainstream and it's a really hard thing to do without sounding like a conspiracy theorist without sounding like you know you're just one of these people that's now got a new idea and you're just going to tell everyone about it and become really boring you know whatever the kind of the friction is it's um it's it's hard to kind of a live in that society and that's why I think this kind of community is so important but B you want to help people ultimately and I think the the reason the motivation behind all of this is that we all want to be able to help those around us that need the help whether they're ready to or not at this point maybe not you know not in our control but when they are ready we want to be we want to be able to to to kind of provide that and and pass this forward um so I think yeah that's what that's that's where the meaning for it really ends up you know just coming clear for us all when we're when we're going through this we can all connect it back to how the rest of the world is and how we want to see the world change yeah no I wrestle with that all the time once you find something so amazing you really do just want to share it with everybody and it's even down to like when I'm pushing a shopping cart to get my receipt checked at Costco I want to point out like check it out it's like plant free but that doesn't it doesn't do anything for people that aren't ready as much as I want to shout it from the rooftops it's just not the best way to share it like you mentioned and so doing things you know like what you're doing and inviting people and and being open and kind to them to be able to bring them in and answer questions I think is the most effective way do you have one other moment in in doing in hosting these book clubs itself one moment that really stands out for you uh gosh there's so many I'm not sure I can choose one I mean I think we're really I wouldn't say I know if this stands out most but one one moment that we all had a very interesting conversation was um when we were reading Leah's book which is very much about the cycles of Nature and how everything we're all here for a reason and we're all going to feed each other ultimately no one's really taking more out of the system than they're going to end up giving back we're all we all have to play our part in whichever part of the cycle we're in and and and us as humans and Homo sapiens we are going to give back to the soil one day one day we'll be buried and we had a really interesting conversation about well what do mean for how we need to be buried then like have we has anyone ever thought of this if we are spending our whole lives taking out of the system because we've been going to be alive for decades and we're going to be you know consuming all of the meat and all of the nutritions uh nutrients that we can when it's our turn to give back how do we bury ourselves in a way where we actually do give back properly to the soil and no one that has any idea about that so we've been like trying to figure out the answer to that um and you know do we need to be buried in a certain kind of box should we be embalmed is that a good thing or not a good thing as far as feeding the soil um is it better to be cremated or is it better to be buried should we just be like you know thrown in a shallow grave somewhere is that the best thing like a really weird conversations and someone was saying well I'm just happy to just be thrown in a bush and we're like well that's not allowed so how do we kind square that Circle was such a strange conversation but I don't know that's one moment that just I always remember and think God we're just and I even said to Leah like I'm sorry I'm sure we're going to ask you all the questions you've been asked before and she said no one has ever asked me that question before toally random original things that you guys are thinking of so um yeah I think just we you know our creative juices just flow when we read the stuff and we really think big picture and you know we think about personal experiences and our lives and yeah it's just uh it's just very enriching in that way well that's really come through in this conversation with all the participants in the book club that like you would think somebody on a carnivore diet does doesn't care about the environment They Don't Care About Animals they don't think about the health of the planet and I found just the opposite it it I know that vegans and vegetarians think about that kind of stuff but carnivore is thinking about that stuff as well we want to be very thoughtful about all of that so I love that that was one of the topics and something you were able to ask theer about um Olivia for you personally what are you the most proud of oh gosh um I'm just I don't know if I'm proud I'm I'm proud I'm I'm proud of just everyone in the club and how much they love it and they participate um but I feel it's just a bit of luck that we've kind of got to this it's just none of it has been by Design it's just kind of happened um I guess what I'm I'm probably proud of is that I I do I do make people question things and I do you know deliberately say but yeah if I was that a vegan I would say d and so how are we gonna you know um George Momo I don't know if you follow him but he has some very now that we're in the Agriculture and environment Topic at the moment he has some very challenging views on on the environment so I'm going and listening to everything he's ever said and I'm trying to relay it to everyone in the club to say look this is what we're coming up against this is like the alternative view what are we all are we ready for it are we able to defend against it how does what he says which is very well articulated not Mak sense he's a very good arguer um I even watched him debate Alan sa at Oxford University and that was that didn't go very well um unfortunately um so we've got to be ready for these challenges so I think what I'm proud of is is bringing that that Insight out which people are not going to naturally go and seek themselves um and I think I'm really proud that we've also something you just said a minute ago Casey about um about ethics and where are ethics as carnivals I think sometimes as a carnivore Community we can be a little bit Brash about animal welfare and you know I don't see the compassion coming out of us and our concerns about Animal Welfare as much as you see it on you know however militant a vegan is they they do have compassion for animals and I don't see why the two are mutually exclusive like I believe that you know I love animals so much and that doesn't mean to say I don't feel like there's there's any conflict with eating them I you know I'm very much in the Le a um Keith Camp about we all play our part and I'm very grateful for the nutrition that is provided by by beef and other animals so you know but I do think we are we are concerned about the ethics of animals and we we really believe that we I want animal to be treated and have as great a life as they can and that's why you know we started challenging our own views on on ethics and we were talking about Dairy carbs and what happens to them and are they slaughtered at Birth and if so are we comfortable with that and are we happy being carnivores consuming Dairy if that's one of the parts of the kind of the consequences of it so we all went on a bit of a mission to to actually investigate Dairy carves and what happens there and got ourselves much more comfortable with what really does happen and where we're buying our Dairy from so that we can take that ethical Viewpoint into account so I think helping people face up to some of these ethical questions that maybe we don't really face up to as carnivals I'm really proud of of that because I think we should be you know there is not a monopoly on ethics and morality um that that people who don't eat meat can I don't think can can assume I I think we can have a stronger a case for it and we just don't necessarily pull that case together or um or think about it very much um which doesn't makes sense to me because I love animals and and I think we should be kind of proud of our position and be able to be confident about it so yeah so I think you know that kind of challenging View and getting people to maybe different places that they wouldn't normally think about um I'm I'm pretty proud of that I love that what a very lovely answer and a very special episode I'm G to be petitioning to Dr Anthony chaffy to pay you and I both a commission for doing this episode which is turned out to be a commercial for book club it it's it's such a cool collection and like
