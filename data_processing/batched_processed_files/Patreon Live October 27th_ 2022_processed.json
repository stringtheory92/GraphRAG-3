        "transcript": "foreign hear me hopefully um yeah okay all right hopefully that works better sorry about all that that was a bit weird um it just wouldn't let me use the right camera and so and then it locked me out completely so I had to had to restart it so sorry about that guys but thank you very much um thanks everyone who uh is coming on hopefully hopefully that um we can answer everyone's questions and everyone has a good time so we had some some questions that have been submitted thank you again to everyone who submits the questions um if you want to ask a new question uh just put it up in the comments if I'm not seeing it and it because obviously people talking and things scroll down so if I don't see it just someone flag it or something like that or copy and paste it again just to catch my attention if you can someone did get a haircut yes and um yeah so just trying to uh I don't know just got a little shorter than normal but I don't know I kind of like it I think it I don't know I think it's kind of funny to have your beard in here sort of all the same length and uh Hey Paprika in Germany if anyone wants to say sort of where they're from where they're calling in from and uh what time it is there thank you everyone for for coming in at odd times of the day and night people like the beard that's good um so okay so Deanna has a question genuine question on Carnivore diet if plants are bad then why do almost all medications come from plants or plant compounds this crossed my mind a few days ago I'd love to understand more good question the the answer is that you know um we use things medicinally that we wouldn't use normally we don't use antibiotics for normal daily Health we use that for uh for a certain specific circumstances where we want you know to attack something else that's attacking us or or to to have something happen that uh we don't necessarily need to happen every day so we don't need antibiotics every day because we're not fighting off an infection every day our body can fight off that Forest when our when a bacteria gets sort of overwhelmed our our system then we might need some bacteria antibiotics to help fight those off but they're actually not good for you if you just take them every day so you know a medicine is just a poison that does more good than harm under certain certain circumstances but you know Methotrexate is useful in a lot of different disease processes but it will absolutely shred your body to pieces in the ax and so you certainly don't want to have that uh when you don't when you're not treating you know the problem that um when you're not treating a problem that uh um you know goes with that so you're you're not getting you're getting the the you know you're sort of getting a good with a bad when you're using something as a medicine but when it's um uh when you don't have that benefit then you're only getting the bad so that's that's the deal with plants is it has these poisons in them that cause harm but in some cases those those things like you know like digitalis that comes from Fox Club you get too much of that you're dead you have your heart just stops right and so uh that's not good but in cases of heart failure that can actually be better it can help your your heart beat stronger so that's a benefit in those cases in very select and specific doses so that's the answer to that oh thank you Mike appreciate it um so Lewis wants us wants me to talk about meat variety and grass-fed versus grain fed uh his wife and he are on a budget so he limited is of a variety and grain fed fine yeah grain fed is fine I mostly eat grain fed I you know I think grass-fed you know the healthier the animal is the healthier more nutrients it's going to have in it I think that that difference is not really appreciable when you're talking about the grand scheme of things in uh in in the diet so I think of it sort of as um I've sort of used this this analogy before but it's like getting gold and silver at the Olympics right gold medal uh you know beat everyone silver medal lost to Gold but silver also beat everything else on Earth so that's what I think about with grain Fed so I mostly do grain fed if I get grass-fed I prefer it but it's it's um it's totally fine just eat grain fed and you know grass-fed stuff is is uh can be a lot more expensive it can be prohibitively expensive so don't uh don't break the bank just chasing chasing gold okay silver is just fine um let me ask do you think different forms of carnivore could help heal type 1 diabetes and duplicitous contracture contraction not too convinced on that um you know that's just like sort of scarring of your tendon um you know from different different things but uh I I would hesitate to guess if that's gonna if that's gonna get better just with um just with uh dietary changes but it wouldn't get worse anyway which is a good thing it's a start anyway uh type 1 diabetes will certainly get helped on a carnivore diet that's actually what we use to treat uh type 1 and type 2 diabetics for for decades uh was it was a ketogenic diet which is you know what a carnivore diet is and um there are animal model models that that look at fasting and a ketogenic diet or fancy mimicking diet as they call it and um and type 1 diabetes and I found that the mice can actually regrow the areas of their pancreas called the beta islet cells that actually create uh insulin so that's actually pretty good um thank you and um hey this one skips around so Tommy asked I had an incomplete spinal cord injury 15 years ago anything else besides carnivore that will help with recovery or new cell growth um we don't we don't have too much in the way of technology that will will help that you know there are some interesting things being done that that they're trying to use electrodes it will sort of bridge that gap between like spinal cord injuries um it's [Music] um you know it's still an infancy stage you know maybe maybe one day we will be able to do that uh but at the moment it's not uh there's nothing nothing on the market anyway that that I know of so I think just um just uh do the best you can and and be as healthy as you can and that's uh going to get you a lot further than than other other places but uh I would start with that anyway uh uh so his question so uh charger Mopar says question is a 39-year meat-based eater I have never experienced constipation why do people think that eating red meat is going to cause constipation um yeah I don't know where that that that came from originally but I mean it's uh you know like in the 1980s everyone was getting constipated because I stopped eating fat and then they said oh you have to eat a bunch of fiber and I think it's probably just because we actually absorb red meat uh very well and so it's just like if you're just eating a lot of red meat like things don't really come out you're like oh I must be constipated because if it doesn't come out then that means it's you know stuck somewhere that's what people think um so that's wrong but um yeah but you if you're on a carnivore diet you're not going to get constipated unless you're not eating enough fat that's what I found [Music] um so thoughts on using certain plant extracts and concentrated as medicine I think I know what you're going to say whatever bark case thing it can be useful what is your take on it so I sort of answered a similar question earlier I mean things can be used medicinally and and the medicine uh can be helpful in certain circumstances but the the difference between allopathic medicine and like naturopathic medicine is that you know you you use like the plant in naturopathy which they say well maybe there's things in there that are working uh synergistically with you know the the part that you're looking for like the digitalis digoxin in in Fox club that makes it work better okay but you know you need to show what those are and if you can show what those are then you can put them together and have them work together synergistically and you can get the doses right because if you're just giving someone a plant you don't know how much is there you don't know what conditions it needs to be grown in you don't know what conditions need to be kept in you don't know exactly what dose you're getting and it comes with all the other thousands and thousands of of things in there as well that you don't want that could cause harm so you know yes things can be used medicinally but it's better to actually use things that have been isolated and carefully controlled all right so I'm just going to do some of the do some of the the questions have been submitted um it's questions from Evie may it seems like I read a post somewhere that said you have to make sure your anesthesiologist knows you are carnivore before going into surgery is that correct I may have to I may have to have rotator cuff surgery no I've never heard that and uh you know I just had surgery on my knee to clear out some loose cartilage and I didn't say a word and it just you know didn't come up so um no that doesn't matter what does matter is if you're if you're eating things that can interfere with with medication like or you know grapefruit juice grapefruit juice has Veronica coumarins that are toxic and your body has has to clear them with our cytochrome p450 enzymes in your liver and you can use a lot of those up and then they aren't there to process and metabolize the different medications that uh that we give to people sometimes and so they work differently and sometimes they get uh they stop being useful or they become toxic you got toxic levels of these things so that's uh that that's the thing but uh eating carnivore no that's not a thing it's just people trying to scare you so don't worry about that um Ray asks I have done some reading on how poor nutrition mainly from Agricultural and processed food revolutions stunted people's jaw development leading to malocclusion jaw problems and deviated septums all of which I am now trying to get fixed to improve my health alongside carnivore I remember Dr chafe you mentioned tongue ties at some point as part of this and I actually had mine released earlier this year would love some discussion on this maybe a good idea for a future posts or podcast yeah so um tongue ties are something that I've uh learned about more recently being associated with or attributed to um poor nutrition uh early on and so that's that's seen an increase in tongue ties which can be very very detrimental to a child's development it that's when the oh is it that the frenulum I think underneath the tongue is sort of stuck down so they can't really lift their tongue up and uh they can't speak properly they can't pronounce words properly they can't nurse properly they can't do all sorts of things and and so you have to you know it depending on how bad it is you need to get it get it released early on and it's um it's becoming a growing problem apparently so the I don't know too much about that but there are other people that that do um that I know some people that have worked with that specifically and they said that this this is going up and up and up and and it's um it has been shown to be uh caused by eating the wrong thing and not having proper mouth development chewing all the right things and things like that have to do with jaw and teeth development as well as just the nutrition that you're getting in uh but yeah after the Agricultural Revolution the the fossil record is very clear that that our Jaws became smaller our teeth became more crowded they've had a lot of cavities and plaque and tartar and Decay and you did not see that before then you know think of animal teeth and they're just they're just you know white or maybe a bit yellowed but they're they're healthy and they don't have gum disease and they don't have tooth decay and things like that they never brush their teeth how how unnatural is brushing your teeth I'm all for brushing your teeth don't get me wrong I brushed my teeth every day but you know it this isn't something that's normal in the wild right so our microbiome our oral biome um you know and and our physiology protect our teeth from just rotting and decaying so if you're either going to rotten Decay that that means something's going wrong you know you're eating something that you shouldn't something you're sick there's something happening that's bad right because that you lose your teeth in the wild you're done you can't eat you're dead right I mean we you know we see that now you have to have dentures and um you know those don't just show up out of nowhere so if animals were doing this uh they'd just be dying out you know within a few years of life and that's that's obviously not uh not gonna happen not going to work oh well thank you very much Mike um for that um so we asked uh 26 uh under 15 body fat trained five to six days a week uh high intensity interval training have had higher blood pressure since I was 14 on uh blood pressure medication standard dose is 150 and low BP yeah okay and uh should I ditch the medication carnivore for six months no issues with kidney or heart heart Etc um You probably can you look there are other other causes of high blood pressure that you need to get checked out you know if you're having high blood pressure at 14 that that suggests that you're in that category of uh you know I mean you have things like field chromocytomas that are just pumping out adrenaline and um you'll just have really high blood pressure it's generally not that well able to be controlled but it's something that needs to be checked out and so uh going carnivore will help a lot of the causes of high blood pressure but there are others that you need to get checked out so see your doctor talk to them make sure that you've been checked for all the weird Wild Wonderful causes of high blood pressure which getting high blood pressure 14 is is uh makes me very suspicious that you're in that category or they're just very sensitive to carbohydrates because carbohydrates raise your insulin you get insulin insensitivity and then you get issues with your blood pressure that that's one of the early signs of of insulin resistance and um and so you get uh problems with your blood pressure not everyone does but there's a very common cause of that um because uh insulin can help with the relaxation of your arteries and when they become insensitive to that then they don't respond and so they just stay tight and closed and and you get high blood pressure so being on a carnivore diet or even just keto diet for three to six months can certainly help that uh 130 you're sort of you know in in a good range but you're sort of the upper end of the good range you can you can try uh coming off of it um but I would definitely check for those things first and check for those those causes of high blood pressure and uh and just see your doctor about that and then after that you can you can you know try coming off of it and see what your blood pressure does I would check your blood pressure at sort of the same time of day and same conditions every day and just keep a track keep it keep a log and then you'll be able to see okay um so from Rey uh oh no sorry I've already did that one and from Kim I've been trying to gain extra weight and build muscle so I've added lunch each day okay I had been eating a huge or a large breakfast and evening meal for the past 18 months would you agree with this or is it healthier to eat to eat twice per day I think you eat as much as your body's asking you to eat um I think it's good to eat until you're full I tend to get a bit lethargic if I eat until I'm full and so for me that works better if I do that later in the day uh or even at night and then I just you know just tired and I just want to go to sleep if I do that during the working day it's difficult because you know I need work I can't go to sleep so uh just play with it if but if you're finding you're eating disorders like three smaller meals throughout the day you know for me it's um I I tend to just eat like a big meal until like I'm full and I meat doesn't taste good anymore and I naturally want to stop um and uh and so you know I think that that's a good way of doing it quite often if you're getting fatty enough meat and you're and you're eating until you're satiated you don't need to eat uh more than once a day if you're working out a lot that will probably increase I find that if I'm working out heavily I'll I'll do that twice a day sort of eat a lot twice a day but just be be mindful that you might get a bit lethargic and uh you know so if you're if you're doing that right at the beginning of the day you know that might be might be um holding you back a bit with your energy levels but just play with it and but I would definitely eat until just meat just does not taste good anymore at night and then see how you go throughout the day and then sometimes if you eat just sort of smaller meals in the day that you're not quite getting to the point that you're really exhausted then you can you can have more energy during the day uh John asks um speaking of isolation any chance of having Tim Knox on your channel he seems to be more meat heavy lately still keto though he has interesting takes on isolation as well I I think Professor Knox is amazing I absolutely love that guy I would love to have him on I've been meaning to sort of ask him um at some point but uh just I've just been absolutely slammed of you know speaking of different um a couple different conferences and then doing some big presentations for my department and um which is pretty exciting we're gonna get some new research going on um cancer and uh doing dietary measures of treat of adding on as an adjunct to uh brain cancers which is actually great work so I'll be working with uh Professor Thomas Seyfried over Boston College and some of his colleagues there as well as other doctors in New Zealand Matthew Phillips and um and others as well and then trying to get a study trial going here at my department so um I just haven't been able to to uh to get on all the people that I want I've been able to do great interviews with like people like um Nina teichel she was amazing and uh absolutely loved talking to her and um and you know Sally Norton I just spoke to and a lot of others that are in a pipeline uh you know uh Dr Gabor Somali who's an expert in deuterium which is super interesting something I didn't really know about so it was fun to pick his brain on that and then um and others so those will be coming out but yeah I definitely plan on having Tim notes on if if he'll you know if he's interested in coming on um so sorry to read one of these so ask um I'm 45 year old female Carnival for seven months I started to add butter to my meat and chicken because I never felt like I am super full now I'm gaining weight I see more fat on me stuff about her I mean you may have a problem with dairy some people do and um sometimes that's a that's expressed as as weight gain so you can try that fat is really good for you though it's not the fat that's the problem it would be you know the problem with the the milk proteins that would be causing an issue because fat is actually very very beneficial and it triggers the release of fat in your fat cells as opposed to the deposition of fat in your fat cells so I would still try to eat until you're full still try to get a good fat content but you can try some you know eating just eating fatty meat and just doing it that way or or supplementing with like beef Tallow grass-fed beef Tallow instead of butter and see how you go because it could be that you're reacting to the milk proteins [Music] um let's see okay uh another question from Kim can you talk about folate again and maybe go deeper into explaining folate levels in blood B12 Etc also the intrinsic factor in digestive enzymes intrinsic the intrinsic factor in the digestive enzymes does justice system sorry I assume carnivore will improve and possibly reverse issues well it'll do a lot for that um it will allow your body to absorb a lot more things you're not bringing in like the anti-nutrients and the and the different you know protease Inhibitors and things like that that come in Plants everybody's going to actually absorb what you need intrinsic factor is released in your stomach and that's what binds to B12 and allows your stomach to absorb it if you don't have if you don't have intrinsic factor then you can't absorb B12 and even though you're getting a lot of B12 in your diet you're still going to get a pernicious anemia and so that's something to know about generally that's not a problem unless you've had some sort of like infection or surgery that has removed that part of your body and then you you can't absorb B12 you have to get B12 shots for the rest of your life which is pretty um pretty tough but um folate folate uh testing is a bit difficult because uh the serum levels aren't very accurate and so you really have to check your red blood cell your erythrocyte folate levels because that's where it's active it's active in the cell and so you want to check the levels in the cell you know we think there's oh if it's this level in the serum then it that equates to this level in the cells but not always some things you can test like that and it's and it's fairly accurate you know like sodium or potassium but other things uh not so much in foliage one of them um magnesium is also one of them as well as zinc right you want to check the erythrocyte or red blood cell RBC zinc magnesium folate to get an accurate uh reading on that and also whenever you're taking lab tests you need to do it in a consistent manner um you need it the best thing to do is have the same time of day same fasting status same hydration level right so so what we recommend in our clinic is first thing in the morning sort of between 9 and 11 in the morning fasting don't eat anything that morning and uh probably don't need anything after 10 o'clock the night before and then drink at least two glasses of water and no more than four glasses of water okay so you're having consistent hydration fasting and timing that's going to give you more accurate tests and a test is only as good as a retest you get one testing oh my goodness this is this thing's offer this thing's whatever well it could be just a glitch it could be something just weird that day so in six to eight weeks you get a test again and you check it again if everything's accurate if or everything's consistent well then you know you have pretty good uh basis for uh saying that that's um that that's what your your levels are so I would do it that way and um and then you obviously have to look at um how you're doing these tests as well because people just check for folate they don't realize you need to check it in the cells so Raymond thank you very much uh for the"

        "transcript": "in the cells so Raymond thank you very much uh for the in the cells so Raymond thank you very much uh for the super chat um says Dr Smith says you need to need some soluble fiber to get rid of bile and that is the reason why long-term carnivore will not work what is your take on that um I I think that he is assuming a fact that's not in evidence as they say in law why do we need to get rid of Bob you know I mean he's he's saying that we we need and need soluble fiber to get rid of bile okay well soluble fiber does bind bile and it will get rid of it why do we need to get rid of bile bile is not a waste product but your body makes bile on purpose it expands energy and nutrition and resources to make bile so why are we just assuming that that bile is bad for us um if you the reason that people said that you should eat fiber to bind bile and to uh get rid of bile is because cholesterol is used in bile cholesterol is using a lot of things every single cell in your body is made out of cholesterol the cell membrane in of every cell in your body is cholesterol nearly every hormone in your body is made out of cholesterol vitamin D is made out of cholesterol testosterone is made out of cholesterol estrogens progestogens cortisol all the all the all the hormones made out of your uh in your adrenals and on all the steps in between they're like 27 steps between cholesterol and testosterone every single one of those steps is an active hormone in your body every single one is made out of cholesterol but we've said that cholesterol is bad for us let's do all these things to reduce our cholesterol and bile is made out of cholesterol that's one of the things that biles made out of including your brain by the way and so the idea was that you should eat soluble fiber to bind the bile and this would lower your cholesterol and it does but is that a good thing well no actually because all those studies saying that cholesterol was bad for you have been shown to be fraudulent and that's you guys can look at my um my video that I did on YouTube and my podcast called uh the hard facts about cholesterol and heart and heart disease and I talk about all the studies and and the the hard evidence that shows that this was fraud and I I give the links in the description so you guys can you know you can check for yourself and see this is this is um uh just a matter of record now that this was this was fraud the USDA fraudulently claimed that cholesterol cause heart disease we know that and because we have the contract between the sugar companies and the head of the USDA he was a professor at Harvard and we know how much they got paid we know how much the sugar companies paid this absolute monster to lie and falsify records and data and studies to make it look as if cholesterol cause heart disease was really sugar they paid him sixty five hundred dollars back in the 1960s that's it that's where that's worth fifty thousand dollars in today's valuation so that's that's what that's what his um his soul was worth and that's what the health of the of the uh the world was worth to him so um when you have things based on a false preposition you have to throw everything out and start from scratch and so that's one of them you say oh well we need to eat fiber so that you can bind bile so that you can reduce fat or reduce cholesterol but cholesterol is not actually was not actually the problem that it was throw it out so you know if you're if you're worried about your cholesterol uh then sure eat some Fiber you'll reduce your cholesterol I am not worried about my cholesterol in fact the only worry that I have is that I don't have enough cholesterol because it's actually super good for you you know all the studies are showing that people with higher LDL cholesterol live longer live healthier and so I'm just fine uh keeping my bile because it's physiological and it's there to absorb fat which is a necessary nutrient um question uh what do you think about using coconut oil for its MCT and is there any MCT found in animal products yeah there's a lot of MCT that's mid chain medium chain fatty acid or medium chain triglycerides so um medium chain fatty acids these are uh good which is necessary for a lot of different things uh your body actually can absorb them pretty easily your body needs bile to absorb pretty much all fats except uh medium chain fatty acids a lot of medium chain fatty acids I don't know if it's all of them and um but it uh it does a good job at absorbing those um otherwise but the vast majority of fat goes out of your body um unless you have bile to absorb it uh I don't think you need coconut oil I don't think you need any plant oil at all I think that um that that you'll get everything you need from meat you just eat naturally and and your body will do the rest there are uh MCTS in meat um I don't know the exact proportion versus coconut oil but I don't much care um there are other things in coconut oil and these plant oils like um uh plant Esters that or um what's it called um basically plant um plant cholesterols and they and they sort of bind these same things and they and they replace so the cholesterol you don't absorb this cholesterol and it sort of sort of like a mimic or an antagonist so um this is what people say it's like oh you should eat these eat almonds because or or these other sort of plant um you know plant cholesterols because your body doesn't use them in the same way and it sort of displaces cholesterol but it's the same thing again cholesterol is not bad for you you don't want to lower it and um you know so so that's the thing so it it may have MCTS in it but it's going to have things that you probably don't want it's going to screw with your cholesterol and other sorts of things as well um so I don't have it anyway if you want to you know it's not it's not as bad as like you know other things like you know olive oils or canola oil and all that sort of uh garbage but I just stick with me me fat lard all that stuff um from Jared Dr kiltz mentioned in his interview with you about the glycol biome and glycobiology do you have anything to say about this topic it was a bit over my head and the resources uh that I can understand and find myself uh find myself are rather scarce uh yeah no I I think it's a very interesting uh point to make you do have a glycobiome and this is this is a and it's um and you have and you have this in a lot of other areas of your body it's not it's not just in your GI tract and so this is sort of an intricate web of um of molecules that sort of have a sort of protective sheath encoding and I don't know all the functions that it that it has I'm sure it's quite um quite a lot of them but it's not something I've studied in too much detail but it's an important part of your of your uh anatomy and your physiology and biology so uh you know when you damage that and you damage that structure like you know the glycocalyx and things like that it's um it's uh it's going to you know it's just gonna it's just going to mess with your your physiology and the way that your your body functions and that's going to have you know on you know Untold sort of uh consequences as a result of that and um and he was talking about all these different things in plants that absolutely terrorize you know the glycocalyx and your glycobiome and um so yeah no I thought it was very interesting it's definitely something I need to look into more as well um and to get uh to get more familiar with but no I I don't I don't um um yeah I don't have too much to add to that because he he knows just so much more than more than I do about that so uh just just check out his videos um on that and uh you know because uh that guy that guy uh knows his stuff um um skipped again uh [Music] oh so question is any way to replace the fat in your body made from vegetable oils you ingested faster I heard half-life of fat cells is around four to five years does this mean I have to wait tennis years to replace them uh you know yeah no I don't think so you know it's that your body your body's replacing molecules all the time and so you know you're going to be you're going to be um you know you know churning through and getting rid of sort of that unhealthy bits of bits of body and cell uh that you've had from before and replacing with more healthy tissue and and uh and ingredients and structures so uh no I don't I don't think it's gonna take all that long um a lot of people you know are doing a lot better you know within within months you know you're gonna you're gonna replace a lot of this stuff I don't I don't think you have to wait for your your fat self to die to then then make um I make new ones I actually I'm not um I'm not too sure you actually your fat cells actually do die uh or and I'm not too sure that you actually make them as well it was my understanding that you you make as many fat sales as you're ever going to have uh after you know in your adolescence and then after that they just grow bigger as opposed to multiplying hyper or and um and uh dividing um you know maybe maybe they do uh but um it was my understanding at a certain point they become pretty pretty permanent but in any case I you know what whatever it's doing um I don't think that you need to wait for them to die and grow new ones you just need to you'll just replace those molecules and those fat stores that are in there and that that'll be fine that'll do that on its own so just yeah just do your thing just do carnivore you were just supposed to eat your body your body will do the rest probably is amazing it I mean there's just billions of chemical interactions going on in your body you know every single millisecond and so you know just just let it do its thing you'll be fine uh from Wendy I was talking to my mom about my hair loss and she said uh remember me especially beef is high in alpha lipoic acid um they say that the only bad thing it does is make your hair very thinned out could this be reasonable hair loss I don't know uh myself I'm not familiar with that but I I don't know I I have noticed the exact opposite um I've noticed a lot of people the exact opposite um you know most people when when they go Carnival they come to me and go oh my God my hair has never been this good my nails have never been this strong my skin is so amazing uh so I generally see the opposite of that um but that's not something that I've heard before that there was a problem specifically with beef um but if she has any articles or any papers or anything like that that um that talks about that I'd be uh very interested in uh reading them if you wanted to send them over I can take a look uh what are my thoughts on using glycine as a sweetener I've never used it I don't um so I haven't really thought about it is a short answer um you know I mean is glycine all that sweet I don't know maybe it is I don't I just don't worry about sweeteners like um you know I think meat just tastes good and I think water tastes good and I think when you start chasing these sweet flavors and sweet tastes um you just you know you just start becoming sort of uh mentally addicted to these things again and you want that flavor and you chase that taste and um you know it's always these um these things like you know when when your expectations meet your reality that's where happiness is right and when you're you know when you're a reality exceeds your expectations that's that's when you're you're really living a good life but when you're expectations for exceed your reality that's that's when people get very upset and so if you're constantly thinking like oh can I get something sweet can I get something this we can use that as a sweetener this is a sweetener that suit you're constantly you know uh wanting something that isn't really going to be a good idea for you and and you're just you're just going to be unhappy with it uh I think that it's better to just really appreciate the food that's good for you and just you know just enjoy that and uh you know that's what I do so I make meat taste as good as I can I you know I age it I prepare it I do things um in preparation to then have it be just unreal amazing steak and uh and so I don't really worry about anything else so I can't I can't see anything necessarily wrong with using glycine as a sweetener um so if you want to try it I guess but um I yeah I just yeah I would I would try to just eat Whole Foods I think that's always the best way to go is just just eating food as it comes and drinking water um there's a general question how long before taking Bloods should you stop taking any supplements to ensure that you get the picture of what you are naturally deficient in um well I mean there's sort of there's sort of a couple parts of that question first of all why are you taking a supplement if you're taking the supplement because you're you're deficient um you want to be taking the supplement like the day before um because that will give you that will tell you what your levels are at with the supplement if you want to just stop taking the supplement and see what you're doing normally um it depends on the supplement it depends on what you're doing if it's like like a vitamin or a mineral if it's fat soluble versus versus water-soluble but you know giving it a good sort of six to eight weeks probably be perfectly fine for anything um and so that's what you could do if it's sort of water soluble things you probably don't need to wait more than a couple weeks but you can um uh if if that's what you want to do if you just want to if you want to come up with supplements to see if you actually even need to take the supplements which I think is a good idea I think that you shouldn't take supplements unless you have a diagnosed deficiency in something and um and uh so yeah you try like six to eight weeks off of the supplements and then uh check it from there so there you go and [Music] let's see all right so bodybuilding on Carnivore under 2 000 calories a day will my body fat be used to build or do I need to eat more about 35 body fat uh I think I think you just well in in those sorts of areas I mean you need to make sure you're getting enough fat but you also need to make sure you're getting enough protein uh and so I would I I really hesitate when people are talking about like they eat this specific calorie they have this specific caloric intake because it's like is that because that's what your body's telling you to do or is that because that's where you're limiting yourself to uh I think that even if you have excess fat your body is still going to want a certain amount of nutrition and yes it will prioritize using your your body fat first and the problem with that is that if you if you eat too little your body's gonna just say oh hey you know what we need to store this we need to pull this back because we're in a famine and you know we don't need we need to protect this or we're going to die of starvation if we if we sort of burn through all of our nutrition and our calories so uh yes you do need to take in uh adequate protein and adequate fat um and uh you know so you need to you need to get those amino acids in you need to get those proteins in to build muscle um but uh you also just need to eat enough or your body is not going to uh really burn the fat because it's not going to release the fat because it's going to think that you're starving so you need to be careful with that and I would I would still just eat intuitively and just make sure you're getting enough protein and enough of that uh um yeah I I agree with that you know Christian said um as long as you're eating enough macros fat and protein you don't need to worry about the number of calories I agree with that so Andy asks any advice on introducing on inducing bowel movements please I have stopped getting them so it's hard to go due to my very secondary lifestyle style because of illness I eat high high fat meat and Eggs only um well I mean how long is it going between each ones like you know it's very normal to only go once a week and have not have there not be that much and if you're not eating like a lot of gristle then you know you're gonna you're gonna go even less you know because you're going to absorb basically everything that you eat if you're if you're not eating grits if you're only eating meat and you're not eating the gristle so you know I would just be patient if you're getting enough fat and your stools are soft then you're not constipated so it doesn't matter how long it takes before they go I I think people get very caught up in oh I have to go I have to go I have to go why do you have to go are you in pain is your stomach bloated you know are you vomiting have you stopped passing passing wind because those are all signs that you have you know an obstruction and then oh my God you need to go you need to take a laxative and get this thing unblocked but that's not happening if your stomach's flat and you're not bloated and you're not in pain why do you need to go eat enough fat things will go trust me and um but I just I just don't worry about it is is basically what you should be um is is the long and short of that uh thank you very much Luis for the"

tell me uh looking for recommendations on ending my Pepsi addiction doing one liter a day uh everything else is water and beef carnivore for 12 months lost 60 pounds awesome very good uh weight is stable thank you for the vids um from Las Vegas awesome wow thanks for for joining in um yeah so I mean that you know it is an addiction right so like caffeine is addictive and sugar is very addictive so these are things that are going to um you know compound the problem and work together to make it difficult to stop but you know that's a lot you know that's a lot of sugar it's a lot of caffeine and there's a lot of other chemical you know slop in there that you really don't want as well um I think just just I mean you could you could try weaning down and just you know limit yourself to sort of half a liter a day for a week or two and then down to you know just one Pepsi a day like a 12 ounce can of Pepsi day and then you just stop uh I'm I'm sort of like a you know I don't I don't really do things in half measures myself and so usually I feel better I just stop I've made a decision you have it in your head I'm just gonna stop another thing is that if you're having cravings like sugar Cravings carb cravings that um if you just eat fatty meat sometimes that can help suppress the the urges and the um cravings and so just you know just like when you're like oh I really want a Pepsi has some eggs you know or have some beef really yeah beef because you do beef and water which is awesome that's that's definitely a way to go um and uh you know looks like you're doing great you've lost 60 pounds you're keeping your weight stable that's awesome I think you'll you'll increase your um you know your results and how good you feel by by getting rid of the Pepsi as well so make a plan and stick to it so it's one of one of the two ways either half a liter for the next uh week drop down to one can for a week and then stop or just stop right now and but mark it on your calendar whatever you do you know write it down write in your calendar say this is what I'm going to do these are the days I'm going to do it and then you just do it um and uh you know it's it it it's um it takes a bit of doing but all addictions will end and eventually that chemical addiction will go away it's usually about two weeks for for um caffeine you can get headaches and be symptomatic for a few days it generally doesn't last more than a week and then you don't even really get the Cravings after about two weeks sugar can be two to three weeks for me it was about two weeks that was about it most people find that as well some people have have cravings and it's sort of really sort of want it longer than that you know and so you just have to be mindful of that but you need to stay strong also remember if you're getting Cravings it could be your brain just telling you that you're hungry especially after the chemical addiction after those sort of two weeks are gone because uh sometimes we just don't eat enough on a carnivore diet because our hunger signals are different and we haven't relearned them yet we haven't paid attention to them enough and so sometimes it just goes um uh it your your hunger signals sort of come in as craving your body your brains are saying hey get energy you know and so just remember that and so if you're having sort of if you're having cravings going forward just remember that that could be that what that is and just try eating meat first and uh and drinking water and things like that hopefully that helps so Charlie asks I've been suffering with chronic sinusitis for the last three years and I have had a number of surgeries I'm a month into carnivore still having a lot of issues with inflammation do I just give it time definitely give it time it takes a long time to clear your body of all these problems you can have a problem with inflammation and um and uh like just reading that gave me a runny nose um you can have problems with uh inflammation but it you know it goes away it does go away pathological inflammation goes away uh absolutely does but um all these all these issues take time and you know uh chronic sinusitis is an absolute Beast to get rid of it's um it uh it can you know get into the bone and just sort of just sit there and just keep coming back and keep coming back so you just need to be mindful of that and um uh but you know going carnivore is going to help your body it's going to help your immune system and if you need some extra help with like antibiotics and things like that to clear it then they'll work better anyway so yeah just keep doing what you're doing and just give it time and let your body heal and uh hello for uh from Texas hey how you doing American 1020. carnivorous four months and let's go awesome good job I've been feeling awesome at the moment that's like sort of like the sweet period where you're just coasting and feeling feeling your best so that's great uh barrico says no more diabetic no more hypertension no more migraines no more sinusitis the list goes on awesome that's that's absolutely fantastic um yeah so I I love seeing that where it's just you know people's lives are just getting so much better and um that's really really good to see so I'm glad to see that [Music] um yeah so Nick says uh a few months ago I was having cravings so bad at night time that I would leave my house to go to the grocery store to get ice cream at 9 00 PM slamming meat at night was the only thing that helped so that I think that's a very very useful comment um and and illustration that this can be um you know a very benefited by just eating meat and that sometimes your brain's just saying you know get something and like I've been there I've actually I actually remember sort of my late teens early 20s uh thinking it was just like oh my God I just need something sweet I need some ice cream I need something like going off and getting something like that and uh it's weird you have this weird compulsion you just have to get it and then you just eat meat and it goes away um so I don't know if it's the the sugar addiction that's doing that or your body's just your brain is screaming at you to get some fat because everyone was eating low fat forever because that's just what we were told to do I always have the sniffles doesn't the carnivore fix that I have these nipples because I've broken my nose hundreds and hundreds of times in rugby over over the course of of uh two and a half of a decade and a half um so you know that's just you know my face is broken unfortunately so um I've had I've had three surgeries just so I could breathe properly because the cartilage is just so broken and Tangled Up Inside My Face um because I just kept playing I kept playing with broken nose bone was split from here to my eye I eye socket and it was flat on the side of my face it just busted it back into place I had to do that you know I I did that on the side of the field a few times and I've gone to the ER and I've broken it back and stuck a tuning fork up my nose broke it back into place and then had three surgeries to fix the cartilage and and the bone because that is uh that's that's what I did to myself because I wasn't willing to stop I wasn't willing to stop playing I just I just you know just wanted to you know get out there and do it and so because I had a full-on openly broken bone and broken cartilage and I just I was a very very very physical player like I lived for the contact and the collisions like I just just tried to blow people up and um and so you know I figured out early on that if you hit someone harder than they hit you they take all the punishment and so it's just a matter of just intelligence you know just to be the hitter and not the hit e and when I was smaller than people and like playing in you know you know senior leagues when I was you know 17. uh people were twice my size and so I had to I had to just really rev up the intensity and the velocity because they give you think of your your kinetic energy um equations it's one half mass times velocity squared right well I didn't have the mass but velocity counts for a lot more so I was like great all right I'll just crank up that velocity up to Absolute you know highest as I can and just waste into somebody and so that's what I did so people were twice my size I just just blow them blow them up and then when I started growing into my frame and getting bigger and getting heavier and being one of the bigger guys out there I still had that mentality of just trying to just destroy people and you know so it made for some big big collisions and um which was fun was fun to to do and fun for people to watch and uh but because of doing that you know I'm just shattering my face you know all the all over the place but yes I always do have the sniffles because it's not always always but if I get like a little bit of allergies or something like that it just it's very easy to do it because I know it just doesn't clear it properly JV highlights I wish I had them I I have some highlight tapes um a lot of them just got uh because it was like I was doing most of this like before things were really big on the internet with people putting a bunch of clips and things like that on there um and a lot of games especially like the US games like they just didn't get uh recorded a lot of these games didn't get recorded and so um either were there were a lot of things actually on the internet for a while um and uh and then I remember checking them you know a few years ago and I couldn't find it for whatever sites they were on they'd just been taken off they weren't like on on I don't think they're on YouTube not by under my name anyway I don't think um but uh yeah so there used to be a lot more than there are now but yeah I I don't know whatever websites were had them up they're not uh maybe not in use anymore I don't know um so keto Elite reversed uh their pre-diabetes arthritis carpal tunnel tinnitus and uh and tinnitus is getting better cognitive function is skyrocketing awesome and thanks to all your wonderful content I am sharing with everyone well thank you very much I really appreciate that I'm really glad that it's helping and that you're having such good results and I appreciate you sharing things up with people and hopefully it helps them as well which I'm sure it will um Carson has Hashimoto's one to taper off the lthyroxine that should be dictated by your blood tests so uh it will happen you know you will your hatchimals will get better Hashimoto's can take a little longer than other things takes longer than a Crohn's and ulcer colitis however it does happen it does get better and um just be patient with it but check your check your Bloods and if you're feeling you know a bit jittery and and uh and uh you know like you're you're having too much uh thyroid medication then that's the time to get another blood test and say hey you know what is this doing another good marker is uh reverse T3 you can get your doctor to ask for a reverse T3 that shows a better um gives you a better idea of the intracellular function of of the thyroxine of the thyroid hormone so because that's again where this thing functions is inside the cell not in your not in your serum so um getting a reverse T3 can show you exactly how functional the thyroid medication you're taking is um but yeah so that that should be that should be guided by your doctor and your blood tests um so he said he responding to my request for an interview a couple of times but never got a response maybe the email systems have failed um that is interesting I do remember getting your email and I thought I replied so I'm sorry about that I will uh get on that right away and and reply but definitely want to get you on a podcast that would be awesome um one of my thoughts on egg whites um I don't have a problem with them a lot of people don't have a problem with them uh some people do and so especially people with autoimmune issues a lot of people without immune issues for some reason have problems with egg whites and so if you're having a little issue you're having some little skin issues or rashes or you know full-on autoimmune issues uh take out the egg whites see how that does see what that does for you most people with autoimmune issues really just need to stick to like grass-fed red meat uh as close as they can anyway you know grain finished red meat uh being again silver metal but you know red meat anyway so where do I announce these live chats normally I do these on uh Well normally I do these for patreon um and so actually today was supposed to be a patreon one and uh it wasn't actually working um and so I had to like restart it and re-go and I actually meant to have it be just uh from people that had a link and not have it be a general one uh but I ended up not hitting the correct one because I am a useless person at this sort of stuff because I'm just sort of trying to figure it out as I go um and this ended up being just a a general live so um that's how that happened but normally I do these um every week for my patreon group which is just Anthony chafe EMD and people can sign up there and I do I do lives every week or twice a week really and we do I post my videos there early and we have um at Discord groups and chat groups there just with our our community and uh we do like you know we start up like a book um book club and things like that to [Music] um to uh read different sorts of things that that help bring um more information to this space of health and nutrition and um I think the next next month we're going to be reading Nina Thai Schultz's book The Big Fat Surprise which is uh I think is very uh going to be very interesting I haven't read it yet myself uh but it's uh from the bits that I've seen is absolutely packed with uh with information and studies and uh historical data on on how ridiculous this whole idea of fat being bad for us was [Music] um so CJ saying she's or they are I don't know I don't know if uh sorry CJ I don't know um for a guy or girl I apologize um they are obese high cholesterol HBP high blood pressure I'm assuming um type 2 diabetes and thyroid what do you advise I would advise eating nothing but uh red meat and only drinking water and letting your body heal because all of those issues are caused by having uh eating the wrong things high cholesterol in your case probably is bad because it's damaged cholesterol from the sugars and uh and other other toxins but um if your cholesterol sort of changes a bit as long as your HDL is going up and your triglycerides are going down then don't worry about anything else but you need to be strict strict strict red meat and water uh really for the rest of your life but at least for the next two years uh so that you can really just get rid of this stuff or at least at least the next year and then you can make your decisions from there if you want to start eating the things that got you back in that place in the first place and that's your business but um that's how you get rid of that is you stop eating the things that put you there and you start eating the things that your body actually needs which is fatty meat fatty meat and water an d Mad Max hey thank
