    "transcript": "okay hello everyone thank you for joining for uh my YouTube live uh it's also on X and Facebook thank you all for joining us is for June 26 2024 so thank you all very much for joining it's great to see you all it's um it's been a few weeks since I was able to do one of these just because I was traveling uh for work and conferences I was speaking at a few conferences one was at a medical conference in London the public health collab operation in London and um then I was speaking in uh Texas at Austin and then over to Switzerland that was a really interesting one uh in Switzerland I was in St Mar which is absolutely stunning I haven't been out up into the the Alps in Switzerland before and so that was a very special special uh treat to get to get out there and and it was a wonderful conference as well that was the uh the keto live conference and the keto live sports conference were sort of back to back and so uh there's a sports medicine conference uh that I spoke at and then the the the rest of it was um uh after that was on a lot of other more General subjects and each day had a theme like cancer diabetes those sorts of things and they were excellent had some excellent speakers from all over the world and uh they do this every year I think this was the fourth annual event and so if people are are available next year and it's going to be in St meritz again it's absolutely stunning location and it's a fantastic conference and we got to go you know we had like walks out with different presenters and we'd go everyone would would talk and get out in the in the uh in the Mountain Air and walk around the lake and things like that it was absolutely fantastic and uh the public health collaboration as well is around the same time and I think they're going to sort of try to piggyback on each other like one after the other to make it easier for people uh like for me I had to go to London and then back to Australia and then over to America and then back to Switzerland would be nice for just be London Switzerland um and so they're gonna I think they're going to try to coordinate with each other next year as well so and that's a that's a fantastic conference also that was um uh this time in London but again happen at other other areas in the UK last year was Sheffield I think and then this year was in London so those are all fantastic um conferences they are uh eligible for CME credit so for for you know doctors and clinicians and and practitioners medical practitioners you get you get continuing medical education or uh professional development um points as well um for that so it's uh definitely worth worth checking out so um there are a couple super super chats and things like that that have have sort of come up and and previous uh ones that uh came up on um some previous premieres and things like that that have just sort of built up that we've kept track of can't keep track of everything unfortunately but we're able to keep track of some of these so um going to go through some of them so and some of the super chats actually came in over night since I posted this and so we'll start with those first and we'll go through them I have about an hour so I'm going to go through as many questions as I can but we already have like 16 um already so we'll do the best we can and um may may have to sort of cut off the super chats at a at a certain point and um so that we can try to get through all of them so we'll get going anyway so first question is from Ellie Ellie thank you for the Super Chat Ellie says I eat only beef but grass-fed here is very expensive and limited selection is it bad to eat almost all grain fed thank you again um no not at all it's it's absolutely fantastic um it's very very good for you it's very nutritious it's way more nutritious than anything else you're going to eat and so no that's perfectly fine I I mean for years and years and years I was eating uh predominantly grain finished just Costco beef because that's what I had access to that was what was convenient I could get in in bulk it was cheap and and very good quality so no that's that's perfectly fine is it it it objectively has less micronutrients and a different omega-3 to Omega 6 profile than grass-fed and finished beef however it is still far more nutritious than basically anything else you're going to eat so it is um you know it's not it's not as nutritious but it is extremely nutritious it's more nutritious than basically anything else so uh no that's perfectly fine you don't need to break the bank this isn't this isn't just for the elite um if you need just you know ground beef ground pork ground chicken you know eggs these sorts of things these are very cheap they're very inexpensive they're very good for you and they're perfectly good options brisket one of the cheapest Cuts also one of the best has great fat content great nutrition uh as well and um even even grassfed and finished brisket is not all that much more expensive than grain finish brisket and is uh you know very affordable very good for you so it's um uh but no that's totally fine if if uh grain finishes what you have access to then then go for it you know it's it's the not eating all the other things that's what makes the biggest difference another question from Ellie thank you again um Ellie says if it's the same Ellie same spelling anyway uh thank you in any case I want want to use butter but I'm afraid of not knowing how much of it to eat and dairy being addictive is it and is it healthier to get fat from meat thank you well grassfed butter is very very good and most people will do just fine with it um I don't I don't I don't think you have to worry too much about it some people you know may do better without butter but most people do just fine and it can be it can be a good way of getting fat you know getting the fat from the meat is is typically great um but you know if you're doing grain grain finished beef uh the Fat's not going to have as much omega-3 like DHA and EPA as it would if it if it was grass-fed and finished and so butter actually has a very good uh omega-3 to Omega 6 profile so that's actually not a bad idea um to add that in if you're if you're not getting any grass-fed fat as well because you'll get more Omega-3s and DHA and EPA also it's um it's possible to get fat trimmings from the butcher you can it's generally pretty cheap and um it's generally pretty cheap and and uh accessible and so especially if you can get grassfed and finished um fat trimmings and they're usually pretty dark yellow uh then that's fantastic that's really the best thing you can do you cut those into little chunks and you fry those up in a pan and it's absolutely fantastic so those are those are good options as well I'm just going to just open the door let my cats bugging me to let him out just one second [Music] okay all right so sorry about that um so there's a super chat from changle Thomas Jones thank you very much for that it doesn't look like there's a question but maybe there's one down the chain um dominicos dracos I'm going to go out on a limb and guess uh they say well first of all thank you for the super chat um Mr Draco says I'm a 17-year- old male a few months until 18 can I grow taller on Carnivore if so how can I maximize my growth do you get explosive diarrhea first week or two on Carnivore um so you well it depends if your growth plates are open then you can you can grow um it just depends so most people's growth plates will still be open at 17 18 years old however some people do close off and so it just depends on the individual but I mean there are people that that uh switched to carnivore at 21 and grow significantly I mean there are people in in University College and things like that that do grow and continue to grow so their growth plates are still open so that's pretty lucky but it's uh it's absolutely something that happens I had a friend of mine that happened to gr like five inches in college and went from being a um you know a great football player to an amazing football player to like a Pro Bowl football player and um and uh so it's um it's fully possible explosive diarrhea for the first week or two some people do some people don't if you're drinking coffee or tea taking magnesium using artificial sweeteners things like that you will exponentially increase your chances of of having explosive diarrhea because they're all atives those are all atives so if you're only eating meat you're only drinking water it's much much less likely especially if you get the fat balance right so you need enough fat you want to aim for about you know like a ribeye steak is about as much fat U as you want and um you know you're paying your Super Chat was in pounds so you know in England they may not have ribeye as much as like Scotch filet uh which will have a lot of the fat trimmed off so that's actually not as as much fat as you want remember that that diarrhea is sort of a U-shaped curve with fat so if you eat too little fat you can get liquid diarrhea and then you sort of get enough and then everything's sort of normal and then you get too much and you get liquid diar and you get diarrhea again so just remember that keep that in mind cut out the coffee tea magnesium supplements and artificial sweeteners for sure even in gum like sugar-free gum like all that sort of stuff that can all cause um diarrhea especially when you cut out fiber uh so it but otherwise um sometimes sometimes people get some loose toools for a while but those it's typically in the people that still drink coffee that's that's the most common time I see that so another Super Chat from dracos thank you very much I heard you need 8 to 10,000 iuse of vitamin D3 for optimal blood levels is this true on Carnivore is carnivore suitable for sedentary people it is it is absolutely suitable for sedentary people and everybody um just like grass is still good for you know cows and a pen or you know hay is good for you know or whatever you know hey whatever the hell they feed zebras in the zoo probably hay it's good for zebras in captivity and meat is still good for lions in captivity um nutrition is nutrition you know it's the right nutrition for your species or not and uh if you're active or inactive it just changes the amount that you require and that you need so yes if you're sedentary it's still just as important to get the right food and in fact it's more important because if you're sedentary you can't offset your your crappy diet by by exercising and at least you know you know using some of that energy so it doesn't get stored into fat and trying to build some muscle and stay fit and at least you know pretending that what you're doing is healthy um if you're sedentary then it's just it's all going to go to to rack and ruin so um it's it's even more important for sedentary people to be on a a proper human diet as far as Vitamin D3 that is that is a typical supplementary uh supplementary dose that people would take to supplement vitamin D3 doesn't mean that you necessarily have to have that all the time but to catch up to get into a better level that is a typical dose that um that people go on if they're deficient and they're trying to go up uh vitamin D3 in supplement form seems to be a different kind of vitamin D it's it's strange it's not quite what we make when we're exposed to Sun or what we get from food and so that's actually important so you really want to get your vitamin D3 from animal fat if you're very low sure top it up on supplements but um you know there there are some studies showing that getting people's vitamin D levels up higher with supplements isn't as uh beneficial as one would expect and doesn't seem to be as beneficial as just people who have naturally have higher levels of vitamin D3 so and that could be because of the different kind of vitamin D3 that you get from supplements versus from food and from being out in the sun so that's your first first Port of Call is you know get out in the sun don't use sunscreen really um and uh you know Tallow as skin moisturizer is very good for you if you're on a carnivore diet you typically don't burn you may get red but uh that that redness typically doesn't uh peel unless you really overdo it you can overdo it so don't overdo it but you know as long as you're not peeling you know your your um uh you're pretty much okay and then you know get sun exposure try to get out in the sun you know at least you know for 30 40 minutes a day it's actually just really good for you for a lot of different reasons and uh you know try to get your shirt off and and you know get out in the sun especially now in the summer months in England you know that's it's really important to get sun on your skin it's not just good for vitamin D it's good for nitric oxide it's good for your mitochondria it's good for um uh your um your your cardi metabolic system just actually is very beneficial to be out in the sun so very good things and you get the vitamin D but I would try to get this from your food as well I try to get this from from animal fat from grass-fed butter things like that grass-fed beef fat those sorts of things it's a it's a fat soluble vitamin it comes in the fat so you know you need to eat the fat as well um if you're very low you know in England if I'm not mistaken on the units in England you want to be between 140 and 180 on your vitamin D so just check that and um you know if you're down well below 100 maybe think about using a supplement but um definitely think about upping your animal fat and getting out in the sun it's very important Beth Boker thank you very much for the Super Chat Beth says nice to see you back thank you very much it's nice to be back are eggs as good as meat or is meat alone the ideal I know eggs have carbs um so do you have to limit them thank you as always no I I think I think eggs are honorary meat you know they have all the nutrients uh and precursors that then turn into meat turn into to chickens so it's uh it's actually absolutely fantastic pasture raised eggs are are far more nutritious than um normal uh you know grain fed Factory farmed eggs they have way more micronutrients so they're going to have they're going to be much more healthy and that's if they're actually pasturas and actually out there eating bugs and not just eating being fed a whole bunch of corn and soy and garbage like that you can't really tell one way or the other unfortunately but um but if they're eating what they're supposed to eat they're going to be they're going to get the nutrients that they're supposed to have and they're going to be much more nutritious for you as well so uh yeah but no eggs are great some people do react negatively to eggs especially like the egg whites some people have a problem with um so if that's you then you avoid them but if you do well with them and you feel great then yeah yeah go to go to town on eggs those are great so getting into some of the the uh stored questions uh from cby cby had an earlier question Dr chaffy as I'm in the UK so won't watch this live which is more nutritious butter ghee or Tallow uh grass-fed Tallow I'd say is your Pinnacle and then grass-fed ghee grass-fed butter uh it's Pro you know it's not that grass-fed ghee is necessarily more nutritious than grass-fed butter but it can um just be less of a problem and just more um more suitable for more people because the you know the proteins and milk solids in butter seem to be a problem for some people people most people actually do fine with them but G just less people are going to have a problem with that so but as far as nutrient content is concerned I think grass-fed Tallow is a grass-fed finished Tallow so it needs to be yellow if it doesn't have a yellow tinged probably not grass finished um that would be that would be I think the the best yeah and then um this was a a a very generous Super Chat for from stink ass cat um and who who just who this on a Premiere the other day um or last month in May um and I haven't had a PR I haven't had a live since then so I haven't been able to thank him so or her and so thank you very much for that it says hardcore carnivore is the only way well thank you very much uh for a very generous Super Chat and also for just being uh you know a very very supportive member of the group um uh stink uh often will um post you know very nice comments and super chats and uh even just to say thank you and and keep up the the good work and all that sort of stuff so I really appreciate that I really appreciate the support and I appreciate you being here and I'm glad that things are going well and I'm glad that you're doing well also um oh okay actually know this is a two-part question or comment really from um BM 78 Dr chaffy um and you saved all my and you all saved my Dad's life that's amazing um I'm very sorry he was sick in the first place but I'm very glad to hear that sounds like he's doing better I wouldn't have um I wouldn't have been able uh to do so wouldn't have been able to without your support deeply grateful it's been around two weeks since I started slowly feeding my dad meat U continues on here and he is now down to half insulin that's amazing um how amazing his kidney toxicity is way down too I can't believe how fast the results are coming he's 80 years old well that's amazing I'm really really glad to hear that I'm glad to hear that he's doing so well hopefully just continues to do better and better and better this was something that Melissa was telling me um that that unfortunately her father was in the hospital and very very sick and she was able to get him eating meat and they you know weren't really optimistic with how he was doing but now he's now he's home and he's doing better which is amazing so that's really really good to hear and um you know thank you for sharing that with us something very personal like that is not always easy to share in in groups and so thank you for that I'm really glad to hear that your dad's doing better random Adventures random Adventures 2.0 thank you for being such an inspiration I started carnivore 53 days ago got my blood work results today and my A1C went from 11.8 down to seven that's amazing um that's with no meds in eight weeks well that's that's really incredible so it's um it's always good to see um great results like that and that's pretty typical um that's just what happens I mean diabetes is not a disease it's basically carb hydrate poisoning and just you know bad food poisoning because you know seed oils and other sorts of things seem to to cause more insulin resistance as well it's very funny when people say that that um there's actually meat and fat that that cause insulin resistance I eating fat has absolutely zero effect on your insulin so that's out and so and then people are are going on a meat and high fat meat only diet and their diabetes goes away so obviously it's not the meat or the fat that's causing the diabetes clearly um but they they still CL clutch to these these crazy ideas even though they go completely against just the just the observ phenomena you're just looking at something that happened you seeing like wow all these people going on Carnivore diet high fat meat-based diet meat only diet and their diabetes goes away no meat causes diabetes just you just wait in 50 years you'll see like okay I'll be waiting for that Chestnut thanks um cornivore Scott says uh my VA liver dock uh says I no longer have portal vein hypertension wow um so carnivore has reversed it that's amazing um yeah portal Venus hypertension is a very serious condition and um is uh yeah is is I'm just very glad that it's it's better because that's a that's a very difficult situation to be in so that's amazing um I'm really glad to hear that and uh hopefully hopefully others see that and maybe get inspired to give it a try as well and hopefully they they get helped as well because that's that's pretty uh pretty amazing so great job thank you for sharing that this was a a super chat from uh C kuat I don't know I don't know how to pronounce that I'm very sorry but thank you very much for the Super Chat uh thank you sir for answering my questions I think that was um I think that was Melissa who actually answered the questions in the chat so well thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm glad that that Melissa was able to help um a peaceful wolf retirement uh I was thinking for months that my problem was from oxalate dumping and now the lab said no it's uric acid uh from too much animal products red meat Dr said no um so uric acid doesn't go up because you're eating meat it can go up eating um purines like um uh from livers or from organs and things like that that's you can get that up uric acid can also go up uh for other reasons one is keto adaption that's not something that everyone knows but ketones and uric acid compete for elimination in your urine and so you can actually track how keto adap you are when you become fully keto adapted by your uric acid levels so you're at first basically everyone's uric acid levels are going to go up because they're there you have excess ketones that your body's not utilizing properly and so your uric acid will go up because your ketones are getting expelled in your urine as well and so as you go your Ketone levels will get used more and you'll have basically this is what people notice when they at first they have super high ketones and like oh this is great I in ketosis and then after a few months they're like oh my ketone aren't that high I'm not in ketosis anymore what's going on no you are in ketosis it's just now you're keto adapted and so your body's using those ketones much more efficiently and so you're just not eliminating out you don't have excess amounts because you're using them and so you don't have to eliminate them and so uh and your uric acid comes down so um no the only so as far as oxalate dumping is concerned I mean it really depends on what what the problem is or if you're getting gout um there are five causes of gout one of them is uric a acid one of them is oxalates the only way to test is by stabbing a big honking needle into that horribly inflamed swollen joint and taking an aspirate and that's the only way to check it's exactly the same presentation otherwise but sometimes they'll just oh well that's nasty so we'll just check your blood levels and oh Uric acid's up must be must be gout right and must be uric acid gout well no not necessarily because there is actually a very weak correlation between serum levels of uric acid and and uh and uh gout and uric acid gout so people can have very high levels of uric acid never get uric acid in their joints ever uh and they can have very low levels of uric acid in their blood and get gout and get um uric acid uh deposits in their joint so it it has to do with how your body metabolizes and and uses and utilizes uh uric acid not just how much is in your blood and if you are having other sorts of symptoms that aren't gout related then why would uric acid be causing that uric acid is one of the if not the strongest antioxidant that your body makes so it's actually not the worst thing on earth to to have that um and um and so you know it's uh it's it's it's uh not apparent to me that your problem is uric acid um everyone's going going to have higher uric acid levels at first it's a really good um antioxidant it goes up when you're keto adapting it will go down when you're keto adapted and again weak correlation between uric acid getting into joints um just by having elevated levels so I would be you it may not be oxalates I mean oxalate dumping gets blamed on a lot of things but the oxalate dumping can actually manifest as pretty much anything in any tissue so it's really hard to differentiate that that and something else so I I always think of oxalate dumping as sort of a diagnosis of exclusion you know think of other things and uh and try to address those first and foremost try to optimize everything else and if you're just eating you know fatty beef and water and everything's otherwise ship shape and you're still having these problems okay well then you start thinking about oxalates maybe you add in a bit of low oxalate tea or something like that and that settles it down great you know that's uh that's probably what was going on and if it doesn't help well probably something else either way very doubtful uh you're having a problem with uric acid because uric acid is actually quite good for you and um you know and so you know I um I just doubt it you know it's um it gets blam for a lot of things and they and meat gets blamed for it too you know sugar fructose alcohol those sorts of things those actually raise uric acid and those actually can precipitate gout and getting uric acid in the joints so you know just eating it doesn't come from eating meat in fact in the 1800s that was the cure for gout was putting people on a beef and water diet right that was what Salsbury was doing for decades and and people after him you know carried that mantle and were using that so I would I would doubt that anyway but hopefully that helps chill froo thank you very much for the super chat on Carnivore 4 months lost 50 lbs had DBT in leg and Pulmonary embolism on Warr for 3 years now and my irr blood work is uh too low 1.6 should be two to three could I be getting too much iron and beef that's causing this issue um no it's it's um it has to do with with vitamin K so warrin knocks out vitamin k um you know k one and two you know these are precursors for your clotting factors in that are made in your liver and so the way that um the way that that it works is that uh warrin basically blocks uh vitamin K from being turned into these clotting factors in the first place so you know it's it's really just a matter of of adjusting your Warren dose for whatever your diet it is and and there are plenty of people on Carnivore who are on Warr as well and um and it's actually much more consistent they don't have the ups and downs because some people have very difficult time correcting their uh Warr and dose because they just you eat different things on different days and have different amounts of vitamin K and so if you're eating more vitamin K you're going to need more warrin you're eating less you're going to need less and so you know your INR is going to go up and down sort of crazily and that's why some people need to check their warring every week or even twice a week just just to make sure they're on the right dose it's it's a real pain in the ass and so if you're just eating a very consistent diet you know which is just meat um then you're going to get a much more consistent especially the same kinds of meats you're going to have a much more consistent uh amount of vitamin K coming in and you you'll have be able to adjust your dose much more it will keep it much more regular but you still need to get on the right dose and so just keep working with your doctor your doctor will be able to um keep bringing up and you just have to keep hydrating that dose up until you get into the right range and I'm sure you'll be able to there's plenty of people do it's just sometimes it's just takes a bit more finagling um than other people and uh but at that point you should be able to just stay on the same dose and pretty much be good uh for quite a long time and uh yeah so good luck with that but do work with your doctor and to get on the right dose srfs nw8 uh so don't know what that stands for but thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy I have existing gallstones confirmed with ultrasound I want to keep eating carnivore but I get frequent gallbladder pain and bad attacks what would you recommend um well you know the thing is is that you know first of all you know you know do talk to your doctor and see you know what's going on and obviously if you have uh gallbladder attacks or you have um possibly an infection or blocked Stone then that obviously needs urgent treatment and so you need to work with your doctor on that but as far as having gallstones in general and eating fat in general when you have stones that exist and you eat fat it's going to cause your gallbladder to contract and that's going to expel bile so that you can digest and absorb and emulsify that fat absorb orbit and if you have Stones getting in the way and they're sort of getting stuck and blocked it's going to cause pain and sort crunching down on these stones that could be quite painful and so some people are able to pass these if they're small enough they'll be able to pass these and get through them and some people are now reporting that they actually uh don't have any gallbladder pain anymore and they don't have any issues anymore and they don't have any Stones anymore because their body's either e dissolve them or pass them through more likely pass them through but if these things are too big and they're not going to pass through and they're not going to we don't know if they dissolve or not um but uh if they if they're not able to do either of those things they might get stuck and so if they do get stuck that could be a very serious emergency and you will have to get uh a procedure done to get that stone that Block Stone removed even have your gallbladder taken out which hopefully you don't but if you don't eat fat what's going to happen is that bile is going to accumulate in your gallbladder it's not going to get expelled at all it's going to continue to concentrate this in phys physiology textbooks that it can concentrate up to 20 times what it comes out of the liver as and uh what happens to any hyperconcentrated solution at rest it forms precipitate forms crystals forms Stones right and so that is if you do eat the fat you could get a block stone and you may need surgery if you don't eat the fat you will definitely grow your stones and at some point you'll get a blockage and you'll need surgery so it's sort of you know where to go from there it's really a personal choice but for me um you know I think that it it's still an advantage to get optimal nutrition and you do still need the fat and you do want to get get the fat and you know as long as the stones are small enough there is a chance that you can clear these things and hopefully you do if there's any concern or any problems you go see your doctor right away because if you have a block Stone that's a that's an emergency and you need to get that sorted out so uh good luck with that be very careful but you can you can still eat a carnivore diet and um even if you have to get your gallbladder taken out um you can still do a cornivore diet after that because you're living still makes bile it's just you won't have a big gush of it at time so you you can just split up your fatty meals throughout the day so you can you can get maximum absorption and I think we've cut off super chat at this point because we just have uh a lot of questions already and um so and I again I only have probably about half an hour left at this point uh so Daren uh D montier we solution it uh has a question it says my wife has just had a gallbladder stone episode first one she's been told by her doctor she should consider removing the gallbladder she has been on keto would carnivore be better um you know high fat is going to still do the same thing with G the gallbladder is concerned um it's going to start you know expressing out that bile and you know and use that to emulsify and absorb the fat if um so that that shouldn't change unless she changes the amount of fat that she she has um I think carnivore is better than keto anyway just because you're getting rid of plant toxins and other sorts of fiber is actually digestive disruptor blocks out the absorption of a lot of things that actually strips out bile oh that's good you want to get rid of that bile no you don't bile is actually really good for you you make Torin in your liver it's expressed in your bile and you only absorb it again if you absorb that bile so you can actually get torine deficiency by eating fiber even on a keto diet and so that's not good that's not what you want and if you cook your meat you're not going to get your torine because torine is denatured when you cook meat so you know you know you want it you need it it's it is essential um we consider it non-essential because we make it but we make it in the liver and we absorb it in the bile and so it is essential we do need it it's just that we make it but if you if you're taking a bunch of fiber and you're losing a lot of that bile then no you're not going to get enough torine and you will be deficient and you will have a problem a toine deficiency is a problem so um you know it's just like the last question potentially she may need her gallbladder out if she does she can still do carnivore she can still do high fat keto it just needs to be sort of split up throughout the day and eventually she might form a pseudo gallbladder and be able to do more U big meals one at a time but or in one go but um that remains to be seen if that's something that happens and so you know it it just depends um you know she can always see how she goes with uh with what she's doing and if things settle down then that's great and if things get worse or just continue to be a problem uh then she can always get surgery with the caveat that sometimes if you if you do it electively it's a much more straightforward procedure you can do it through Keyhole um sort of laparoscopic incisions it's a lot safer much less complications and uh much lower complication rate much less scarring and adhesions and all that sort of stuff and less likelihood of infections and blockages and all these other sorts of things whereas if you wait until it is an emergency sometimes there's an infection involved very fry able there's a lot of PS and um all that sort of stuff and the tissue is just falling apart and so you have a much higher risk of hitting a blood vessel having a bad bleed things like that so it is definitely something to take under consideration and you know discuss the available options with her doctor if her doctor is saying look this is this really is just there's nowhere to go from here you know maybe uh you know that that's something to consider if the stones are small enough and they think that it there's a chance that these things can sort of pass on their own you know that's something to consider however it's a it's a trade-off because if something does get stuck and it is an emergency it's a higher complication rate and um when you get surgery as an emergency as when you do as an elective so that's something that should really be strongly considered uh with the advice from her doctor so good luck to her and good luck to you uh cam the carnivore thank you for the Super Chat how much water do you recommend we consume uh and do you yourself consume I realize we haven't had access to water like this until now thanks for all you do well we we've typically congregated around water sources and so when when humans migrated we you know brought water with us and we tried to you know camp and make camp and civilizations around water sources uh both for water and uh probably for for food like fish and things like that as well um so but we probably didn't you know drink water all day every day probably you know every now and then would just camel up would just run by the creek or river and just you know drink drink as much as we felt we needed to and then move on for the day um so yeah just having sips throughout the day probably not necessary I naturally have gravitated toward just the camel method of just drinking a lot of water in one go and then being good for the day maybe drinking a bunch of water later so I wake up in the morning and I maybe drink a liter of water maybe two and then I get on with my day I may not actually drink much water until I get home that night and then probably I'm a little thirsty and so I drink you know a few more liters then I don't really track how much I drink I just go by thirst and I I tend to drink probably more water than other people do maybe four five six liters a day um I detarium tracking friends are horrified by this but you know um that's what seems to make me feel the best and then uh so I go by thirst you know if my my lips are sort of dry and cracked I think okay probably not getting enough water if I'm getting uh leg cramps at night it's for me at least it's always because I'm not drinking enough water and I start increasing the water in those leg cramps go away at this point my my electrolytes are well balanced it's been seven years and so it's you know I don't I don't even salt meat anymore I just whatever is in meat I eat and so that's what I do anyway so you know I have I sort of have this you know this is my first leader of the morning and I've just sort of you know had a bit of it but um you know I do feel thirsty so you know um that's usually what I do I usually go for the camel approach there's there's some people that actually talk about that that you know just having sips of water throughout the day actually isn't isn't uh the the best way to do it I forget actually the argument as to why and what that did but there did seem to be some sort of argument as to just drinking more in one time uh but the same amount throughout the day actually seems to be better than just drinking small amounts throughout the day don't know but for me uh the camel method seems to work pretty well so that's what I do you know when I was growing up in wrestling my class was a 64 oun Big Gulp super big gulp good glass from uh from 7-Eleven and uh so that's a half a gallon or you know a little over two well around two liters um so it's a big ass cup and um and I would I would fill that up and I would chug it down I would fill it up again I would chug it again so ID drink a gallon at a time and um and that's yeah because I was just just working hard and sweating a lot and I didn't have enough water throughout the day I'd drink some of that in the morning and then I'd drink that I I might drink like a gallon or two a day and when I was playing rugby I always felt best when I have like two gallons a day I just felt amazing had much better Energy felt much uh better athletically I remember once I was out of shape I sort of came in to the season sort of a month late so I missed all the preseason stuff and I was just basically my first week of practice the first game was that weekend I'm like oh God okay I'm out of shape I'm just going to make sure my my hydration is on point so I drank two gallons a day every day for the week leading up to the game and I felt great had a great game you know had all sorts of energy running around this was great and so I was like oh wow I'm I'm I'm in better shape than I thought yeah look at me and the next week I sort of pulled off on it I still drank water but I only drank probably about a gallon a day because I wasn't on top of it and the next game felt miserable had way less energy was just dragging myself around the field I'm like okay I was definitely not in shape that was that was just from the hydration and so it um it seems to make a big difference for me anyway so that's that's what I do and uh my sister rosin says yay little boy is there he is there he was there he's gone now he he left me little bastard but um yeah he had to go he was getting bored in here uh Frank calibrii thank you very much for the Super Chat carnivore October 203 or 2023 uh NGO mural thrombus uh aorta plaqu aerosis high blood pressure 3 weeks on a toroa and 80 milligrams aspirin p um I'm Lo to HDL high LDL low triglycerides low Axia uh clot cerebral chronic esea um quit yes no thank you no I don't think that U it would you need to to quit doing a carnivore diet I think that that um you know optimal nutrition is is most important when someone is dealing with very serious issues like this and now your HDL being high is great tricars being low is great HDL or LDL being low that can go up or down depending on the individual for me it's it's uh High I don't consider that high I consider that physiological I consider that exactly where my body wants it to be in fact people that are more slim uh lower body fat percentage and and typically in better metabolic Health seem to have higher LDL when on a ketogenic diet so on the lean mass hyperresponders sort of things but it's the um people that are less metabolically healthy maybe overweight have higher um well BMI so you know how however useful that is um but um it's uh they they seem to find that those people tend to have lower LDL so in fact higher LDL tracks with better metabolic health and uh better body composition at least from that study so no I think I think it's a very good idea to be to optimize your nutrition I think that optimizing your nutrition is one of the most fundamental things that we can do to support our health and then we have all the different sorts of wonderful miracles of modern medicine with medications and surgeries and procedures and and investigations that we can that we can use to our advantage as well but it's starts with our own nutrition how we care for our body your body is a temple don't put garbage into it and so if you take care of your body your body will typically take care of you and we have medicine and doctors and procedures to help fill in the gaps if um there's anything else that goes wrong but it it it starts and finishes with nutrition nutrition is the fundamentals of of good health and so having optimal nutrition and I do believe that what we are biologically uh designed for what our evolutionary diet is is our optimal nutrition I think that's the definition of nutrition for a species is what that species has been eating for the longest period of time it's pretty straightforward um and so if that's uh you know uh if you're eating that I think that you're going to optimize your health does that mean that everything's going to be revers and go away no of course not it just means that it's going to optimize your nutrition and at least that won't be an ISS issue and your body can heal from a lot of things that an inappropriate diet would have caused and what what that means to you means is just remains to be seen but I think that you'll find that it actually really helps your condition and your situation um in a in a lot of ways and a lot of people are able to come off a lot of their medications their blood pressure normalizes things like that so I would personally um still recommend optimal Nutri ntion for anybody at any time optimal nutrition is optimal and so if you feel the same way then that's something that that you can try but no I don't think that you that uh you're doing anything wrong I think a lot of people in your in your situation um have uh improved significantly so hopefully you do as well good luck and obviously work with your doctors because those are very serious medical conditions RS thank you very much for the Super Chat uh started carnivore March 26th after blood and urine tests um June 13th tests show rise in Billy Rubin total from 1.0 to 1.3 and a trace of protein and urine is this something to be concerned about um not necessarily you know sometimes people have elevated Billy Rubin for a number of different reasons uh Gilbert's Disease is is a benign reason for uh hire Billy Rubin um um you know you if you're having you know pain or anything like that maybe you're thinking about you know gallstone obstruction or something like that or billary tree obstruction that can back up the bile that can back up Billy Rubin into your blood and U but then you typically get jaundice and other sorts of key features itchy skin all these sorts of things um that can be indicating that you have a blockage of some form so you know if there's a concern obviously see your doctor you know I mean your doctor got those blood tests and and urine tests so obviously you know that's something that you know they need to follow up on but um no those going to be completely benign if you're not having any other symptoms may not be anything else going on but it there could be something so obviously you need to to you know check up with your doctor but um carnivore diet won't damage your kidneys and they won't damage your liver and they won't cause jaundice on their own if you have something else uh going on like you know you're eating more fat and so now a stone has comeing out and gotten lodged that can cause a rais in your Billy Ruben for instance but that you would have other symptoms like you'd be in pain you would get jaundice yellow skin to tint to your skin and your scare of your eyes things like that so um you know keep that in context but if you're feeling well and everything's great and your doctor's not worried about it then then that's okay but you know do do double check and just make sure there's nothing else going on you know so these these blood tests are you know very hard to look at in isolation you need to look at the whole clinical picture the rest of your Bloods and and your symptoms as well so um yeah just just double check with your doctor whoever put you in to get those tests or if you ask for them to be done yourself just double check with your your uh primary physician and um just make sure that that they're happy with everything and you can also just get a retest you know it's uh sometimes you get these little fluctuations and if they're otherwise okay and nothing else is a problem doesn't really necessarily mean anything and sometimes you check it again and it just comes right back down again so sometimes you just get a blip on the radar even a lab error so that's also something to think about swine dog thank you very much for the Super Chat hello doc I'm a fan of the carnivore bars especially for travel and I make my own pkin I experimenting with different fat to protein ratios is there a specific percentage of fat you would recommend well that's great I I definitely like the cornivore bars too that was the major staple of my travel diet when I was um going around um all over the world literally circumnavigated the globe went from um actually you know one and a half time so Perth London and back that was 24 hours each way and then Perth to Austin to Seattle to Switzerland back to Perth so it actually circled the globe and um cornal bars made up a big part of that so because I wasn't getting much food that I wanted on on the airplanes and for 35 hours it was just you know stuck there and I just ate carnivore bars that was it uh pkin is great too it's basically the same ingredients it's just meat mixed with fat isn't it and uh and it's great and it's uh it's much more affordable to make your own um but if you can't or you don't uh have the option to then Carnival bars are great um as far as fat percentages I mean the typical ratio for pemin would be um dry weight powdered crushed up uh lean meat powdered that and U mixed that by weight 5050 with rendered Tallow grass-fed Tallow is to be preferred for sure and that from what I understand is two grams of fat to one gram of protein and so that's 80% calories from fat and I think that's probably the right ratio to go for if you are finding that that's you're just not absorbing all that and you're you're getting loose stools because of that just kick it back you know just bring it back you know add a bit more um lean meat to your uh to your Tallow and um and you'll get you know between one and two one to two grams of fat I wouldn't go less than one gram of fat to one gram of protein so I would just go even even ratio and then adjust from there um the carnivore bar is about is about two to one fat to protein so uh by grams and so that's 80% calories from fat so that's what um that's what I would go for that's what I'd aim for and then you just adjust for you and if that's not enough add more fat if that's too much add less fat and uh yeah just see see what you prefer and what works best for you the bush rangan order thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy I've got a few questions just wanted to let you know firstly that you can refer to me as bushy uh rather than the bush rangy in order okay well good to good to know that bushy I actually got a a good buddy of mine um named bushy that played rugby with growing up he was a he was a kiwi and um Steve Bush he was a badass is a badass uh and absolute badass player and he was you know he was on all the The Grooming teams for being an all black back in New Zealand is and he had family um that were all blacks like his uncle was a prop also named last name Bush I don't know his first name though but he he's like you know just you know one of the one of the great all black props and other family members uh All Blacks as well so he came from a from a lineage and um and he was being groomed up for it as well and then he moved to Seattle and and just really liked it there and um that's so I was fortunate enough to play with him as well bushy's freaking great but yeah so good to meet you bushy and uh thank you for the Super Chat Maria Fila thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat it's very kind of you hi Dr chaffy my lifelong friend of 35 plus years beautiful woman has Scleroderma do you think carnivore could help her thank you for um for all of the eye opening information you provide well Yes actually I you know it's um you know some of these things are are based in you know ketogenic studies that people have done on ketogenic di things like that others are just anecdotal this would be in the anecdotal uh category but yes I've seen people with Scleroderma improve on a carnivore diet so um a lot of these conditions that are just have just very unknown cause and just weird sort of reactions the body has autoimmune issues uh seem to be a reaction to an inappropriate diet from plant toxins or other sorts of things that our bodies are saying that does not belong in here and it causes disruption in our physiology biochemistry and and Immunology um and I think Scleroderma is one of those things and so uh another thing to do you can go into the the older long-term carnivore Facebook groups like zero carb health and zeroing in- on health and just look up in the search function there Scleroderma this these things have been up for 15 20 years and there's a lot of information on there as you look up Scleroderma and you'll see all a lot of other people there's nothing that has happened to to you that has not happened to someone else and have and they've had those same questions and so you can find those questions in the in the search uh functions in these older groups and uh they're fantastic so uh there very very good resource and just look up Scleroderma and you'll see you'll see a lot of people improve and I I I hope that your friend is uh one of those people that improves as well good luck to her Keith uh cerak thank you for the Super Chat just uh popped in Inu hernia uh and will the carnivore diet help I mean that's a structural issue right so that's probably not going to be fixed without surgery unfortunately uh but a cornivore do can certainly help uh recover from surgery you know you're getting I mean just just higher protein diets in general typically help wound healing and and recovery and if you're yeah you're just you know at any time optimal nutrition is going to help your body do as well as it possibly can but uh no it's it's not going to repair the abdominal wall probably you know it can help strengthen it um but and help you recover from surgery and hopefully not have uh complications and things like that but it's not going to repair the wallet itself so you probably will need surgery if it's uh especially if it's bad enough sorry to hear that um that's really unfortunate but I still think cornivore diet is a good idea to optimize your health going forward in general and recovering from surgery if you do end up getting it good luck with that Keith okay uh Gunther SB thank you very much for the Super Chat this is my first month lion diet I've never been vaccinated for HPV but want to if I get a vaccine uh too soon after starting carnivore can it interfere with or limit the healing I may have I may have otherwise had from the diet no I don't think so I don't think that that's a problem in fact they think that you know you're on a carnivore diet and that can actually help optimize your um your immune system um we it does seem to help regulate the immune system people with autoimmune issues to be able to reduce their Auto auto antibodies and improve their symptoms without immune modulators um people have been using a carnivore diet since the 1800s to help um with tuberculosis Dr Salsbury was doing that and so and in fact pre-agricultural uh fossil records don't show signs of tuberculosis infections in the bones or the spines of people we we really only start seeing that after um population started moving to agriculture so there's something to be said there as well so no I don't I don't think that that's a problem I I you know the I don't think that will interfere with your carnivore diet uh experience and or the benefits thereof um and I don't think that being on a carnivore diet will interfere with the vaccine either if you and so I that that won't affect it anyway if you have a reaction to the to the vaccine it's it's not going to be because of carnivore anyway so I think that's um that that should be fine so yeah no it's um I don't I can't see any problem anyway I don't know of any anyway so good luck my good friend bushy back again thank you very much for the super chat um have you looked at Alpha gal syndrome any solutions or thoughts on its Origins and also treatment options well the idea is is that you're you're creating a sensitivity to a or having a reaction to um the the the you know saliva some little toxin or whatever in the bite of a lone star tick and that's causing you to react to one of the carbohydrates that typically appears on on red meat or in red meat and so um and so you have a bit of a of a of a immune reaction to that whether we call that a true allergy I don't know we were reacting to it negatively I you know this is not something we had too much experience with because it's not as common as all that but you can still eat meat you can still actually do carnivore because you know white Meats don't seem to have that the same um you know Alpha lactose uh carbohydrate molecule that people seem to react to seems to be more on red meat and so you still eat you know chicken fish things like that and uh possibly eggs too but yeah you know but there there's the list anyway you can look these up on the different meats that you can eat and so you can still do it you can still do uh carnivore no problem it's just you sort of have to avoid like the the red ruminant meat and um but from what I've been told and I don't I don't know how accurate this is but it's just something that I've been told by other clinicians who have dealt with this is that a you can eat other meats so just do that b it typically only lasts about 6 months to a year and so at some point you can go back to eat red meat as well so it's um it's not great but it's not the end of the world and it's uh from the sounds of it could be temporary anyway and hopefully it is because that would suck to not be able to eat steak again for the rest of your life and just be stuck on you know peasant bird and just eating that the rest of your life but you know any port in the storm you know and if you're if you're um just eating still eating really good quality meat then you're still going to be doing really really well so um that's uh that's what I would do anyway hopefully knock on would don't ever have to uh come you know deal with that but um you know we'll see uh you there there are workarounds anyway and hopefully it's it's only temporary okay um another one from bushy thank you for the Super Chat can you please speak on the dangers of worms and other parasites if when eating raw meats such as flu qum it depends on where you're eating them if you're in a country that that thoroughly tests these things most Western countries do they'll take samples from all the different um processing plants they'll send them off they'll look for parasites they'll look for bacteria they'll look for contamination and if there's any problems they'll pull them uh there haven't been any uh parasite even in pork in American pork I think for like 25 years I don't think there's been a single diagnosed case of stenosis and farmed pigs in America in like 25 years so it's um it's something that is really checked uh very very thoroughly it is it's one of those things that people say oh no you should never eat meat oh you have to cook it all the way well done lean as hell I I think that's just a way of getting people just to naturally not want to eat meat because you get lean meat cooked um you know pass a point of recognition just it just tastes horrible as we was oh I just don't like meat and and um that's because you didn't cook it right you know you burn the hell out of it and there's no fat on it so of course you don't like it I don't like it like that either but that's not meat you know um so I actually cook meat I sear it on the outside I leave it pretty rare on the inside sometimes it's just fullon blue on the inside medium rare at most I really don't like anything past medium rare it just doesn't taste good to me and so I um I and but you know I'm I'm doing that in countries that you know do that do check this stuff and are are much more careful about it and you know we have whole parts of our immune system that are involved in fighting off parasites and parasites you know have whole parts of their defenses that uh you know try to you know elude our defenses but know so there's a back and forth but I think that for the most part for people in um uh countries you know test these things and check these things you're pretty F you're pretty much okay while game that's when you need to start cooking things more uh more well done I you know medium rare are well done because it's um uh parasites are a problem and um you know there there are much more parasites in in wild animals and Wild game and things like that whereas in in farmed animals much less so it just depends on where you're getting it you know wild fish things like that probably cook it all the way you know U Sashimi is very carefully prepared there's certain ways that they prepare the fish um so that it it sort of kills the bacteria or the um the parasites I should say or gets them out of there um but you you are sort of running that risk especially with things like salmon salmon seems to have a higher you don't just eat raw salmon like like the salmon sashimi from like a Japanese restaurant they especially prepare that there's ways that they can prepare it to um counteract the parasites in there so it just depends on what you're eating where you're eating it um and if you have symptoms you're having GI upset and all these other sorts of problems you might want to think about doing U you know getting a medic you know getting some medication it's usually pretty quick like one pill or three days one pill a day for three days usually pretty good after that um and uh yeah but if you're not having problems you're not having any symptoms that you're worried about you know and you're being careful in in the quality of meat that you eat I don't I don't think that's probably as much of of an issue as all that so good luck um all right let's see here [Music] um Mama the uh Kaa I don't I'm sorry again that's there's been a a few names today that I've not been able to to get a handle on so sorry about that but thank you very much for the Super Chat four weeks pregnant um AB LC um so something low carbketo AB animal-based low okay animal based low carbketo uh but uh not strict carnivore well then get out no just kidding um uh need sources uh study name Etc to give my doctor when telling her I'm trying keto thank you very much well I guess it depends on what sort of um studies you're looking for um I you know it's um there are I mean there are literally thousands of studies on ketogenic diets in general animal-based ketogenic diets that um um that's uh animal based ketogenic diets that's that are showing Improvement for things like diabetes and other you know metabolic health issues for weight loss for all these different sorts of things so so there are a lot of different benefits um I mean epilepsy I mean we studying that for 100 years you know uh for ketogenic diets so um you know it just depends you know so I mean the I don't I don't know of any specific studies looking at ketogenic diets for pregnant women but you can just point to the Inuit who have been on animal-based ketogenic diets for Millennia um more than Millennia and um and they still have babies and um you know they don't have crazy birth defects and all these other sorts of things uh India has some of the highest birth defect rates on Earth and they eat only three kilos of meat per person per year on average so that's probably not helpful and and uh that's my my wrap it up signal um and uh so I don't know exactly what what studies would be best for you um to bring to your doctor the ones that you're specifically looking for you know is things on on on is it you know U you know cholesterol and all these sorts of things being fine uh one thing you can do if there is something specific that you're looking for you can just go on to like Pub Med or even just Google SC and you can just look up that issue pregnancy ketogenic diet you'll find a lot of things or ketogenic diet heart disease ketogenic diet diabetes ketogenic diet X Y and Z and um and so you'll find a lot of those things anything that talks about a ketogenic diet look for two things one how much carbohydrates are they actually restricting if they're calling a ketogenic diet or a low carb diet what does that mean to them in that study because sometimes they say it's oh it's a low carb diet and it's h yeah it's less than 200 grams of carbs a day okay all right so that's it's not really all that low and um and and one said that like oh was a ketogenic diet and it definitely was ketogenic we checked their ketones ketones were up all the time and how we kept them in ketosis the fat we used was Crisco so like no so obviously not so anything using seed oils anything using hydrogenated seed oils like Crisco um anything that doesn't actually have restrict ke um carbohydrates below 20 grams a day basically don't bother with them because that's not what we're talking about you know we're talking about animal-based ketogenic not uh under 200 grams with Crisco you know so that's something I'll look out for as well and those ones the animal-based fats uh with actual ketogenic levels of carbohydrates uh do fantastically well and so those are the ones you want to look for as well so hopefully that helps uh Caleb hessinger thank you for the Super Chat just started meat only 5 days ago feel really good acne is going away and I'm feeling very high energy any advice for dry mouth and trying to gain weight or muscle 19 years old 125 lbs 5' 10 thanks uh well dry mouth drink more water and um and first of all that's great I'm really glad that you're feeling feeling good already acne is already starting going away it's only been five days that's amazing um you just need to eat meat you need to eat a lot of meat you need to eat until it stops tasting good you do that at least twice a day you're a growing boy so you know you need to you need to you know pack in the food and you need to lift weights lift weights and Sprint those are the best things you'll ever do for yourself you get into a habit of of lifting weights regularly 3 four days a week sprinting U you know three four days a week as well at least you know two three days a week um you're too exhaustion to muscle fatigue uh with the Sprints and the weightlifting and you're eating enough you're going to have fantastic results you're going to put on a lot of muscle you're going to be very athletic and you're going to feel amazing and you keep doing that throughout your life you do that through adulthood you do that when you're 95 if you can and if if you're doing it all the way up until you're 995 you probably will be able to do it past 95 um the less you do the less you'll be able to do as you age remember that and so it starts now right now whether you're 19 or or you're 85 it starts right now you can't start before you know it's like the there the old say I think it's a Japanese proverb or maybe Chinese it says um the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago and the second best time is right now okay so the best time to start working out lifting weights eating properly and doing sprinting was you know as soon as you were walking and really in the in the womb for eating meat um second best time is right now so yeah so just eat a lot eat a lot of fat and eat until it stops tasting good at least twice a day three times a day if you need to but at least twice a day you get enough food until your body tells you to stop until you get a bite it tastes like cardboard and you just say not doing it anymore that's when you're done and you work out and you push yourself very hard you'll put on muscle more easily than you have before and once you start putting on more and more muscle it'll get easier and easier and easier to do that and but it's consistency it's not g to it's not going to happen overnight you're going to talk we're talking years to build up uh a decent amount of muscle mass U but eating this way in that and working out in that fashion will get you uh the best results as fast as possible so good luck with that and bushy thank you very much for the super chat again any thoughts on those with misela can changing the diet really combat that type of cancer somebody I know with late stage can't eat meat without causing a lot of pain in their liver area well that might be something to do with their gallbladder um might be something to do with like Stone or something like that so that that's something to get checked out with their doctor maybe get an ultrasound see what's going on there um misela that's a that's a difficult one because that's um that's a very aggressive form of cancer and so it's um it's uh it it but these cancers you know all all known cancers behave in a similar way they have the same physiological uh uh characteristics which is they they don't um uh they they don't go through oxidative phosphorilation and so they have to go through substrate level fermentation and so they require far more glucose to to run than normal cells about 400 times the amount of glucose so even though you make glucose you're still not it's better to not Jack up your glucose way higher and just you know pour gas on the fire um the amount of glucose that you make isn't uh enough to run um at at Full Steam for these Cancers and so it's just just doing any sort of ketogenic diet is going to be a good idea um watch my interview with Professor Thomas seed s YF r i d he um is one of the Premier cancer researchers he has over 150 um peer-reviewed Publications on uh ketogenic metabolic therapy and cancer um get the gki low get blood glucose low get the ketones high with a combination of diet and potentially fasting or or calorie restriction if you need to can't let him lose too much weight you need to be able to to go um do refeeds and uh keep lean body mass at a at a good healthy level um those all those are all some of the principles that Dr um seed talks about and has published on and you can find a lot of his uh Publications on there I'm actually working with as part of his team um you know my my contribution is very minimal but um uh uh we're about to publish a large protocol on ketogenic metabolic therapy and how to deal with various Cancers and things like that so it's um it's quite comprehensive it's quite long and so when that comes out take that out as well but I don't imagine that that misela would act in any sort of a different way um either even though it's a very aggressive uh nasty form of cancer so good luck to your friend um do check out the G gall bladder with with their doctor and and see if there's anything can be done there and uh just good luck either way you know look up ketogenic metabolic therapy um and just get rid of the carbs and the sugar because that feeds cancer plain and simple that's just all there is to it that's a start and stop is that feeds cancer so you know avoid that and good luck and we have some uh super chat or super sticker from low car blow drama thank you very much for that another Super sticker from Heather Keys thank you very much uh for that as well um and there's something from changle Thomas Jones I think that was a previous Super Chat um was HDL 2.1 uh LDL 13 on high fat lamb diet kindly advised I really appreciate it um well you look at your triglycerides look at your insulin fasting insulin look at your hba1c look at your other metabolic markers and and you know watch the different uh lectures and read the studies talking about this sort of relationship where if you're metabolically healthy um that you'll see high HDL which you have you'll see low triglycerides which I'm assuming you may well have and your LDL can fluctuate depending on your med olic health and people that are more metabolically healthy more um uh slim tend to have higher LDL levels so it's not necessarily something that's bad it could be something you know at that level could be you know familial hyper cholesterolemia and um you know we've had exactly the same amount of people having hyper familial hyp cholesterolemia back in the 1800s as we do in the 1900s and yet the the the mortality rate and heart attack rate went through the roof in the the 1900s and it didn't really exist in the literature at all in the 1800s at least not in America so you know something to think about as well and I have a I have a YouTube um video called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease uh Dr Paul Mason has a number of of lectures online that you can watch as well Dr aim multra is a cardiologist in the UK and he wrote a book called A statin-free Life U where he talks about these sorts of issues as well and so that's what I would I would look at as well and then um and then there's there's one more Super Chat that didn't sort of get put up but I'll read it out to you it's from nav thank you very much for the Super Chat day 40 carnivore no caffeine get solid stool in am U that leaves streaks in the toilet and then a few loose stools during the day not sure uh how to adjust fat because I get both loose and solid stools typically um if it's very hard and dry and cragly um and then you're getting liquid stools around that you can get what's called overflow diarrhea which is um you're getting sort of half blocked up and so the liquid stool from the small intestine sort of squirting around the outside of that so you're getting liquid diarrhea and then every now and then you get this Boulder that comes out and if that's the case then you need to eat a lot more fat because you're actually quite constipated and so you're sort of slowing things down enough that it's sort of getting stuff's having to squirt around the sides because it's not able to push it down and out so if that's the case then probably eat a lot more fat and see how you go clear everything out and hopefully it'll just be nice soft normal stools after that uh that's typically typically the pattern that you see so um again it's a U-shaped curve so too little fat you get loose stools because of the Overflow uh issue and if you get really you're only really just getting protein at all then you you sort of get more of a protein poisoning sort of situation where you'll get loose stools as well but before that you'll get this sort of pattern hard dry Rocky stools and every now and then and then sort of liquid stools as well and then you get enough fat and that sort of settles that down and then you get too much fat or not too much fat because it's not harmful to you but a lot more fat than your body can absorb and then you're just you know you're just it's coming out it's it's got to go somewhere and you're it's not going it's not getting absorbed so it's got to go out uh the other way so uh yeah that's what I would that's what I would uh suggest probably eat more fat and see how you go that's what it sounds like okay I've got a I've got a run I've got an appointment in about 10 minutes so I I've got to get out of out of the house so um thank you all very much I really appreciate you coming on it's good to see everybody um after being gone for a few weeks uh for all the conferences and things like that so uh thank you all for joining thank you all for the super chats and thank you all for uh the participation in the comments and helping each other and talking and and hopefully uh making this an entertaining time so and we end on stools yes we do seems to be a common theme uh yeah that seems to be something that people uh have questions about a lot so uh thank you all very much really appreciate it and I will see you next time"
