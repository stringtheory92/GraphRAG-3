        "body": "all right sorry i'm trying to get something sorted on instagram here there we go lovely um really appreciate it ronaldo uh and then thank you i'm really glad that you've learned a lot and gotten a lot i you know i like to do this sort of stuff um so about um you know keto khan the king kong was that's the first time i've ever been there um but it's really cool i've never been to any of these sorts of conventions before um but it was it was uh it was really interesting i think the the keto community is really starting to move uh more towards a carnivore uh your way of thinking which makes sense you know because it's you know people have already uh realized that there's certain things that we eat that cause a significant amount of harm and that it's best to avoid these things um it's the next logical step to realize that there's more than one bad thing you know everyone thought that cholesterol was bad so they stopped eating cholesterol uh but that was wrong um and they got onto keto where you know cholesterol or sorry carbohydrates and sugar were bad which it is and they are um and so um you know so um it uh uh you know but but we focus myopically sort of on one thing being bad um so obviously there are a lot of bad things out in the world so it's good to see uh people sort of coming to that that conclusion that you know even though you're keto and you've made a big big step in the right direction it's um you you can keep improving you can keep getting better better and better so uh that was really great and and just meeting everybody uh and and a lot of very interesting talks uh it was a shame it wasn't uh it wasn't uh recorded this year but um thank you yeah well you're welcome aaron thank you for for you know giving it a try that's amazing going from vegan to carnivore is a big step for people uh but i think that i don't think that it's it's too far-fetched for people uh that are vegan to you know go carnivore or anything else if the evidence shows that you know a lot of people are really just trying to uh do what's do what's what's right and do the best thing for their for their body and their health and they've been convinced that veganism is the way to go or at least plant-based is the way to go so you know if you're able to convince them to show them the evidence uh contrary to that um you know quite a lot of people are really interested in um and uh you know in in pursuing that and learning more about it so um you know that's always uh that's always good to see but yeah so uh you know i got to see a lot of really really cool people you know nutrition with judy judy cho was there um kevin stock was there and um you know sean baker was there uh bill schindler was there he's a he's a really interesting guy he's an archaeologist and professor of archaeology he uh actually you know to conor he was actually a um a visiting professor at uh uh university college of dublin for a year so he was he was up in um in dublin for for i think a couple years ago and um he was a very interesting guy you know he brought out like actual like stone tools and stone implements he was like making stone tools like in front of us like like that our ancestors would have made millions of years ago which is pretty badass and um and uh you said like oh yeah oh yeah so yeah and then the the talk on on ketocon like i put obviously put that up um sorry they didn't come up with the you know the the slides and everything uh that were up with that you know the projector behind me just didn't have those on they were on the side screens but i will be doing a new um talk well the same talk but uh just with the slides and so i'll be putting that up at some point as well i just have to sort of you know get to get the uh the time for that kenneth what's up buddy how you doing um currently reversing uh your rms and lost 45 pounds in five months yeah absolutely that's awesome man uh what very well done with that um so and that the question over from tick tock is uh what are we talking about we're talking about uh mostly diet and nutrition how that affects health and chronic disease specifically my talk at ketocon on why we're carnivores and also talking about my recent interview with professor thomas seyfried who's a professor at boston college and one of the world's foremost experts in cancer biology so that's what we're talking about today so people have questions about all that and how diet nutrition can help their health and specifically cancer uh feel free to ask and um all right let's see a couple more hey steve how you doing buddy all is well thank you hope all is well with you um converted a carnivore after 40 years vegetarian diet letting me a four-day hospital stay deficient in magnesium google best sources and beef popped up everywhere awesome very good well i'm glad that that that helped michelle creatine has gone up on carnivore that's okay uh just drink more water that's all right um that that's not a damage to your kidneys though kidneys do not get damaged by a carnivorous certainly not a carnivore diet but but even just a high protein diet uh you know that that has been shown in multiple studies to be the case that that higher protein diets actually help your kidneys they don't hurt them and i've i've seen people come off dialysis by going on a carnivore diet when all their doctors say you're going to kill yourself you're going to kill yourself and they just they just they actually go right the opposite direction and they just sort of say like well you know what your advice has been just making me more and more sick and my kidneys have gotten worse and worse and worse so you know what i'm going to try something different and wow look at that you try something different you get different results funny enough um oh well thank you crystal for reposting that so yeah i i really like that uh interview with with thomas seyfried um you know that guy is brilliant man like he's done so much work and being able to really just see through the uh you know the noise of the published literature and the and the dogma uh in medicine there's so much of that there's so much in medicine that you know since i started digging into the research and realizing that you know we were we just had so many things are so far off that you know i started digging into other things and realized that like wow we've got a lot of things that are way way far off and you know it's not necessarily malicious some of it was you know so it was it was purposeful with the you know vilifying cholesterol to save uh you know sugar sales uh that was [\u00a0__\u00a0] but um the uh you know the majority of these mistakes are just mistakes and you know they we don't have the best information so people make a guess and they just say hey you know uh that's that's the best we can do and then they don't realize that this is actually just a just a best guess and so you know then they just gets repeated and repeated and repeated until you know just people just accept it and it's in and it's in uh textbooks and you're referring to papers that have referred to papers that are referred to papers that refers to anecdotes and no one really realizes that that that's the origin of these things so you know you have to take everything in a medicine from with a grain of salt and you just have to say like okay what's the hard evidence do we have to support all this so i'm just going to find that saying it went carnivore after back surgery that's probably a very good time to do that um love the podcast listening to every single one multiple times and i've shared with lots of friends and family well thank you very much i really appreciate that i'm glad you i'm glad you uh i found it helpful um great to see my podcast with me mafia oh well good thank you so much yeah i like that that episode that was uh i thought that was really well done i thought they had like very good questions and i thought it went um i had a good flow to it you know so some of these things you know you find yourself sort of you know repeating a lot of the same thing and that's because you know there's there's different audiences that maybe haven't heard uh your message and so you know the people interviewing you are interested in sort of hearing that that message and so it's nice to to when you do things like with the meet mafia or with kelly hogan or um uh you know like lily kane and and judy cho and and you know so many others where they you know they really ask very novel questions and uh and then get out a much more interesting uh dynamic conversation i thought that was that was a good one as well um i think it's a very straightforward carnivore information i provide is uh and yeah well thank you yeah i mean i think it is it is something that's very doable i think it's something that's very straightforward can be very straightforward if we make it complicated we'll be complicated we don't have to you know that that's some of the the beauty of of the carnivore diet um is that you know you can you know you can just uh it's like the easiest thing in the world you know exactly what you can eat you know exactly what you can't eat right it's very clear so there's no some ambiguity oh is this okay is that okay it says meat water that's it you know pretty simple no plants no sugar nothing artificial that goes for sauces seasonings and drinks as well right and then just go on from there and um you know you don't have to worry about portion sizes you don't have to count calories you don't have to count macros you don't do any of that because your body will do it for you with your taste it will not it will stop tasting good when your body doesn't want it and so you know that's that's how it works nature is natural it just happens you know you're not gonna you're not gonna have a calculator in the wild you're not gonna you know buffalo isn't you know calc you know just doing long division to figure out you know how much you know protein he's getting uh it doesn't care it just eats grass until it doesn't it doesn't want to anymore and then you can just eat any time of the day or night it doesn't matter it only matters uh if you're if you're eating carbohydrates because that can screw up your hormonal system uh you spike your insulin with carbohydrates and that um you know and that in turn blocks the the action of growth hormone so growth hormone is very important to health and longevity and youthfulness and it is you know the highest dose of secretion is two hours after you go to sleep and so if you eat a big you know pasta meal before you go to bed uh your insulin is going to be up and your your growth hormone is going to be you know screwed um so the the interview with with uh professor c freed if people haven't seen it uh that was really interesting so it talks about the metabolic theory of cancer um and you know we have sort of two competing theories the original one uh was you know the genetic theory of cancer and that was you know just that you get these these hallmark mutations and that these you get these specific mutations in specific genes and that makes specific problems with proteins and that that continually you know perpetuates more mutations and then eventually you get you know a metastatic cancer but the problem with that is that you don't always have uh you know the same genetics in every single cell in a cancer tumor in a tumor okay so why is that why are they acting like cancer when they don't have the same genetics you know when they don't have the same cancer genetics okay because as he argues this is an epi epiphenomenon you have damage to the mitochondria through metabolic issues and they can't uh you know oxidize you know create atp through oxidative phosphorylation um properly and so then they they have to go through a fermentation process and this is how they they generate atp this causes a lot of free radicals and um and you know free radicals and reactive oxygen species they kick off to uh you know create genetic damage and that actually precipitates the the mutations but if you take the nucleus and the dna from a cancer cell that has all the genetic changes and you put that into a healthy cell with healthy mitochondria it doesn't behave as cancer but if you take the mitochondria out the damaged mitochondria out from the cancer and you put those into a healthy cell with healthy normal dna it does behave as cancer so what's going on there it's a mitochondria that actually uh suppress dysregulation and uh you know uh dysregulated growth which is which is what cancer is just it's just growth out of control and they can you know spread around your body and then just grows out of control and then that's a problem you know it just gets into other other tissue and it starts growing and growing and growing and those those organs uh fail you know and so it's uh it's actually a very bad thing otto warburg in uh the 19 or 1930 won the nobel prize for um showing this actually that that this cancer was a metabolic disease that it was mitochondrial disease and that cancer cells taken about 400 times the amount of glucose as other cells and so and so when you go on to a ketogenic diet or you go into our natural diet of carnivore diet you're limiting the the food source that these cancer cells have and so you're you're dropping your metabo your glucose level your um uh your blood sugar level down to normal levels and so you're not having these big spikes of of blood sugar and insulin and so you know that that's curtailing severely the amount of energy that these cancer cells can take in but also uh it's been shown in studies that a ketogenic diet actually really helps your mitochondria so it makes them work better it makes them uh respirate better and it gives you more of them so this is beneficial all right so this is actually preventative in cancer as well you know the cancer has actually tripled in the last 40 years since we started massively increasing the amount of plant food and carbs and sugar that we've been eating okay so what's that about you know that's that's not genetic our genetics are not changing you know we were getting you know less exposure to sunlight we've we're smoking less we're um you know often drinking less depending on the country and the area and so you know we're having less and less exposures and yet we're getting more and more cancers so you know that doesn't really track so cancer as a metabolic disease makes a lot more sense and you know just the simple fact that you can take you know these damaged dna and put it into a normal uh or into a normal cell with normal mitochondria and it doesn't act like cancer but the mitochondria putting damaged mitochondria into a normal cell with normal dna that does that tells you something that tells you it's the mitochondria doing the problem okay uh there's a question i even do i take any nicotine no i do not take any any nicotine or anything like that i don't take anything from plants whatsoever i don't take any and any you know drugs or alcohol really uh you know i mean once every year or two i might i might drink or something like that but you know i feel so much better uh without it and i can actually tell in my workout my energy levels it takes about three weeks to get all that crap out of your system when you're when you drink alcohol so you know if it's gonna it's gotta be something that's really worth it to me to lose three weeks of optimal health you know it's got to be very very rewarding it's not just the hangover the next day or maybe even two days and being run down for for a few days it like it really affects you and you know maybe people aren't working at the level that i am and working out as hard as i am but it's um you know that's you know that is something that i've noticed so that's not worth it to me i'd rather feel like a superhero 24 7 than feel drunk sometimes you know strong series hey thank you so much i really appreciate that as a question hey doc carnival uh carnivore joe here been carnivore for six seven months now and lost 125 pounds that's awesome absolutely fantastic um wish i knew about this way of eating back before we lost my grandfather to brain cancer and my father seven months later so oh i'm so sorry that that that is absolutely tragic i'm really sorry to hear that um you know it's know it is really tough and and i i you know i see this in the hospital now um when i see people suffering from cancer and even my patients with with brain tumors it's it's hard for me not to bring this up i mean i don't want i don't like shoving this down people's throats and i don't like um you know bringing it up when people you know don't necessarily want to hear it um and that you know it's not the hospital policy and so i can't exactly go around to say oh by the way but i do feel that it's it's unethical to not talk about it and tell people about it uh when they're in these situations i just you know i just don't think i just i just can't not do that because you know it does help you know i've seen it help i've seen it help personally i you know and and the studies are all very very clear that when you go into a ketogenic diet when you go into especially a carnivore diet well there's no studies with carnivore diet but just a ketogenic diet um like professor seaford has shown this really helps this really helps fight cancer it starves them out and it helps your body work better to fighting these things off and you know some of the traditional treatments that we have you know really harm our bodies and uh you know he was actually showing that you know glutamine is another thing that that cancer cells feed on so this is why you want to take dawn um which is a a medication that sort of limits the glutamine action in your body and and this can help this can help fight cancer this can help your body fight cancer it'll help starve them out along with the ketogenic diet you know so you know when you're i lost my train of thought but it um you know it is something that that can really help people uh you know going on a ketogenic diet and or even going on a carnivore diet and there's like just studies to show that you know that this this really helps people and this really helps you know fight these things back like i say in the conversation you know i have a friend of mine who is nearly six years deep with a gbm which is like just the most aggressive form of brain cancer like it doesn't really get more aggressive than that like people have a from time of diagnosis the average life expectancy is three months okay so this is big time problem and um you know that's without treatment and so with treatment with surgery with chemo with radiation you know it's like you know 18 months but a seafood show that was was lost track of uh what seafood showed is that actually when you're doing radiation on these things it actually pumps up the amount of glutamine that's that's in the area so you're actually feeding the cancer cells now you're hurting it you're harming it with the radiation but you're also sort of you know giving it a leg back up you know by uh by by dumping out all this glutamine now maybe it's very going to be very helpful if you are taking these glutamine inhibitors but they're not allowing us to use these things they're not they're not approving these for human use it's just [\u00a0__\u00a0] you know because these have already been used for human i don't know why i don't i don't understand the idea there on why you would limit this or if they say oh it's too dangerous it was like do you know dude too dangerous as compared to chemo you know like that's what kills people you know so uh yeah i i really hope that this gets out more and and i will you know continue talking to people and telling them about it personally and just and giving them information showing the studies and and letting them make their own decision um sandra jensen thank you so much that i really appreciate that um uh says uh thank you so much for your work i learned a lot since march 99 carnivore i only smoked tobacco still well it's a lot better than other people um is it now does it know what smoking depletes from the body that i can supplement until i stop it um well i mean the the biggest thing is not that that smoking just you know is depleting certain nutrients i mean i'm sure it is i i don't know exactly what what they would be but but the problem is they just they're they have toxins you know and these things are making you know doing toxic things to your body and so you know that's harmful i mean nicotine itself causes direct damage to your art or arterial wall so even even like nicotine patch or nicotine gum that will cause damage to your arterial walls which uh you know that's part of the process of developing heart disease and peripheral vascular disease um you know so that's um that's uh uh you know you know really important now if you're if you're only eating carnivore and you're not damaging your uh cholesterol and you're not in involved in this big you know inflammatory process that's going to be less of an issue however you're still damaging your arterial walls you're still causing problems and you're still sort of setting yourself up uh for for problems and damage there also you know the tobacco how they how they you know flu cure it now uh i mean there's like formaldehyde and arsenic and all these different things in there like it's there's a lot of bad stuff in there um so it would be it would be good if you could quit that uh nicotine is obviously it's addictive but like any other addiction you can you can get unaddicted and it usually takes about two weeks two weeks to get off off the nickel team so there is a light at the end of the tunnel if you you know you stopped all the plants and everything like that you know you can do the same thing with nicotine you know sugar getting rid of sugar and getting off the sugar addiction that's that's harder than getting off nicotine getting off coffee caffeine that can be harder than getting off smoking it's just people enjoy smoking you know they like it you know and so like it's you just have to make that decision like i like feeling the way i do a lot more than i like the sensation of smoking or drinking i just do um so that's the that's the main thing so if you if you just go cold turkey just drop it two weeks later you won't have any nicotine addiction after that would just be happening you'll just remember i like doing this and i do this on these certain times but you know habits can change too and after two weeks you'll be well on your way so uh very well done um you know 99 carnivore like that's awesome you know you're doing your body a world of good um you know getting that just that last thing off i think you know i mean obviously you you know that that will help your health uh tremendously but i don't know if you know you how just how much it will help you because like it will make a massive massive difference so give it a shot you know maybe just like go a month and see how you feel you know you can always start smoking again you know but like i would i would hope that you didn't so so give that a shot um okay so it says uh any recommendations specifically for stage four colorectal yeah i mean yeah 100 uh you go strict carnivore just just meat and water the idea that red meat causes heart or causes um uh bowel disease is just flat out wrong it is just flat out wrong uh it does not and you know that wasn't there was one epidemiological study that you know they cherry cherry-picked pieces of data they were flawed and biased in a new a number of ways and there was only a barely a tiny little correlation uh increase uh which is just not significant and so you know it's um you know there have been other uh studies done that show there's actually no correlation between red meat or meat in intake and colorectal cancer or any cancer for that matter so i would just eat pure beef and water grass-fed beef and water like i mean it's it's you know grain finished beef is is is almost as good and it's better than everything else but you know if you're dealing with some serious illnesses like like uh you know cancer like i just i just go for the gold just get just get the best uh that you can and that would be a grass finish beef but you have to make sure it's grass finish beef the fat should be yellow if it's not yellow it's probably not grass finished okay um so processed meats actually don't cause bowel disease either um you know obviously when you're processing it depends on what you process it with um you know things can be processed with sugar and plants and things like that and those can cause harm but um no the the the the risk is is again from these um from these epidemiological studies that were you know biased flawed and didn't show really that much of a of increased risk um you know so and and other studies have shown that actually you know they're not that's that's not the case so even processed meats as long as it's not processed with a bunch of plants and sugar are actually okay you know uh senator johnson thanks okay good i'm glad that's clear and uh and thank you um so yeah i mean that's that's sort of the the crux of it you know is uh the the biggest you know the biggest thing is that you know if you don't eat uh what our bodies are not designed to eat if you're eating an appropriate biologically appropriate diet uh then your body's gonna be working better you know humans are carnivores that's just that's just the kind of animal that we are i did a whole talk about that at ketocon i have that up on my youtube channel that people can can watch um those are the facts you know and so you know when you're dealing with something like cancer you know you know as i argue like these things are not diseases per se these are toxicities and malnutrition where we're getting a toxic buildup of species inappropriate diet and a lack of species-specific nutrition so namely too many plants not enough meat okay and and this is causing harm and we see this this manifest as diabetes heart disease cancer autoimmune disorders alzheimer's parkinson's even neurodevelopmental delay such as autism all these things were very very rare uh before the 1980s certainly uh before the 1900s and uh now they're the the only things we treat really you know they're like 85 of what we treat in medicine and um you know that's that's very new you know so you know and all these things increase at the exact same time you know people say oh well you know we probably just didn't notice them it's like okay we didn't notice them in the 1970s but we have brilliant brilliant you know nobel prize winning uh you know doctors and researchers i mean they're just too stupid you know to figure out what's in front of them i mean these diseases are devastating you know they they are bad you know if you've never i mean you know that that's that's coming from someone who has never met a kid with autism never had a family member suffer from cancer you know never had a had a parent or a grandparent uh die of alzheimer's you know so that that's that's that's um you know not uh not really uh uh possible that we just we just wouldn't have noticed these things in these vast vast numbers these are these are devastating illnesses um is that where i'm posting my yeah so i i post my interviews on on youtube so my youtube channel is just anthony chaffeemd and um so my interview with thomas c fried s-e-y-f-r-i-e-d is the most recent uh video i put up there i highly encourage i think that's probably the most important um video i've done just just ever you know so um i think that everybody uh i hope that everyone will watch that because i mean this is i mean cancer is just it's just so devastating and i i think everybody has had at least one family member someone they know that has uh had to deal with this you know i had a very good friend of mine that i played rugby with who had you know sarcoma of uh in in his face uh is in his sinuses and he was on these different medications that were just so harmful to his body that he just didn't didn't want to deal with it and you know one of them were just destroying his nerves and they were just making him crippled and um and he just said look you know i don't want to survive cancer to just be an invalid you know why they're going to do this and get through this with um you know with you know with my ability to have a more or less normal life or just you know i'm i'm out and unfortunately he didn't make it um you know so this is this is something that is very important uh to me and to i think obviously everyone i don't think there's anybody who who would disagree that this is a horrible thing to go through and so you know just just making very simple changes uh you know it can can save your life and can prevent you from having this problem in the first place you know i i think that's just the most important thing for people to know about um you know and and you don't have to just kill yourself with chemo and radiation i mean that can help you know i'm not saying don't get those things i'm saying do this too and you know because chemo radiation have absolutely been shown to to prolong life but you know they damage you severely and you know there are people that are that are getting rid of these problems with just diet um i am not telling you to do that i'm just telling you to add diet into it and think about what you are doing and make your own decisions because this is your body this is your disease and you pay the consequences all right is a really bad idea to let someone who pays no consequences and no price for being wrong to make the decisions okay you're going to pay the price you're going to face the consequences you need to be the one making the decisions okay so um yeah so check out that in that interview um hiatus hernia and remedies for reflux especially at night uh again diet i mean that that's that's that's one that's that's very very clear uh in evidence you you get rid of these uh you know different elements and plants uh that that cause a disruption in your gut lining and overproduction of acids and uh and you'll actually be better i've you know i've seen so many people get their reflux better now hiatus hernia that's a that's a physical anomaly that's not gonna i don't well yeah it it if it does get fixed just by diet that would be news to me but that's that's a congenital issue that's a you know that's that's you know been with you uh since birth really and so that's probably not going to fix uh regardless of your diet but you know if you're you know developing it's probably going to not develop that way if you know your mom is eating the right stuff and just eating meat and you're eating that when you're growing up but now that you have it you know you're a bit more predisposed to reflux than other people just because of the anatomical variants so it's probably even more important for you to not eat these things that are going to trigger that and those are all plants you know meat does not do this to you um sorry guys i'm trying to get through uh through the questions but they they do sort of uh you know go by so um you don't have to uh you know uh put in a tip or anything like that but it does help me see it but you know feel free to just ask questions i try to get get to everything um basically carnivore since 1998 75 years old use super low exercise method and everything tag plus yeah awesome you know that that's the thing you know this is this is good for any age any person any gender anything you know like this this is this is the proper human diet as um as dr barry says you know this this is how humans are supposed to live you know this is the you know there is some diet that we've evolved to have or we're created to have whatever where we are biologically um you know adapted to eat a specific diet okay it is something i argue that it's a carnivore diet but it is something you you know there are no examples in nature of two members of the same species who have different optimal diets you know maybe some people you know can be less damaged have more defenses towards some of these plant poisons and plant toxins but that doesn't mean it's optimal for them that doesn't mean that it's the best thing that they can have so there is an optimal diet okay it is something all right so i think all the best evidence shows that that's a carnivore diet and so regardless of your age regardless of your issue and your disease that is the best thing for you to eat and it will change your life dramatically um so how long do i think that salted steaks on the rack in a fridge uh can last for they tend to go very dark yeah you know they can just go forever as long as they're not touching each other and getting points of moisture then uh they can just go you know they can just they can just last really really indefinitely they'll just dry out and then they'll get more dry than you want to cook a steak um but they'll just turn into beef jerky basically just don't do like a brick of biltong or something like that which is like it's fine with me it's just expensive to do that with ribeye you know but uh it won't go bad if you've salted and it's not touching so if it's on a drying rack and it's sort of touching yeah it can it can sort of spoil or where it's touching there less so with the salt but it can still do that um so you want it you need you need to dry out so you need that surface to dry and everything like that and um and so yeah and it won't go bad it'll just it'll just dry out you know oh sorry um [Music] am i aware of any studies on the effects of the carnivore diet on the microbiome that's a good question i mean there have been um there have been some that showed that you know that there's so many different kinds of of uh you know microbiota that people talk about and you know some of the ones that you know that that people like is um uh they do find that they actually have quite a lot of these when people are on a carnivore diet uh people like you know dr ken berry have you know checked their own and the people around them and they find that people on a carnivore diet have a very very diverse very healthy uh microbiome um i don't i don't know of any that's like specifically looked at large numbers of people on carnivore but um you know either way like whatever you're eating or sorry whatever uh your microbiome is if you're on carnivore like that's what it's supposed to be it's just plain and simple your microbiome changes every couple days depending on what you eat because it eats what you eat and it eats the leftovers right so your body's going to have a different microbiome you know every couple days if you're eating different things and it's going to be very very consistent with with a carnivore diet if you're just eating the same thing but it's very healthy anyway uh corn for two months reduced aches and pains blood sugar blood pressure went down clothing fitting better but gaining weight how long until weight loss happens on carnivore so i mean that's the thing your your clothes are fitting better which means you are losing fat right but you're clearly also gaining muscle muscle weighs more than fat okay so that is um you know that is the uh you know that that that that can offset your gains on the scale so try not to focus as much on the scale just focus on your health focus how you're feeling focus how you look focus how you you know how how your clothes are fitting your clothes are feeling better awesome that means you're that means you're losing fat um you'll hit a point at some point where you sort of stabilize with the muscle you you're gaining uh depending on how much you're working out i mean you could just continue to to bulk up um and then if you sort of get steady with your your muscle growth um and your fat is burning then you you'll start losing weight uh but really what we're what we're worried about here is is fat loss right we're worried about changing our body habitus and and um and our body composition and that you know it from what you're saying is is happening you know so just just focus on that and just be happy with that and uh don't don't get hung up too much on just like the what it says on the scale uh steve henderson thank you so much that was very very kind of you thank you steve i'm sorry i'm just going to go backwards no i don't take any supplements at all if you have to take supplements then by definition your diet is deficient and so if you're eating your biologically appropriate diet which carnivore is then you don't need to take supplements and or anything like that and this is why you know i don't think that people need to take uh liver supplements or any other supplements whatsoever now if you're you know off somewhere and you're in the the the far latitudes um you're not getting enough sunshine you know maybe you might need to take some vitamin d3 but generally you don't on a carnivore diet if you're getting enough fat because there is vitamin d in the fat as well so you generally don't need to take even that where can we watch uh the interview uh the interview with with professor siefried is on my youtube channel uh which is anthony chaffeemd uh chaffey is spelled c h a double f as in frank double e um and that's just my my channel and uh that's the most recent um interview on there it's uh you know called the i think it's called the hard facts about cancer and diet um dad diagnosed with cancer in january i'm diagnosed in march jesus christ i'm so sorry um [Music] you know i mean there is such a thing as a point of no return um but you know i i think it's still worth a shot you know at least getting on a keto diet if not a full carnivore diet and just more meat and fat and just no plant no no no carbs and no sugar these things feed cancer they just do and you know it you know it may not be enough at this point but it's obviously worth a shot okay so hopefully that hopefully they can maybe you can show them that video uh with professor c free to myself and then maybe get them to to give it a try hopefully hopefully it helps uh what i recommend for cml um that i would i would still recommend a carnivore diet any sort of cancer diet any sort of cancer i would anyone anything i would recommend at least keto if not full carnivore uh for cancer specifically you know you need to limit the amount of sugar that's going into your body because this feeds your cancer cells just you know it gets a little more complicated than that but that that is where that's what it boils down to uh you eat carbs and sugar you will you'll be feeding the cancer so uh try not to do that and then just go high-fat carnivore that is absolutely the best way to go um i'm gonna do for a son has a learning disability um and got bullied in school because of that yeah that's tough man it's um it depends on learning disability uh but you know especially when when when kids are young it's the most important time to go on carnivore diet a high fat carnivore carnivore diet because that's what your brain is made out of okay so if if you want to develop to your genetic potential you need fat you need cholesterol okay and they and so your son is going to need this more than anyone else and specifically you want to get rid of these things that can you know offset and damage the development of their brain um you know even autism that's that's been shown there's certain kinds of autism there's different causes of autism autism is a mis development formation of the neurons in the brain so they don't work properly and there can be reasons for that there can be reasons either you don't have enough nutrients and they don't develop properly or you have toxins that are hurting them there are a lot of people that are finding that their kids with autism are doing so much better on a ketogenic diet there's plenty of studies showing this as a treatment modality um just getting rid of carbs and sugar there was a lady came up to me who i've spoken to many times on uh instagram and and online um who came to ketokon and she was telling me that her her son was a non-verbal autistic only when he eats carbohydrates and he's very different when he doesn't eat any carbohydrates and that's not even full carnivore but just not eating carbohydrates and there's a study out of university of texas a m showing that if you don't get enough carnitine your brain won't develop properly and you'll get a specific kind of autism so i don't know what the cause of your son's issue is but either way eliminating out things are going to harm his brain will help his brain and giving his brain all the things that it needs to develop properly will help him develop properly so i can't say uh more than that but i can say that he will develop to his genetic potential from here if you get them on a high-fat carnivore diet vitamin c you need vitamin c measured in nanograms if you're not eating carbohydrates you need in milligrams if you're eating carbohydrates okay so this is a big difference so you need a very different constellation of nutrients and and and vitamins and minerals based on what you're eating okay so if you're only eating carb diet you get everything you need in the proportion that you need it okay uh uh rastafarian oh thank you very much appreciate it um as a question hi anthony my father has had severe pancreatitis due to a diabetic drug interaction could you do carnivore uh yeah you could definitely do carnivore and uh i think it would absolutely help him it may you know you're getting damaged from from these these uh uh medications unfortunately um that uh you know sometimes there there is such thing as damage done but it can it can help his body heal and you know either way it's going to optimize his health otherwise and so you know he's already got this problem he doesn't need all the other problems that that eating plant poisons bring to the table so i would absolutely encourage him uh to go carnivore you know you know young healthy adults uh you can get away with more you know and that's what people say like oh when i was a teenager i could eat whatever i want and you know 20s whatever just drinking smoking and just do eating pizza all the time and then by the time i hit 30 i was like oh i just can't do it anymore yeah because you run out of reserves you just damaged yourself so much that your body just just started quitting on you so you know when you're when you're you know you can get away with it for a certain extent but i mean you'll just you won't be you know as as awesome as you would be otherwise but you can get away with it when you're sick when you have damage done when you're a child developing like you really have much less wiggle room you really really can't do that you know you really do need to be tight on this and it makes a massive difference so i would absolutely say um for your dad that that uh you know getting on a carnival diet would be exactly what he needs to do your body is going to break down and absorb meat when you're only eating meat far easier than anything else okay and so when you eat plants you have like protease inhibitors you have all these different sorts of things that disrupt the enzymes that come from your pancreas and make it difficult for you to absorb things properly so it's more important for him to be on that because he has damaged pancreas okay um so i was just trying to see a question here um start with a new fridge in the hotel facilities to cook for five days and get away with storing meat in a cooler box for a couple days but yeah uh yeah you know it's like sometimes you just you're just sort of screwed with your logistics you know i you know when i was i was in an airbnb and like the stove didn't work um and so i just i just ate it raw like i just i just took sticks and just like salted it and left it out for a couple hours let the salt soak in and then just just cut it up into chunks and ate it so that you know that was my solution to that but yeah um okay do you think um oh sorry i'm just trying to kill this where do you send uh parents of pediatric patients for ketogenic diet information and support i usually um it depends it i don't deal with as much with pediatrics um but you know whenever i'm counseling anyone on this um it depends on in terms of what we're talking about like if we're talking about a specific issue you know there are studies that maybe address that certain issues so maybe you know we're talking about autism and i'll send them that thing from texas a m just say hey check this out um or uh or other studies that that have you know spoken about you know um ketogenic diet as a treatment modality for autism uh there are plenty of those i did i posted those in my uh video on youtube uh discussing autism and developmental issues and so they're in there so you can send that to them and then you know cancer obviously send them uh the different things showing that you know keto helps fight cancer and why um uh as well as like you know uh professor c freed's work as well so it depends on what what we're talking about but i try to send them you know specific sorts of things um uh just based on on what we're what we're talking about so i can't think of any any i don't know of any like specific resource that that sort of encompasses a lot of pediatric keto issues um so i just sort of send everything uh in a specific sort of one-to-one sort of issue one-on-one basis uh colossus thank you so much i really appreciate that uh can you talk a little bit about the kidneys and the research that paul saladino mentioned about lack of electrolyte retention inside the kidney from keto carnivore yeah so so you know all the studies show though all the actual studies show that uh you know higher protein is very good for your kidneys this is this doesn't harm your kidneys um and so you know that is sort of slightly different from what paula saladino was was saying but this is something that comes up a lot is that people say well i don't want to eat so much protein except that's going to be bad for my kidneys it's not bad for your kidneys it is very very good for your kidneys and when people actually did the studies it was it was one of those things that was just a supposition they were like oh you know that makes sense you know if you're breaking down taking down um you know a nitrogen out of um out of a protein and um you know you have to turn that into ammonia that turns into urea and you've got to you know get that out through your kidneys um you know if you're if you're you know increasing that burden that's going to be hard on your kidneys fair enough assumption when you don't know and you're just you're making a guess the best guess but it wasn't born out by the by the data you know people then did studies you know decades later and they found that no actually that's that's not the case you know more protein actually helps your kidneys and so um you know that's just one of those well those examples of you know things that have just been repeated so many times they just think that's uh that's what it is and in fact it's not it's not based on anything more than just a best guess uh and as specifically uh to the research on that saladino mentioned about electrolyte retention so he was specifically talking about how you needed carbohydrates and this this how you regulated your electrolytes better and otherwise you get you know incen and sensible uh electrolyte loss through your urine and um am i in favor of the carnivore diet yes 100 i i only practice a carnivore diet sorry um and uh so so this makes you lose electrolytes and this makes you you you sap those out he also says that you need for proper thyroid function for uh proper um you know uh androgens like you know testosterone uh your your sexual binding globulin that all these things get screwed up if you're in ketosis for too long um or if you're you're not eating carbohydrates at a rampant level i think now he's talking about how you need to eat 200 grams of sugar a day or at least carbohydrates and when he gets that he gets that in the form of sugar that's um that's just not the case you know i mean there are plenty of examples of entire populations that have never eaten carbohydrates that never eaten sugar you know where's the fruit and honey in the north pole like people live there you know and they have generationally you know where was the fruit and honey when people were crossing the land bridge across the bering sea you know there's there's none you know it's like you know what people say that it's like oh well when the ice ages happen you know people weren't living in the ice they they migrated more down towards equator and like who told you that uh because that's not what the fossil record shows um you know bill schindler uh who i mentioned he's a professor of archaeology um he actually was talking about in in his talk at ketocon he was just like actually um as the ice ice sheets were coming down humans were moving up okay they weren't running away from the ice they were attacking into it because that's where the mammoths were you know that's what they liked eating so no you know like that's just not the case you know so you know you know he can he can trot out any study that he likes that doesn't change reality you know i mean that's the thing you can get a study that says anything you can get a study that concludes anything that doesn't mean it's true you know i mean there are plenty of studies that say that you know cholesterol causes heart disease and you or or at least is associated and and uh correlated with heart disease and there's a ton of others that say that no they don't you know so one of them's wrong okay so you you have to sort of look at these things and look at it from from first principles you know are we carnivores or not you know are we or aren't we you know if we are carnivores then carbohydrates are not essential and in fact that's been recognized uh you know by by you know international you know medical board i mean like you know as as you know i don't i don't hang my hat on that you know because obviously they've gotten a lot of things wrong such as cholesterol causing heart disease but you know even even these guys that are you know most of these things are pushing like plant-based uh agendas they're even saying oh actually there's no such thing as an essential carbohydrate and they're the entire populations that have never eaten carbohydrates they don't get these electrolyte issues i mean you get you get your electrolytes out of whack you die plain and simple you know there's no there's no there's no two ways about it you will die you know your potassium goes too high you're gonna you're gonna uh a rest your heart will stop you know it gets too low you're gonna go into uh atrial fibrillation and then you're gonna go into v-fib and you will die you know period that that's what will happen your sodium gets too high your brain gets screwy it goes too low it really gets screwy and then you know you die so this isn't this isn't like a little thing you know and so if you have these populations they're living generationally you'd know about it because they wouldn't exist so they do exist so we know that that's wrong and he also talks about how uh it's necessary for um thyroid okay and yet we have these people that are living generationally without any of this nonsense and their thyroids are fine um you know how i know they're fine because you cannot have a proper generations if you're if you're low thyroid first of all you'll die again you'll die thyroid is thyroid hormone is so important it's used in every single cell in your body and you don't have it you die okay they're not dead and uh also if you're even just borderline low uh thyroid uh for um you know while pregnant your kid will get cretinism cretanism is is a very devastating congenital uh uh debilitating um issue where your brain doesn't form properly your body doesn't form properly you have short stature you have the facial deformities uh very specific ones and uh and you're very significantly intellectually delayed okay that's what cretanism is and [Music] you know the the the inuits and other other people living in the north that are just eating carnivore they don't have cretinism you know all the people kelly hogan um and all the other people my f i've multiple friends that have done this have had you know carnival pregnancies whatever their kids don't have cretinism i'm sorry so that's not a thing you know and it and it doesn't matter what your study says it doesn't it's not borne out in reality as as richard feynman said that he was a very famous physicist he said it doesn't matter how brilliant your theory is and it doesn't matter how smart you are if it doesn't agree with experiment it's wrong okay so it's wrong you know he's saying that oh yeah look at this study and this means that and yet it doesn't it doesn't do that you know and the the sexual binding globulin he's saying that this is off he's saying that testosterone is off i see the exact opposite in practice i saw the exact opposite in myself i didn't check it before but when i checked it years after being carnivore many years longer than uh you know paul has been a carnivore i checked it i had none of these problems okay so i wasn't eating any carbohydrates what am i doing differently what am i doing differently than him i mean obviously we're doing something different but what we had in common at that time was we were both not eating carbohydrates okay so there was something else that he was doing that was different from me okay it's not the carbohydrates um i see people in practice all the time that within three months their testosterone goes up like 30 40 percent one guy doubled his testosterone due was in his 50s and all of a sudden his his testosterone was actually like above the normal range for like you know like a young healthy 20 year old and he's like oh my god i just feel like a teenager like all i want to do is just work out and like you know and that was like that's awesome you know but um you know so i'm seeing the exact opposite one of the things that that saladino does is he eats a buttload of organs out of proportion with the animal i mean how many organs how many livers does a does a cow have exactly you know it's got two pounds of liver to every you know 800 pounds of meat this guy's eating you know half a pound of liver a day how is that possible how is that possibly the right proportion of things i don't begrudge him this you know he's trying to do what's right right for him he's trying to figure this out and that's fine but i'm just saying like that doesn't line up you know and you're having health problems that i'm not having that the inuit are not having you know that a lot of people that do this long term and generationally are not having so obviously there's something else going on you know so i was a bit long-winded um [Music] yeah okay so so i have to skip through um [Music] how long to put psoriasis into remission online diet been out for 33 days and barely see any improvements 33 days man that's that's that's you know that's very new uh give it time you know these these your body takes time to heal uh psoriasis yeah i yeah i've seen that that uh you know helped significantly but you know things are individual if you're on a you know actual lion diet uh and just eating meat and just drinking water uh that'll be that'll be quicker than other people you really want to do uh you know high fat obviously the fat's very important um and just give it time 33 days is is uh is you know very very very early on um you know like for me it took i think i mean i didn't have you know psoriasis right but i you know just to get into basically where i am now sort of stable state where i am now it took about six months you know so you know that's that's all also super quick i mean think about this you know the people suffer with psoriasis their whole life you know and and weight problems their whole life and they you know people saying like oh if you can average like you know losing two pounds a month that's really good like you're out of your damn mind like that's like you know i lost 23 pounds in 10 days when i when i started a carnivore diet you know most of that was water weight obviously when you're you're not going to lose that much fat that quickly but i was losing a lot of fat too you know and and i kept losing fat and i kept gaining muscle and i kept getting better and you will too you know just stick with it focus on how you feel focus on your health focus on your energy and um you know the psoriasis will will come along with it uh i think it's best to listen to taste buds when it comes to liver totally agree you know your your body will tell you if if uh it wants those nutrients if meat doesn't taste good it means you're not hungry and if liver doesn't taste good it means that you don't need necessarily those nutrients raw liver definitely tastes a lot better than cooked liver that's just that's just something i found out which was very surprising to me and a little bit upsetting but it absolutely tastes a lot different but you know even then you'll have roll over i'm like wow that tastes really really good and i'll have a couple pieces i'm like yeah that's enough i don't need any more of that and there's some people you know if you're on a standard diet like you like i said earlier you will just need uh you know more nutrients more vitamins and minerals and that could be uh what's going on with with dr saladino and carnivore aurelius and these other guys because they're eating just butt loads of liver and organs you can get you know vitamin toxicity okay well like we said you know when you eat carbohydrates it increases your body's demand for certain vitamins and so it could be that this is offsetting things and then they were getting sick and they were getting unwell they were having problems and then they started eating carbohydrates and sort of offset that maybe probably would have done a lot of other things as well mechanistically um you know to to sort of you know change things around but that's a possible uh scenario um but you know i think that uh either way you know there's something different that that we're doing and you know i don't i don't think that that um you know you know paul's like a bad guy and i just hate him like i think that he's done so much good for people i think that he's you know uh you know really really knowledgeable and and and really been able to uh you know help bring this stuff to light which i'm very thankful for um and you know i personally i've never met the guy i've never spoken to the guy but like i feel it if any form like i like the guy because just because we're sort of in the same space we're trying to do the same thing for people and just try to bring them to optimal health i just disagree with him on this one and i would love to you know sort of talk to him sometime and you maybe you know come on his podcast or maybe come on on or him come on mine and just you know just talk about it and you know see if we can can flesh it out you know because i think that um you know i think he's he's you know uh trying to to do the same thing that i am which is you know figure out what the best thing is for people to eat and how to help them the most so you know i just think that that he got that one wrong you know um and i mean i think it's pretty clear that he got that one wrong though you know because like i'm doing this for 10 years i have none of the problems that that he's having and and so many other people have been doing this for 10 years 15 years keto people there may be people doing keto a lot longer they've been doing carnivore as a as a broad part of the population people have been in ketosis for like 20 years in western societies right obviously you know in in in primitive societies people in ketosis their entire damn life and now you know maybe if you're eating a lot of protein a higher big bolus of protein in one go you know that can transiently raise your blood sugar to the point that your insulin goes up a bit takes you out of ketosis and then you sort of come back in you know and maybe that's enough to to you know regulate your electrolytes and everything like that but either way like i don't worry too much about that i think that's getting in the weeds uh and missing the forest for the trees um because at the end of the day we are carnivores that's just the kind of animal we are you have to think big picture you have to think you know first principles we are carnivores and so if we are carnivores we should eat meat and whatever happens physiologically it's supposed to happen you know so i think it's interesting i really like it i really like knowing about it i really think it's cool to be able to talk about it uh you know at that level but at the end of the day i don't i don't care i really don't care you know it's like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what the mechanism is it just it just matters that i'm eating the way my body is supposed to eat and my body will just do its thing like i don't i don't try to micromanage you know my body i don't try to micromanage you know millions of years of evolution like i just i just i'll let it alone thank you i think it's i think it's done enough uh on its own i don't need to screw with it um thank you for your professional personal insight and support for your carnivore uh healed back and off walking stick etc never looking back at the gym now awesome that's badass you know that that's something that i you know i have seen but you know people get get such bad back pain and and you know even even like nerve pain shooting down their legs uh this is just horrible it's completely debilitating um you know so that's something that that causes huge harm in people's lives and even like fibromyalgia which is which is just a sort of a of a diagnosis of exclusion when doctors basically just throw up their hands and go look i have no idea what's going on but i believe you're in pain they call it fibromyalgia and then some some doctors actually don't believe fibromyalgia exists they think that it's something that either drug-seeking behavior or just sort of in their head and um and and they're just being uh a bit dramatic uh i've i've always thought that that was a bit absurd obviously there's some people that are gonna be drug seeking but there's a lot of people out there that are having serious pain issues like they can't all be lying you know i'm sorry you know it's just it's just not going to happen like that and you know i and i i know people that have uh you know chronic pain issues and it's like they they hate having to take these painkillers they really don't like it they would really rather just just be able to just exist normally and so you know they get uh on a carnivore diet and all of a sudden it's gone and they go like i've been able to get off opiates for the first time in 15 years i am so happy about this that's awesome to see you know and it's really really great to see like i don't like being in pain my back kills if i eat any carbs like just kills i'm like that's just no way to live so you know this is um great that that more people are getting onto that even from just from a from a chronic pain perspective as well um does carnivore mean uh only meat or does it include other proteins it doesn't include chicken or fish any meat any meat is fine so um you know carnivores just eating animals really so so any animal that you care to eat go for it uh red meat is just nutritionally superior uh by and large and uh you know fatty red meat is gonna be the best so beef will be your best bet but eat whatever the hell you want if you want chicken i would just go for fattier cuts like you know chicken thighs or drumsticks with the skin on and that's going to be better and obviously chickens that have been eating what they're supposed to be eating are going to be healthier than chickens are just being given a bunch of grains same with fish you know the the nutritional nutrition and fat uh components of like farm raised versus wild caught salmon night and day night and day so you know you need you need to be eating your natural diet just to get like the omega-3s that you need as well um and so you'll have a very different complement of of uh omega-3s omega-6s after about three months of feeding a cow just grains it will you know basically you know lose all the omega-3s that it has so it's um you know it's important it's it's um you know i i eat a lot of grain finished beef i don't i don't just go for grass grass fed and finish it's very expensive it's hard to get sometimes if i can get it i do but i'm not too fussed about it and i feel great so but that's just something to think about [Music] um converting your sister to carnivore she's crippled with paul manager well i think that you're doing her a great service because that she's going to be very much benefited by that and hopefully she she makes recovery and doesn't uh doesn't have to suffer with that um so white hat says i want to start carnivore but am trying to gain weight i'm afraid of weight loss i had initial weight loss two years ago due to ibs d of unknown origin but that is now resolved good how can i avoid uh weight loss or diarrhea um well weight loss you're i mean you're going to lose fat and you're going to lose some water weight at first so at first it's going to look like you're you're losing weight maybe you're you're skinny and you don't want to want to lose weight but you'll lose you're going to lose water weight you're going to lose unhealthy weight and good riddance you don't want that that on you but if you're if you're eating enough and you're eating as much as your body wants uh you know as evidenced by the fact that it you know tastes good and then stops tasting good then then you'll be you'll be fine then you you won't lose muscle you certainly won't lose muscle mass and you'll gain muscle you'll put on weight especially if you're working out so i would just say eat to satiation it's very easy to under eat on a carnivore diet your your your um your hunger signals change dramatically on a carnivore diet when you're not eating carbohydrates or even on a keto diet and so it's very easy to under eat so you just go by your taste so if a steak tastes good it means you're hungry you should you should keep eating eat until it stops tasting good which is just easy to do anyway because like wow this tastes good this tastes good this tastes good then you go like ugh i'm not really enjoying it just stop that's your body telling you you've had enough and so you won't you won't lose uh uh you know unnecessary weight you won't lose a you know a bad amount of weight or healthy weight if you're if you're eating enough and so you'll lose fat you'll lose water weight especially in the first couple weeks but you'll stack on muscle and you'll keep healthy weight if you're eating enough okay so just make sure you eat enough um especially for ibd ibs i mean this that stuff just goes away when you stop eating plants they just go away you know and they don't come back unless you start eating that crap again because like that stuff's poisoning you you know and so if you start eating poison again you're gonna get poisoned again i had cancer three years ago i cut out a lot of red meat so i should go red meat all the way yeah i would think so red meat is very very good for you it does not cause cancer it does not precipitate cancer it does not feed cancer carbohydrates you sugar does other things do there are there are hundreds of carcinogens in plants because they cause harm to your body and as professor seyfried said the a lot of these plant carcinogens go in the cell and they bung up your mitochondria okay so this is how they they precipitate cancer because they're screwing up your mitochondria which are the you know the the regulators of your cell and they they stop your body or your cells from going crazy uh so yeah i would absolutely go uh on the on the red meat diet i am on the red meat diet and um and then eliminating out all the other crap okay dr chaffee you should go uh for the presidency yeah yeah maybe um uh you are the best i'm so thankful to be able to listen to your knowledge and learn well thank you very much tony i really appreciate that i'm glad that that it can help you um yeah politics just bummed me out man like i just i've um i would sort of hate to get into politics but i think that you know back in the sort of the the the um back in the day when people said you said that this was their duty to their country to sort of be a civil servant and to to give back when it used to be when you when you act it actually cost you money to become a politician um because you weren't doing your business you weren't working you were just getting a salary that was not going to be as much as you would have made otherwise um that that was that was a good thing for people to do and to give back now it's you know it's very power hungry uh sort of profession where most people are you know that get into it get into it because they're incentivized by the power and the money they can make you know you have a lot of these people going in there on 140 000 a year and they're millionaires multi multi millionaires within a few years what the hell is that about well one of them is that you know their the insider trading laws uh are exact you know uh congress and senate are exempted from insider trading laws they exempt themselves from a lot of laws that that affect the rest of us and so you know they they take advantage of that fully and um it's just a bit of a snake pit really uh but also you know as as favorably as as uh you know i may be you know as soon as you step into that that arena like you know you will get painted as the worst human being who has ever walked the earth because you know they they want they if that benefits the opposition and so you know it's it's a bit it's a bit ridiculous i you know i think that at some point i might you know think about doing that just because i think that it's important too and i just you know a lot of things that they really bug the crap out of me and that and people are getting hurt by that i think i probably could help with and i would want to if i can um but it would be it would be a bit uh weird but you know i've you know i've spent my life dealing with people trying to take me down and trying to you know tear me down and attack me verbally and physically and so forth and you know i'm still here uh so i think i could probably uh weather it and maybe you know come out on top but uh it's just just just a gross thought you know honestly i i really wish that i would never have to but you know uh who knows who knows what will happen um your champion dr tafe so glad you're down under well thank you very much i really appreciate that i hope you stay a long time thank you catch you next video well thank you very much michelle i appreciate you uh watching and i appreciate you um saying that that's very nice of you uh best brand of eggs in australia struggling to find a non-grain fed uh corn or soy free yeah that's a tough one you really have to do sort of a lot of research i i don't know the answer to that um you know when you're when uh especially soy man just gosh this just avoid anything that's been fed soy this stuff is toxic um but uh you know if you find like you know free range things like that that uh you know that should be better it's it's it's hard it's hard to know though there's a lot of um there's a lot of obscurity in in sort of food industry and they do that on purpose you know because they're they're purposefully not telling you uh all the crap that they put in these things um this guy says that uh healthy people get cancer people eat good food good life still get cancer well it depends on what you define as as good food because what people have been defining as good food has been a lot of low fat fruits and vegetables and grains and that my friend is not good food that is that is just cancer on a plate plain simple and if you uh watch the video that i did with professor thomas seafred uh he'll show you that i mean this guy is this guy's a world expert in cancer biology and he shows if you know understand the biology of cancer you will understand how this works and it's very straightforward those foods are not good those foods cause cancer okay thoughts on sibo please uh yeah actually there was a there was a study that just came out uh showing on a carnivore diet that that uh sibo goes away when you go on a carnivore diet like within a couple months and that was specific to a carnivore diet which is pretty badass so you go on that you you uh remove all these things that are precipitating this you put your body back on the food that's supposed to be on and uh these problems go away so sibo's is a very very good one just because of that uh study that just came out and i've seen that uh personally and uh uh just anecdotally just with different people uh talking to online um let's see here uh spirit writer thank you very much i really appreciate that um question is do you think that the preservatives nitrates in bacon and processed meat uh compromise the microbiome um bacteria in the stomach and reduced nutrient energy absorption i i don't personally i haven't seen any evidence uh to suggest that that is the case one thing uh you know uh dr barry ken berry actually did a really good um video on this uh not not the for the microbiota but uh for uh nitrates and nitrites and he actually showed that first of all that like vegetables you know like celery have way more of this stuff than uh than stuff we'd add to it um and this is why you look at like naturally cured bacon it said you know celery uh you know celery powder is put in there well that's because oh there's no nitrates you know this is like yeah well celery powder has a ton of them so you know it's against these this this obscurity in in food labeling but your saliva has like hundreds and hundreds of times amount of nitrates that you would get in in a normal helping of bacon you know hundreds of times and so we're making this all the time we're swallowing our spit all the time and so if that was going to be causing a big problem it should be causing it anyway so um yeah you know this is another i think where the studies i just really didn't uh uh provide very good um [Music] good uh you know support for their their conclusion you know they just sort of went like oh yeah look you know we you give you give these animals you know like 50 000 times or 30 000 times the amount of nitrates that you would ever get in a in a a serving of bacon or whatever and oh look there's there's a problem there yeah well i bet there is you know if you if you uh drink 50 gallons of water in a day it'll it'll cause your your uh cells to die so you know and and and you'll you'll die so yeah too much of anything is going to be a problem you know but um you know that doesn't that doesn't mean that that a sort of a lower amount is actually harmful at all and again we make it in our saliva so you know it's a drop in the bucket when we sort of get this stuff in in preserved meats um [Music] see would i recommend a carnivore diet for someone who's diagnosed with with uh hodgkin's lymphoma absolutely 100 anyone that's suffering from cancer i think this is absolutely vital that they go on you know proper biologically appropriate diet that excludes carbohydrates and sugar and obviously alcohol and things like that um so bad for you i mean it's so bad for cancer you know these things feed cancer they just feed cancer you know carbohydrates and sugar feed cancer plain simple so you know it may not be that this this can cure it but it will absolutely help your body fight it off and it will it will help you know curtail the ramping growth and aggressive nature of these cancers because you simply will be you know simply won't have the same amount of energy that it has that that it wants so you know it's um it's a very very very very good uh way of helping your body fight off cancer so yes i would absolutely go with a carnivore diet on hodgkin's lymphoma or at the very very least a ketogenic diet but yes a carnivore diet is going to be better i say that i say that five percent the last five percent um from 95 to 100 carnivore uh are a big difference when it comes to results can i elaborate please yeah so you know like a little bit goes a long way you know so if you eat just a small amount of carbohydrates this is going to um this is going to raise your insulin which is going to box your your biochemistry right so it's going to change your metabolism from a fat burning metabolism to a fat storage metabolism it's going to do a lot of other things as well but just a little bit of carbohydrates will do that you know more carbohydrates will you know continue the process and will keep your insulin up longer but you you've already derailed your metabolic system you've already screwed your biochemistry okay so you're just sort of adding to it you know if you if you sprinkle a bit of sand into you know uh you know watch gears your watch is screwed you pour a lot more sand in there well it's still screwed but it was already screwed you know so you know you're you think about your body like that you our bodies are very robust they're very capable of dealing with a lot of you know uh outside external insults but at the same time it is also a finely tuned machine and you you will throw it out of whack uh with just a little bit of of uh you know sand in the gears you know i talked to a lot of people i mean even just getting rid of coffee just that last little bit they're like oh my god i feel so much better i can't believe how much of a difference that made it's like yeah you know because like you know when you get all this stuff out of your system like you just you just you just feel incredible you know and so you know when you just introduce just a little bit of this junk into your system uh it just screws with a lot of different processes and you feel it you will absolutely feel it so you know give it a try you know just just go just pure pure pure uh for 30 days and like honestly you will you will feel like a different person um i don't know that's something else sorry there's a lot of questions i'm trying to get to everything but it's sort of skipping through um i'm going to have to brush up on saladino enter this community via ken berry stick with ken berry um saladino um i just think he gets a few things wrong i think he that he he looks at um a lot of things at a very technical level at a very very you know minute detail and you know it's sort of a problem of sort of missing the forest for the trees and i think that's why he sort of got diverted down the path that he has of promoting uh you know sugar carbs and and uh honey you know and and he's saying oh look at this look at this study and look at this and this and this but okay but that that really doesn't change anything and um you know there are certain things and he talks about you know i i i don't know when he started talking about the plant toxins but it's a very important topic you know something that i've been it's a drum that i've been beating for five years and well 20 years really that's when i first learned about it but i've been speaking about it publicly for the last five years uh first time with dr baker on his original podcast one of them one of the first ones that he did and um you know talking about you know this is how the cell plants defend themselves you know this is this is the botanical uh fact you know and um uh but it's nice to see other people people picking that up so you know i i i think that solitude's got a lot of good stuff out there but um i think he just he just he misses a core concept on a couple of issues and so um just be careful with that just take it with a grain of salt and um and then look at other people's arguments as well um but yeah i know he does have he does have good stuff as well um but um sorry just reading a couple of these things um but also just getting back to that like but dr barry like the guy's fantastic like i absolutely love ken berry um you know he was he was doing paleo for a while in keto for a while uh and now he's he's gone full-on carnivore and really espouses that and and shows why you know so a lot of it he has tons of videos a lot of them talk about you know more of a keto approach and that's that's totally fine and it's uh you know it's evidence-based and um you know but it's evidence-based as compared to you know like a standard american diet and you know even he's come around he's saying hey you know carnivores even better now um and uh but yeah dr barry i'd you know keep keep going with dr barry i think uh i can't i can't say enough good things about him i think guys absolutely fantastic um let me see sorry um how about a setback will cheating result in depends on how much you cheat it depends on how often you cheat depends on what you cheat with if you're going to be you know eating carbohydrates and sugar then obviously that's going to uh you know just get you carb addicted again you're going to screw your metabolism uh for uh at least 24 hours with an insulin spike and you'll just feel kind of crappy and it's easier to get back into that rut and just keep eating carbs because you're going to eat carbs it's going to give you a bump and then you're going to feel like crap and um and then you're going to say like oh i need to eat more carbs and you're going to start eating carbs again so you know i would uh sort of avoid that you know especially sugar sugar is going to be addictive as heck and so you know you're going to have to be another sort of week or two dealing with cravings and addictions so you know like a cheat day fine it's better than eating it every day but you know a little bit turns into a lot with addictions and you know all you're doing is really just keeping yourself addicted you you know sunday is your cheat day you just eat a bunch of crap and then you're just thinking about all the rest of the week you feel like dirt for a few days or maybe more than a few days and you're also just thinking oh i really want to eat that that would taste so good you have these cravings um and then by the time your cravings are really sort of settling down you just you know restart the cycle again so like i think it's pretty counterproductive um and so that's best to be avoided but you know if you cheat and you fall off the wagon like you're not kicked out of the club like you know i don't hate you so you can just just get back on the wagon and just get going with it again you know you're not uh you're not it's not uh that that you can't just get back onto it just get back on and do it you messed up big deal you know you can see now you can see the contrast of how good you felt now you feel like crap and be like okay i'm not doing that [\u00a0__\u00a0] again you know so just just you know think about it that way um cadence no disrespectfully just can't wrap my head around vegetables being bad for us uh having known cancer survivors save their life on raw food lifestyle can please explain more in depth plant voice 100 that's that's a very good question and a very good point you know the thing is there is a difference between the standard american diet with a bunch of carbs and sugar and processed crap and a whole food whatever diet but you know what a whole food plant diet my which plants you know those 340 000 plants in the world most of them will kill you okay you go on the woods you lose you run out of water sorry run out of food you can't just eat any random plant most of them are very toxic so you know you know most plants are inedible you know you really do need to know which plants are safe to eat safe to eat as in they won't kill you right away and you can get some nutrition on it you can survive but that doesn't mean that they don't have any toxins at all so this is just how plants defend themselves you know plants and animals are in an evolutionary arms race you know plants becoming more and more poisonous so less and less animals can eat them so they can survive and thrive and animals becoming more and more adapted to specific poisons in specific plants so that they can eat that plant and safely process those poisons so that they can survive and thrive i learned that in seventh grade biology and i think that's not an uncommon thing to learn and then in cancer biology we learn this again but from a cancer perspective that these these harmful toxins can cause cancer and so you know and we know that they're abundant there's ten thousand well we know 1989 when we actually knew about far less uh toxins in these plants that at that time there were 10 000 times more plant toxins in you know plants like spinach and mushrooms by weight than the pesticides we were spraying on them and they were a thousand times more likely to cause cancer than the pesticides we were spraying on them so you can help yourself again you know i mean you can you can be on a ketogenic plant-based diet and cut out sugar and cut out carbs and really help yourself um when it comes to cancer but that doesn't mean that that's optimal that doesn't mean it's the best thing for you um but don't take my word for it you know you can go and take a look at botany books horticulture books you know this is just this this is hard science like there are toxins in plants and we know them we've categorized them and cataloged them like it's there you know you eat hemlock you know like that's what killed socrates right that will cause a blockage of your gaba receptors so your body your brain cannot slow down its neurons and you will die of seizures within two minutes you know that's what a plant toxin is it is it is trying to protect itself plants are living organisms they want to stay living organisms all living things down to single-celled organisms have a defense and while animals can run away or fight back plants can't and so one of their main deterrents is by being poisonous saying hey you know you eat me i will hurt you you better watch out for more of that i go into a lot of detail in a in a video that i uh you know just very plainly named plants are trying to kill you so just take a look at that on my uh youtube channel and um and and and for more and there's a lot more information there in the description as well i have links to other other things as well uh dan m thank you so much dan i appreciate it says that uh dr chafee how does ox bile work i don't have a gallbladder oxbow you know oxbile is just you know you're you're taking in you're taking in uh you know bile that that's derived from oxen and that that emulsifies the fat that you eat um and that helps your body absorb it you still will make bile without a gallbladder so you don't actually need to take uh ox bile you don't have to so you will you'll keep making your your liver will just steadily drip this stuff out and you will you know continue to um absorb fat that way the thing is is that obviously the gallbladder stores it for a while so you have like a lot of it in sometimes concentrated form so you can absorb a lot of fat at the same time so you just may have to split up your meals you know which is fine you know just you just recognize how you do that if you're not absorbing all the fat they will go out and it will make your stools very soft and maybe even give you diarrhea that doesn't mean you're sick it doesn't mean it's an infection it just means there's more a lot more fat than your body can absorb and so you just you know you just you're just going to excrete that um and so if that's if that's your case you can just you know eat a bit less and just sort of split up your meals throughout the day uh but you know some people do form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is sort of an out pouching on the common bile duct basically acts like a gallbladder so you can still again store bile and then excrete this stuff out uh when you eat a big meal so there are many people without gallbladders that can still eat you know once a day just some big big steak once a day so just see how you go uh you don't need to eat octopi though if you are if you are you know in the category of needing to um you know needing to split up your meals throughout the day you know that's fine maybe you're at like some big you know banquet or you know you go to like a you know you know buffet like a casino like lobster buffet or something like that um and uh you know then then maybe you want to take some ox bile just so you can absorb you know all that stuff you know maybe you want to do that but in general you wouldn't you don't need to do that uh kyle thank you very much kyle i really appreciate that uh mike awesome mike thank you so much uh really good to see you here thanks for joining um thanks for doing the live keep them coming well i hope to you know i think it's just sort of a sunday here and i just figured you know why not why not check it out i have to figure out um how to sort of get um you know all the different streaming things like uh i don't even know if if facebook does it but you know youtube and tick tock and um and uh instagram trying to get those uh get those uh going uh at the same time like on browsers in um you know on on a desktop right now i've got you i can only figure out how to do these stupid things on my phone so like instagram and tick tock i've got on on phones and then i'm on youtube on my computer so we'll see i'll figure it out i'm sure there's a way to do it that's right i think it was someone trying to go on a joint live thing with me on on tick tock but i just sort of missed it i don't know how that works actually but you know maybe we can you can try that out uh if they call back um yeah what about peripheral neuropathy well it depends on how far far gone you are i have seen this help uh with you know nerve issues and your body's healing from that but again there's the concept of damage done so it could be that you you can damage your nerves to the point that they don't come back but it's always worth a try and there's a bunch of you know there's a bunch of other reasons why this is beneficial and you can benefit greatly from that in other ways as well so it's always worth it kyle thank you so much i appreciate that um kyle says my sister says she gets reflux or feeling she can't swallow when eating meat any idea well what could cause uh what cost could be um well things are processed differently in your body depending on what you're eating if you're only eating meat your body processes these things very very differently than than other things graham thank you so much graham that's very very generous thank you um uh and so you know the thing is is that you know is she eating meat with other things as well is that me contributing to the problem and she can't swallow me that that more sounds like a conditioned response that she's just she's you know been told her whole life by everyone around her that she trusts that means bad for her and that it's going to cause cancer it's going to make her fat women and girls especially listen to that a lot more you know guys are usually more uh you know reckless and they say like screw that i'm just gonna do what i want um women tend to be much more sensible and uh and think about things and be like well if that's bad for me if that makes me fat then i don't i don't want to do that and uh unfortunately we've just been lied to and um so it's uh uh quite often people can get just you know just conditioned and be like me it's bad for me and so they just physically don't like the meat uh or the fat like i was doing this like i was still trimming fat five years ago you know and i eventually had to just go like what the hell am i doing you know i i trust the data i trust the research you know and i trust the evidence like that's good for me eat the damn fat and so i had to start to recondition myself it took a while though you know even though i knew conceptually that this stuff was really good for me i couldn't i just couldn't eat it you know it was just like oh my god that's bad for me and just that taste and that texture my entire life had been conditioned to say that's bad you know it's hard to undo but you can do it uh and so you know i just was like okay i'm gonna cut off a little bit of fat and put it on a leaner piece of meat and i'll eat that and that sort of tasted good and so i reconditioned myself and eventually you know felt great and and loved to taste me i can just eat chunks of fat now they taste awesome and um you know so i think that given time if she really understands the concept that like no actually this is really good for me and um and she uh accepts that and and stops eating all the other things that she's not going to get uh the same problems and she and she'll be okay uh reflux you just me just does not cause reflux and so um you know people that that get off all the different plants that they're eating you know they will find that their reflux goes away so it's probably a combination of both those things she might still be eating a mixed diet um and then just condition yourself to to not like it so that's generally what we see or generally what i've seen um a person asks uh what about people with kidney disease uh then you definitely want to be on a carnivore diet because carnivore diet will help heal your kidneys i have seen people come off of dialysis on a carnivore diet after about nine months that you know according to you know the the medical dogma should not happen however there are actual studies showing that a high protein diet is very beneficial to your kidneys so the idea that high kid high protein diet bait site is bad for your kidneys are going to box your kidneys is just wrong and it's not even it's not even uh supported by the medical literature there's nothing like there's like there's like actual studies saying they're like no no protein's really bad for your kidneys there are no studies actually showing the kid that protein is bad for your kidneys there was supposition and conjecture that protein high protein was bad for your kidney but that the studies actually showed the opposite so uh cornbread is the best thing you could do for your uh for your um oh shoot okay well i lost that one too so i think there's people who are asking to go go join live on um tick tock i've never done that before um and so well i was gonna i was gonna try to join it and see what the hell what they wanted to talk about but i missed it so maybe maybe someone could tell me what that's about and uh and how that works and uh maybe we can try that um colossus says my thyroid gets swollen when i don't eat carbs for more than four days i usually get goat yogurt with a little honey to fix it any ideas of how to push this through it gets really big can't turn head so that's interesting um you know you could it could just be as simple as uh uh you have a lack of iodine you know because that's the that's a major cause of goiters which is an enlargement of the thyroid um so you can try you know you know getting iodized salt or taking salt or iodine supplements and see and see how you go again you know when you eat carbohydrates you eat these different things it can it just just changes how your body dynamic works a little bit so obviously something is is working uh in that system to help you out but you know it could just be as simple as you're not getting enough iodine and you can you can try that try that at first anyway and and see how you go that would be my first first portal call um [Music] how about high how about eating high caloric intake shortening your telomeres resulting in shortened lifespan well if you're if you're eating an over abundance of them maybe but you know when you're eating carnivore diet you won't you know so you actually eat less you will eat less on a carnivore diet because you can actually listen to your hunger signals when you're eating carbohydrates and sugar it actually disrupts how your body processes energy and disrupts your your um uh your hunger signals so you will overeat and so yeah you know that that may be a thing i haven't looked at those studies specifically but just on first principles you're going to be benefited by going on a carnivore diet because you will be eating less thoughts on intermittent fasting um it's great if you're eating carbohydrates because you're waiting out the clock on the insulin insulin is going to disrupt a lot of things in your body and your body chemistry and um and it will screw you up so um intermittent fasting is just a way of of of of just waiting out the clock on insulin so you have a period of time during the day that you're not in in that in that uh hyperinsulinemic state and your body works properly and and was like wow you get all these benefits of it like yeah that that's the benefit of not i'm not eating carbohydrates really of not having high insulin so it uh is great if you're eating a mixed diet if you're eating a bunch of carbs but you don't need to do it if you're on a carnivore diet you will probably naturally eat like once or twice a day [Music] but you know because you're eating high density nutrition you don't need to eat as much or as often so that's fine but it's not that you're depriving yourself of energy and nutrition like i if i want to eat three times a day or sort of snack i can't get a big meal and just want to eat a little bit like i will it doesn't matter but yeah you don't need to do it if you're not um if you're not uh you know eating carbs and things like that um [Music] so kyle thank you very much kyle is tallow better than butter i can salt or can i salt too much i really like salt but recently heard someone say over salting good cause overeating and drinking well over salting sure but it doesn't sound like you're over salting because you're enjoying the taste of salt so if you salt to taste then by definition you're not over salting now you can you can force feed yourself any stuff that tastes really salty and gross and that can cause problems but otherwise no no you'll be fine so uh just salt to taste there are some people actually that you know just don't salt at all you know and um and they do fine they do really well um and they know long-term carnivores that don't salt at all and that's fine that's great i salt i don't use much salt but i just i use some salt i like it but you don't have to and i don't i don't particularly uh find too much problem with that as long as you're just salting to taste and yeah that should be fine tallow better than butter yeah probably you know so tallow is just you know the rendered fat uh from beef and if you're getting you know grass-fed uh beef tallow that's gonna have have you know tons and tons of nutrients um butter can have the you know the milk proteins that uh some people have a problem with can cause a bit of inflammation so tallow yes will be better than butter but you know grass-fed butter is still really good if you tolerate it some people don't so you know some people just just really can't handle any of the of the milk proteins and you can go for like grass-fed ghee at that point but yeah no tallow can't go wrong with with grass-fed tallow um how to get past the keto flu i've tried three times and cannot get past it even with electrolytes so the keto flu i don't think is is actually from going into ketosis at all i think that that's that that's completely wrong um because you know you go into ketosis in about 24 hours you know so everybody doing intermittent fasting will be in ketosis for a number of hours during the day before they they have their one big meal um and then people uh who are fasting you know they're in ketosis you know like that that's it you know so you know we don't have you know people during ramadan or lent where people are fasting uh they're not getting the keto flu really like that um so it's not it's not from going into ketosis but uh what i think it is is probably withdrawals like what you're withdrawing from sugar from carbohydrates you're getting these plant toxins out of your body and um and you may be caffeine and or even alcohol cigarettes whatever whatever you stop now you're gonna withdraw from that and you're gonna feel like crap like that that's that's what it is and so you know if you've been eating a lot of that stuff and you stopped it now you're just gonna withdraw but withdrawals end you know they end in you know in a week or so so you know maybe two at the most and then and then you're done so i would um i would just focus on that and just focus on the fact that you know this will end and you're doing the right thing for your body and uh you know just you know it'll it'll pass it'll pass maybe it takes a couple weeks but it will pass okay um so mike says sue and dr saladino is now saying keto is harmful totally lost his marbles need to rename his book the sugar the sugar for coat 100 percent you know i mean he's not even carnivore anymore he's not even meat based even anymore animal-based anymore uh because he's you know he's getting like 200 to 400 grams of uh sugar a day grams of sugar a day you know that's 800 to 1600 calories from just sugar i mean how are we we're not humming birds you know like that's not what we're supposed to be eating and getting the majority of our or our nutrition from that's just uh that's just wrong it's just wrong um hyperlock says for people that can't eat meat only what would be less harmful to eat vegetables or fruit depends on the vegetable obviously depends on the fruit most fruit will still kill you actually most fruits are still inedible think of all the berries you know don't eat the red berries those will kill you fruit sugary fruit i definitely wouldn't do vegetables probably some vegetables like the non-nightshade vegetables i think would be less harmful than fruit because you just don't want sugar sugar is just harmful so you don't want carbs don't want sugar so get a non-carbohydrate non-sugar non-nightshade vegetable um and uh and and try not to eat as much of it as you can because you know you're gonna eat you you can build these things up right so so your body can process toxins to a certain degree but if you're just eating the same toxin day after day after day it will just build up okay so if you're just eating just loads of spinach you know that's going to build up especially with like oxalates and things like that so if you if you mix it up and you start eating different things your body will process that better you know but i would definitely first and foremost just get rid of all sugar of in all forms and all carbs all of it okay then get rid of all night shades potatoes tomatoes eggplants peppers gone and then you know you can start working down the list and then if you're going to keep eating these vegetables vary them okay do not be eating the same vegetable every day you know and certainly not every meal and make and make fatty meat your your staple you know just just eat a lot of that if you want some of these other things you know fine but i would i would do it in that way um i've noticed that if i cheat and have a few carbs i get trouble with a regular heartbeat is that because of insulin what could be go from all sorts of different things you know depending on what you eat but you're basically just growing with your body chemistry and your body's not happy with it you know so you should listen to that you know your body's saying and cut it out so you cut it out um all right thoughts on the paleo diet please well the real paleo diet i love because the real paleo diet is a carnivore diet you know the commercially propagated paleo diet is is working in the right direction and the concept is right you know what we should be eating to our genetics as as paleolithic man a you know tens of thousands of years ago hundreds of thousands of years ago 100 on board with that the problem is is that you know where that what people are calling paleo is not you know paleolithic man was carnivore that's what all the hard evidence shows that's what all the data shows you know stable isotope studies um you know are very clear that that that you know homo sapiens neanderthals and other uh you know uh earlier humans they were hyper they were hyper cornflowers they exclusively ate meat they were for two million years two million years you know at least okay and they were heavily meat based before that as well and you know so we had a higher carnival rating than you know other large carnivores alive at the same time lions hyenas you know bears you know foxes wolves we had a higher carnival rating these guys because we were eating them too you know so um you know so paleo is great um because paleo is the carnivore but you know so what people call paleo is a bit different but i but but you know that's that's my thoughts on it um any specific diet for someone who just finished chemotherapy i gained a lot because of the steroids yeah i mean yeah so that's crazy too because you know you think about you think about um cancers cancers feed on glucose what do what do steroids do i mean and the steroids we're talking about here are not anabolic steroids they are um corticosteroids we give these to reduce inflammation uh in the body so things like uh you know cortisol analog like prednisone prednisolone dexamethasone these sorts of things um they uh really screw with your blood sugar and then they can spike people's blood sugar so you know that that's a bit counterproductive because you're you're now feeding this cancer not great um so yeah i would absolutely go with a carnivore diet especially because of the cancer issue because that's going to help your body fight off cancer and starve off the cancer and so that's that's definitely the way you want to go and and you'll lose weight too and you'll you'll organize your body's hormones and cortisol to uh to to drop that weight drop the water weight as well um so uh jimmy is six foot seven 295 pounds and plays football for the buckeyes badass good job we live four times a week and eat six times a day i fine with that as long as you're eating meat uh you will blow everyone out of the water if you just eat meat you just eat a buttload of meat um first of all you won't have to eat as often and you'll be able to work out a lot better because you won't just be just just you know bogged down with all the with all the food that's in your gut you your athletic performance will go through the roof so i i played professional rugby for 10 years before i went to medical school and i can tell you for a cold frozen fact that there is no better diet for an athlete than carnivore diet that's bar none so i i i played professionally for five years on carnivore diet and another five years off a carnivore diet because i just didn't sort of realize how significant uh what i was doing was when i was on a carnivore diet i have never been more athletic i have never been more dynamic i have never been able to work out harder i've never been as fit i could i could go forever i never got sore i never got tired i never ran out of energy i could just go go go go i'd work myself up to it but i was able to do that i was able to work myself up you will get so much more out of your workouts you will be able to work out a lot more and you'll get more out of the more that you do and you won't be sore you'll recover nearly immediately and you'll be able to do it all again you will absolutely kick the crap out of everyone around you with your performance if you uh if you go on a carnivore diet a high-fat carnivore diet and the trick is not eating all the other crap because that stuff will bring you down carbs will bring you down you do not need carbs to build muscle in fact they detract from building muscle they just put on fat they put on intramuscular fat and glycogen so your muscles look more bulky but they're not that's not lean muscle mass i have an episode with um with uh uh the catholic who's an all-american decathlete out of michigan state uh ryan uh talbot um he in his second decathlon ever he won the big ten championship in the decathlon because he went carnivore in january and he told me and i was i was helping him out with it and he was telling me he's just like i'm finally turning into the athlete that i you know i've always wanted to be you know thanks to carnivore diet and he goes out and blows out and gets a near olympic qualifying uh uh score for the decathlon in his second decathlon ever all right he's a sophomore man like so he's got he's got tons of time to to kick ass uh so watch that episode with ryan talbot it's one of my more recent ones and and you'll see yourself like this is the best thing you can do uh for your athletic career you go into this you'll storm through the the nfl and you'll just stomp over everyone and it'd be great to see you do it because you know you'll be leading by example and you'll be showing people that um you'll be showing people that um you'll be showing people that this is a very uh you know um not just viable but just you know a you know dominating uh way to eat uh for uh um you know anybody who's an athlete and just anybody in general so definitely definitely check that out and just just watch some of my videos and just see what you think man you know shoot me an email anthony chafee gmail.com it should be in my my show descriptions as well and these notes and just uh happy to help you out with it uh so am i saying that sugar feeds cancer yes i am uh that was something uh that um professor thomas seaford who's one of the top cancer researchers and cancer biologists in the world out of boston college in yale uh you know shows quite conclusively it has over 150 peer-reviewed studies and publications on the subject and and he shows that very clearly we've known this since the 1930s when the work of otto warburg who won the nobel prize in uh medicine in 1930 he showed that that that cancer takes in about 400 times the amount of glucose that other cells do and this is a problem of uh respiration on the mitochondria so if you aren't eating a bunch of carbohydrates your mitochondria work better they don't get damaged and you're not feeding these cancer cells in the first place so yeah that's very very important but yeah if you guys want to um watch that that's that's on my youtube channel just anthony chaffeemd and that's um thomas seyfried is the is the interview with that and so you know check that out uh milk and eggs um i i tend to avoid milk just because of the lactose but um you know eggs and butter absolutely is fine and jimmy says thank you do you eat a lot of steak that's awesome uh trick is not to eat all the other crap the other crab will you know bring you down but yeah you know keep it up with steak fatty steak fats really good for you if that does not make you fat it makes you lean strong and healthy and gives you muscle because you actually need cholesterol to build muscle okay cholesterol is also what your testosterone is made out of okay so you know eat it um hulu operator thank you so much uh who do appreciate it uh says that can you give your opinion on uh cannabinoids and are we being lied to about it as a medicine surely thc cbd or plant toxins yeah that would be sort of my thought on it um you know you know that's the thing with with medicine you know medicine is just a poison that gives more you know benefit than harm in certain circumstances so just like i'm not going to take you know antibiotics every day if i don't have an infection or even in antibiotics if i don't have the infection that is treated by that by that antibiotic you know i'm not going to take thc and cbd unless you know i have an issue that is specifically treated by those things now maybe there are things i'm sure there are you know but does that mean that we should be taking it all day every day probably not and they are going to have other side effects and toxins uh toxic effects uh that we don't want you know and so maybe the the good outweighs the bad in certain circumstances but you know if you're just living your normal life you know probably the bad's gonna weigh the good um what's going on here oh sorry sorry i'm trying to find i'm all new to this guy so just bear with me questions okay oh i think that's already been asked all right sorry about that i'm still trying to figure all this this uh stuff out and uh there's three different platforms so sorry about that um okay so um one question is i file issues after a massive coffee binge and still recovering after cutting it weeks ago i'm carnivore i'm wondering if i could help uh heal my gallbladder or liver somehow staying immediately yeah i mean your body will will uh will sort itself out you know um just i haven't really heard of you having bile issues after just you know drinking a blood load of coffee sorry that's why that happened um but yeah i know just give your body time you know i mean obviously the best thing you can do is just give your body what it needs and then avoid things that are going to harm it right so you know the the best thing you can do is is just eating meat um you know it's never going to be a good idea to eat poison it's never going to be a good idea to eat things that harm you and that's what plants are so you know i would just uh yeah just stick to meat and let your body do its thing um i need to interview the carnivore dentist again yeah kevin stock you know he was really good um yeah unfortunately i had to cut that that a little early because i was actually on call at the hospital and i was sort of like getting getting a lot of phone calls it was like six in the morning um but you know i was on call overnight and all of a sudden i was sort of getting a number of calls and i was like okay i can't really ignore these because it could be someone if they're if they're calling me at you know six in the morning that probably means that someone uh needs help and so i had to go they actually didn't it actually did it was a complete false alarm but like um but you know i had to check anyway because obviously i was i was working uh but yeah i uh kevin stock's awesome and i do plan on on linking up with him again and doing this and doing another one because i have i've added a ton of other questions for him anyway um all right guys i think we're coming up to the two hour mark so i think we're just gonna do sort of five to ten more minutes and then i've gotta go uh do some other things and make um make some calls and do some work but uh so maybe we could try to get some last uh last minute questions in as much as we can um and um where we go here um dr chafee do you think that salt will make me hold water even though i'm only eating meat yeah not really you know you'll pee it out you know you'll um you'll you know as long as you're drinking enough water and you're not over salting like you should be fine you know your body will sort of take care of that on its own um you know and uh you know if you if you want to sort of eat a bit less and see how it affects you you know that people are sometimes are affected there are some people that are a bit salt sensitive um it's rare but but they're but they are and so you know if you're in that category then that's something that's good to know about um so you can just sort of just trial that out you know maybe eat a little less salt maybe just go a week or so you know without any salt and just see how you feel it's very good to test things with your body uh yourself would you do two milli meals rather than one if you have lowered fats because of diarrhea [Music] diarrhea problem that listening to the secrete video i heard you say that i don't need to lose weight i do fast 72 hours weekends um yeah so if i i if i understand that question correctly you're saying would i would i do two meals rather than one if i'm if i'm having sort of loose stools yeah maybe you know i just you can also just just sort of reduce the amount of fat that you're having if you don't have a gallbladder then then you might need to split up your fatty meals throughout the day your fat intake throughout the day that's still going to be important you still need it but you can you'll need to sort of eat it in smaller portions throughout the day uh if you're not in that category and you're and you're getting this over overrun then um just eat it just eat a bit less fat you can just pull back on the fat um what to try on feeling when feeling low energy on straight carnivore generally that that a lot of people when they're having problems is usually because they don't have enough they're not getting enough uh fat in their diet um and so a lot of people will not eat enough they think they're they're eating enough fat because they're not because they're eating a lot more fat than they have ever in their life um but it may not be it may not be and so if you're getting um you know hard stools uh then you're definitely not eating enough fat but just just here you go it's usually it's usually a fat thing usually people that aren't getting a lot of energy there they're not getting enough fat so you can try increasing that also water hydration is very important people get quite lethargic when they don't get enough water so make sure you're eating enough that's the main one and make sure you're eating a fat and get make sure you're getting enough water as well uh statin drugs if he allows you when i took them yep you will because that that is uh not good for you it uh snaps your body vitamin co q10 which uh you know screws up your your uh um oxidative uh phosphorus phosphorylation so phosphorylation so it um is actually screwing with your body's ability to make atp and it will harm you plain simple and also cholesterol is uh super good for you so like every cell in your body is made out of it and uses it um so that's wrong that it's bad so um yeah so you really don't want to take something that's going to remove something beneficial from your body and it has side effects so you know medicine is just poison that does more good than harm in certain circumstances this is not one of those circumstances all right it's doing harm and it's also doing more harm so you know yeah you def i i'm not a fan of statins anyway um give us a flex i don't know about that but um uh dr shaffy do you think salt will make already read that one um my husband's cardi indocar um i know endocrinologist sorry told him that he would get diabetes if he didn't eat gluten oh what okay when he questioned her she said it's in the literature the hell it is okay tell her to show the damn literature then that's the thing you know you'll get people to show their damn work they say oh it's in the literature okay can i see that please you know and and if they get pissed off and get offended and they get like very defensive well you know they're full of it all right that's dumb you you could get duff but like what what about eating okay so she's saying that the lack of gluten causes diabetes insulin resistance and aberrant uh uh processing of glucose what the hell does glu you don't even absorb gluten you can't you don't it's indigestible it just causes leaky gut and screws with your bowels doesn't even go to your body you know unless it's like you know through leaky gut you know it's it's not it's not a usable protein by your body um that's that is just insane like get that literature because i would love to see that that is nonsense like whoever that lady is she should be fired immediately and have her license taken away that is just ridiculous that someone would say that you know and like maybe there's some just just idiot study out there that has some sort of weak correlation or something like that that's suggestive of whatever but there's absolutely nothing that shows causation between those two things nothing i bet every cent that i own and ever make in my life that that is not the case that is garbage absolute garbage tell her to show her work tell her that that is tell us like okay great let me see the study you know and then read the study and see if it actually is anywhere close to showing anything that that would that would uh you know you know support the conclusion that if you don't eat gluten you'll get diabetes that is just the dumbest thing i've ever heard in my life and i'm i'm shocked that anyone would have said that especially an endocrinologist like these are the people that treat diabetes like how the hell but then again you know people that treat diabetes are also telling people to you know to uh uh you know go on um uh fructose because it has a lower glycemic index fructose causes type 2 diabetes you know this has been shown conclusively you know by the biochemistry department uc san francisco medical school you know and and and dr robert lustig like dear god you know like so and these are the people saying like oh you should you should do that because uh you know it's low glycemic index you use fructose as a sweetener they gave my mom like a big tub of fructose he put in her teeth she said oh i don't really like it so i don't use it thank god you know because i mean jesus but yeah mike okay i don't know that one that one just pissed me off like jesus really that's wild tell her to show her damn work i want to see that i want to see that study i want to see what kind of nonsense this person's trying to to base that on sorry a little worked up uh this was my favorite interview of yours blew my brain open you've been um having been a soccer player with occurring hamstring tears oh well thank you very much appreciate it uh is it coffee okay do you recommend cutting it out yeah i would i would i would cut it out i mean it's you know it's it's the plant at the end of the day right so plants are going to have plant toxins you know so i just saw a little tik tok thing where this guy was saying um he's like oh you won't go want to get healthy and people say i'm going to cut out coffee whoa not so fast there's this observational study that said that you have these benefits observational study what kind of nonsense is that you know that that's that you're you're basing like the health of your existence on an observational study maybe maybe not not uh the best thing to do i mean that's very low level evidence you know maybe it's true it could be you know i mean there have been observational studies that were you know borne out um and ends up being true but it's very low level evidence so you know you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna you know you know change your practice and you know based on that i don't know what are some hard facts well hard facts are that you know in botany and and horticulture we know that there are certain poisons in there that that plant makes to deter insects and animals from eating them you know especially in the bean right because a bean is a seed right all organisms protect their babies more than anything by and large and a seed is a plant's baby a bean is a seed a grain is a seed a nut is a seed and so this is where you generally find the highest concentration of poison is in is in the seed okay so so coffee bean is is no different you know you know cocoa is a cacao it's no different as well it's like it kills dogs chocolate kills dogs it's because it's poison okay and that's why it's bitter as hell because that bitter taste is your brain and tongue recognizing harmful chemicals saying don't eat this this is bad for you spit it out right and so that's uh that that's what that is and you know coffee coffee is bean you know you know i mean you know uh caffeine itself is is just a neurotoxin you know i i've uh spoken to people who have you know tractable epilepsy uh who've cured it on a carnivore diet and keto diet we've been doing this for 100 years actually it's in it's in been used in the liter been used as a treatment modality for intractable epilepsy for literally you know 90 years uh it's still used at johns hopkins okay um i i spoke to people that that you know uh got rid of most of their um uh seizures from uh going keto and got rid of all of them on carnivore had one cup of coffee bam seizure okay so he was thinking it's like yeah you know caffeine is a neurotoxin so yeah i just avoid that stuff you know i i had one cup of black coffee um after you know short a couple days after like a heavy workout i was sore for two days i don't get sore i don't get sore normally it doesn't matter how much i work out doesn't matter how hard i push myself you know i'll get sore uh with one cup of black coffee i'll store for two days okay so obviously there are things in there that are harmful um and everyone i speak to this that gets off coffee they all you'll say that they're really happy with that um let me see someone's saying is you know uh asking us to cameron if they were talking about gluten or glucose that's a good question maybe it wasn't gluten that would just blow my mind if they were saying that but also like you know why would you how how would you get how would you get diabetes from not eating sugar like what kind of stupid nonsense is that so by the way that lady is an idiot um and uh and should not be listened to and don't give don't give them your money like just don't give people like that you're telling me if they got that wrong what else have they gotten wrong you know like you can't you know you got to be careful with these sorts of things you know and people make honest mistakes but like come on now um ovarian cancer what are your thoughts on juicing plus keto carnivore from new zealand uh well you know juicing meat sounds great but um you know i know i would avoid i would avoid uh plants in general you know think about it this way you know if you if you juice a bunch of vegetables and you don't add any fruit or berries or sugar or anything like that um you know then you know you're going to uh you know you're going to see exactly what this tastes like and it is very bitter it's like it's like not palatable you know that's why people add sugar to this stuff to cover up that dust abhorrent taste of these of these plant toxins but that's your brain telling you hey there's things in there that are toxic so you should really listen to that there are a ton of carcinogens in in plants all plants i learned that in cancer biology 22 years ago that's why you know i stopped eating plants completely okay so i would not i'd touch any of those the main thing is is eating more meat but also stop eating carbs and sugar those things feed these cancers and and and change your metabolism and change your cellular metabolism to precipitate cancers okay that that is borne out uh by the data and that is something has been shown very conclusively in cell biology and cancer biology so i would definitely avoid all carbohydrates and sugars if you you know want to have some vegetables as well then you know that's your prerogative but i think that the best thing you can do is eliminate all uh you know harmful inflammation causing uh products which includes all plants and all fruits so i would just go strict strict carnivore if if they were if or me and it is me and i do it so but you know especially in the case of cancer that's i feel very strongly about that um okay how much worse is grain fed beef and grass-fed beef while eating a grain burger patty from a restaurant be detrimental to my health that's strictly carnivore ah not really um you know there have been studies that sort of don't show too much of a difference between people who are eating just just grass-fed and just grain fed there's not much of a difference now there is a difference i mean that i mean they're just going to be different nutrients in there um and so you know if you really want to get technical that's going to be the best of the best but you know crane finished beef is so much better than absolutely everything else on earth that it's you know it's the difference is now negligible between that and grass fed and finished beef i think of it as i think of it as uh you know uh what is it like um you know like uh you know the olympics right so gold and silver medal like so silver medal lost to gold okay but silver medal also beat everyone else on earth right so that's how i think about you know grain finished beef is that it's the silver medalist um okay i'm just gonna do two more questions guys and then then i've got a run um could you try you could try vitamin c for constipation oh you could if you yeah well it's an irritant right if you eat a lot of vitamin c um uh you won't absorb it and uh and it will irritate you know uh your gut and yeah you'll have like you know if you eat enough of it you have explosive diarrhea i have seen it happen um i actually actually um pranked my brother we were going we were going snowboarding uh god you know when we were like you know teenagers like teenagers early 20s and um in the early 20s and he uh you know just did like a big brother thing you know we're getting in the car and he's just like yeah once you go in there and you know you know get me a vinyl vitamin c and give me this you know take this and get in there and just you know make me vitamin c and just put some vitamin c water get me some water and do this just sort of ordering around just doing that sort of you know um you know uh you know just just just you know couldn't you know power game sort of uh thing and um and so i was just like all right yeah fine i'll do that but you're gonna get what i give you and so i went in there and i got i boiled up some water and i just put like fill up like half half glass with um with vitamin c and like use the boiling water to like dissolve it to get like you know uh you know super saturated in the solution and um and then sort of like topped it up uh with colder water but being careful so it didn't precipitate out and um and so i was just like yeah all right and i brought it back i was looking at him he looked at me and he knew that i was gonna screw with it for a bit but he wasn't gonna like let me know that it bothered him so he started drinking it you sort of see he's just like okay all right that's a lot but he's just like he was just like yeah i'm not gonna i'm not gonna i'm gonna pretend like nothing's wrong and just do that drink it out like all right we just sort of looked at each other like all right okay and um and we started driving and like as soon as we got up there we're up like we're getting in the parking lot he's just like oh my god um he's like uh yeah he's like dude how much how much vitamin c do you put in there i was like dude i put in like half a cup like you know i'm surprised you you're able to deal with that he's like yeah it's not feeling good it's not be like i'm really having problems right now i was like hopefully it settles down we got up on the first chair lift and like as soon as we're on you know like quarter of the way up he's like okay this is a bad idea this is wrong nope this has got to go we booked down this thing and he just spent like it was like dumb and dumber style just spent the rest spent the rest of the day uh in the lodge just couldn't um she couldn't get out of the bathroom it's absolutely hilarious so you could do that you could use vitamin c to uh to move things through but you don't need it you know you just uh just eat enough fat if you get enough fat the excess fat will keep your stool soft and that will keep things moving through so um yeah you don't need to you don't need to hurt yourself by doing that um all right last question um let's see uh see if i can find one here let's see anyone have another question i'm just saying sort of comments um so chris says excellent live do i have a partner asking for a friend in australia yeah i do i have a girlfriend l and um she uh yeah we do some posts together and things like that and we just started like a sort of a cooking carnivore cooking channel on youtube but we haven't haven't really posted many uh videos yet but those will be forthcoming and hopefully uh people like that she's also going to be starting a podcast discussing um with her friend uh from church uh about you know just things that you know about life and everyday things and um it's just called uh god what are we doing or god what am i doing and they just talk about you know their life and and sort of dealing with their issues that they've had and and putting that in a uh potentially in a religious context as well so that's interesting to people uh you can check that out it's not up yet but it will be um judy cho uh judy cho talked about iodine yeah she does that's a that's uh a very good point uh that judy makes is that some people just iodine deficient and um that's that's easily done um vitamin c diarrhea oh my god hilarious city stop ordering here yeah well look i mean there's always a dynamic between brothers but yeah i know we get along very very well now um you know but but growing up it was it was definitely friction and that was that was more one of the funnier uh episodes of that um okay guys well thank you very much uh everyone for coming by i hope that was helpful uh i hope that um that you liked it oh just a quick one berry strawberries blueberries no absolutely not i don't do anything with sugar uh sugar is very bad in all forms from all sources just because blueberries and strawberries may have some vitamins or minerals or whatever that are good for you that does not mean that they don't have things that are bad for you and so you have to look at the whole picture and anything with sugar you don't want anything uh from plants you really don't want but um how do i feel about mammoth meat i have to answer that one would love to get my hands on some mammoth meat my uncle was at a um a uh like a charity dinner like a fundraiser dinner and they actually found like a mammoth like in a in a like an ice floe in a glacier and just through hair and all you know so they studied this thing and all that uh but they actually took the meat it was just like freeze dried meat and um and uh they cooked it up they were cooking like you know mammoth steaks for people and usain was like yeah this is a bit dry as well i said ten thousand years of freezer burn but um you know yeah i would love to get my hands on some mammoth i'll be that'd be awesome but um right okay guys well thank you very much i really do appreciate it i really hope that this was helpful to people and i'm still trying to figure out this live stuff and uh and so once i get that going um i'll uh you know i'll do more of it um leighton asks if i can do a video on my blood work yeah i actually plan to do that my my blood work is is great you know so like as my endocrinologist friend said you know if you took 100 000 people my age off the street my blood would be number one without a shadow of a doubt i'm not saying that to brag i'm just saying that that's that's the result of years of carnivore and um you know i'm i'm you know uh uh not as young as i was and so if they're not going to be as good as they were when i was you know in the prime of my life well probably my youth um but you know there are excellent and so and i feel great and that's the main thing um so yeah okay guys well thank you very much i really do appreciate it and i hope to see you guys again soon all right oh how do i end this i don't even know how to end this crap i'll figure it out all right bye guys and yeah and please do like and share if you like this stuff it really does help guys and and and do check out the thomas seyfried um video that i think that that really is just the most important video i've ever done and you know anybody who has cancer or doesn't want to get cancer which is everybody please send this to them um and and let them see it because it's just it's just too important uh to not uh get out there so please do all right thanks a lot guys really appreciate it all right now it's just for"
