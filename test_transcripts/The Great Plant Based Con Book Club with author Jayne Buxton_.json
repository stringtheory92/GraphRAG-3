    "title": "The Great Plant Based Con Book Club with author Jayne Buxton!",
    "transcript": "okay so hi everyone and Welcome to our our weekly book club meet um this is a really special meeting tonight as we have Jane Buxton the author of The Great plant-based con what we've been reading for the last kind of month or so um evidence just to prove just to prove it yeah mine was mine was online on a Kindle so I can't do that but we've all read it in a lot of that so yes great to have Jane along tonight to um for her very kind of had to give up her time to join us and um and reflect with us on all of the observations that we had over the book as well as a few questions that we've collated along the way um we've had some some great discussions as I mentioned to you earlier Jane a lot of us are are pretty progressed being a carnival book club um on the nutrition side to things um and what we found we spent the most time discussing was some of the other aspects that you have so expertly described and explained in your book that are at play in relation to you know how we eat and what's good to eat and what isn't and what we hear about that um a lot of and um and yes so I you know I think I can say on behalf of everyone thank you very much for pulling together such a fantastic piece of literature that explains so well to to the Layman really um you know all of the factors that are at play when it comes to to eating um as we do or as we choose to the influences that are out there the kind of different angles that everyone has on it the media the elites the seven day Adventists um the investors and whilst at times you know it did leave us feeling a little bit um I guess overwhelmed by all of the um forces and where they're going and we're obviously touching that tonight um I think you know overall we feel much more in much more of an informed position to be able to kind of understand and interpret and um and and maybe have a bit more of a um kind of critical understanding of what we're hearing and what might be behind it so I think we're all very grateful to you for doing that So yeah thank you for reading the book because I know it's long and well done for reading the book it is very very long and in fact it rather terrified the publisher when they saw that the manuscript came in I think it came in at 50 000 words more than they commissioned me to write and um so they wanted me to cut it down and I said okay well tell me where to cut it down and they couldn't really think of any any place that could do with less evidence so we ended up um trying to put it into a format that that didn't look quite so daunting as it actually was and so I think my publisher actually did quite a good job of choosing choosing the typeface and all of those things to make it a little less um intimidating um so yeah it's a long book how did I get there um well I don't know many of you may have read my biogues which seem to differ depending on who's telling them but I've been a writer full-time for about 20 years um previous to that I was working in business um and I was a consultant and and largely working in the work-life balance area so I was a little bit of a a Pioneer in all of this business of flexible working helping companies to do that working from home all of that stuff we now take completely for granted but believe it or not there was a time when um that stuff was very very hard to get through into company so I started um I was doing that and um I got the writing bug and wrote a uh a non-fiction book back then about that kind of topic and about mothers and work and child care and all that uh I also uh wrote some fiction um and I was in fact in the middle of writing a novel based on truth based on a true story uh in 2019 I've been writing that for about five years and then this topic came along and grabbed me and I keep thinking about why it grabbed me so much and I think it was because I was also in a transition personally with my own diet and health and thinking about what would work best for me at this new phase of life and I had read so many things which impressed me which were to do with you know low carb and carnivore and keto and yet I was hearing something completely different in the Press about those diets and and that somehow I tweaked that there was a lot of misinformation and the more I dug of course the more information misinformation I found and I think many of you might have heard me say previously if you've listened to any podcasts or whatever that the thing that tipped me over into thinking I really need to write a book about this was when I saw the movie The Game Changers and I I realized what an absolute load of garbage that was but it was a load of garbage that was going to be very persuasive to a lot of people in particularly young people and I was so worried about that that I decided to launch myself into this project wow that's great to hear that that game changer game changers had a positive impact somewhere yes exactly based in Northern Scotland Jane which as you'll know is replete with green grass and rain and cows absolutely a lot of sheep um and yeah I just think I mean I've read quite a lot of um fairly hardcore books in this field over the years um so it wasn't that difficult to read your book I thought it was quite it was quite easy to read actually um but I I just for me the the real gift of this book is just having everything in this in one place you know and and so many things I didn't know you know I mean I mean I have to be careful talking about it to people because I'm coming across like a conspiracy theorist and I'm having to you need a long explanation don't you due to to not say nuts yeah absolutely but anyway yeah I'm not going but thank you okay yeah my name's Mike my home base is in Las Vegas Nevada um I first of all I'd like to say I love you and your book and all the attention you're getting out there for this I think it's important that people are hearing it in more than one place you know you're just great the way you put the book together I loved it um I haven't written any books but I've read a lot and yours was really good so I'll leave it at that so everybody can get in and we can get to some more questions thank you okay I'm Deborah from Orange Beach Alabama and in the U.S and I your book was wonderful it had so much like Roger was saying you know putting it all together in one place and I just wish we could get more people to read it and unders you know understand what's really going on and I thank you for that hi so anti-ism in UK as well um in Beaumont and yeah I love your book and it was quite nice to hear you're talking about the game changes because I was talking to Oliver earlier as well um I had so many people in my family just kind of saying to me how wrong I was and how and I should have watched the movie and all that and yeah if you could get the message for everybody I still have a lot of hard time with some friends and family but yeah I know why where I am now at least so I don't I don't need to explain myself to anybody anymore but yeah if more people could understand would be great really for the planets I guess hi I'm Chris I'm from Melbourne in Australia lots of rain down here as well times and cows and sheep I'm so so grateful that you wrote this book just the level of detail it goes into is really helpful for someone like me uh when I like to get things all lined up in my mind about how things are work and why why eating meat is good for us and good for the planet so thank you very much for for your efforts and continuing efforts to um spread the message hi Jane I'm Kim I'm from New South Wales in Australia we're also lots of um Dairy Farmers and beef here and um I just have great admiration the the courage for you to step into this space write a book like this it's um it's fabulous and I really really enjoyed it thank you hello my name is I'm I'm living between London and Cambridge in the UK I really enjoy your book because I was born in France and I'm a bit older than all those ladies so I do remember times where people would keep a few cows they would go to the co-op and they would take the milk Etc and then I moved to the UK and um a Fluor airplane so once you fly airplane you can't see anything anywhere you don't know you could come back one day could be the end of the world you wouldn't know anything about it and also that was so interesting because from my childhood I remember one thing then ever since I've been in the UK I was trying to find farms in the South where I could go and buy my meat and I never realized that as I've been told even in France if you've got a few cows nobody wants your milk any longer sugar chicken nobody I mean there's nobody to sell anymore because everything I become big Cooperative is that how you say Cooperative yeah and um yeah it's really an eye opener a complete eye-opener for me I had no idea it was that bad hi thanks uh I just want to say that I loved the book very much I'm actually finishing up the Big Fat Surprise now for the fourth time that's a great book and I can did you get back and I can totally see you reading yours several times also I just I feel like it's one of the few books hopefully that I'll ever read and make you just like mad all the way through if that makes sense you know like I was just mad all the way through the book like I can't believe we're still doing this if we know about the statistics and stuff that we're still doing this so um and just like the Big Fat Surprise I feel like everybody in Congress and everybody on the dietary guidelines committee and the President should have the book I feel like anybody who cares about nutrition at all should have your book um so thank you so much for writing it and thank you for being here today we appreciate it so if we start with the kind of the questions and we'll we'll work our way through those and as I said raise your hand if there's something that you'd like to add into the discussion um the first one I think Deborah is going to ask uh yes it's just um we were curious about where the title The Great plant-based con came from and do you think it makes it more deliberately provocative with that kind of title or did the Publishers pick it or did you choose it um I chose it and it was the working title all the way along um and I fully expected that the publisher would have a battle with me about that at the end and we'd have to change it and and there was some discussion about the title but then they decided that they really liked it and um they liked it because it it it really describes what's in the book so it's incredibly accurate and nobody has to guess um they also felt and I felt too that it would help distinguish um the book from others that have been written in the space some very good books have been written about this topic and I'm thinking of titles like defending beef or on meat Matthew evans's book I think was called on meat or on eating meat and all of those kind of reasonable titles had been done and I did feel that if I didn't have a title that grabbed people's attention nobody would read the book um I also very much wanted to get across to people the nature of a con and we battled very much about how do we describe that con because as I've said in the book it isn't some one person um or even a group of people sitting in a room pulling strings and going haha you know I'm gonna pull the ball over everybody's eyes that's not how it's working it's just that Confluence of a vested interest that happened to work together and I just felt it was so important that we get that message across so yes it's provocative yes it has really upset some people and it has even upset some people who are on our side as it were on my side who felt that I should have been more uh diplomatic and I would have won over a bigger audience and and maybe maybe I did sacrifice some audience but I think I probably gained more than I sacrificed as my guess yes yeah well thank you thank you Jane um the next question is about you know your progression as you have written this book and you've obviously pulled together a lot of information and then faced you know questions and challenges from the plant-based Advocates um themselves is there anything that you have found out from um those uh those proponents that have caused you to rethink any of your any of your points or positions on anything um having been confronted with that direct challenge um on the nutrition front there's almost nothing that somebody can throw at me on the plant-based which has convinced me to change my mind there's you know I remember being a little disconcerted by some of the New Evidence around tmao and the dangers that that might represent and then the more you dig into tmao and where it comes from the more you realize that that's very much a a burgeoning science there's no firm science on that um that that is convincing and there's also a lot of vested interest behind that tmao narrative so I could satisfy myself on that I think the biggest let's say quandary I have that remains with me that that if anything gives me sleepless nights it would be this it's the question of if I'm talking about moving our desire to move to a regenerative system for producing meat by and large a soil enriching system something that draws carbon down from the sky the best form of agriculture um how there are a lot of people who say you can do that great but you can't produce much meat that way and but you have estimates which are you know so widespread in terms of how much meat you could produce and not you know there's a fellow that I quote in the book Dr Alan Williams is absolutely convinced that you could have three times as many cattle on the land in the U.S if you managed it properly other people say no we have to reduce our red meat intake for instance by um you know two-thirds so you get this vast difference um and I think the jury is really out on that and I think it may very much depend on where in the world you are where you're implementing these practices in what kind of mixed Farm you're putting them so you know you may get a net increase in food which is what Gabe Brown did but maybe a little less cattle although he didn't get less cattle he he runs more cattle than than his um um ancestors did um so that's the thing where I feel the science is is not settled and that gives me the most grief and I'd really like to have a better answer on that okay thank you what do you think just as a follow-up needs to happen to get to that place is it just more studies to be done or more experts coming together and agreeing I think more studies which use common um metrics because a lot of times when you get people arguing about this you find that they're using very different metrics to do with um uh the inputs that are required for a given amount of land for instance so common metrics but it would also require people to really value and listen to the experience of farmers who are doing it so you know I know plenty of farmers who have managed to replenish their soil use mob grazing and they're producing more food and getting more profit from their land than they were previously now that may not be every Farm but we need to listen to those farmers and really take their their experience the problem you get with um the naysayers is they always say well I'm not going to listen to one farmer here I have this study by Joseph poor and it says this right so anyone can denigrate the evidence of farming the farming Community a farmer a group of farmers and and I would really like to see us championing those stories um a lot more thank you very much it's really interesting um Mike you had the next question I think how do we enact change against the system and that is vertically and horizontally linked and collectively pulling in the opposite direction and when we have a model that is inherently non-profit making so if you don't have anything to sell so it doesn't sound as glamorous out yeah yeah I think about this a lot and um talk about it with people um because you know you all said I think that you were a little depressed about the the sheer force you know the size of the the counter movement and the The Narrative which we're battling against and all the people that are involved in that all corporations all the money and it does seem as if it's pointless to argue against them how could we possibly win um but I put my faith in Grassroots movements and the power of those movements so I've seen it work for the low carb Community the low carb Community um has made in Rhodes I believe and they are helping small groups of patients who have and growing groups of patients who have decided to turn their back on all of that monolithic advice you know all everything that is official and that will keep happening and we'll just get stronger and stronger but it'll be slow and and the mainstream narrative will be up here and it will still be continuing and will all be incredibly frustrated but this movement below I think will start to grow and pressure against that I think there's another thing acting in our favor and it's a little bit perverse perhaps for me to say this but I think inertia the inertia and the common sense combined of ordinary people who don't know very much and they don't participate in these debates Dan will going to eat their meat because they've been eating and their grandmother ate it and they just like it so now along with that they're going to eat a lot of processed foods so their diets aren't perfect and that isn't something that you would like to see as as carnivores who studied this obviously but it is something which can be leveraged in our favor there is a there's an inertia in the system which will not allow those big great Elites to to have their way it will not allow corporations to take what is a really historically appropriate diet away from us so you know I might be naive in thinking that those two forces and factors can counteract the great big monolithic Force at the top but I but I that's I have to put my faith in those things okay I would agree with that I think you're right the Grassroots is a good way I mean that's the strongest way the foundation is just so so wide I've seen it firsthand a little bit myself but uh I think combined with your book and others and some things you mentioned common sense when people realize hey I've been eating this meat and all this stuff and then if they hear a little bit about the anthropological side of it where it shows you know through the Isotopes and things like that what we actually did eat meat and all of that um it's just common sense you say well yeah that makes sense and I think it appeals to most people who do have that stuff the people that go to work every day they don't have time to kind of get in like these debates but they're they want their families best interests at heart their best interest and they're they're smart so I think it'll catch on but it's like you said it's going to take a bit but the Grassroots is the way it's going to do it yeah yeah yeah I'm hoping we said it earlier Jane that um yeah these corporations are all investing in plant-based products you know at some point if they're finding that's not actually turning a profit they'll just move away from it as well so we might be hopefully in the in you know a bit of the kind of the peak of that and where it's looking like it's going constantly upwards in a trend fashion but actually you know as people start to realize that there's a huge cost involved in it um and and there's just not the volume there to you know to Warrant you know so many different product lines I think the money will move away from it yeah that's a really good point actually um yeah about the failure of those products and those companies and particularly with enteric fermentation and yeast based um you know George mombio's pet projects that he thinks are going to save the world he writes about that as if it's around the corner and fully scalable it's so far from being the case it's it's it's light years away from being the case so you know that that is in no way a sure bet that they're ever going to get that technology to deliver and is that still the case Jane because I remember reading a couple of Fairly weighty articles where people have basically just said look this this lab-grown meat stuff will not scale end of story and it was kind of like oh okay but what about technology and they were like no it just won't happen it's impossible uh which was kind of kind of shocking to read because you just always think oh well just be incremental costs will come down and we'll get there but I remember reading a couple of Articles like that which could be giving me great hope is that stuff are they do they well the most recent article that I read on that it was a very very long article I can't remember where it was maybe it was in the Atlantic and it was interviews with all of the players in the field and some of them who were actually investing in this and who who were staking their lives on on this we're admitting that yeah scalability is a really really big issue it might not happen anytime soon um so I do think it's it's a big big problem and I think we have to remember that people have been trying to do these old meets since early 70s as well so uh this is not this is not an entirely new they're using different Technologies but they've tried and failed with many Technologies before so we'll we'll know we've won when when we get like beef pops breakfast cereal yeah right I'm looking forward to it foreign a conversation the other day online between a kind of a meaty to an Anon meat eater and the non the non-meteater that vegan was saying I don't know why you're making such a big fuss about us being plant-based because you know we're really we're one percent of the of the population of the world and I thought God is it that small and like you know to us it feels like it's it's big and it's the only narrative we hear because we're probably very sensitive to it and and very alerted to kind of what's going on but when you look it up it is still tiny volumes and it goes back to your point about inertia um you know if one percent feels this big then actually maybe we're okay yeah because human instinct and you know their instinctual need to eat meat will will prevail hopefully yeah yeah yeah I think we have to hope so and and you have to look at the recidivism that word is almost impossible to say recidivism rate um which has historically been very high so people generally last about three months on a plant-based diet right and and they circulate out of it and there are more ex-vegans than there are vegans in the world that is for a reason people can't do it people can't sustain it most people cannot be healthy now we could talk I find the the subject of um why do some people appear to do very well on a vegan diet I find that endlessly fascinating and I'm just starting to learn much more about that about what might be driving those different reactions to vegan diets but there aren't many of those people they're just there aren't as if you can just interject again we've had discussions about this in terms of the inherent marketing um uh features of the carnivore diet because people who go carnivore generate headlines that they can tell to what the people like I'm off my 12 medications or my diabetes has gone away or look I can walk again you know I mean it's insane you look on um like rivero.com or something like that the categories of the unbelievable endless stories if you read the YouTube comments on a carnivore video it's just it's just unbelievable um and so it feels like you know carnivore has got some kind of virality built in whereas veganism has the opposite yeah I mean I know already from my own experience when people see you eating meat for say several months and not dying something goes changes in their brain you know they're just they're just like well what's happening here you know you don't have to say anything really apart from just you know I believe Scotland where they have banned mates from the school that's not strictly true yeah I think in Edinburgh they were they were saying we're gonna go all plant-based um but how actually that's actually going to be implemented I'm not entirely sure yeah at the University was that University or the city well there wasn't there was one in the University as well wasn't there and Cambridge has done it um and then there's this town Hayward teeth that has signed the plant-based treaty where they've decided to go and I interviewed the woman who was driving that and she just drove me absolutely nuts um and I don't know how it's going but I predict I predict many roadblocks I'm gonna move us on to the next question so it's um a question about whether and if you did how did you manage to maintain any objectivity when you were researching the book so did you kind of come into the point of view or did you very quickly form a point of view or did you try and stay totally objective all the way through and I think this kind of stems from us as a group just being very aware that we are to a certain degree in an echo chamber and we don't want to only know the you know the Viewpoint that we have so we're actually embarking on on reading a Simon Hills book next month to really kind of contrast with yours Jane and challenge ourselves into understanding if nothing else you know the full argument on the other side so we can be better at defending um defending our own viewpoints um at the very minimum but yeah wondered how you encountered kind of that conflict or was there any conflict when you were working your way through all the material yeah there's always conflict and I wouldn't I wouldn't profess to be completely objective I mean I don't think anybody is ever objective but I think you can force yourself to be as objective as you possibly can be so I obviously came in with a point of view which was that the game changers argument was was really full of nonsense and that they the studies didn't Stack Up Etc and so I moved from that point of view and started doing more research now um I because of the title you know that I started out with that point of view I I thought it was a con because of what I saw around me and what I found confirmed it now occasionally people would send me studies which would um contradict what I was saying and what I found I had to do and I still do is whenever somebody sends me something I read it I analyze it or I look for somebody else who's analyzed it very well and there are plenty of people around who do that work for us which is great um so Zoe harkum is one that I I really love she's always on it with these with these studies and um and invariably I would find that there were flaws weaknesses questions in the study or the analysis that was being presented to me so each time I would find I would be able to say well no that has not shaken my Essential point of view um it might have you know like I said with the TMO thing it might have worried me and there would be some unanswered questions but there's nothing which has overturned anything in my mind but I do think it's so important for everybody for all of us to keep doing that to keep looking at the opposite side I think it's great that you're reading Simon's book I did something similar well I had to because I was at a Book Festival and I was debating somebody called Earthling Ed I don't know him yeah and um he had written a book at the same time came out at the same time as mine and I read it covered a cover and was prepared to talk to him about it um it didn't go according to plan for various reasons but what I found was that his his book was very convincing on the surface and a lot of people would have read it and believed it but I knew old studies he was referring to I knew exactly what they said and I knew they didn't say what he said they said or I knew that there were caveats or whatever so if you're armed with that kind of knowledge you're able to be more objective I I think because you're just dealing with facts rather than opinion yeah and I think saying something earlier today about you know we forget that people forget that's really important that we should keep reminding them and not be afraid to do that because it's very clear to us as carnivores that meat is the most nutritious and red meat in particular the most nutritious food to eat but many people have been LED astray into a different way of thinking on meat and as he said that's that's one of the one of the points of the argument that's actually incontrovertible that we can continue to remind people about absolutely the the kind of nutrient density of animal Source Foods in general meat in particular is incontrovertible and we mustn't um we mustn't stop asserting those because you know I think you as you said to me earlier today uh Olivia you all know that and so you maybe you just think it's taken for granted and you get tired of talking about it or whatever but most people really don't know that they really need reminding people have forgotten that they're shocked when you tell them that that there is value in eating these and it you know the the kind of newspaper articles drive me crazy because all they ever talk about is people want their meat because they like the taste no no they want their meat and they need their meat because it's good for them so that message needs to be repeated ad nauseam as far as I'm concerned okay thank you so Serena has the next question yeah I was just gonna ask you how do you suggest like you have a suggestion for how we handle ourselves like on social media and even in public or private settings with friends everybody's got such strong opinions about this kind of thing and you know we need to protect our own mental well-being like I have my own uh dilemmas with that I have a social media page that's public where I share like exclusively carnivore stuff and a YouTube channel where I do that but I haven't shared anything really on my personal Pages unless I did it by accident which I have done a few times um and so I just want and I haven't done that on purpose because as much as I want to help people I can just seem you know like people unfriending me other people I went to high school with and stuff you know like so how do we protect our own like mental well-being and not um not be like too far to one side or the other to kind of turn people off yeah well I'm I've I've been around the houses on this and I've tried lots of different tactics so I'm really no expert with a definitive uh strategy here but I think I have evolved to realize a couple of things I also keep my personal um uh social media activity separate from my Twitter so Twitter is the place where I will discuss things I don't do Facebook at all um and Instagram is is kept for family unless it's an interview like yesterday I did an interview with um a carnivore and he posted it all over Instagram of course all my friends saw it but it wasn't me it wasn't me projecting it it was just happened to appear and they're paid so I felt that that was okay what I have learned and tried to teach myself is um to always be a little bit distant and and very polite and to not get engaged in the kind of really low level personal attacks on people even though I get attacked a lot um I'm sure and people will say all kinds of things about me as and I'm sure you've had this experience too they'll see it as if I'm not in the room you know as if I can't read it they're all having conversations I mean she's this she's that um oh God she did creative writing and wrote fiction well everything she writes is fiction that kind of thing and then I've had worse than that really ugly ugly misogynistic things um and sometimes I'm tempted the other day I was very tempted there was a fellow who was attacking everything and he started out using studies but then got progressively more personal and I I had to hold back because I wanted to say to him do you know what you're really rude but also you look really unhealthy so for a plant-based Advocate I don't think you're doing so well I would have loved to have said that the guy looked like he was about to die right oh my goodness I didn't say it because that is just going where they go all the time yeah so I just try to with and so at a certain point if the conversation isn't going anywhere which is usually I stop stop and then what you end up being accused of of course is running away and hiding so you you have to take that on the chin and and hope that they're frustrated and actually a lot of time you notice okay nobody's listening to them they have no likes they have nobody in the conversation it's just them so you just relax a little bit and let them go off on their wrist you know yeah yeah that makes sense the one the single rule is don't get drawn into personal stuff and don't get rude and don't and don't get involved in that stuff yeah I actually um shared a meme that a friend posted today that I feel a little bit guilty about um it's something like my mouth Waters at the smell of a fresh grilled steak did you see this Olivia it was Joe's post um the smell of a fresh grilled snake or snake I wonder if vegans feel that way when they mow the grass and I shared it because I thought I thought it was really funny but anytime I share something like that I think you know I don't want to push people I don't want to push vegans away no I want them to stay um and so while things like that are funny I think I'm going to try not to do that anymore because the truth is I don't it would be like a Christian you know condemning people for their sins right you know you're not going to bring people in if you do that you know so so the more I think about it the more I think I'm not going to share things like that anymore as funny as I think they are I would rather keep the people there because maybe one day they get sick enough or get curious enough yeah that they try it you know because I really think I think the more vocal we all are the more people we can bring um so I'm like I am this close to sharing on my personal Instagram and Facebook pages about what I do because I know people there need help too you know so anyway you made a good point there which is um uh I think you were hinting at something about being positive if something is positive then I think it can be shared and I think we can all be um get much more traction if we talk about the benefits of eating the way we eat or that you eat in particular um rather than the negative the way somebody else eats so just sort of sing the Praises of this diet what's it done for you what's it done for people that you know um and then if somebody wants to come back and say oh yeah but but you know plant-based is better you say well this is what's working for me and this is what's worked and this is the evidence I have seen right a positive story yes absolutely thank you very much that was definitely a good answer thanks um potential incentives you know whether you've seen any any incentives that seem to be working or you know about them because it's always such a Minefield especially when it comes to farming we've seen a terrible unintended consequences in the past come across anything that seems to be working well I wrote about a few a couple of sporadic um not government sponsor but actually corporations sponsored initiatives that may have promised you know um when General Mills started working with Gabe Brown and Alan Williams and they paid for those men to lecture and and Coach farmers in regenerative principles um and they funded that whole program that's got to be positive that's an incentive so it gets people over that first hurdle right in the UK right now some of you may be familiar with the fact we have something called the sustainable farming initiative which is and part of that is sustainable farming incentives which all sounds wonderful and farmers are being paid to farm differently so for instance they're being paid to use cover cropping to stop tilling to protect the soil um there's not a lot of mention of using um livestock to protect the soil which is really kind of telling and irritating but the farmers who've responded to those incentives programs have just said so far this is not good enough it's just not enough to help people make the transition to reward them for making that transition or even to help them see what the transition should be so I think the programs are falling woefully short government is talking a good game but not really investing in it and so it's probably achieving 20 of what it could achieve um so I don't think I've seen anything wonderful happening from government anywhere pockets of government some good ideas but no no great programs at the moment okay and I mean it kind of feeds into our next question as well which was um how farmers in general feel about the prospect of changing their models I mean from your book um I've sort of gone on a bit of a journey of Discovery and I'm reading Alan savory's book holistic management at the moment um and I have a couple of farmer friends um locally who I started talking to but is there I mean when you look into it there seems to be quite a lot going on in the UK and it seems to be like there's there's groups here and there's groups there and I can't really tell how they're all joined together but there is quite a lot sort of happening yeah is this is there still that because I mean around here anyway you know we've certainly got a you know a sort of 55 60 plus farmer cohort who are failed resistant to everything yes if you know what I mean um do you get do you have you got a feel for how farmers in general regard this stuff um the farmers that I have met they are a self-selected group because by definition they meet me because they want to talk to me or because we're at the same festival or whatever so there's this festival called um Groundswell which I mentioned in the book which every year has been building and building and building and the energy there is really unbelievable um farmers are just the farmers who come there are desperate for more information they they treat the the guys who've done it right as like like rock stars you know up on the stage giving giving talks and stuff there are demonstrations of exactly what can be done to soil um with the proper management of both cover cropping and livestock Etc so when I go to those places I have huge amount of hope that that is going to just grow and that's going to lead the transition there are pockets of farmers who are very resistant who um don't want to change don't have the money to change they're frightened of changing and some of them go to those festivals as well just to maybe they're dragged there I don't know maybe uh maybe they're they're curious and I I can tell from the questions they pose that they know it's harder than we're pretending it is perhaps or than we're saying it is and it is hard it's really hard and I think it's really important for Farmers not to be polarized and not to demonize one another Joe Stanley writes really eloquently about this all the time let's not overuse these terms like agroecology um uh regen farming as if it's an easily identifiable package that everybody must do the whole thing or nothing at all let's reward people for doing one little thing yeah and for moving gradually and if they've seen one corner of their um their field with cover cropping um improved in soil Health let's applaud that I think you know festivals need to do that farmers themselves need to do that um and we need to keep that perspective in mind too so there's one other question here which I just skipped um and and that's whether you feel there's an increasing awareness of the problems with monocrop agriculture because this is something I get from my daughters who are um sort of mid-teens yeah oh dear well yes that's why that's why I'm here on my own up here um uh uh but you know they're they're very aware of the fact that mono crop agriculture is a horror show and you know we need to do something else and not that they necessarily know what something else is but push against um is there an increasing awareness of this do you think um well your daughters may be well ahead of the curve because I don't see anywhere much of an awareness in my everyday circles at my age group so you know adults adults over the age of 30 say I wouldn't say that I that I find awareness of that and if I ever mention it um I do get sort of you know blank looks like what am I talking about um and then when you start to explain it of course they do cotton on but I think it's probably the thing that we have least awareness in all the elements of this debate that might be the thing we have least awareness of so maybe we can do our bit to talk about that a bit more but I think I always recommend that people go watch the movie kiss the ground um because it's not a perfect movie and it has a lot of blind spots because they don't mention cows for example very much but what they do talk about is the dangers of monocropping and and what it's doing to the world and why we need a different kind of farming so I think it's a really visual way of getting people to understand the dangers yeah yeah okay thank you I think that's the end of my farming questions Olivia okay you watch it and then Chris has got some nutritional questions hi Jane so um I loved all the detail you went through in your in the book obviously but then at the end um I just have a few questions about your thoughts uh so you recommend we still eat a wide variety of fruit and vegetables every day and the diversity is key for the health of our microbiome but that doesn't seem to be an issue for the ever increasing n equals one cases of District carnivores that you study in that way I've studied um and you refer to the phytochemicals but then others of of plants but then other sections of the book point to research that Pastures meat also contains phytochemicals so I was just wondering uh what your views are on our wacky carnivore diet and don't worry we're not gonna bite yeah but yes I I let me start by saying that I really fought hard to keep that chapter in uh it's a short chapter about the meat only diet or the animal food only diet in the book and um publisher wanted to take it out and they said I don't think you should do this because it sounds like you're advocating for people to eat for everyone to eat that way and I said I don't think I am advocating for that I'm advocating for people to have the choice and I've seen evidence that it can really do great things for some people in some situations who who want to eat that way and then discover that it that it helps them um so I wanted it in the book I feel it's really important to have it in there and I think increasingly I see evidence of people who do very very well on that diet in fact I was just told the story the other day when I was um at an event and this woman came up to me she was so excited because someone she knew who has cancer and has tried everything has suddenly been put on the lowest of lowest sugar diets which of course is carnivore and um is doing extreme really well on that so these stories are coming out and people are excited to hear them if I go back to the point about how many fruits and vegetables to eat if you are going to eat fruit and vegetables I think it's best to have a wide variety because I think where people get into trouble is when they overload on on one or two vegetables and types of vegetables or something and they get too much of those tox plant toxins in one go or their diet you know if all you're eating spinach you're going to run into trouble right so I think that to get the there's no doubt that there are vitamins and minerals which come um from getting a wide variety of those uh plants and and fruits but I I think in the next sentence I say but if you can't tolerate those you can get all the nutrition you need yes you did mention that as long as you include herbs and spices which again was confusing because herbs and spices I mean I don't know about everyone in the group but they are plants and I don't use herbs and spices yeah well and you don't have to and you may be doing very well and this was this was um Fred provenza's Theory and also Stefan Van Vliet who believed very much in the ability of that to enhance what the meat is giving you what the food is giving you because it's it's this micro doses of of certain nutrients now that said I do think the jury's out on a lot of this and we we really don't know about the balance between too little in terms of phytonutrients phytochemicals and too many and I think it's a very fine balance and probably differs for different people and you know the the the benefits have not been proven they are it's the research on all of the the say cancer protection benefits from phytonutrients are it's very early it's it's it's uh and it's very diverse but I think the research that you will be partaking in through your own experiments but also as as as some academic research uh explores the subject we may well find that a a good variety of animal Source Foods could also build a really strong healthy microbiome and that the interaction of those uh chemicals and that you can get equal numbers of phytonutrients or just enough from the grass-fed meat and I think that that is all emerging and and and and and very exciting and will be exciting to see um let's let's hope so and so I just had one other question but I think you were sort of it was in the same chapter so I was probably part of the same um stream of of being balanced uh you quoted farmer Matthew Evans who said if you're not happy with how meat has been sourced to the restaurant you're better off to choose the vegetarian option and I read that and I'm thinking surely not surely not because you never know where the vegetables come from with the glyphosate and you know the monocropping stuff and they could equally have also come from you know if the owner doesn't know where their meat has come from they're likely to not know where their vegetables yeah all plants have come from either so um yeah you're correct to point that out as a sort of little bit of a fallacy my daughter did the same thing um and uh and you are right so I understand his sentiment um but I also understand that that would not be a foolproof solution to me ensuring that you're doing a better thing either I think what what he was probably saying and what I would say is it depends what your goal is so if and I think he was writing that from the perspective of somebody desperately concerned about his direct impact on Animal Welfare so if that is his primary goal he may be prepared to put that top of his list and eat something that's monocrot that's not so great for the soil I don't know I haven't asked him that question but I can see people would go through these trade-offs somebody else might be much more concerned about the use of water and the fact that we're importing all our fruits and vegetables from water stressed countries and we really shouldn't do that so they would look at a menu and go okay I'm not having any of those fruits and veg because this is not the right season and that is putting too much pressure on that environment so do you see what I mean there are loads of factors to take into account and we all must choose considerately based on what we feel most important most strongly about um and maybe that is that what we can take from Matthew's sort of sentiment in that sense the useful thing that we can take out of that yes now I am aware there are there are a couple of places like that in the book where I having thought about it afterwards I thought well yeah that didn't make complete sense and there are going to be those in a book of 550 Pages you know there are going to be moments when you think yeah I didn't do that well enough I didn't explain that well enough or I didn't have time to do that so um you're quite right to point it out in fact all the questions you guys have asked have been amongst the most intelligent and kind of thoughtful questions I've ever had in a group like this so um you're kind of a great audience and a tough audience at the same time it's over me you're so grainy that's right I didn't I didn't mean to take away from your efforts and I definitely no I know the science section in the same section you were talking about choices and that was amazing the way you wrote that up I thought you know and about affordability and the choices people make when they're you know turning up to the supermarket and they've got to decide yeah you know do I do the um pasteurized this or do I do from far away or do I do the you know like all the all you know because nothing's perfect yeah yeah and this is real and also you you have to talk about affordability without making people feel bad or using the word poor right and it there's so many sensitive areas when you're writing about this stuff where people can actually um stick you can they can knife you if they feel like it um I I even did worry about using the word woman in connection with pregnancy to be honest in the book I thought am I am I allowed to do that anymore I don't know anyway I did I did I didn't notice that being an issue yeah none of us would work for that Mike you had a follow-up question or comment yeah I just want to say something kind of intertwined with all of it was um one of the parts where you mentioned that certain vegetarians might look like they're so healthy you know like for a few months they probably are you know because they cut out all the garbage any garbage diet you go one way or the other is to be better but I always whenever I see someone who says yeah I've been a vegan for this long and I'm doing so great I my first thought isn't oh you don't know what you're doing my first thought is I wonder how much better he'd be or she if she was eating meat they would be so much better and that's the thought I always have as opposed to coming down on them just saying wow it would be if they could just see how good it is and how how much energy you get how much more your focus and how how your skin your hair your nail everything just starts looking so good and people are so happy yeah that is it's amazing what I see from carnivores and people that I've seen go carnivore and just totally overcome yeah chronic so-called chronic conditions that we have to live with that we really don't I believe you and I have not heard any stories the way you hear vegan stories um disaster stories and people who eventually say you know I was going to die if I kept on this diet anymore or my my health plummeted at about year five it you know is quite a common story I don't hear that on the carnivore side so I don't know whether you know we we haven't we haven't been at this very long sharing stories but but the more we do the more sort of data we'll build up around that and I I believe you the only reason I don't go carnivore myself is I seem to flourish on the diet I have and I love vegetables I'm sorry but I do and I I look forward to them and I prefer them but I I eat meat because I have to and I want to make sure I get those nutrients I make myself eat meat and I know it's good for me I know it's good for me um so you'll have people on the Spectrum um who who do better or worse and on each variation of the diet and I think people just need to be honest with themselves about what they're getting out of something yeah you're probably thinking well she'd do so much better if she gave up those damn vegetables don't forget anybody who can everybody can write a book that big in that much detail is probably doing just about just fine I think we'd all uh all be glad to be able to maintain that level of focus for that length of time yeah amazing for writing what you wrote everything you wrote with yeah great thank you I loved it all you know I didn't agree with 100 but I think it was very good I think you're very important to at least have people open their eyes and think about it you know like we said the common sense person is going to look at it hey maybe you try a ketogenic diet or a just a low carb diet but just try to see something and see how you start feeling yeah yeah yeah and that's the main takeaway that I would see is give it a shot give something a shot get rid of the garbage yeah in fact I was if people would only think of diet first when they don't feel good if they would only think of trying something I had lunch the other day with a family and and the mother's vegetarian the daughter it turns out is vegan she's 22. I hadn't met her before and we were in a big group and the girl then revealed that she'd had me uh you know the energy I don't I don't know the exact name for Emmy but it's when you have no energy um and she'd been in bed for nearly six years and hardly able to do anything and living at home with them and you know she was starting to come around she discovered some new medication and she was starting to feel better and I just I couldn't say it but I thought because it wasn't the right context I wanted to say did you ever think that your vegan diet might be the reason and I'm sure it is in my in my gut I know it probably is um but you have to choose your moments and if she'd asked me if she'd given me an opening of any kind I would have said something but you have to be very careful you know with a vegetarian mother and a and they're long-standing friends and you just have to be really careful don't you you have to wait until you get that opening yeah I have a my son has a best friend who is a vegan and she has her son and she's raising him vegan it's very hard for me not to say anything but I know I I can't say anything because I love her to death and you know so I just I don't know there hasn't come a time to say anything but you know yeah I think it's even um worrying you know especially young vegan people who tend to be very passionate and emotional and somewhat black and white about these things you know even the the facts about veganism it strikes me is quite dangerous for them to to encounter and I do realize that people are infinitely capable of rejecting ideas that they don't like but you know even even these which I think is becoming a more common piece of knowledge now that veganism kills animals so in huge numbers that and animals that don't end up getting eaten I mean it's it's a horror show right so even that you know if that that piece of knowledge for a for a young vegan would I mean it could be terrible absolutely you know wow difficult and I think it's actually the the kind of opening question which is Jane you chose the title on purpose to get attention and I think one thing we have on our side and we've talked about this again through the the many weeks is you know it seems like the more shocking you can make a message the more you can cut through and that's something I always think about as someone who is from a background in marketing and we actually have a lot of those types of kind of shocking um claims that we could make on our side because everything is so opposite to what we know in the mainstream that we can turn that on its head and actually use it to our advantage I think that's something we're not doing enough of and we're not exploiting fully but there is a kind of a rifle exploitation is is some of the the claims that we could make that could really stand out to people and and turn people's heads around and make them think hang on maybe I've got this all wrong yeah yeah I mean wouldn't it be funny to sort of casually mention at a group at some sort of event um that you don't you never be vegan because you would hate to kill all those animals and have people go what and it's like whenever I somebody asked me you know or I'll mention why I'm ordering the meat on the menu I'm eating the meat because it's really good for me and the more people just hear these really counter-intuitive counter-cultural statements just simply put just simply put you know Common I really wanted to speak about was you know we talk about vegans and carnivores and like it seems like that's where the battle is it's not really the battle because that's that's good the vegans and carnivores because the vegans will kind of Wither away over time where the problem is is the the people on the sad diet the ones that are eating everything and they don't realize why they feel bad or why they've got inflammation or why they've got this it's got to be a a drug that's going to take care of me it's going to fix me because why why should a diabetic not be able to eat their cheesecake and and cupcakes how dare you say that but they believe that the standard American diet is the best thing that's where our fight really is is to get them to go to a if nothing else a whole food approach where you're something you can pull out of the ground or something you can kill or been killed and eat the whole food stuff that's that's where we want to get the middle let them pick sides it'll it'll the the other side will go down I think that's what happened through Evolution the other side failed that's why we survived for 300 and some thousand years or possibly four million years depending on how you look at it but it's because of me that's how we Thrive so I think the problem is the middle you are right but thank you for your book it's awesome thank you very much for having me it's great to talk to you guys thank you Jane I also want to say I really love the photos and pictures that are behind you I found that very inspirational as we were going Wyoming that's Wyoming from a trip we took um about five years ago when we were living in New York we did a big big trip and uh it wasn't yeah it was inspiring so we keep them up there to remind us yeah well thank you Jane for joining us tonight it's been so insightful fascinating interesting to talk to you and the perfect end to rounding off that fantastic book so thank you thank you hi everyone Hi everyone bye-bye"
