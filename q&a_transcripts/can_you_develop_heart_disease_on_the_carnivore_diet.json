    "transcript": "[Music] what is the connection between carnivore and reducing heart attack risk I'm a 50-year-old male strict carnivore for six months and keep hearing about men younger than me having heart attacks yeah it's it's very concerning isn't it and um you know when you consider the fact that the first heart attack diagnosed and confirmed on autopsy in America was in 1912 and there wasn't a single case reported in the literature uh confirmed on autopsy of someone dying from a heart attack then uh you have to sort of wonder why the hell that is and why 10 years later became one of the biggest killers and then few years after that became the number one killer in America even though we're eating the least amount of meat in America than we were in 200 years before or since and so in the 1800s we're eating far more meat oh people are only living to their 30s well people in their 30s have heart attacks now people in their 20s have heart attacks now my friend Dr Anor Verma is an ER physician in India and they eat three kilos of meat per person per year on average and he's seeing 17-year-old vegetarian kids coming into the heart the hospital with a heart attack the hell is that so people just 17's not old enough I guess um it's it's it's pretty wild uh what people the mental gymnastics that people can do to deny reality in in front of their faces the average life expectancy from birth in 1850 was 38 but the average life expectancy from age 10 years old if you made it to 10 was 56 so and you get to 20 it's 66 and so on so if you get into adulthood and middle age you lived as long or longer than people do now and so it's just that the childhood morality rate was very high and and early early deaths were high because it's you know it was a hard life you know we have it pretty piss easy now in the west you know you go out go to Bangladesh and uh you know go go see how they live not even in the refugee camps where I was working just go see rural Bangladesh or even Urban Bangladesh the vast majority of people are living under very different conditions than than we are and they have a life expectancy to uh compare that to India their average life expectancy from birth is around 60 60 something right and they're all vegetarians well wouldn't that mean that you know uh that uh you know being vegetarian is bad oh well but there's infant mortality and there's this and there's oh okay so now now there's a distinction but not when it goes the other way so um why does you know what's the connection between carnivore and reducing heart attack R well the simple thing is is that you're you're removing out things that can be causitive you know I mean cigarettes at smoking um nicotine can cause damage to the artery lining diabetes causes damage to the lining of your arteries through glycation you're going to keep your blood sugar down you're going to keep your insulin down and high fat meat-based ketogenic diets like a cornivore diet have been shown in clinical trials in humans to reverse type two diabetes that's one of the biggest risk factors for developing heart attack and heart disease and stroke and um so that would be diabetes metabolic syndrome both of which have been shown to be reversible with ketogenic um uh high fat ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet and people all around the world are reversing their diabetes with by going on a high fat carnivore diet uh that is ketogenic and getting rid of seed oils and these things these Industrial Products that have never existed in nature ever and um then you when you cook with them they can make uh trans fats they can they partially hydrogenate and you make um trans fats that are extremely toxic they don't exist in nature either and um you know that's why these things are illegal now because it's such a high risk of developing heart disease and and other sorts of health issues and when you cook with these plant oils they you know uh they can turn into uh trans fats so that's not good you don't want those but I mean the the the plant oils themselves um can be harmful as well so you're just eliminating out all these different things and so it's an Elimination Diet you're just you're just cutting out things that are bad for you so it's like you know what what is the connection between you know um not drinking alcohol and doing drugs and certain Health outcomes well you're just not doing drugs and drinking alcohol which damage your body and can precipitate these health issues same thing with cornivore you're just eating what humans have been eating since humans have been humans and so your body's just going to work normally you're not bringing it all these other sorts of harmful additives um and for those who said that you know people died in their 30s you know before the 20th century just remind them that since the 1700s the minimum required age to run for president of the United States was 35 minimum right and you look at all the founding fathers all these like white-haired old men usually wearing wigs because they lost all their hair right so tell me again how only leing to be uh 35 again so um you know John Adams was born in the mid 1700s and he uh was 92 years old when he died Jefferson I think was 6 was 84 and um uh Washington was in his late 60s and then he you know caught pneumonia working out in the field and just getting soaked wet and um and decided not to change because he didn't want to be late to dinner he was very punctual it was just all about gen gentlemanly manners and and um that was very important to him and um you know it cost him he got bad pneumonia and um pneumonia and he got very sick and he ended up dying probably from all the things that they were doing at the time you know all the blood letting and cupping and all that sort of stuff and it was weeks and weeks and weeks before he died uh but yeah he unfortunately died so you know unless something killed them they they lived to be in their 80s and 90s for you know centuries you know and so and yet there were no heart attacks and strokes confirmed on autopsy in America before 1912 and then in the 1920s it's massively increased in the 1930s it's the number one killer in America and it stayed that way and it just sort of kept going up and um you know now the prevalence and incidence the new heart attacks people having their first heart attack is getting more and more um common so you know in the in the 19 know so you know liar and people that are trying to purposefully mislead you will use this line um that uh that the cardiovascular mortality rate peaked in the 60s and 70s and then started coming down right when we started you know going away from eating meat and fat cholesterol and and putting people on statins but that's not what we said so the rate the incidence the the you know the how common heart disease was and how common heart attack was went up and increased dramatically actually and worldwide deaths have increased dramatically as well U just in America the mortality and these are age adjusted numbers always remember that age adjusted means they've changed the numbers and you you know you have to you have to sort of say well what did you change them to what are the raw numbers so don't age adjust them why the hell are you age adjusting them just tell me how many people have had a heart attack how many people have died from a heart attack they don't tell you that they only tell you the age adjust it is almost impossible possible to find the unage adjusted numbers I actually haven't been able to find the non-age adjusted uh mortality cardiovascular mortality I have not been able to find them and I've had um you know research assistants and and other people that have not been able to find them either it's very difficult it's almost as if someone doesn't want you to see them hey everyone really happy to announce a new sponsor for the show and for everybody

talking about the prevalence we're talking about the incidence we're talking about the percentage of people in society that have heart disease we're talking about the the how many people a year get diagnosed with heart disease well that's just screening that's just better Diagnostics okay what about first-time heart attacks that's going up to so the number of people having their first heart attack and surviving is going up we have better interventions we have better access to Medical Care we have way lower smoke rates in the 1920s and before when heart heart disease almost didn't exist 80% of men smoked right and so now it's far less than that and yet we have a far higher rate of heart disease and uh and deaths from heart disease actually then in the 1920s when it was 80% uh male smoking rate so you mean this is back when they were like telling athletes you should smoke because it opens up your lungs gets your your cardiovascular system going uh just crazy but it um it it is the case that the first people having their first heart attacks is going up so why is that since we're reducing we've reduced red meat by over a third reduced fat saturated fat and cholesterol by the same in increase fruits and vegetables by 30 and 40% increased heart healthy grains increased um heart healthy uh unsaturated vegetable oil oils by over threefold and um and replaced uh you know these calories that you're you're missing out from animal fats with h plant oils and sugar you know and sugar is supposed to be not bad for it's not supposed to cause heart disease but then why the hell is heart disease increasing why are people having more heart attacks why are people all around the world dying of heart attacks and strokes more than they ever were before and that that and those worldwide statistics you can get and those are increasing and the deaths from cardiovascular disease is increasing beyond the rate of population growth around the world right so you're outstripping just how how how many people are out there right so it's not just wrong numbers it's percentage of the population is going up and up and up and like I said in India there's some of the sickest people and most metabolically sick people they have some of the highest rates of diabetes they're all plant- BAS right a traditional you know vegetarian Indian diet like I said you know my my friend Dr anchor Verma he's treating 17-year-old kids vegetarians that are having heart attacks 26y old lady came in had stroke this is crazy I mean you're destroying the potential that this person had for their whole life you're just destroying an entire life and um and and then people are just try oh it's the meat it can't be the meat because um or not not the meat alone anyway because these people don't eat meat you know three three kilos of meat per year and 20 years ago they were eating five kilos of meat per year and they were healthier they're worse now the the you know diabetes rates in India for these vegetarian population is 25% and that's in urban and rural areas right and that's published in top journals and recent studies published in top journals um 25% of the population uh is type two diabetic contrast that with America when everybody says oh America they're all fat and slobby and junk food and this and that and blah blah blah and Americans are just the least healthy people on Earth the diabetes rate in America is 9% diabetes rate in India where they're vegetarian and all super healthy is 25% so why doesn't that show up in the blue zones right why why don't we make a movie called the anti-blue zones you have all these play that go strictly against that Blue Zone ideology and blue zones are anti-blue zones too because they they disprove their own Theory because most of them eat way more meat than they said they did um and um and they they lied on a lot of other different fronts as well but um you know you have the entire subcontinent of India oh look at this little population this that how about you look at 1.4 billion people who are largely vegetarian and only eat three kilos of meat per year and see that they are the sickest people on Earth how would you look at that and um and and tell me what you think you can check your actual objective markers your C score or uh you cred Doppler and see what's going on I have a number of patients that have been reversing their atherosclerosis this is all anecdotal but this is they are reversing it had a gentleman in my my patreon uh chip who had 100% uh stenosis blockage of his right cored artery and uh a year before he started u you know a year ago he was on Carnivore for a year"
