    "body": "member says 60 plus days carnivore great job gain bit of weight no loss yet will I lose weight if I exercise more I barely exercise now or will my body demand more food and cover whatever I've burned through exercise depend well the it does depend but um exercise is very good for you it's very beneficial it can help increase your metabolic rate and function and just your overall health so it's very good for you doing anarobic exercises such as sprinting and weightlifting is a very good idea you almost certainly lose weight and lose fat if you do start lifting weights and sprinting um you'll lose fat certainly uh but you will put on muscle and so you may not lose weight and that's always the thing to remember is that body composition is very different than weight because you can put on muscle and lose fat and stay the same weight or even put on weight um and uh also remember that you know this is a this is a long game you have to wait for your metabolism and your hormones to normalize before it's going to function properly and you're going to lose a lot of body fat sometimes it's rare it is the exception not the rule but there are people like Kelly Hogan who actually gained weight for the first six months and after that she started shredding weight and um and eventually got to a a lean stable uh weight and body fat percentage um a couple years later you know it takes time but it happens and now she's been very slim and slender the rest of her life and she's had three kids since then and she's still very trim very slender so it uh it just takes time so exercise is a great idea whether it catapults you into losing a lot of weight um don't know but you will lose fat and you will put on muscle and that's really important too and so don't worry so much about the weight worry about your health first and foremost and then your body composition as a distance second and never do you worry about the scale because scale says nothing about body composition and certainly doesn't say anything about your health so those are the most important things but yeah exercise is a great idea I think that would be good don't do like crazy amounts of cardio and just jogging endlessly um because that can raise cortisol and actually make things a bit more stubborn but um uh high intensity very high intensity exercises like sprinting if you can obviously um and and uh weightlifting resistance exercises those are those are great little cardio to warm up or something like that and then getting some more high-intensity stuff and that's where you get get better results"

    "body": "hi doctor can you please discuss coming off allopurinol while on Carnivore well if you're not having I mean Al allopurinol is typically prescribed for gout and so if you're not having a gouty attack then you know you can you can try coming off and and see how you go the uh some people get freaked out because early on when people go on any ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet their uric acid levels go up and that's because ketones and uric acid compete for elimination in the kidneys and so if you have if you're not keto adapted and you have very high ketones because you're not using them very well you're going to spill some out in your urine and that's going to that's going to block out some of the uric acid and so you're just going to have a bit more that doesn't mean you're going to get gout there's actually very weak association between serum uric acid levels and uric acid gout now remember there's five kinds of gout only one of them is uric acid now they call the other four pseudo gout but they used to be called gout and one of those causes were oxalates the only way to tell the difference those five different causes is by sticking a big old needle into that joint and taking out an aspirate and and testing it no one does this because it's already horribly painful they're not going to stick in needle it and make it more painful so they just say it's it's uric acid has to be there's nothing else it could possibly be and and give you allopurinol and that's of course wrong you know it's it's only 20% chance that it's um that it's uh uric acid and again lowering uric acid levels in the serum doesn't necessarily do anything for the uric acid in your joints if indeed there's any uric acid in your joints so you might see your uric acid come up in your serum but after a few months several months you'll see the uric acid levels come back down to normal levels as you become keto adapted and your body uses those ketones more effectively and you don't start and you don't spill them out in your urine this is why people that have been in a ketogenic state for a long time they don't find any urine ketones which is why that's not a very good marker of being in ketosis or not because you're not supposed to spill out ketones in your urine you're wasting energy this is why the whole thermodynamics calories in calories out you can't destroy energy yeah but can piss it out right and so if you're peeing out glucose and peeing out ketones you are literally peeing out energy and that energy does not get stored type 1 diabetics if you don't have insulin you eat 50,000 calories a day 100,000 calories a day 50 billion calories a day if you don't have insulin you will not store fat period right and you'll pee it out right you'll pee out glucose you pe out ketones so uh yeah you're not destroying the energy it doesn't disappear goes down the toilet bowl so um if you are well adapted into into a ketogenic diet your uric acid level should be down fairly normally anyway allopurinol isn't probably going to be very useful some people find if they have gou they may have a a flare up or two in the early stages of converting to a keto carnivore diet so maybe if you feel more comfortable doing it stay on your allopurinol for a few months make sure that you're not having any outbursts or out or flareups and if you're not and you're feeling good then you can you can try coming off of them and uh you know if you're concerned about it you can always ask your doctor but um you know allopurinol is not like you know these these psychoactive medications that you have to be slowly weaned off of them um and so you know it's something that's uh if if you don't need it anymore is is very easy to to come off of so I basically what I generally recommend is you know work with your doctor but if you if you've gone several you know few months several months without any sort of gouty attacks that's a perfectly reasonable time to to talk to your doctor about you know coming off of those sorts of medications to see if you even need them at all and so that's what I would do"

    "body": "member says is it possible to taper off levythoroxine and never be on it again what sort of labs should I do when I'm on Carnival diet thank you yeah absolutely I I have tons of patients that have come off um their levythoroxine other thyroid medications and and then you you'll obviously see a lot of people discussing their own um Journey with with um thyroid issues and that they come off these medications as well so you just you just do the normal uh thyroid panels Le thyroxine is T4 T4 converts into T3 which is more active form um most doctors only check TSH and if that's what they consider normal then they don't check anything else or maybe they'll check T4 make sure that's okay too and um otherwise they don't check further on but I think it's important to check T3 also so you check your free T3 to make sure that you're converting T4 into T3 and you're actually getting enough of that so if you're feeling good you're feeling great you check your levels if they're really really good and you know maybe you know talk to your doctor about you know reducing your dose and uh you see you know how you're doing in in uh you know a month or so to six weeks and you check your levels and yeah your body's able to to maintain and and do really well you're feeling well you don't feel like there's any problems your T3 is great your T4 is great and um then it's okay you come off a little more and you come off a little more and a lot of people can can eliminate out their need for levythoroxine however not everybody can if you've had different sorts of issues like Hashimoto thyroiditis which is way more common than people people uh believe because they don't check for it until it's an absolute disaster uh but I I check much more uh early on because you know why would I wait for something to be a complete disaster before I I do anything I want to know what's coming so that I can prevent it from becoming a disaster and so I find that way more cases of of Hashimoto um than uh than other people do so you know you you just and a Hashimoto is an autoimmune disease that attacks the thyroid and can can permanently damage and eventually destroy it and you have to get your thyroid taken out and you be on medications for the rest of your life so if you had permanent damage done to your thyroid from Hashimoto or whatever then you know your body's going to could recover to a certain degree but it may not be able to recover fully and so that's just something you you just need to be con you know cognitive of and cognizant of and um and you may just need to be on a bit of thyroid medication but that's how you do it you just you test so you test your your thyroid markers see how you do if you're doing great and you you you and your doctor are happy to lower the dose you lower the dose you check it again in a month see where you're at check it first thing in the morning fasting from the night before couple glasses of water in the morning don't take any coffee pills tea this and the other don't take your thyroid medication till after you get the test um and uh you know no stress um poor sleep exercise or sexual activity for 48 hours before your test this these actually can dramatically change your blood results especially for the different hormones and and thyroids no different so I would check all of those you could even check uh your reverse T3 which can counteract the effects of T3 and basically make it less uh less useful in your body and so someone has Normal T3 but they have very elevated reverse T3 they may be functionally uh hypothyroid is it basically just slows down your metabolism it's it's a it's a mechanism for your body to slow down your metabolism people that bass for way too long and just starving themselves your body just goes okay we need to slow this down and that's why I don't tell people to fast I tell people to eat you eat food you don't you don't tell your body you're in a famine you let your body know you're definitely not in a famine and keep your metabolism brought up want to encourage your metabolism not suppress your metabolism so uh good luck with that and hope that goes well"

    "body": "member says I'm switching my dog from half process to a raw carnivore diet to reverse his osteosarcoma vet says he has three months left can this cure his cancer well I'm very sorry to hear about your dog is very very very sad um it's you know can is a you know anop term right so I mean it can it could just like it could for other people as well the same same cancer biology applies to dog cancers as it does to human cancers which are the damaged mitochondria and dysfunctional metab cellular energy metabolism and so it's um is uh very much the case that that uh they should respond in a similar fashion when you limit and remove carbohydrates and things like that this is going to limit the amount of energy available to the cancer cells and just like they will in in human cancer cells once you have cancer that's a severe dysfunction of these cells and it's not always possible to reverse that uh it's it's a hard struggle it's a hard fight and um you know so you know doing surgeries and and different things like that are you know potentially something that can help and um but you know getting back on a normal animal diet is really important because you know it cancer is not a natural thing it's a very unnatural thing it's a pathological thing and so you know getting back onto a normal diet I I I don't think there's there's no doubt in my mind that um that these cancers are caused by the food that we're feeding dogs cats and ourselves I don't I don't think for a second that it's um it's just ah just is what it is it's genetic it's just from intensive breeding no it's complete nonsense it's from it's from environmental insults and the most impact well the most regular frequent and I would say impactful uh environmental um insults that we provide ourselves and our pets are the is the food that we eat because we doing that every day and we're do that all day every day but there are other things that we get exposed to as well that can do that as well so this is this is a big first step in the right direction and I think it could help him but you know we I can't say anything for sure I think it's a very good idea to switch to a raw meat diet for your dog get rid of everything else and just you know and and even if he can't you know completely get through this he's going to be a lot healthier and happier uh for the time that he has remaining anyway and that's um you know that's not a small thing so good luck with that I hope he does well"

    "body": "member says thoughts on doing dry fasting one meal a day greater fat loss thoughts on kefir uh been doing 7030 and don't hit my body weight in protein will I lose muscle um yeah you need to get you need to get a certain amount of of protein per kilo you know like 1.5 grams of protein per kilo more it's actually you know um can be good too just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you'll hit your Macros you'll hit your your body's requirements for these sorts of things very easily um dry fasting omad um I I think you just eat fatty meat till it stops tasting good and if you do that uh at least at night typically people only want to eat once a day um I don't I don't think there's any necessarily benefit of not drinking any water during that time either and if you look at animals in the wild they're not eating a couple mouthfuls of grass drinking water eating some grass drinking water eating some grass drinking some water or eating some gazelle drinking some water eating some gazelle drinking some water uh they're very separate you know they they camel up they tank up on the water and they tank up on food when and as it becomes available so sorry it's a bit of noise so um you know I I don't I I think it's a better idea to not drink water around um around Meal Time times because you're going to dilute the stomach acid and digestive enzymes and you're just going to fill up physically fill up that space in your stomach that you know you you need for food so um there are people that argue that having a lot of water at one time as opposed to bits of water throughout the day um and just having the same amount of water by those two different mechanisms but having it you know big big uh volume at a time is is better for for certain reasons probably makes sense from a you know from a nature point of view you come across a a river and you you you drink as much as you can and you move on with your life um so it's uh you know that's something that you could do but I wouldn't I wouldn't do that at meal time though I would do that separately from that I don't think it's gonna increase your fat loss to do one or the other you know I think omad can help it's but your your insulin is going to be your insulin blood sugar going to be fairly low anyway your ketones are going to be up but there is an argument for that eating that one meal a day that um that can you know keep your insulin blood sugar in in nice no low normal levels as long as possible and um but I still think you need to eat enough because you're undereating you're going to slower your metabolism and you're actually going to stall your weight loss and fat loss in particular and so just just eat that fatty meat till it stops tasting good and that's more than once a day and it's more than once a day day but if you do eat a big old fatty meal of meat and you eat until you get a bite when it's just like that just doesn't taste good anymore typically you don't need to eat more than once a day unless you're working out heavily and your body really wants to put on muscle and put on weight and so you know that's um you know so that's that's probably you know from The Sounds you were trying to lose weight not put on weight so I I would imagine that just eating one big meal a day is going to be perfectly fine but if it's not your body wants more just eat more just don't split up your meal eat until it stops tasting good get a big big go at it and um and that's it uh I wouldn't I I I tend to avoid uh Dairy even Kefir um it's it can be pro-inflammatory and um and it still has carbs you know there's there's it's not like oh it's all fermented like yeah it's fermented and so some of the carbs are gone but if you look on the bottle almost all of them will have about half the carbs of milk maybe a bit less but a lot of the ones I've seen are about half the carbs of milk um and uh yeah so hopefully that answered all your questions"

    "body": "member says is it true that a large amount of B12 can help with Parkinson's I suffer from essential tremors and vocal trimers and just wondering if B12 would help well it's not really to do with Parkinson's it just has to do with mation of your axons and your nerves um B12 is essential for all sorts of different processes in your body and DNA uh synthesis and replication and so if you are if you have low too low numbers amounts of B12 then you're just not going to be able to to replicate your cells and stem cells aren't going to be as active and you're you're not going to have as many blood cells you're not going to be as healthy you're not gonna be able to myelinate your axons and if you can't mate your axons properly they're not going to be as healthy they're not going to be as be able to fire as quickly and so your brain isn't going to be able to communicate as well and you're not as healthy so you need to have adequate levels of B12 so it's not large amounts it's the right amount so in America you want to be between 1100 and 1600 on your B12 in other parts of the world you want to be that would be PS per milliliter I believe is a US unit and then um yeah pams per Mill I'm pretty sure and then elsewhere in the world it's like P moles per liter uh pea moles per liter you want 800 to 1200 pag GRS per milliliter you want uh 1100 to 1,600 for B12 and that's that's the optimal range that's the ideal range and Below you know 540 600 call it for peagrams per milliliter in the US numbers that can actually be low enough you can cause demalation and actually get nerve damage and Below 400 for picamoles per liter um can actually do that as well and and so that's very important the Oxford study in 2008 showed that uh levels of B12 basically below that um they did serial MRIs every every year and after five years they're brain shrink by 5% which is crazy and so it's very important and so if you want your brain and your nervous system to work properly you need all the nutrients that required and b12 is a very very essential one but because the because everybody's low on B12 now the reference ranges have just gone lower and lower oh but that's in our range so that's normal well your range is stupid your range is is a marker of the average person the average person is sick so that's not a good good reference range so those are the reference ranges I use in my Clinic um and that's why and so uh it can absolutely help with neurological function yes is it's not going to cure Parkinson's though but it will uh help your nerves be properly melinated and help your body be healthy but you need Vitamin D3 and you need choline and you need carnitine and you need DHA and you need EPA and you need to reduce inflammation and you need to be in ketosis and all these other sorts of things it they're all parts of a massive puzzle of uh Optimal Health so good luck with that"

    "body": "member says please explain why A1C is high on a carnivore diet mine dropped from 6.3 to 6.2 a little disappointed uh thank you for what you do well you just need first of all need you know to give these things time um A1C is a really blunt instrument right so it's just sort of giving you you know some uh level of of glycation and we're assuming that means that it's that it's um a 3-month turnover because that's the average that we've assigned to red blood cells that this is this is sort of typically how long they live but it's not always how long they live if you're eating a bunch of seed oils or plant steroids they'll actually uh live shorter and so you'll get an artificially low hba1c and then you get rid of those and all of a sudden they're living longer you haven't done anything else differently but now your hba1c is higher well that's different but your blood daily blood glucose is exactly the same or you're on a carnivore diet and you're much healthier and they're living longer than three months well then you can have an artificially high but your blood sugar is still exactly the same so check this against your like a like a c like um finger prick test you know just check what you going if you're in 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 don't just ignore your hba1c um because it's just it's just trying to give you an estimated average but it's an estimated average if and only if your red blood cells are living three months exactly and if they're not then it's not accurate and then it doesn't matter so just remember that and um and uh don't worry about it too much you know if you're if you're diabetic and you're still requiring and you're still insulin resistant and and all these sorts of things and you know uh you may still need to be on medications for a certain period of time until your blood sugar comes down to normal levels without medications um if you're very stressed you're getting poor sleep your cortisol is going to go up your blood sugar is going to go up your hb1c is going to go up and so those are all things you need to remember as well and and yeah you know and and lastly if you if you're eating like a lot of really lean meat then you know you're going to have more protein in your body needs and you're going to convert that over um you know to energy and you're going to convert that into glucose and you're going to then store that into fat um and so you can have a sort of transient blips in your blood sugar and you know potentially raise your your hb1c but you know that's that's it's not as common as the other things you know and so it's not like you're going to get like massive massive spikes in your blood sugar from from eating too much protein you're just not going to do that but um unless you're eating it with carbs you'll have a bigger spike in in blood sugar uh from protein if you're eating them with carbs uh but yeah so so that's why I wouldn't worry too much about it check your blood sugar on a daily basis if that's if that's a concern and um and focus on the other thing stress sleep um averaging four to five hours sleep at night for 7even days in a row can give you pre-diabetes it's that that significant and it's that quick so um you know just be just be mindful of that"

    "body": "hi Dr chaffy could you delve into the mental health effects of the diet I'm particularly interested in the Flow State and whether nootropics like modafinil would enhance or be detrimental you know I I I tend to steer clear of those um you know they you know I mean yeah they can keep you bright they keep you alert you know I I know a lot of people residency that use these so they can you know they they work all night and they're on call and they're exhausted and then they they take some modafinil and they can study all day and then they just crash um it's not good for you you know you're you're forcing your body your brain to be awake when it doesn't want to be um you know it it's um you know how they were using it because they were working all night and then studying all day and it's like terrible idea but um um I don't think you need it you know when when you're when you're on a carnivore diet you're in a state of ketosis your ketones are up your brain's running on ketones you were firing on all cylinders all the time you don't you don't need to adulterate that and when you do adulterate that you become sort of used to that and U you know and you know this going back to you know undergrad psychology days but the the state of mind you're in like if you're drinking taking a lot of caffeine as you're studying you should take caffeine when you're doing your test because you want to be in the same mindset when you were studying as when you're taking your test so if you're doing everything on modafinil you kind of you know you're going to be you know when you when you don't take modafinil later then maybe you're not going to be as proficient at something um I I just don't I don't think those things are are a great idea and I don't think that they're adding I mean you could get you can get better results short term but is this is this providing long-term benefit is this helping you longterm is this making your brain better and function better long term I don't think so and I and there not really any good uh evidence that suggest that these sorts of things will uh like modafinil will just make your brain work better long term or else everybody would be on this stuff it would just be over the counter and just be said everyone take this you know um it's uh it's restricted you know and I think there's a good reason for that um it's only people like doing shift work that just like they're on all sorts of different crazy sleep schedules and they're they're wake they have to adjust their body clocks at different times and they're just exhausted all the time and they need to take something to get them through work so um I don't think it I don't think it's G to I mean if you if you were sort of tired or out of it or whatever and you you took it like yeah you'd have you'd have better mental Clarity and energy and you can probably get some stuff done that day I don't think it's going to help you long term and if you're getting enough sleep and you're exercising and you're you're addressing stress levels and you're eating a lot of fat you're good ketosis your brain's going to work amazingly well and you'll be in that flow State all the time and you wouldn't need to take medications like that at least not from my experience and not from speaking to others"
