    "body": "member asks hey Doc if we are true carnivores why are we able to metabolize carbs sugar or um develop the ability to do so in the first place thanks uh well look we weren we weren't always carnivores we had the ability to to eat these sorts of things historically and does give a survival Advantage because we have we can eat other things we can survive on them um and when when you're looking at at things in evolutionary terms you don't lose the ability to do something unless it confers a survival advantage to do so so because that's just that's just how that works because the ones that don't have that trait tend to die off and they tend not to have kids and so it's that trait that actually is a big survival Advantage so you know making having the ability to break down carbs and sugars and and absorb them is is uh you know an advantage to anybody because if you don't have that ability then you you're limiting more resources and um in a famine period you're trying to eat something else you know that's not that great but you know pretty much any animal can absorb simple carbohydrates you know not all animals make amales but most of them do and um and so they can still break down starches some don't have amalis in their saliva but they can make it from their pancreas and either way uh they can they can absorb they can absorb carbohydrate simple carbohydrates like simple sugars and and there are carbohydrates in meat I mean there's glycogen in meat and and so you actually do get these things on a carnivore diet so you actually do need this stuff uh on a carnivore diet because there are carbohydrates that you're going to break down and absorb as well it's just not the mass quantities of these things that that we see in you know processed carbs or you know starchy vegetables and things like that or fruit you know very sweet um it unnaturally sweet fruit that we've we've uh arranged you know and breed and and intensively bread to be much more sweet so plenty of animals do plenty of carnivores do still have that ability we're no exception it does confer a survival advantage to to be able to eat potatoes and survive um it's just not it's just not optimal but also there are carbohydrates and meat and so you need that ability there too break down the glycogen and uh and certainly absorb the simple sugars and you know I mean look at you look at your cells I mean there's there are carbohydrate components to uh many proteins to many receptors to many parts of your cell to many parts of of the animal and so that's important you know that's important to be able to contend with that break it down and absorb it so yeah that's not actually abnormal um you know i' I've seen some things where they say that that you know like lions and big cats don't make amylase in their saliva but that doesn't mean they don't make it in their pancreas and I've seen other ones that said that they do so I I don't know about that I think it's generally generally accepted that they they don't but I have actually seen some that that said that they did so you know it's um either way it doesn't really matter if we have you had that ability because we were herbivorous before you don't lose that trait unless there's a survival advantage to lose that trait um but also I mean even herbivores I mean look at gorillas you know they're they're not eating carbs they're not they're not eating like roots and tubers and starchy vegetables they're eating fiber and that fiber you know amylase won't break that down you know it won't won't do any of that it's um the bacteria in their gut that is in their in their hind gut which is their cecum which is very very very long or equivalent is the appendix because that was a survival advantage to lose that we did have a very elongated cecum presumably and then that shrunk down to almost nothing because that's very energy dependent and so we traded our gut length for our brain size and we needed more nutrient-dense food uh meat and so we that did uh give a survival advantage to lose that big useless gut that we we weren't using anymore um and so we have a much smaller one so they have a big hind gut and the bacteria eat the fiber because because it's only bacteria and protozoa and these single cell organisms that can even make cellul termites don't even make cellulase it's the protozoa in their gut that eats the the cell cellulose and produce cellulase and as a byproduct they produce saturated fat and then the microorganisms die off and they get absorbed as protein so do gorillas have amylase do gorillas have the ability to break these things down why they don't need it they're absorbing saturated fat and protein so it's the same thing you know we need fat and protein lions need fat and protein gorillas need fat and protein and we get those from our food source that's really the main thing some of us have some amylase some of us don't doesn't really matter you still just need fat and protein that's the main thing"

    "body": "member says GF been trying to increase meat girlfriends has been trying to increase meat but says she has low appetite for red meat and feels sick when eating only meat um even one meal any recommendations yeah you look we we're conditioned to think that this is really bad for us women especially have have um taking that to heart um and uh there's some seems to be some sort of psychological reason for that that you know they're just more much more um much more likely they're just much more coachable and people say this too it's just like you when you're when you're coaching girls like they they really pay attention they really listen they try to try to do what you you tell them to do and like guys just sort do whatever the hell they want so you don't have as as much coachability in some guys and and so you have to you know that's why you know being being able to learn being able to be coachable is is uh is a good trait you know that coaches look for in young athletes um and so but you know girls women seem to have taken that and saying okay well this is bad for me I'm not going to do that okay makes sense and if you believe that that's the that's the right thing to do uh guys are a bit more headstrong like yeah screw that and so I like it I enjoy it so I'm just going to do it a bit more hedonistic and um that can be good in this circumstance when you're being lied to and you're just trusting your your Natural Instincts and the other side of it is that it could be very bad because you end up doing things that are bad uh in any case we train ourselves and condition ourselves to think that meat's bad and to think that um and to think that Fat's bad and we and we have a psychosomatic reaction where it just it makes us physically ill I would get that in my late 30s when I knew that this was the right way to go when I would eat fat I just couldn't do it and I had to slowly work myself into it and so that that's what you do just ease into it you know it's uh just just a little bit more a little bit more doesn't have to eat if it doesn't taste good if she feels unwell don't eat that's fine your body's your body can can tell you that if if meat doesn't taste good you're not hungry and you'll eat a lot less you don't need nearly as much and so you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good if you can't eat big chunks of fat you you cut a small piece of that fat off put it with the lean meat eat that together and say like okay that actually tastes good together and um and you can do that and you just recondition yourself and really decondition you know that programming you know that we had of listening to The Experts and never eat fat because Fat's so bad for you even though it has never been bad for ever in human existence um and then the argument goes like well but we weren't living all that long says who the Census Data didn't say that in the 1800s if you made it to adulthood you'd live you know s very similar length of time that we live now it's just average life expectancy from birth was 38 in 1850 because the infant mortality rate was so high and 50 years later it was a lot higher than that because INF morality or the total life expectancy from birth was a lot higher because it was um it was the infant mortality rate had had uh improved significantly and so um you know it's completely false oh people were just weren't living long enough in the 1800s and before that to uh to experience these diseases like really have you have you read a book because they were written by people and some of those people actually have um biographies and you can actually see like how long they lived you know how how old was Mark how old was Sam Adams when he died how old was was John Adams second president of the United States born in the mid 1700s died in the mid- 1800s he was 91 all the founding fathers look them up they're all in their 80s and 90s when they died Ben Franklin was 64 when the Revolutionary War broke out and then funny enough I I seem to recall that the minimum age required to even apply for the job of President of the United States was 35 is that well that's funny if everyone eyes at 35 that's funny age to set a minimum and I'm pretty sure we've had presidents in the 1700s and 1800s which is funny that because these these people are so smart and they know so much and surely they they'd look it up right and they'd understand that there's historical figures that we have clear documentation of that were much older than that and there's what was it Socrates is that who I'm thinking of who uh was in his 70s when they had to kill him and he was so sharp that it just pissed everyone off in Athens so they had to kill him by eating a plant by the way they made him drink Hemlock so I mean that's just nonsense that people weren't living long enough to um to experience these these diseases that's just ridiculous and I just spoke with a with a gentleman uh Dr Verma from India he's an Emergency Physician over in India and he said he treated a boy who's 17 years old came in with a heart attack 17y old kid had a heart attack right vegetarian by the way vegan vegetarian and of this mostly plant-based nation everyone says oh but and plants are so bad for us and meat is so good for us explain India India explains that you know 20 years ago the average person in India only ate five kilos of meat a year a year right I eat more than that in a week way more than that in a week you know and and um and then in the last 20 years it's actually dropped down to three kilos a year right and the metabolic disease rate has actually sprung up in that time it's gotten worse right um he said something it was like 30% of people had metabolic metabol syndrome and disease and 30% 30 30% of people in India had diabetes full-blown diagnosed diabetes and this is very you know there a lot of people living rurally they may I ever get that diagnosis I me I have access to healthcare so diagnosed diabetes 30% that's three times the diabetes rate of America is slovenly Americans who just eat a whole bunch of processed meat and processed foods and and red meat oh you know these guys are eating three kilos a year a year and a lot of them aren't eating any and 30% they have three times higher uh diabetes rates so it's just flat out ridiculous that that people even make these contentions they're either complete Liars or just too stupid to to uh just too too stupid to to take any advice from anyway either way these are not people that you need to listen to if they're so flagrantly incorrect by their either intentionally or because their brains don't work that like this is this is no one you want to take advice from anything else you know I mean people get things wrong and that's fine you know and and so you know I just I agree with some things that people say and I disagree with other things that they say um that doesn't mean that I hate them you know broke clock is right twice a day you know but um but some people when they get these things so intensely wrong it's so easy to look up it's um you know it's just like okay well what else are you phing in you know like we just can't really we just can't really trust anything you say at this point like Ancel Keys the guys are know fraud he was defrauding people for the majority of his career when did that start when was he when did he start being a sellout I mean presumably had to do some good work in order to sell his reputation and integrity but when did that start can you trust anything he did because he's unscrupulous maybe he cut corners on other things maybe he just did things and published them just so he could just so he could get some recognition fits the profile you know there people with Alzheimer's they say well it's this beta Amyloid plaque that's what doing there's there's this there's a l paper that came out you know supposedly proving that showing that and turned out it was total fraud it was total garbage and that just came out last year so no that has nothing to do with it and they just defrauded people just so they could get the reputation just so they could publish a landmark paper and get their name on the map and um and you know get everyone tenure and everyone's all happy and patting each other's back and now they've got tenure so can't get rid of them but it's fraud it's absolute fraud and uh so when when did the fraud start with with Ancel Keys who knows just don't trust anything he says don't trust anything he does and um you know and uh and the same thing with these sorts of things so long story short we've been conditioned to think something that is inherently untrue and we're getting psychosomatic responses as a result of that so just lead into it just just ease into it you know eat what tastes good stop eating when it doesn't taste good feeling a bit nauseous just stop you know if if she has to sort of do a slower transition and include some other stuff too just eating more fatty meat and less of the other stuff is already going to make a big difference and if you start easing into that and eating more and more meat and getting used to the fat you know eventually she might be able to just drop everything else you know but don't you know you don't want to force it you know because you know it might be that she just goes too much and goes no no no no no I'm not doing this and just mentally can't get her head around it and then you know might might just uh not really want to do it and not be motivated to do it so you know just it's okay it's okay to ease into these things too so good luck to to t o both of you"

    "body": "member asks will intermittent fasting help me lose weight while on Carnivore um yes and no because the thing is is that most of the time you'll you'll naturally be doing something along those lines where you'll be eating in a in a shorter amount of window or maybe only once a day I typically eat once a day twice a day at most um if I'm working out especially and um so that that people say like oh well you're intermittent fasting you're doing that it's like well no I'm not because what fasting is is intentionally withholding food from uh when you're hungry and you want to eat but you're like no I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm going to abstain that's what fasting is just not being hungry is just not being hungry you know if I'm only hungry once a day and I eat once a day and I'm fine that's not fasting but it looks like it it looks like you're intermittent fasting so that's so that's the the yes part of it the no part of it is if you're intentionally withholding food and you continually do that and you do that you know day after day after day you're going to slow your metabolism down you can actually stall weight loss and again it's not weight loss it's fat loss that you're looking for you're not looking for weight loss you don't want to lose muscle and bone you want to lose fat and so if you lose fat but you put on muscle and bone you're not going to lose weight and so you need to remember that and uh quite often when people are having a stall it's not actually a stall it's that they're working out and they're replacing their fat with the muscle and bone uh then you can do things like take o zic that horrible poison that's been foed across the planet um again to make billions and billions and billions of dollars the research on OIC for weight loss by their own estimate was that you lose weight generally because you felt so sick and just nauseated you just couldn't eat and then after that after about two years that that uh those symptoms would go away your appetite would come back and because you just been eating just little bits of chocolate and candy the whole time because you couldn't stomach anything else um and you basically just starved yourself for the last two years now you have horrific eating habits and uh and your appetite comes back and then you eat a whole bunch of garbage and then you end up putting on more weight than you lost initially and the weight that you lost wasn't just fat what they showed was that a large portion of this was actually lean body mass was muscle mass and bone density which you just can't afford to lose at any point in your life especially when we get into to middle and late age uh but I mean kids I why would you Jesus why would you do that to kids so use a lot of lose a lot of lean body mass and then so you're losing weight but you're not losing the weight that's healthy you're losing really un you're losing uh weight that is very unhealthy to lose and then when you put weight back on because you have such horrible eating habits you put on fat you're not getting back the muscle and bone you're just getting back fat you're get back more fat than the muscle and bone that you lost so after two years people tended to regain more weight than they lost um so that's not good so it's not about weight it's about body composition and really it's about health so you just eat what's healthy for you and and the the body composition comes as a result of that and that just happens down the road that's a consequence that's a secondary outcome the primary outcome is your health that's what the most important part of this is and um and if you if you intentionally withhold meals and intentionally withhold from eating you will slow down your metabolism and you can stall and you can actually start gaining weight eating less you know bariatric surgeons will tell you that like women in particular if they eat less than 1,200 calories a day they will not lose weight so they have to eat a minimum threshold to actually be able to for their body to actually let go and um and and and let go of that excess fat because they they're storing it because like no we're going to die we need to save this and because we're trying to save you so your body doesn't it's not a conscious being it just it just it's taking inputs right so the input is that there's no food available okay we're in a famine we're going to shut it down and so that's what's going to happen so no I wouldn't do that I would just eat until fatty meat stops tasting good if that's once a day it's once a day if that's twice a day it's twice a day if that's 32 times a day it's 32 times a day it won't be you eat until you get that bite that tastes like cardboard typically when people are losing weight that's one going to be once a day twice at the outside but just make sure you're getting it up enough fatty meat until it stops tasting good you generally won't eat all that much and you'll you'll look like you're intermittent fasting but you won't actually be fasting you'll just be eating when you're hungry and that's what you do and that that's the other thing you know when when you you do these tricks and gimmicks and you're fasting and starving and doing all these sorts of things eventually you get to the end of it and you just go okay well something's got to change because this isn't sustainable or the OIC and you're losing weight and now your your appetite comes back and now what happens now your pattern of behavior and your and and how your your functioning is now in congruent with a healthy lifestyle whereas if you're just eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good you can do that at any day at any point at any stage in your life because at different times you're going to need more or less and if you're just listening to your body and eating until it stops tasting good your body's going to tell you what it needs today it needs 4,000 calories tomorrow it needs 3,000 next day it needs 4,000 now it needs 2,000 now it needs 5,000 it doesn't matter it's going to change on different on different days if you're losing fat your body eventually gets down to a stable body fat percentage you're going to need more that's all there is to it because you're not you're not going to be going on your fat stores anymore you need to actually get more energy and and nutrients in to run your body and maintain your your body fat and so that's what you do and your appetite goes up and so by the time you get to that stable point now you're you have the eating habits and the lifestyle that are going to be conducive to perpetuate that right so that's really important to just uh lay down patterns of behavior that you're going to be able to continue and perpetuate for the rest of your life to continue to get maximal results and the most benefit out of um out of your uh out of your life and on your health that actually changes your odor and so that can be a thing too it's not necessarily butter and Tallow it could be because your hormones are changing that's affecting way your body smells and so uh that's not necessarily A Bad Thing butter smells nice that's just my opinion but I'm not wrong and and so I you know it may be different but it's it's probably not that much of an issue"
