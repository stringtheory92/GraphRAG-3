        "body": "okay hello everyone thank you for joining today's uh live Q&A session on February 1st in America February 2nd in Australia and parts of the rest of the world so thank you all very much for joining um just had a a question that popped up before I came on so I wanted to address that first is from Carmen gusen and she says she's a 44 old female on cornivore diet for 60 days and includes lots of fat is it normal to pass stool two to three times a month I've been uncomfortable in my back and stomach magnesium helps as a laxative but I don't want to be taking it all the time yeah it is normal um two to three times a month is is slightly below average for a lot of people however it just depends on how much gristle that you're eating if you like the connective tissue that tough sort of gristly stuff that's harder for our body to break down and that um and that can you know cause more bulk in the stools and so if you're if you're stripping that stuff out and just having the soft fat and the soft muscle and organs and things like that and adding butter then you'll have much less residue and almost nothing will come out that was the idea of the Salsbury steak early on was that you you take out the gristle so that you basically completely rest your bowel because there's some people with very serious um gut issues and they need to be very careful with that so that's um that is normal it it needs to be soft though if it's not soft then even though you're eating a lot of fat you're not eating enough fat so if you eat um enough fat then your stools will be soft doesn't matter how long it takes so that's a good rule of thumb if your if your stools are ever hard by definition you are not eating enough fat because eventually you'll eat enough fat and you'll get diarrhea right so you you there is a gradient there and most people are eating a lot more fat than they've ever eaten in their entire life and that seems pretty wild but sometimes it's not actually enough we need a lot of fat and so your body is going to absorb out all the fat that it needs and then it is not going to absorb anymore it can only absorb a certain amount and then the rest goes out in your sto ols keeping that soft so that's what to look for was a"

        "body": "e line uh pror thank you so much for the very generous e line uh pror thank you so much for the very generous Super Chat that's very kind of you they say how can I gain body fat I didn't that's a new one um I did the diet with uh too little fat for months and now even though I have started eating uh with a whole lot with a lot of fat I always feel super low energy uh tired and reactive I think my body ran out of store fat I am super slender eating high carb high fat for a while question mark um I don't I don't think well if you want you you can certainly put on fat if you if you eat carbs you'll raise your insulin you raise your blood sugar and you you will store fat so that that will do that is that going to be in your best interest I don't I don't think that it would be you know if you want to do that if you wanted to do that short term to build up your body fat fine but then if you come off of it then you're going to lose that body fat and you're going to be in the same position um you know generally if you are losing more fat than you want uh you need to eat more it's not just about eating more fat it's about eating more overall it's just about eating enough overall if it is very easy to undereat on a cornivore diet and so you know if you if you are not careful you can you know you can run into some problems I did in my early 20s I didn't have anybody to tell me about any of this I had to figure this out on my own and it I didn't figure it out for for a while and so I got you know much much too skinny I was working out 6 eight hours a day every day and um it was just too much I mean I I lost you know a lot more weight than I wanted to and I had to perform at a very high level and so you know it was taking a lot out of my body um so I eventually figured out even though I'm not hungry I don't feel hungry I'm just not eating enough I'm definitely not eating enough I started eating more and so you just have to keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good you have to do this probably for you i' Tred doing this twice a day another thing is that if you do eat during the day or breakfast or at lunch and you eat until you're full you're going to be tired afterwards and that can be a problem for people because they they just feel very lethargic and it's not it's not very fun and they can't uh do their job properly they can't do what they have to do properly and they can't work out properly so if you're going to eat during the day you might want to eat smaller meals at night you want to try to get as much as you want as you can and just eat until it stops tasting good you don't have to get to the point you see some people say saying you have to get to a point where you're puking and you just feel disgust no you don't have to do that you just have to eat until your body stops telling you to keep eating right it will it eventually will say hey that's enough just stop now um and that will go by taste so if it tastes good you're hungry you need to keep eating and you need high fat so one to two grams of fat for every one gram of protein so it's a lot of fat and um so if you're looking at ground beef that would be 65% muscle meat 35% fat tissue that's about two to one fat to protein and that's what you need to go for egg yolks are two to one fat to protein for example the whole egg is slightly less than one gram of fat to one gram of protein so add butter if you're going to have eggs sort of thing and that's pretty much it I mean it's just that's the same problem I ran into I was I was I got very slender I got very lean and I just hit a point where my body just just couldn't handle it anymore and uh and I I had to just pick it up I had to pick up the amount that I was eating and I I work with athletes that run into the same thing they're like hey I'm losing too much weight I need to keep on my size for my for my Sport and um and uh you know and and we figure out how to get them extra meals here and there like you're going to lose a bit of weight early on anyway right but but you know that's just generally unhealthy weight that you want to get off but then you don't want to lose you know lean body mass and if you eat enough you won't so you got to eat enough so keep eating keep eating keep eating just make eating your job understand that after you eat you're going to get lethargic so try not to try to time it so you're not doing anything you know work or workout sort of wise um you know um you know you know shortly after you know you're going to have a big meal so later on the day you want to have I generally have my bigger meal because that's when you know I can just hang out chill out go to bed so just keep eating keep adding in uh fatty meat try to get to that one to two to one grams of fat to protein make sure your stools are soft and yeah just keep going I wouldn't I if you eat carbs you'll put on fat but you're not going to gain Health you're not going to do as well as you could you can absolutely put on healthy weight by just eating uh fatty meat and your body will want you at a certain body fat percentage but you should be good and energized and feeling good you shouldn't be losing more and more weight so just keep eating keep eating make it your job you just need to you know there's the idea of priming where you just you just fill pack yourself three times a day you know I don't think you need to go to the point of discomfort at all ever or non-enjoyment of of meat but it does give you a good idea of just how much your body's actually asking you for all right so you can try that at least twice a day you want to eat a lot okay at the and by the end of the day meat should not taste good anymore you should have leftovers if you finish your plate make more and keep eating until your body until you take a bite and just say that doesn't even taste good anymore and then you stop and then you leave those leftovers for tomo

        "body": "rrow hope that helps Patty thank you very much for the rrow hope that helps Patty thank you very much for the Super Chat uh any thoughts or concerns on using water fasting primarily for weight loss uh 72 hour 10day 30day fast uh nutrition longterm bad for metabolism uh add bone broth or liver Pros cons seven months carnivore yeah I think it I think long term it damages your your metabolism you know if you chronically undereat your body's just going to stop you know allowing you to use as much energy we saw this in the Minnesota uh starvation trials by our good friend anel keys who decided to starve people and see what happened uh this guy was like you know if he was if he was just in Germany he would have been in the nurmberg trials uh for for some of the stuff he did probably and um you know he um you know he you know found these people and they were basically eating so little calories that if it was just calories in calories out and this much calories equals this much body weight uh these people would have ceased to exist they would have lost more weight than they started with and so obviously that doesn't happen metabolism goes down and your body is saying oh gosh we're in a famine we need to suck this in right so less less coming in less going out that's all there is to it you know your body is very physically responsible it's not like you know if you if you cut your hours at work and you have less finances coming in last thing you want to do is blow out the credit card and just start S spending all your savings okay well we need to make this last as long as possible because who knows when things are going to change at work so that's what your body's doing and then when you come back and start eating all of a sudden your body's like okay well we need to we need to save this we that was really bad we didn't like that so let's let's still live in a meager means and we'll just put money in the bank which is your fat this is why people yo-yo di they starve themselves they undereat they they feel miserable the whole time they finally get to a point where actually plateaus and they're not really losing weight very well and they're like okay uh this isn't worth it I feel like hell and it tastes bad because I'm eating vegetables and they're disgusting and then say okay go back to eating whatever and then all of a sudden boom they gain back more weight than they than they had lost eating the exact same things they were eating you know when they before they started the diet and that's a metabolic issue so I don't think it's the the best thing for you can the body do it yes of course it can your body can survive doing that there are people that have done long fast there was a guy who fasted for like over a year uh in in Scotland I believe it was just took like a multivitamin every day like drank water and um you know the premise being that you know um other mammals hibernate and they they store up for the winter and then they they let it go but I don't think it's a great idea long term you know if someone were in that position and they had that ability to do that maybe but you know uh what are they doing after that what sort of nutrition plan are they going on after that and what's that going to do to them I think that um that you don't need to fast you get a most of the benefits the health benefits from fasting come from just not eating the wrong things which you will fully accomplish on a carnivore diet um you can have other problems too long-term fasting sometimes people have other problems you have skin hair and nail problems people lose their hair things like that um even getting 100 grams of protein a day uh can can stop some of these things like the hair loss that people see sometimes on long-term fasting I think the the only time that I would recommend people fasting is if they had a cancer diagnosis and they wanted to get their gki down their glucose Ketone index down as low as possible because this has been clinically shown to improve cancer outcomes and so that's what I would do personally if I you know develop cancer which I don't think that I will at this point because cancer is a mitochondrial disease and if you have healthy mitochondria you should not be able to develop uh cancer there's a lot of things that contribute to mitochondrial Health but I'm doing a lot of them that that are really good and so I don't I don't think that that's a big risk for me if it ever happens God forbid that's exactly what I'm going to do I'm going to fast for a prolonged period of time I'm going to make sure my gki is low as hell and uh and that's what I'm going to do but other than that just for weight loss I you could do it you can always starve yourself into a smaller dress size you would you know you will reduce your metabolism and then when you start eating again you will put on some fat again so what I think is a better thing to do is is you know the the tortoise you know and the hair side of things the tortoise side slow and steady wins the race just you know just keep doing the thing that is going to get you continual gains long term and is going to keep you um and is going to be sustainable long term this is something you can do for the rest of your life and eventually you will get down to a stable body fat percentage that your body is happy with depending on our age and our health and the previous however many decades of doing different things for our body it could be a different place you know may not get down to your your your 16y old body but some people do and so you just have to sort of see but I don't I don't think it's a great idea to to fast um for weight loss I mean you one day a week maybe you like you you playing around with your your metabolism though and so you know I I've seen some people just add in like one day of fasting like they'll eat six days a week basically and that seems to be a healthy an okay balance where they're not you know really damaging their metabolism all that much we're certainly capable of it you know all predators are capable of going you know many days without eating or weeks without eating we're designed for that just in case food is scarce but you know when it's available you know it's uh it 's good to eat Jeff lanton thank you very much for the"

        "body": "ng till it stop tasting good Allison thank you for the ng till it stop tasting good Allison thank you for the Super Chat am I getting enough vitamin D online diet in Winter generally people will it depends on the quality of fat that you're getting grass-fed butter will have a lot of vitamin D or should anyway if it's actually grass-fed and grass-fed and finished butter you know or or or grassfed finished animals like cows and sheep should have a lot of vitamin D even non-grass finished should have a lot of vitamin D as well but you can always check and so um it depends on the quality of fat depends on how much is so vitamin D3 is is a fat soluble vitamin it only exists in animal fat you don't get it in Plants vitamin D2 exists in Plants that's their version of it it's no good to us for for these purposes um not any great extent anyway and so you need the vitamin D3 which is an animal fat so generally people will get enough animal will get enough vitamin D3 in their animal fat you look at the Inuit all year round even in the in the height of summer in the North Pole it's just such an oblique angle they just they will never get enough sun exposure even if they were coming out of their parkas and things like that which you know I you know not really doing too often in the snow uh up north like that um you know they're just not they're just not getting any vitamin D from the Sun they they get it all from their food and they do just fine they actually have very healthy levels of vitamin D so you should you should get enough check you know it's um it's something that is uh very important it's very good for you it's very healthy it's very important to have enough of it so if you don't have enough of it basically if you're in the basically the the normal reference range is probably lower than you want if you're on the lower end of the reference range you're really lower than you want if you're below the reference range you have you have a bit of a crisis and you need to start supplementing uh with some some vitamin D supplements try to get ones in like NCT oil as opposed to soybean oil and canola oil and things like that because the little gel caps are often in those seed oils which you don't really want and take them with fatty food because that helps with absorption Susan De John can a person with severe kidney issues recover um they told him no beef well they told him wrong uh yes they absolutely can it depends again on what's causing the kidney issues so all these problems you know can it reverse certain things potentially it depends on what's causing the issues but excuse me but I I've seen I can't even tell you how many people with severe kidney issues very severe kidney issues stage four renal failure stage five renal failure couple people on on uh dialysis improve on dialysis which is not supposed to happen um and I've heard three accounts of people coming off dialysis and there's one who's working on it and he's actually improve increasing the amount of urine that he's making which is very promising can his kidneys recover fully he was vegan for many many many years and just destroyed his body destroyed his kidneys destroyed his neurological uh uh you know um you know organs and nerves and and um and was very very unwell for a long time but he's doing remarkably better now on a Carnival diet and even his his kidneys are starting to improve in the in in the fact that he's starting to make more urine we we don't know if it's going to be enough but it's very promising the the idea that meat or protein or beef in particular causes kidney dysfunction is a myth and it's unfortunately it's a myth that most doctors believe it was not taught to them in medical school it was just something that people just throw around they go oh yeah yeah yeah no that's a thing it's not a thing uh the studies actually show that higher protein diets actually improve kidney function and so getting rid of all these plant toxins that directly damage your kidney of course are going to help your kidney out so you're removing things that your body is uh doesn't want and damage your kidneys directly like oxalates and then you're improving you're increasing the amount of Natural Healthy nutrients that your body's going to use to rebuild and repair your kidneys so it's it's a very good place to be I don't know if it's going to help yourself or your friend or whoever has a kidney problems in that in this case but it should it should help most people do drink enough water as long as you're not on a fluid restriction from your doctor make sure you're drinking enough water that's very important as well um oh and also your Ura might go up your uric acid might go up those are both extremely good um antioxidants they're very good for you youra can go up but if your crine stays the same that has nothing to do with your kidney function that's not your kidney function getting worse some people will say oh your Ura is going up oh your kidneys are being damaged no you're not your creatin is staying the same so you know that's not that's not causing a problem so just just a caveat there that if the Ura does go up independent of the CR if then they both go up you know that could be that could be a clearance issue with the kidneys but if just the Ura goes up and the craty stays the same or goes down then that's not a kidney problem it could be um kidney's improving if those if those coratin levels are goi ng down so good luck with that uh DC um had a previous"

        "body": "or anything else really John Miller thank you for the or anything else really John Miller thank you for the Super Chat uh Dr chaffy I'm one month in I look leaner but my lifts are decreasing any tips on bulking lifting on Carnivore 3,000 calories a day right now so you know as I said you know calories really don't matter um because calories aren't aren't a thing you know it's heat energy if you have a cup of water at room temperature and you have a cup of water uh 20\u00b0 warmer that 20 degre warmer that has more calories you drink either one of those you're not going to gain weight right even though one has more calories that's not what weight is weight isn't is is atoms you know atoms have weight heat energy does not have weight so people that use calories as a metric um and really believe that oh it's calories calories and then that that the heat that escapes when you burn something that you eat that that's what matters is someone that really doesn't understand the very basic fundamentals of thermodynamics and biology because we're not combustion engines we are chemical factories we take in chemicals and we use them chemically they have complex chemical interactions and hormonal reactions and interactions in our body as well so I would not worry about calories um as far as as bulking and lifting you just need to eat enough you know if you if you are eating within five hours of lifting you're not going to have as good of lift it's one month in you you are still early days um so I just keep going you know I wouldn't worry too much about it just keep lifting maximally you will find that you're you're you know maybe you're not lifting as much your recovery is going to be a lot faster you can push yourself a lot more you know try to see how many sets you can do you'll do a hell of a lot more sets than you did before I'll guarantee you that especially if you're just doing meat just doing water no alcohols no pre-workout drinks definitely get rid of anything with artificial sweeteners that will that will kill your performance at the gym um even though before they helped your performance at the gym now they will hurt your performance at the gym um so I cut out all of that stuff just eat more fatty meat don't eat before you uh you work out you know you should if you can train fast to that the best if you have to eat during the day I would not eat within five hours of um of working out or you just won't have as good of a workout and just sort of eat a half meal just sort of take the edge off otherwise you're just going to get lethargic and you're have a terrible terrible lift um doesn't matter how many calories uh you're eating that could be enough that could be not enough again it's not calories um it may be that you're eating enough food it may be that you're not eating enough food eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good if you're working out your lifting weights you're probably going to have to do this more than once a day just to make sure that you're getting enough nutrients if you're going to eat during the day before your workouts make sure that you do it five hours before your workout and just do a half meal because if you eat to if you eat until you're full you're going to get lethargic and your body going to tell you to shut it down and rest and digest and and no t not do [Music] anymore Tammy deona thank you for the"

        "body": "t not do [Music] anymore Tammy deona thank you for the t not do [Music] anymore Tammy deona thank you for the Super Chat I've been doing a 20 hour fast how many days can I do this or should I um or or should I do this um 20-hour fast I mean that's just sort of basically you know you're just eating sort of once a day but you're eating every day I mean what a fast is is is that you're purposefully withholding food when your body's telling you to eat it so I eat once a day so I do 23-hour fasts every day but that's just because I'm not hungry you know or I'm at work and I can't eat so I eat when I get home um that's that's I don't consider that fasting fasting is when you're saying oh I really want to eat I have an opportunity to eat I'm not GNA eat right so if you're just if you're just eating once a day because that's what your body's telling you to do you just do that for the rest of your life um if you're withholding food you know why why why are you doing that is that is that important to do and the intermittent fasting and fasting in general is more important when you're when you're eating carbohydrates and your insulin's high because you you want your insulin to come down um you don't need that on a carnivore diet so or you have cancer or some sort of medical condition where you really want your ketones up and your glucose down you know then that matters um but you can keep doing you know just eating once a day and or just eating that small window as long as you're getting enough if you're getting enough food if you're getting enough nutrition when you're eating then that's fine you can do that indefinitely if that's not enough and you're losing too much weight then you need to add in more food you just have to eat more often and it and um you know if your body telling you to eat three times a day four times a day whatever that's fine it won't you know but if if it if it does just do it just eat um you need to make sure you're getting enough food and um but if your body's just telling you just to eat you know for those couple hours and then you're good for the rest of the day that's pretty typical and I wouldn't worry too much about that so Rob thank you very much for the"

        "body": "in a minute but um Walter in Salada thank you for the in a minute but um Walter in Salada thank you for the Super Chat my doctor says high cholesterol contributes to uh an A or aneurysm which is hereditary in my family tree on carnor my cholesterol raise and my cardiologists warn me to reduce my cholesterol there's zero evidence that cholesterol causes an aortic aneurysms there is zero evidence to show that cholesterol causes anything um besides good health and hormonal Health um because you need cholesterol for your hormonal health because they're made out of cholesterol so um this is just this is just a a very common myth that's bouncing around from Kellogg and the sugar cereals and things like that and and the and the sugar companies that have have paid off people to vilify cholesterol when it was actually sugar and their processed garbage that was actually hurting people you know that's the funny thing Kellogg you know did this because oh this is going to help people you know so we get them all plant-based and that's going to help people and end up destroying their lives and then they go we got to protect this and we got to blame we got to blame something else for it even though you know they know that their own product is causing harm but they started the product because they thought it was supposed to help people so yeah very Twisted you know when when you do things even even when you think you're doing them for the right motivations you know this the Nazis and all these other people they do these things because they think it's the right thing to do we look on and going well that's bloody evil uh but they were thinking wow this is a good thing there's that idiot from uh WF that guy what is his name um you know just he's just like the piure picture of a Nazi I mean this is Nazi thinking you know like well you know Freedom that's not really a thing if you cut someone in half you'll never find an you a molecule of freedom and liberty and all that sort of  this is this is this is people rationalizing and intellectualizing uh the slavery and subjugation and murder and genocide of their fellow man that's what that is that's what that mindset and philosophy are um and that's what um that's what the Nazis did that's what you know Lenin did and Stalin did and Ma did you know you you have to you have to break some eggs to to make an omelet you know we're making a perfect society and you know if people die they die but then we get we get a perfect Society after that you know hashtag worth it you know no it's not worth it you know any anything that you have to do that you have to murder people and kill them and take away their and and enslave them is of course not going to lead to a better Society to a better life for anybody except the  at the top but you know what you know in a free market they'd be more wealthy they'd be more powerful they'd have more uh you know they have more influence in their life they just they just want that power and that control over other people you know some people don't feel that their lives are are meaningful unless they've taken away the meaning from other people you know they think it's like a zero sum game for some reason uh but you know that's uh that's just wild tangent that I'm sorry I went on um to answer your question uh cholesterol just simply does not cause these problems you own a carnival diet your your cholesterol is going to go up your LDL is going to go up tell your doctor not to eat for five days and to check his cholesterol it's going to slam up why is that because it's a metabolic State change your body's running on fat and you need to mobilize fat around your body so that you can run on that fat and what does that cholesterol does cholesterol LDL cholesterol actually transports and moves fats around your body that's how that works and so if you're running on fat then obviously you need more more LDL cholesterol to mobilize that fat around your body you know this could be thought of part of that fat adaption process you need to make more LDL cholesterol to move more fat around your body so that you can run on it so that you have more of substrate to use you're bringing more fat from your OST tissue to your liver so that you can make blood sugar glycogen ketones right so you need to move that and and LDL cholesterol is what does that so if you stop eating for five days where you just stop eating carbohydrates low fat low carb your LDL is going to go up so just don't eat for five days you're not eating any fat and yet your cholesterol goes up is we make cholesterol this is not a foreign object this is not you know the these um you know these different chemicals and and Plastics and artificial garbage food that didn't exist a century ago that your doctor's telling you to go on instead of the healthiest thing that exists in the world we've been eating for 2 million years which is fatty meat um and never had these diseases they didn't exist before the 20th century they did they did weren't even in the literature At All by any other name before the 20th century unless you go back 4,000 years to the E Hebrew Papyrus when they were in Egypt when they were drinking a lot of beer and eating just tons and tons and tons of grains they knew what heart disease was they knew what diabetes was you know because they they were getting it from all the all the the wheat and U and bread that and beer that they were that they were eating and drinking so you know this is this is brand new to us but it has existed before when people were eating similar garbage cereal-based diet um and so you know it's um you know this is this is simply not uh you know the cause of heart disease this is just this is our normal physiology we make LDL we it's it's it's in there for a reason uh you can damage it you can uh you know sub subvert its normal actions and functions and maybe that contributes in some way to uh you know these problems but that's the smoke it's not the fire something else is causing that to happen in the first place and so you can you can die and Choke On Smoke and house fire and so the fire didn't kill you so the smoke killed you it's it can still be dangerous but the smoke wouldn't exist if the fire wasn't there does that make sense like this this is not this is the smoke it's not the fire this is the warning signal of something else happening it's not the thing itself this is something that can potentially cause harm and that's never been proven either but it's not the that's not the origin of it there's something else that's causing it to act inappropriate like if something if you you're glycating things you're damaging LDL it's turning into sdldl does that contribute in some way maybe maybe but maybe not it could very well be that it has nothing to do with it and it's just it's just a sign of something going wrong as opposed to something contributing to something going wrong but either way you're not going to have sdldl if you eat a normal high-fat carnivore diet you're only going to get that when you're eating um you know carbs and sugar and alcohol and Seed oils you're not going to get any other ways so watch my video called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease that's something that everybody should watch on a carnivore diet you need to know the facts about cholesterol and heart disease you need to know the history and the origins people just don't look back they just say oh well this is what it is everyone knows it no you you cannot do that you the origins of these things in so many things in medicine and in life are so bad the the basis for these things are just garbage Zoe harkham did her PhD on whether or not the original guidelines on limiting cholesterol and saturated fat and meat were Justified and she looked at all the evidence that was available at the time it was like absolutely not these were completely unjustifiable this was fraud we know this the person who was headed of the USDA made these guidelines he was bought and paid for by the sugar companies we had his contract he got paid $6,500 to to work for these bastards right that's equivalent about $55,000 now so this is this is this is a fraud it's a known fraud that's not up for debate that's not a question that's not a baseless accusation that's in the medical literature that's that their memos are published this is a matter of record at this point so you know this is not this is not what we've been told it was so you know you need to know the or origins of the stuff you need to know the history you need to know why this stuff is just not uh anything that you need to worry about at least in the way that they've that they've said can you glean some information off your cholesterol yeah absolutely is it anything close to what they said it was absolutely not I never look at people's cholesterol or my own cholesterol uh when when worried about heart disease and the last I'm looking at you know see if they have low HDL and high triglycerides which is a mark and a marker of metabolic dysfunction and metabolic syndrome increases your risk for developing heart disease by 600% LDL doesn't low HDL high triglycerides do diabetes increases by a th% smoking by around the same so you know that's the only thing I would care about in someone's cholesterol I LDL cholesterol is associated with longevity total cholesterol is associated with longevity they have inverse relationships with cardiovascular disease heart attacks and strokes so uh I don't consider high cholesterol a height you know that's an arbitrary you know as as bar k would say a value judgment someone has just said ah this is what we say is high this is what's low based on on what based on on who you know that's that's someone made that arbitrary decision based on a false premise based on bad information and so I don't think that that we can actually look at that and um and there's the the lean mass hyperresponders data has come out it just shows the people on ketogenic carnivore diets ketogenic diets like a cornivore diet high high fat meat-based diet all their markers improve just their LL goes up okay well does that mean they're getting heart disease turns out it doesn't you know people were on on these these Mass these these ldls that were much higher than they think are safe for an average of 4.7 years did not have any any progression in their atherosclerosis right and in fact the trend was to reverse it and reduce it right as compared to you know other I was at the Miami Hearts study those the that cohort you know healthy people that ate low fat fat sort of diets and had low LDL cholesterol and low heart disease it was better than them right this is just not this is not what we've been told it was so um you hopefully that's reassuring do watch that episode um um the truth about cholesterol and heart disease I think that it's a good place to get a lot of information in one place just show that this is this is not the whole argument this is not the whole story that there is definitely a lot more going on here than make out okay everyone I'm really sorry but I I have to stop there um or else I'm going to be uh late for my patience but uh thank you all very much it's great to to see everyone here we got over a thousand people here today which is amazing thank you so much for that please do come to my Premiere this Sunday in the US Monday in America uh where I'll be um interviewing uh the amazing Dr Georgia Eid who uh was a um a hor Harvard trained uh psychiatrist and wrote a recent book called uh change your diet change your mind it's all about you're reversing serious mental health issues with diet you can just reverse um you can reverse um you know things a lot by just reducing the amount of of processed food and junk and garbage and sugar and all the all the Kellogg's products basically all the things you just get rid of all those things that will improve things if you can go on lower carb that will improve things you go fully ketogenic that will improve things a lot more and for really tough cases and if you can do it even carnivore she has a whole chapter on Carnivore and how this can can help even more and these really tough stubborn cases carnivore can be uh the best treatment for these very serious mental health issues so uh I I had amazing time talking to her she's she's a lovely lovely person you can you can just you can you can feel the empathy coming off her she really cares about this and she really cares about people and getting them better so please do join me for that this weekend or Monday morning if you're in um my neck of the woods and uh hopefully we can get um that up because we I really want to get this you know up and popular so that that a lot of people watch it because it's such an important message and especially people suffering with mental health issues depression anxiety OCD bipolar even schizophrenia this is showing to be improving um people with schizophrenia and this is this is this is something that's in the CL clinical literature that we've done experimental data and now we're having rct's randomized control trials that are in the works now that she's working on uh to to to show uh what else it can do so this is this is amazing stuff it's really really interesting and I hope you all can can join me for that okay thank you everyone I really appreciate it I will see you next time"
