        "body": "anyone who studies biology should damn well know this life is about adaptation and if you've not been adapting to something you're not designed for it if you have been adapting to it for millions of years then you are adapted to it and it is beneficial and it is good for you there's an entire population with 3/4 of a million people in the akiyu who in 1931 were eating a clean nonprocessed food diet plant-based and the Messi who eating a clean nonprocessed food animal-based diet and the Messi were welcome to the plant-free MD podcast with Dr Anthony chaffy where we discuss diet and nutrition and how this affects health and chronic disease and show you how you can use this to optimize your health and happiness both mentally and physically uh hypothesis ketones uh is not a starvation survival function as commonly thought but a result of abundance dietary or stored fat that gets interrupted when we eat plants thoughts no I I I agree I don't think this is a survival function I think this is our this is our primary metabolic State this is the primary metabolic state of essentially all most animals at least in the wild so carnivores and herbivores are in a state of ketosis or starvation State um because they're always getting meat and fat they don't they don't take in a bunch of carbohydrates so carnivores because they eat animals with fat they go for the fat first they're eating fat and meat right so they absorb fat and protein High proportion of fat to prot protein generally and then uh but also herbivores because they don't you know they're taking in a bunch of fiber which is just all carbs but that's not actually what they absorb because no vertebrate animal can break down no vertebrate animal can break down fiber and so it's actually the fiber is there to feed their gut bacteria and the gut bacteria eat that break down all the fiber and then as their waste they secrete short chain fatty acids which are also 100% saturated so they absorb the fat they absorb the waste the sort of weird to think about but the byproduct of this bacteria that's what they absorb and then the bacteria die off and they break those down and absorb those as proteins so what a cow eats is grass but what they absorb is fat and protein what a gorilla eats are green leaves what they absorb is fat and protein and all the way down down the line so um yeah so that so gorillas and cows are in the same ketogenic so-called starvation state so it's not a starvation State the only reason we call it a fasting state is by the time we were able to look at our biochemistry at a molecular level everyone was eating carbohydrates and says okay what does this look like when we eat oh it looks like this great and okay what about if we stop eating does it look the same well no actually about 24 hours it looks this other way oh very interesting that must be a fasting state that changes okay but but if you eat anything else on earth except carbohydrates it also looks like this so-called fasting state so they just jumped the gun a bit you know they didn't test things out um as much as they should have and and this is this is up until current day that's what I was taught in Biochemistry you know two decades ago and uh it's wrong right because when I eat 5,000 calories in ribey I am not fasting and so whatever my whatever you can say about my metabolic State you cannot say it's a fasting state because not fasting right so I think that that's our primary metabolic State that's and that's the primary metabolic state of of most animals in the wild except you know little birds and bees and things that like eat nectar God knows what their metabolism is like but uh for for the other carnivores and herbivores out there you know you're running on fat and protein and so I think that's that's uh that the what we call a Fed State what we call our primary state is actually a pathological defense mechanism that your body's defending against high blood sugar because high blood sugar is toxic it damages it cause direct damage to your body and kill this is what kills diabetics is is prolonged high blood sugar right so those glucose molecules physically fuse to other molecules and they damage them they cause permanent damage and disruption to your body and so your body looks at that and goes sweet Jesus what's going on here and you slam up insulin to try to get this out and and save the save the you know the body and so that that's that's just a a defense mechanism that's not our normal state right because if we're eating what we're designed to eat what we're normally eating what we were eating during the ice ages that's not the state we're in and so you can call it ketosis you can call it whatever you want you know people say that the the Inuit don't go into ketosis but that's really because just their ketones are pretty low uh you get better at at using your ketones as you go and you get more efficient at it so at first you have high ketones because your body is not keto adapted and it's not and so you have just like if you're insulin resistant your blood sugar goes up and it's harder for your body to get this into the cells to use so at first you're Ketone resistant right because you don't have the mechanisms set up to use ketones properly because you haven't been using them you haven't been making them and you know just like when you go back to eating carbs all of a sudden you're not making enough insulin you're like oh God okay got to get those wheels turning again and so for ketones it just takes a bit of time but when you've been on it long enough your ketones aren't that high that's because you're using them you're using them better and whatever happens it's supposed to happen right because you're eating what you're supposed to eat and so whatever happens is supposed to happen and the the Inuit you know they say Well they're not in ketosis I don't know because they're making ketones they're making blood sugar they're making glycogen they're not just running off of the uh you know I mean there there's glycogen in meat and organs but is that enough to run all of their energy demands is their insulin chronically elevated no I don't think so so not that I know of anyway so I think that they are in ketosis I just think that it looks different when you've been on it your whole life as as opposed to just a 6 we study hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own questions please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest of the Q&A so um but yeah I definitely agree that I we the fasting state is not uh a fasting state that um that I think that's our our primary metabolic State and that's where all of our heavy machinery come to be that's where all the beneficial biochemical actions happen that's where autophagy comes from mitophagy replacing your mitochondria and and bulking up their number um um you know all the different benefits you get from from fasting all these we know fasting is so good for you so you go on a cornivore diet it just mimics fasting no no fasting mimics the metab metabolism you're supposed to be in all the time anyway which you would be in if you were on your proper diet how can we say that eating a whole bunch of grains and sugar and processed crap is normal for us none of that existed in in the last ice age or any ice age or before the 1800s why why are we eating things that didn't exist before you know before the 1800s I mean there there are things we're eating now that didn't exist before we were even born right why the hell are we eating them you definitely aren't adapted to those things right uh what are we adapted to we're adapted to meat whatever you're adapted to that's what you're supposed to eat that's what that's that's an immutable law of biology is adaptation you you get stressors and survival pressures and whatever can adapt best to that situation survives and thrives and we not only survived we not only thrived we became the most dominant species on Earth during ice ages when all we had to eat was meat right so we are well ad aded to eating meat we are not well adapted to eating any plants and you know some people have a bit of adaptation 8 to 10,000 years with agriculture a lot of people don't a lot of people have not been introduced to agriculture until they were met by the Western Colonial Powers a few hundred years ago and many of them still didn't eat any of that garbage they knew better it's only in sort of the recent century and a half that they started doing that the native Americans were still eating mostly meat until you know we wiped out the buffalo in the the American Indian Wars you Buffalo Bill which I still think is just a an atrocity just an absolute atrocity and um but that's what it was and so in the 1800s the Native Americans and the Plains Indians were the tallest human beings on Earth that's been well studied and documented and now they are not they started eating a western diet they are more likely to get obese and sick and diabetic and metabolic issues and cancer and these other sorts of things when eating a western diet so what does that mean that means if you know that means the food is causing the disease because if they don't eat the food they don't get the disease and we eat the food and we get the disease we just get it at a lower rate because we have had a bit of protection we've had a bit of adaptation 10,000 years is not that much but it does something and so we have some adaptive measures to protect us whereas the Native Americans don't the native Australians don't subsaharan Africans don't have as much and so that's that's uh where you see a lot of disparities in health come from that background how long have you been exposed to these nasty plants that we really shouldn't be eating if you've been exposed to them longer you can do better with them if you have not had much exposure to them you know uh genetically in your in your uh genetic past then you're not as adapted to it the law of nature the law of biology is adaptation and if you have not had time to adapt you should not be eating or exposing yourself to that thing you want to expose yourself to things that you are well adapted to and what we are well adapted to All Humans is meat and so that's what you should eat hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys Basics ask hey Anthony uh love what you do well thank you very much uh when are you're going to make a documentary in the same style as a game changers well I'm yeah I don't know I was thinking about it actually but um you know I I just God I just don't know when the hell I would do it um but people like Carrie man from homestead how it just jumped right on that train because he saw how much of a massive benefit this made for him and he started talking to a lot of people who was massively helping he's just like no we need to get a documentary out we need to get this on Netflix we need to do something big and uh and so he's working on that so he's working on a cornner board documentary and so i' I've uh well tried to help out with that as much as I can and put him in touch with different people that can help with that and uh and I'll be presumably um in it as well and and talking to him and talking about all this sort of stuff in that documentary and so hopefully that that gets out now um Brian Sanders has been doing this for six years now so he's he's um you know the the um creator of food lies and the you know created that so he's he's making this documentary about food lies and and now not necessarily carnivore but but the vilification about meat is dead ass wrong and showing that this is wrong and actually eating animal-based is very appropriate is more appropriate so it's not a carnivore do documentary per se but it's pretty damn close and it really goes exactly the opposite of where every other documentary says oh my God Less meat Less meat Less meat Less meat oh just just meat's just causing disease or just stop eating it and you'll get better eat any ass plant that you want doesn't matter Hemlock whatever just eat it just just plants because that's what they say more more fruits and vegetables Less meat you do better okay well which ones you know they are different you know most plants on Earth are inedible you can't just tell people just to eat any random plant and it'll be good and any meat will be bad that's ridiculous that is just ridiculous again going back to adaptation and these immutable laws of biology anyone who studies biology should damn well know this life is about adaptation and if you've not been adapting to something you're not designed for it if you have been adapting to it for millions of years then you are adapted to it and it is beneficial and it is good for you and um you know people like Simon Hill will say well just because we're adapted to it we've been eating it for millions of years doesn't mean it's actually good for us okay you name one example anywhere on Earth that that's true anywhere you know Lions have been eating meat for millions of years but yeah but but a fresh spring salad is going to be better for them really okay prove it right so why would it be different for humans and no other animal on Earth why would the laws of adaptation only apply to other animals and not humans that is ridiculous that is a ridiculous statement so you have a lot of these ridiculous statements and then you have the Messiah and the akuu who then people will say well but akiyu yes they're not doing as well they're much less healthy um but they you know they they that's not the vegan diet I would recommend or the vegetarian diet because they do eat some meat and dairy very little that's not the vegetan Arian diet I would recommend okay so they're doing they're doing vegetarianism wrong that's always the classic excuse you're just doing vegetarianism wrong well your studies say that more fruits and vegetables and Less meat equal better but there's an entire population with three4 of a million people in the akiyu who in 1931 were eating a clean nonprocessed food diet plant-base and the Messi were eating a clean nonprocessed food animal-based diet and the Messi were Far and Away more healthy better developed five inches taller bigger brains more uh more body lean body mass and stronger and healthier had less Health defects right and birth and um um uh developmental defects right well that's but that's not the vegetarian diet I would recommend okay you said less meat better these guys have more meat they're doing better these guys are having more plants Less meat they're doing worse so your studies are crap if a study does not disagrees with reality it's wrong period doesn't matter right so even even like mathematical equations you know uh Richard fean said physicist he said doesn't matter how brilliant your theory is and it doesn't matter how smart you are if it doesn't agree with the experiment it's wrong and so you write this mathematical proof and Einstein was known to do this and he write this mathematical proof say I proved this great everyone's like my God you're a genius then they go and observe things and go like yep that's not what's happening throw it out and Einstein would throw it out because he was smart enough to know that it didn't matter what he thought he proved in a mathematical proof he just looked at it and said yeah that's not what's happening okay obviously there's something here going on that I don't know I don't have all the variables and so he toss it out and that's what you have to do and so oh but there's this study and it said I don't care first of all the majority of studies come from uh food the food drug industry why would you listen to any of those you know the Coca-Cola just Coca-Cola not Kelloggs Pepsi Nestle General Mills all the rest of them just Coca-Cola spends 11 times the amount of money on nutritional research every year than the National Institutes of Health NIH right the vast majority of of these studies are put out by the the company trying to sell you this right so you know I'm sure you know heroin cartels are going to put out as many studies as they can to tell you how great heroin is right why would you trust that you know it's the same thing these are cartels these are drug cartels they are making you sick they are making you addicted and they are profiting this is this is the opium trade this is the new opium trade where people are making entire Empires based on your addiction and and your sickness do not listen to these people now and then they're putting out studies saying how great opium is I bet they are right why would you listen to that why would you listen to this crap it doesn't agree with reality right so well more plants less less meat that's better because meat causes harm that's their contention but you have the Messiah more meat more Dairy drinking blood barely any plants and they're the healthiest people in that region right and they inter breed they inter marry right so they're genetically similar right and you have three4 of a million akuu at the time mostly plant-based clean no processed food no pesticides no fertilizers anything like that not doing very well and it wasn't and and they supplemented them gave them uh you know nutritional supplements because they're o deficient got them up to up to Snuff didn't help didn't help their health issues it wasn't until they replaced the plants they were eating with meat that's when they improved okay so again it doesn't meet with reality it's wrong okay and um and so people like Brian Sanders are making documentary showing all the lies and how wrong this stuff is so that's coming out hopefully that'll be done this year he's put a lot of work into that and I'm really excited to see that um I have a bit of a cameo in it if they decide to keep some of my my things I've said in there which would be great but uh but it's massive it's massive that mean they've been putting this together for six years so I'm really excited for that so that'll be uh so people don't know Brian Sanders um just look him up on on Instagram um he has a YouTube channel and podcast as well uh it's all run out of like his uh Instagram page is um food lies and I think it's the website like food lies.com or something like that but certainly on Instagram and so that's Brian's um Instagram and you can you can find all the YouTube channel and podcast stuff through that as well and I've been on his podcast and he's been online so really nice guy and um and he I'm really looking forward to that documentary and then I'm really looking forward to Carri uh Carrie man's documentary as well because that that one is specifically carnivore like carnivore helps people going be following people and tracking people as they go they're like okay I'm going to get started on Carnivore and and they're doing before middle and after and seeing how this affects people in real time which I think is really really powerful one of the one of the most gripping and Powerful food documentaries which really started the genre was uh it's called fat sick and nearly dead as you this guy was very sick unwell he taking all these medications he had I think he had some autoimmune issues and he basically went to just a clean non-processed food diet and was juicing vegetables but he was still eating meat but he was just sort of juicing things and stuff like that that you could see him he was just losing weight and skin getting better and like throughout the documentary he was going around talking to people and he was just looking healthier and healthier and healthier as he went he's always drinking this green smoothie so that was influenced by the by the vegan Community like Dr uh Joel Ferman if I'm not mistaken I'm pretty sure it's Joel Ferman and um and uh so that had that sort of bent but it was very it was very powerful now this was only him it was only his progress um whereas in the corner diet we're going to be showing all sorts of people or car's going to be showing all sorts of people not just one person getting better and and really talking about the science behind it and things like that so hopefully it has has a similar impact and um yeah so so exciting times so um I don't know maybe I'll do one I am working on a book I'm hoping to get it out at the end of the year I'm I'm sort of getting more on on top of that and um uh yeah so we'll see we'll see if uh I can get that out by the end of the year early next year and um and then yeah we have these cool documentaries coming out on in the pipeline as well so that's exciting hey everyone if you need a little extra help getting started on a carnivore diet and my online resources that I have for free aren't enough for you you can go to www.how carnivore do.com and sign up for a 30-day carnivore challenge where you'll have online Resources Group support weekly Zoom meetings as well as the ability to chat live with myself Simon Lewis and the others in the challenge who can help you and support you and give you extra advice and help you along the way so if that sounds like something that would be beneficial to you then please go to how carnivore decom and sign up all right thanks guys we'll see you there"
