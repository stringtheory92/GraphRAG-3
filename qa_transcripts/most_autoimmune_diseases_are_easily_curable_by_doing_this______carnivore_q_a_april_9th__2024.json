    "title": "\ud83d\udd34 Most Autoimmune Diseases Are EASILY Curable By Doing This...  | Carnivore Q&A April 9th, 2024.",
    "transcript": "I have over 100 patients with Hashimoto specifically and the ones that go on a carnivore diet not even a full line diet ones that do a full line diet just red meat and water do far better but everyone doing a carnivore diet antibodies come right down you know I met you can measure them you see a number next to them that number comes down and eventually that goes to uh non-detectable undetectable so what you want to do really is you want to go on a carnivore diet really a lion diet for the Hashimoto autoimun ises go away on Carnivore diets any autoimmune issue you want to stick to red meat and water high fat red meat and water beef and lamb that's it don't have anything else optimize your sleep and prioritize your sleep don't you oh yeah I'll get you whatever I can deal with it don't do that get 8 hours of sleep at night okay all right hello everyone thank you for joining my YouTube live for uh a April 10th in Australia April 9th in the US just got my little boy here and uh looking forward to talking to you guys and answering some questions um so thank you everyone for joining and um and uh um we already had some some uh super Chats on so I'll get to those I have about an hour and a half so I have to finish around noon my time here in per just about an hour and a half and so we will get to as many questions as we can in that time uh question from uh Beth ramacher besides Sprints what is the best cardio uh is it walking also uh how to lift weights without getting bulky when I eat a lot of protein that tends to happen thank you well you know your your body's going to sort of respond in in a specific way so you can sort of see what um what your you know what what you want to do for the the sort of results you want to get um sprinting can just develop your muscles and develop your musculature and pH and Physique in ways similar to uh lifting weights but not um but you don't actually have to lift weights I mean you look at you look at like Olympic sprinters they they look like bodybuilders and uh yet they don't lift weights you know they want they're trying to stay light and lean uh so they can go fast so they're not lifting a bunch of Weights they're not like doing a whole bunch of upper body work and shoulders have like just Bolder shoulders and all these sorts of things and um so you actually get a lot of a lot of uh muscular physique just from doing that sort of work it's a very good full body workout um as far as cardio yeah you know just just doing walking I I really like the high-intensity sort of stuff you can do bike Sprints those sorts of things um Hill Sprints um otherwise you know walking if you're not able to do that sort of stuff doing the long prolonged uh jogs and runs and things like that is um is a bit I mean it's it I mean it is beneficial to your health but it's also uh it can be it can oh hush it can uh raise your cortisol and um and and be a bit more stressful on your system than you necessarily want so it can be a bit counterproductive and it's not it's funny they call that cardio because spr hey stop whining because um uh sprinting is way better for your heart and so um but as far as weights are concern uh you just hey why are you so whiny why why you your whiny why you take a whiny boy take the whiny boy oh hush oh H Jesus okay all right I'll let him go I think he's trying to tell me something and um and so uh yeah if you if you lift weights you do more lighter weights and and higher rep ranges that that is thought to be um you know what you want to do to get more toned physique uh sort of uh looking as opposed to like the bigger bulkier muscles but I've spoken to um trainers in in uh the fitness industry and in the bodybuilding industry and they're sort of saying like the 15 rep range is actually really good for hypertrophy so maybe if you don't want as much hypertrophy you go even higher than that I still like working to failure um but that can stimulate muscle growth the thing is too if you do the concentric so if if you're basically doing the the you know if you're doing like a it's concentric and Ecentric right so if you're if you're lifting a weight while while your muscle is Contracting and shortening the fibers uh versus is you know letting the the weight down and now you're lengthening the F fibers but they're actually still trying to hold on to each other so um molecularly there sort of these actin fibers are sort of stuck on and you're just sort of really just ripping them apart that causes that damage that tearing to the muscle fibers that then stimulates more hypertrophy and so one thing that that athletes do is they'll basically like for like a um specifically in sprinters and in athletes there's a there's a top trainer in California who uh I forget his name but he um he works with all the the top uh prospects you know going into the NFL into the NFL draft and he works with them he gets their 40 time up and they were going into the combine he just massively improves their athletic performance and um one of the things he does is is something is the hex bar bar deadlift so that hex bar is are sort of the hexagonal shape which on the side you sort of pick up the handles on on either side of you as opposed to uh deadlift from the front front with the bar so it's a hex bar deadlift and you're just standing up he said those are all the muscles those firing muscles for um for like a Sprinter for you know doing that sort of mustion Boom all those muscles that those big explosive athletic muscles and so he would just do um you know sort of the pickup part of that and then drop it and what that does is it's just doing the the shortening of the fibers and then you're letting go you're not tearing it by pulling it apart so you get better recovery you can do it more more often during the week and you can actually do some of those it tightens up your muscles gets them ready to really fire and then you go do your 40 yard dash you actually go faster and so the reason that that um is is a benefit here is because you you will uh put on muscle you will tone you will get stronger you will get faster but you're not going to be pulling and ripping those muscles apart so the hypertrophy the bulkiness is going to be less also isometric uh exercises where you're just you're not moving but you're pressing against something or you're doing something in a static position you'll recruit a lot of muscle fibers to that especially if you're you're you know pushing as hard as you can but because there's no lengthening or shortening of your muscles it just works in a different way and so um some of like the old school strong men you know 100 years ago there was like the the what was it the mighty adom or something like that um he was this shorter dude but he was super strong he did crazy used like white nails and just break him in half it's like Jesus and he was strong as hell and like he said that um that the isometric things were were more about getting like this strength in in different ways not getting bulk but being stronger for your size and what he said is it strengthened your tendons and strong tendons is what really got you there who knows um but but he thought isometric exercis are really good for strength so he wasn't this huge big bulky guy but he was very strong and so you can look at those sorts of things um if you want to you know build strength but not get too bulky Lena thank you for the Super Chat do you use paper towels what about dish soap and laundry uh yeah I use paper towels um you're going to tell me there's a whole bunch of you I'm sure there's like a bunch of microplastics and things like that and some of them um but you know try to get just normal paper towels I haven't actually looked too deeply to see which ones are are horrible and all that sort of stuff but um damn it now I'm going to have to now just rais that question um yeah so in in the laundry I try to use things I try to not use things that have like plastic covers on like the pods you know because they those that gets plastic in all all over your just coats your dishes and forks and utensils and little plastic nonsense that you don't necessarily want or your laundry which thing gets on to you and uh so you're just using just normal powder and and things like that that don't have all that plastic involved with it those are the sort of ones that I use I just try to avoid that and um dish soap I actually have um Tallow dish soap I don't always um I have that at have used that as well and um uh but I haven't really worried too much about the soap side of things um from for dish soap anyway for my soap I use tallow use like Tallow soaps and things like that um but okay yeah so that's that's pretty much it I just try to avoid things with a bunch of plastics and things like that um all right um a super chat from Chris black thank you very much for that for a very generous Super Chat um Chris says hi Dr chaffy my stepmom has Hashim modus for years and is now diagnosed with arthritis her doctor prescribed her a drug that causes constipation and recommended Metamucil to counteract it what is your advice absolutely love the work you do um well you don't well you know Metamucil is is a bulking agent and it um has just more fiber and so you know the last thing you want to do when you slowed down the motility of your gut is is add more bulk because it's just going to cause you know more blockage right so if you have you know good analogy that that uh gets used is if you have a traffic jam you know how do you relieve the traffic jam do you just send more cars in and just try to force them through like a log Jam um no that's not what you try to do you try to relieve the bottleneck and um so what you want to do really is you want to go on a carnivore diet really a lion diet for the Hashimoto um because it's uh those autoimmune issues are reacting to the plant toxins that we're eating and uh you know we have leaky gut and damage to the gut things are getting in the body and our body's making um and well these things are sort of attacking the organs and and your body is sort of attacking that those things attacking your organs and your organs get hit in the crossfire and uh they go away so I have over a 100 patients with Hashimoto specifically and the ones that go on a carnivore diet not even a full line diet the ones that do a full line diet just red meat and water do far better U but everyone doing a carnivore diet antibodies come right down you know I met you can measure them you see a number next to them that number comes down and eventually that goes to h non-detectable undetectable and so that's what I would recommend also getting a lot of fat because fat is actually what's going to keep the stool soft so it doesn't matter what the motility is if the stool is soft if it if it's soft because there's water in it okay well then you're on a time uh there's a Time issue because if it's slowing down the motility it's just going to dehydrate and desiccate in your colon and you're not going to be able to get it get it out in time before it's just locked up uh but if you have fat in there and you're eating enough fat that fat gets in into the stool that excess fat that your body can't absorb because it's you know Surplus to demand it um just goes out and keeps those stools soft that repels water it's already dehydrated it's not going to get more dehydrated you're not you don't absorb fat in your lower intestine so it just it keeps it in there and it keeps it soft so if she's eating enough fat doesn't matter what drug she's taking she shouldn't get constipation but she needs to eat enough fat and she needs to eat meat and she needs to stop eating plants really and I wouldn't I wouldn't personally take Metamucil ever for any reason at all um all right uh Lena thank you for the Super Chat uh again uh hungry last night but wanted to go to bed so didn't cook hence didn't sleep as deeply uh does going to sleep hungry once in a while mess up hormones I don't think so no I don't I don't I don't know that it that it would or um or anything like that so no I don't think that's a problem um it's not that I know of anyway so no that's that's fine you just catch up the next day than thing is is that it's very it's very normal for uh for us and for carnivores in general predators in general to not necessarily eat every day and so our bodies are more than adapted and designed to go multiple days or weeks without eating you're going to be fine I don't think that's going to hurt you in any way obviously you know unless you're really not eating enough and you're getting emaciated but no not just from not eating one day uh Lena again thank you again for Super Chat um do you know of any natural painkiller remedy um I guess it's suppose I suppose it depends on what you mean by natural painkiller remedy uh if you mean a natural painkiller you know like willow bark you know that has aspirin things like that but I'd rather just take the aspirin um I mean the main thing is that doing the carnivore diet you're just going to lower your inflammat inflammation you're going to have pain you're just going to experience less pain and um uh so that's that's sort of the best painkiller I have when I eat any sort of rice or beans or any carbs or whatever you know it was only like a little bit got stuck to the meat that I was eating and when I was at a restaurant I couldn't scrape it all off this was six years ago and I mean that was enough to just absolutely kill me I was like stabbing black back pain in my lower back for four days after that it's absolutely awful so um but other than that um you make these you make natural endorphins uh that can they can work on your opiate receptors uh they were there they were there before we knew about opiates you know it's just those those things happen to hit on our opiate receptors they are already there for our own purposes um but if you're talking about like sort of things to take that are painkillers I probably would stick to just the isolated chemical in things like Tylenol and ibuprofen and things like that if you need them hopefully you don't but you know I wouldn't I certainly wouldn't take any plants that have thousands of other chemicals in them as well um so yeah I would uh tell me my thoughts but I I if I understand your question correctly that's uh that's what I would say um so Darth carnivore says Dr sh needs to author a children's nutrition book called plants don't want to be eaten that's not a bad idea that's a great title too um yeah yeah yeah plants don't want to be eaten too or something like that say like PLS don't want to be eating yeah but plants don't want to be eating too and this is what they do and all that sort of stuff um not a bad idea just make a note of that I will make a note of that why is the pen why don't pens never work sorry almost done good idea uh that's funny uh but yeah that's great that's a great idea uh Mariana cozer thank you very much for the super chat um Dr chaffy my dad has been diagnosed with empyema last year even though he quit 18 years ago he's 73 years old his skin on his lower legs are red and dry uh with dry with sores um he is not diabetic any chance that carnivore will help him well it it will help him uh will it help all these problems and reverse him completely um no it's not going to reverse everything completely but it can it can absolutely help and um and uh I I have I've been seeing more and more people with COPD empyema that are improving on a carnivore diet it's not going to it's not going to regrow you know lost tissue but uh it could help the that we know of it won't um but it could help with you know making the the tissue that's still there heal and work as well as uh as it possibly can and you know if there is some healing that can be done you know hopefully hopefully it does that but there are a lot of people that are are doing with COPD and improving you know the different sorts of problems with skin and sores and poor wound healing and things like that diabetic or or otherwise um is um you know that that you know that does help so a lot of people get helped by by that so uh and it's going to help him in all the other ways that it helps everybody else all the time it's going to make give him better mental Clarity better energy better nutrition he's going to keep on uh healthy weight uh more easily as long as he's eating enough it's very easy to undereat so make sure that he's eating until fatty meat stops tasting good that's very different than just eating until you feel that you you can stop you hey stop it weirdo sorry cat just trying to knock over my water hey stop and um and so um you know just he'll improve in all these other sorts of ways and and other people have improved their symptoms of empyema and certainly a lot of skin issues and healing issues so it's definitely definitely worth the try um crazy about cor says is there a Facebook group for Dr chaffy um I I don't have a Facebook group I mean there's like a there's like a follow page um that uh doesn't really have really see too much action um I might link that to my Instagram and um just have that post on there like right now streaming to Facebook as well but it's face streaming to my Facebook page like my actual page um I was streaming it to my other you know follow page and it's um I was getting like you know three people at a time so I don't think very people know about that so but yeah the idea is to have a um have that follow page and and um I guess the only Facebook group I have is is the how-to carnivore group but that's a um a group for people that been in our Challenge on the howw carnivore Challenge and then that's a sort of a private group for everybody who has been in the challenge and they can you know if they're not you know you can do the challenge more than once but if you you know don't want to or whatever just want but want to still be connected with people um you can be in that in that Facebook group and still talk to people and and communicate and support each other and things like that so uh that's a little different so I don't have a like my own I think some of the best Facebook groups would be uh zero carb health and zeroing in on health they've been around the longest they're the strictest and I think they get the best results and they have the best information I think a lot of other ones they just it's just it's just Haywire there's just all sorts of people saying all sorts of different things and it's just it's not helpful for people um so I think that those are the best ones and um uh so that's uh where I generally direct people to and then Mary Shepard says am I the only one weirded out by the line in the bottom right corner uh having rabbit ears or is it just my new glasses so that's the brings the thumbnail uh that I have for this yeah is a bit weird um where is that I didn't actually really notice the rabbit ears um a that's creepy yeah I didn't I didn't notice that I did notice the uh you know the antlers you know coming out of the hand of of one of the little big cat and things like that and um some other sort of yeah I mean you want to see weird you see what what the other sorts of weird things that um that uh the AI comes up with it's bizarre there's absolutely bizarre things that when you get the the weird AI stuff to do yeah that's bizarre oh God that's creepy yeah what is that are those rabit ears well they're weird anyway yeah I didn't actually notice that that's super creepy thanks for that now I'm I'm only going to see that ever uh when I'm when I'm looking at this gonna have to get a new thing creep me out enough hey everyone really happy to announce a new sponsor for the show for everybody down in Australia Stockman Stakes who are delivering highquality grass-fed and finished pasture raised beef and other meats flash frozen and vacuum sealed to your door something I've been enjoying a lot of

today for free order of beef mints or another specialty gift along with your order at Stockman sts.com and I'll see you over there thanks guys uh Lisa C says just want to thank Dr C once again for giving me my life back um or giving my life back to me after traumatic brain injury I was on the trampling with teenage granddaughter uh doing swivel hips and airplanes yesterday that's amazing um well I mean I didn't don't know what I did but um you know I'm glad that um you know changing your diet helped your dramatic brain injury I mean that's something that's in the literature ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet um help people recover from from traumatic brain injuries and concussion and postconcussion syndrome and all the rest so it's it's um great that you found that and and at you know at a time that you your body was still able to repair and get a lot of of good results back so that's really great I'm really glad that you're able to spend time with your your grandkids and um and get a lot better so yeah thank you for that thank you for sharing Jen Warner thank you for the Super Chat I've been experiencing symptoms of hypoglycemia uh I am off all diabetes medic medication for over a year and doing keto for 9 months my endocrinologist wants me to increase my cars but I refuse I don't uh I don't know what to do um I guess it depends on what what your symptoms are and uh and sort of why you're getting them if you're off all your medications your body should just make uh should just make uh your you know the the appropriate amount of um blood sugar that's what people do you know there's no such thing as an essential carbohydrate your B you know entire civilizations entire human race survived without carbohydrates for much of its existence and um you know generation after generation so this is this is this is something that we're we're designed for and built for um so if you're doing keto uh there's a difference between keto and just carnivore the reason I do carnivore or not keto carnivore is a ketogenic diet but it's more strict it's just getting rid of all plants in general and the the reason being is these plants have toxins that aren't good for you some of those toxins some of these things called lectins can actually bind to the insulin receptors uh five times more tightly than insulin and so you can actually get an insulin response even though you're not bringing in extra carbs you actually get lower blood sugar and you actually suppress your ketones the only way that people can really get symptomatic or hypoglycemic or certainly symptomatic for hypog glycemia is um is if they're not making ketones because their experiments in in humans back when you didn't have to pass this by an Ethics Committee where they they ramped up people's ketones and then they dropped their their in their their blood sugar levels they dropped it lower and lower lower they dropped it down to blood sugar levels that you you should be in a coma they were fine they asked them hey how you feeling yeah fine why do you ask you know nothing was different for them because their brain was running on ketones because your brain primarily runs on ketones it preferentially runs on ketones um so you all these people say oh no no you have to have glucose for your brain no you don't you need ketones for your brain you use glucose as a secondary fuel source if you don't have enough ketones so if you have enough ketones and you have an abundant amount of glucose the cortex of your brain will only run on the Ketone so two-thirds of your brain of of your brain cells will only run on ketones right so plenty of glucose available it's only running on ketones that's a preference so that's his primary energy source and it's only when the Ketone levels start going down like insulin or insulinogenic response that you start replacing that with glucose now if you have that insulin response and there's no glucose available and you suppress your ketones you don't have as much glucose then you can start feeling pretty rotten um but that doesn't happen um if you're if you're not getting that response so if you have enough ketones you should not get the the cognitive sort of issues uh related to hypoglycemia and um so I would you know you could check your Ketone so I think really what you need ketones not carbs some of these some of these um lectins in plants can uh cause um you know can bind to the insulin receptors and can cause that that scenario to happen another issue another potential issue is that you can um if you're using like keto treats and keto snacks while they're keto so therefore it's okay no there are other bad things on this earth besides carbohydrates and uh when you're using artificial sweeteners that can actually give an insulin response get reactive hypoglycemia because your insulin goes up and you're you're not getting a whole bunch of carbs so your blood sugar goes down your ketones go down and you have uh issues with hypoglycemia um if you're a type two diabetic you know then you have the same risks and problems of getting hypoglycemia as anybody else in in the population because you're not taking insulin the issue with uh hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetics which is an entirely different disease it we call them both diabetes because they make they both make you pee more when they're in you have massively elevated uh blood sugar levels but they're not anywhere near the same disease um same issue so you know these things can get conflated and it seems that your doctor is doing that um if you're just not taking medication you're not taking insulin you're a normal person so why are you getting uh hypoglycemia it's not because you're diabetic because you're not that kind of diabetic um it's because of uh something else that you're doing so you know just I don't have much to go on uh but the keto part of that makes me think that there's something that you're eating apart from meat that is uh causing this reaction and response um cold brew thank you very much for the super chat um hey I've been eating a lot of chicken thighs um is it better to eat the skin or not are there any benefits to eating the skin thanks yeah a lot of benefits of eating the skin is it's much more nutrients and fat uh that you want you need the fat and so if you're eating chicken you want it with the chick with you want the dark meat with the skin on because you need that fat chicken is very lean and has less nutrients especially fat soluble nutrients than meat red meat uh options and so yeah you need you need the skin there's a lot of there's a lot of great nutrients in the skin uh like the fat the fat is a nutrient it's not just a calorie Source there are essential fatty acids that you have to have that you can only get from meat and they're essential fat soluble nutrients that you have to have you can only get from meat and so you need to eat the fat it's an essential nutrient so yes skin is great also tastes really good that's a big Advantage too and uh hello Ellie Melly says hello my two boys yeah we had the little boy and he was he's ignoring me now he's ghosting me so unfortunately it's just it's just the one boy right now uh Deborah says I appreciate you and thank you for all you do Dr Anthony chy go corn well thank you very much you're very sweet um my son uh is 31 and autistic day to carnivore non-verbal uh but he seems calmer that's great so I'm really glad to hear that I think this is probably one of the most important things for autistic um people you know kids and adults because you just help the brain work a lot better and it's getting getting rid of a lot of things that that slow down the brain and stop it from working properly one of the things that prevents the brain from working properly are dysfunctioning mitochondria there can be a lot of reasons for dysfunctioning mitochondria like lack of carnitine only 70% of people make enough carnitine fully 30% of the world doesn't make enough carnitine and you have to get it from your diet so you're eating more fatty meat just meat in general you're going to get more carnitine can't get that from plants and then if you're on a ketogenic diet again your brain's running on ketones primarily and preferentially so that's better for your brain you want to be in ketosis anyway for brain development you need to be in ketosis for brain development because the ketones cross the blood brain barrier and reconstitute into fatty acids and so when your brain's still developing you need those ketones to get in there actually build the physical structures of the brain and then after several months on a carnivore diet that is ketogenic you actually will go through autophagy and more and more autophagy and mitophagy you're going to be and and mitogenesis so you're going to be replacing the mitochondria and you're going to be making more of them so it's been shown in studies that ketogenic diets like a carnal board diet after three four months you have four times the number of mitochondria and they're four times as effective so there a massive Improvement in the mitochondria and function of our neurons and and cells overall and so that is something that I would expect him to get better and better at and hopefully in a couple of months he'll be uh even even better than that and I I would expect him to be and and I hope that he is and so thank you very much for sharing starlord thank you very much for the super chat um hi Dr chaffy I've been eating mostly red meat and eggs for a year now and it's been so good for my health but I have a hard time dropping coffee and ice cream I know it makes a difference to go pure any recommendations ice cream is a that's a that's that's a big one you know lot of sugar a lot of lot of stuff in there um you can make you know better versions of of ice cream you just make it with cream you can just ice cream you know put in some raw milk there's you know there a bit of sweetness to to milk um it's actually very sweet to me if I drank you know whole milk it tastes like I'm just drinking ice cream it's just insane like how good that tastes but that's because my my sweet senses uh my sense of sweet flavors is much more pronounced now um because I'm not just overwhelming my system with just crazy amounts of sugar and sweets and so I drink milk and it's like wow that's insanely sweet and so you know if you just made you know ice cream or iced milk out of like whole milk like to me that would just taste like ice cream you wouldn't need anything else but if you actually just make cream like take actual cream couple egg yolks in it to make it a custard and you turn that into ice cream you know you can just have that you have you know a bit of raw milk or something like that or whole milk or whatever um in there and had a bit of extra sweetness but it's not like a ton you know it's not ideal because you're still having carbs and you're still going to raise your insulin but it uh it's a lot better than then store-bought ice cream with all the the sugar and added random chemicals that are in there so that that would be my suggestions maybe transition to that and then maybe see if you can pop it off um you know coffee you know it depends on why you're drinking coffee if you just uh if you want the energy and the caffeine you can switch to caffeine pills which have the thing that you want and doesn't have 150,000 other chemicals that come with uh coffee if you uh like it just because you enjoy the ritual of it just something hot and disgusting in to taste in the mornings then you know you can try to transition that to something warm and not disgusting to taste like even you know bone broth or even just water people make um bulletproof water now where they blend like a stick of butter in hot water and just all this creamy foamy frothy butter water it's tastes it's actually sounds pretty horrific to say that out loud but it uh it actually tastes really nice it's just nice it's sort of nice creamy drink and it's nice and warm so it depends on what you're going for but you can sort of replace that with these other things you know eventually when you drop caffeine in general you know you might get some headaches not everyone does some people do and they they go away within the first few days and so then you you drink a lot of water because that can help uh help you not have headaches and then you um you T tend to feel a lot better A lot better you have a lot better energy much more consistent energy say these spikes and ups and downs you're just here just there all day and you know I was you know working till very late last night and I just my energy was right there you know the whole time I had as much energy at night as I had in the morning I worked all day came back had consultations and meetings and and podcasts and things like that and then I had a lot of work to do on the computer and then it was just you know was a lot of work and I was I was there the whole time so it's uh it's much better without the caffeine I mind and and So eventually you know you just sort of replace these things out you know and then and then at some point you just sort of stop and and just give it 30 days you know you can do anything for 30 days you know and so you know this is in the grand scheme of the entire span of your life 30 days is nothing you can just see you say okay how much better do I feel do I feel better at all did I feel better with the ice cream and coffee you won't but if you if you did it's like okay great you know you can go back to you can always add it in so you're having that bite-sized chunk of just say it's just 30 days you know there's no issues with it and you see what it is a lot of people most people find that wow I feel a lot better since dropping these sorts of things I found one guy who reported to me doing carnivore he dropped coffee for 30 days he added it back in he didn't see much difference so he said yeah all things being equal I'm just going to start drinking coffee again because I I enjoy it fine that's great but you know test it you know because you want to see that if you know test the contrast you know you just get that information and then you uh then you can see so you test that so you just try for 30 days you don't have anything and you just see how your body feels and then you know you can say like okay wow that's a big difference or maybe I didn't see too much of a difference maybe you add it back in you go oh there's the difference you know a lot of people uh you know go carnivore and then they say like wow I didn't even realize how good I felt until right now when I don't feel that good because I ate something stupid last night um you know and so that's you know that's a thing so U just getting that contrast and seeing for yourself I I think you'll you'll find that you feel a lot better without it and that you're you're glad that you stopped and then after 30 days you'll not want to go back i' I've only heard of one person that didn't do that so you know see how you go uh Jeff Watkins thank you for the Super Chat looks like there's another one down here so Jeff says wondering if this helps gout or lymphadema yeah it does so uh Dr Salsbury was using a red meat and water diet exclusively red meat and water diet since the 1800s to cure gout and so it's not red meat that causes gout it's all the other crap that comes with it and so some people find that they get like a flare up or two of gout since then but uh you know after going carnivore but then it settles down and goes away and doesn't come back there are other causes of gout besides uric acid crystals as well there's actually like five causes now some of those things are being called pseudo gout now and one of them is oxalates oxalates are a known cause of gout used to be called gout now pseudo gout um and um and so you know you can get like you know oxalate dumping and things like that potentially so down the road potentially you could get like a bit of a flare up uh and joint pain and things like that um but uh it would be likely that if you did an actual aspirate of the joint you would not find uric acid crystals you'd find oxalate crystals and um that's a difference but most people do this stuff uh you know just clinically they just oh that looks like gout that's gout that must be uric acid crystals well you don't know unless you actually stick a needle in there and find out uh most people don't do that and most doctors don't do that because it hurts and uh people don't want to do that they don't want to stick it's like it hurts enough and you're going to stab me you know like thanks Doc um but so they just oh yeah must be that here's some culture scen off you go uh but uh but no people people do uh do fix their gout by going carnivore and like I said maybe a flare or two maybe it's uric acid maybe it's something else and then then tends to go away and lymphadema yeah there've been more and more and more reports of people uh sorting that out very very easily with a ketogenic carnivore Di y Mia Neville thank you very much for the Super Chat do you know anyone who is Christian that could give a Biblical view on your ways I don't know well Dr kiltz is uh is quite religious and uh could potentially do that um I don't know who else in the I don't know who else sort of who has like a channel and things like that might be able to do that um well if people know if people know of anybody who might be able to give a sort of a Biblical interpretation of this uh you know please do uh put it in the chats and and and let us know and um can pop it up if we um if someone has a good idea um you know uh homesick Buckeye is a is a guy we become friends with he's actually a Seventh Day Adventist Church member and he sort of found that like yep nope this is wrong he not supposed to eat plants and that's not making us healthy and um so I don't know how much of a Biblical scholar he is and and how much of an interpretation he has done but I I do know that he um is Christian and um and he has a YouTube channel as well I think it is just homesick Buckeye um anyway he's a funny guy and he does he does some funny things on there and um he might be able to Dr kils might be able to um you know I've seen a lot of people commenting here if someone has is a Christian has a sort of biblical view on this you know maybe can have a discussion here um you know one thing that I point out to people is that um you know that the Seven Day Adventist say that we should be in the Garden of Eden diet we should be doing Garden of Eden diet but they say that yeah well we actually can't get B12 we lost that ability that was punishment for the original sin and now we we need Vitamin B12 so okay so what what were people supposed to do for the thousands and thousands and thousands of years up until we were able to supplement with B12 you know if we're all supposed to be on a on a vegan diet on a Garden of Eden diet and we can't be that doesn't really make sense it's not really consistent and um and that's what the school of Lifestyle medicine teaches you have to be on the Garden of Eden diet because School of Lifestyle medicine is um founded by the 7 Day Adventist Church who say this as well oh we need to eat what Adam and Eve ate in the in the Garden of Eden actually in the in the Ethiopian uh canonical texts they're very clear that Adam and Eve ate meat in the Garden of Eden and meat is eaten in heaven and then they come out of of the garden for eating a plant they get punished for eating an apple um I'd probably throw someone out of my house if they were audacious enough to eat an apple in front of me joking um and um and then you know Adam and Eve had Cain and Abel uh Cain gave uh uh you know his his crops as a sacrifice to God God didn't care for it Adam gave uh the meat from his herds he was a herder he gave a sacrifice of meat God was pleased and they don't say why it doesn't say why it doesn't say well you know your the sacrifice wasn't in your heart I mean a lot of people can interpret what they want but what it says in the Bible is that Abel gave to God sacrifice of meat God was pleased Cain gave a sacrifice of plant God was displeased that's all it says it doesn't say that Cain had hate in his heart or anything like that it just said pleased and displeased that's all it says and then Cain gets pissed off and kills Abel and um you know which is sort of the first first recorded incidents of you know vegan rage right they're just freaking out and trying to trying to smash somebody and and then what happened you know his disciples became horrible and plagued the Earth and they were just awful just a whole bunch of just angry vegans spread ACR across the world and these these horrible angry you know uh you know farmers and crop eaters and things like that and then what happened God sent the flood wiped out Humanity uh except for Noah he said you're a good guy save all these animals and now eat them that's that's literally what it said said you need to eat meat now this is stupid this is what going plant-based does to you this is bad you know didn't say that but if you want to interpret you know things if people are interpreting what was in Cain's heart and all that sort of  then I get to interpret what God meant by that is that he was that that people eating plants were bad for the bad for the planet and uh and you need to start eating meat and that was that was what God Said So and then like how many thousands of examples uh in the Bible are there of of eating meat and you need to eat the you know the fatted sacrifice the fatted calf and you know give this and do this and do that you know in the New Testament and the Old Testament it's all you know there's a lot of these directives about eating meat and things like that so I wouldn't worry about it oh carnivore Kip um might be a good a good one for that as well um and he's on he's has a YouTube channel also and yeah anybody anybody who thinks uh thinks of another one you know just stick it in stick it in the chat hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own questions please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at 6 p.m. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest of the Q&A pack fan uh thank you for the Super Chat I'm not seeing a question uh here it is uh Pacman says no question just really appreciate all the info started keto carnivore two years ago well great well you're very welcome and thank you for that thank you for the support and um I'm really glad that you're doing well and I hope that uh you know that's uh going well for you and people around you are seeing the benefits and getting interested in it as well so they can help themselves um Jeff Watkins thank you for the Super Chat I think we already did that one yes we did um Daniel Patrick Roy thank you very much for the generous super chats very kind of you jumped into carnivore high fat head first and about a week later got a nasty bout of Keto rash is the way forward to slowly dial back the carbs and eventually zero carbs uh from one week to the next you certainly can and if you find that that's better for you then then do that um a lot of people find that just jumping head first into it works really well because at some point you need to stop you need to convert over to a state of of nutritional ketosis or ketogenic metabolism a non-carbohydrate driven metabolism and um you know eventually you just need to do that you know sort of cutting out more and more things is um you know if you want to do that in a peace meal sort of way if that's easier for you if that works best for you then definitely do it a lot of people find that it's h easier for them to just jump straight into it because if they're just sort of slowly cutting things out they generally don't cut them all out and then they sort of go back to what they're doing but when they're in it like okay I'm just going to do this they throw out everything out of the house get out of side out of mind they're they're better able to do it when people are quitting smoking or or other sorts of things um cold turkey is is uh what seems to have the best results and so that can be helpful too you just get rid of all the plants and everything in your house just just cut it out it can be easier if you're getting a rash it's not necessarily because you're you're in ketosis it um it can be because you're actually losing fat and you have a lot of toxins in your fat they get stored there they then get released and your body can react to and you get a bit of rash they go away you know it does tend to go away on its own and so I wouldn't worry too much about that um I have spoken to keto carnivore dermatologists and and they they've seen that and that's what they think is going on so we don't know exactly what that that is but I don't think it's ever a bad time to stop eating poison and for your body to work in its natural way but you can have these weird sort of reactions your body's releasing different toxins detoxifying different sorts of things you can get weird reactions and and the the keto rash is definitely one of those things and so but it goes away and that's that's the whole idea so if you feel that transitioning slower works for you and sort of keeps that at Bay great but then if you stop eating all the carbs and you sort of start getting that again when you start losing fat you know that might be what that is and so but just you know uh just you know be be aware and be confident that it does go away and um and that it's it's just your body probably your body just clearing out these different stor toxins that uh you want to get away and so that that uh that's actually that's actually a good thing and it goes away it's temporary um narissa Anders thank you for the Super Chat can you speak about how to do carnivore diet properly specifically about how to get enough fat for someone allergic to beef and Cow Dairy um well really the only people with like a like a like an actual allergy allergy would be people with you know Alpha gal syndrome uh from the lone star tick bite and then you just eat other meat that doesn't that doesn't react and you just eat uh fatty versions of that meat uh you try to get the fat cuts from those meats um and uh and if you can't do Cow Dairy could you do goat dairy or sheep dairy or get you know butter from from different animals um or cream and things like that from you know goat cheese all these sorts of things I don't know if they I'm sure they they do goat milk I don't know if they do goat butter I've never seen it before it might be interesting to try but um Alpa even with Alpha gal syndrome um from what I understand from what I've seen apparently it's not permanent and uh and eventually you'll be able to start going back to eating red meat again so you know see how you go see if if that if this is a true allergy um you know then then it's then like like an alpha gal sort of thing it may be temp go back if it's not Alpha gal then there may not actually be a true allergy there it could just be something that you're sensitive to or reacting to or maybe something that that you've been conditioned to like red meat's bad Fat's bad oh I can't eat that and so you sort of react negatively to that so so try to figure out this is an actual reaction or or just a you know a condition sort of response and you just you don't really feel well when you eat that stuff because you've always been told your whole life that it's not good for you um either way just eat the meat that tastes good to you that that makes you feel the best and that you have access to it doesn't have to be beef it doesn't have to be butter U but those are very nutritious things that um that most people will be just fine on and the vast majority of people will be uh best on uh but if that's not you if if something else is better then you know uh eat it you know if you're saying allergic to beef what about lamb what about goat what about venison have those have the fattiest Cuts get the you know the trimmings from the lamb fat you know that that might get thrown out otherwise you can just cook that up fry that up plenty of fat on there and so uh yeah a lot of options uh jetting Chen thank you for the Super Chat thoughts on carbonated water W on Carnivore um I don't I don't think it's the the worst I don't think it's necessarily bad for you certainly if if it's un flavored if it's just the carbonated water and that helps you drink water I think that's probably fine you it has a bit of you know um S carbonous gas that um you know carboxylic acid sort of thing you is that going to be good for your enamel is that going to upset your stomach pH and things like that yeah maybe so I wouldn't necessarily have a ton of this stuff but every now and then uh it's probably fine as long as it's not flavored or sweetened uh Kylie kidle thank you for the Super Chat not seeing a question um I'm not seeing a question down the road either U maybe maybe if you put your question up just just put it in and um um put cues next to it and hopefully we'll be able to find it um and this little Ellie Melly um thank you for the Super Chat very sweet of you don't have to do that um just doing a super chat so that you know I was here in case you didn't see me say hi thank you for being a wonderful supportive person you are well you're very welcome and thank you for being very nice sweet little girl and um yeah nice to see you Tina Andre thank you very much for the super chat um again unfortunately not seeing oh there we go down there um question is I'm confused I eat very low carbs mostly meat butter and dairy if I eat uh too many carbs in the day will my cholesterol stick to my arteries um I don't I don't think cholesterol is is the causitive factor for atherosclerosis in general um so I don't think that that's something that uh you need to worry about carbohydrates themselves do bad things to your body uh raise insulin that you know and uh raised insulin has over a 100 different effects on the body and uh and that can be very damaging to the body um so you know it's not um it's not the cholesterol doing it but the carbs going up damaging the cholesterol knocking off Apple b00 those things having to be picked up by scavenger macroasia and things like that can make these foam cells then you get damaged to your your artery Linings can these foam cells get stuck in there all these sorts of things there's a lot of theoreticals we don't actually know the direct cause of this but we you know uh I I think we do know that high levels of cholesterol don't cause heart disease and don't cause atherosclerosis and so um you know it would be the carbohydrates damaging your body and um and and potentially you know other sorts of things damaging your body high cortisol high homocystine and other and nicotine these sorts of things all can all damage the the lining of your arteries if you don't have that damage in the first place nothing can get stuck in there anyway so you do the things that that don't damage that so you don't have any nicotine products you keep your homocysteine Low by keeping your B12 and folate high or in a good level and um and then you know avoiding carbs and things like that that can you know cause glycation Advanced glycation end products and other sorts of damage to the body that's very very deleterious the those are the things you want to do and so I I wouldn't I yeah I wouldn't worry too much about um the cholesterol side of things the cholesterol is the normal the cholesterol is supposed to be there can the can the carbs damage the cholesterol yes does that then cause atherosclerosis not necessarily cause but it could be used in that process but not necessarily you know there there are studies showing that in aaa's aortic ABD abdominal aortic aneurysms with a whole bunch of plaque and buildup they actually found plant steril of plant cholesterol in there so actually macroasia hold on to our cholesterol very tightly but they just spit up plant sterols very quickly the plant version of cholesterol because it's like that's not normal don't want that crap and it's um and so it could be that these macras are going in there it's not they're depositing our cholesterol even though they're filled up foam cells could be that they're spitting out the plant stero and that's what's getting in there so we don't actually know one way or the other so I don't think that that cholesterol will ever cause this as a problem it's just it's just a scapegoat by the sugar companies and I think we just need to ignore that and stop thinking about it in that context and do think about things about carbohydrates sugar alcohol seed oils inflammation homocystine all these other sorts of things nicotine all these other sorts of things but you know in the 19 1920s and before four out of four out of five men smoked and yet heart disease was nearly non-existing in the 1800s was similar and was non-existent you know um as far as heart attacks deaths from heart attacks reported in America non-existent in the 1800s a lot of people smoked so you know does nicotine damage these vessels have we seen evidence of atherosclerosis going back hundreds of years yeah we have first heart attack proven on autopsy though was in 1912 in America there wasn't a single case before that in America a few in Europe in the 1800s in the entire Century of the 1800s and one that I found in the 1700s but reports of atherosclerosis we could see oh look there's some buildup there right um so you know other things other plants and and you know going back to ancient Egypt you know they definitely had signs of this stuff they weren't eating a lot of meat they were eating tons of grain press seed oils and uh beer lots of booze and they had man boobs and and beer bellies and the iish Papyrus showed that they talked about the symptoms that that you would see when some right before someone dropped out of a heart attack and they described diabetes and Alzheimer's you know they they had these diseases there and they was all eating lots of this sort of garbage and now that we've gone much more plant-based plant Focus processed plant food Focus we're getting a lot more of these diseases as well that we really haven't seen in this abundance since uh ancient eypt when they were eating just a ton of this stuff and um that was actually an old saying in ancient Egypt ancient EG Egyptian proverb was uh one quarter of what you eat uh feeds you and three quarters of what you eat feed your doctor because you're eating that you're getting sick and now you're going to the doctor and paying him to fix you they knew it back then you know uh hypocrates let food be thy medicine medicine thy food hypocrates also said uh before you before you heal someone ask them first if they're willing to give up that which is making them sick right so we have known this for a long time that the food causes the disease um it's just we have had I don't know how many billions of dollars have been spread around maybe in hundreds of billions at this point over the last 150 years uh in propaganda and marketing and fake studies and payoffs and bribes and all these sorts of things um to to make us you know forget something we've known for thousands of years and had hard evidence of and still have hard evidence of so uh I I don't think we should think about this in the context of cholesterol anymore I think we think about it in the context of eating an inappropriate diet you make cholesterol don't worry about cholesterol uh you don't need you you don't need excess carbs you make you make all the carbs you need you drop those cut out the sugar you cut out the seed oils you cut out the things that didn't even exist in nature 150 years ago like these seed oils and random chemicals that we just putting into food and and cosmetics and things like that you just don't just don't put that stuff in your in your ecosystem and just eat what people have been eating for millions of years and get on with your life and it'll be a much better life for that okay roach thank you very much for the Super Chat do you know of any studies relating to motor neuron disease and a zerocarb Diet uh not much information and definitely no help out there in regards to it thanks I've I've only come across like a few things they weren't like very robust um I have anecdotally seen a few people that have said that they have experienc improved symptoms is it that they're improving their motor neuron disease or is it because they're just improving all these other ways as well and that's making it a lot easier to deal with a motor neuron disease can't say at this point um don't have too much information on that unfortunately but the thing is is what the hell else is going to work we don't really have anything so sure as hell worth a try and it is going to help help them in a lot of other ways which will make them a lot more healthy in general which is exactly what you need you need to be as healthy as you can be when you're dealing with something like that and so it's it's definitely worth trying out and I would be as as as laser focused on this as possible of just very high fat red meat cut out everything else eat organs uh along with that make sure you're getting all the nutrients that you need you don't have any sort of um uh gaps in that um meat has everything you need um but the meat that we're eating isn't Wild game anymore it's not wild Mammoth right the Inuits don't really eat organs but they're eating Wild game right traditionally right and so that's much more nutrient Den so I would um I would do that and it sure as H worth a try and hopefully it's uh it helps and actually helps with the m andd and not just makes them feel better while dealing with it hopefully just makes it go away that would be the ideal and uh please let us know if this is yourself or someone else let us know how it goes let us know what uh your experience is or their experience is because that's we need all the information we can get on these sorts of things especially things like motor neuron disease tkm uh 7211 thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr chafy do you think taking a beef collagen supplement on a carnivore diet would be beneficial or just another overpriced supplement thank you yeah I probably just waste some money probably don't need that if you're on a carnivore diet you're going to get tons of collagen if you really want more collagen you sort of eat the cartilagenous parts of of uh the meat you know like the ends of chickens or chewing up chicken you know um cartilage and things like that um the the more tough bits of of beef where you're slow cooking them and you're sort of breaking down that collagen you get a ton from that so slow cooked meats uh slow cooked tough Meats you're going to get a lot of collagen from that if you're making like bone broth beef broth you know something that um that I heard the other day was it from Natasha camel McBride maybe Dr Natasha camel McBride world-renowned neurosurgeon we're just calling her Natasha but um she did the gaps diet I think it was her who said that that like bone broth was like Poor Man's beef broth because you want want you don't just want the bones you want the meat on the bones in the in there and you you get out all those nutrients from the meat and the bones and that's that's much better so uh you can do that you know you get you get plenty of collagen you know from doing something like that you don't need to you don't need to take um collagen supplements you'll get plenty of collagen just from from eating just meat and if you want more collagen you get the slow cooked tougher pieces and bone or beef broth with the with the bones in need in it and you'll be fine Amanda kkin thank you for the super or not a super chat thank you for the question H hi Dr chaffy carnivore three years I have cerebral poy quadriplegia I have had I consistent loss of function for four years I'm really sorry to hear that I increased my fat intake recently and gained function uh what happened that's amazing um well I I can't say exactly why you've been losing function um you know cereal poy is is by definition something supposed to be a stable lesion so generally if you're losing function it's just your body's atrophying and just sort of slowing down as we age and that can certainly happen could be you know different sorts of things you're eating uh cornivore for three years is fantastic and um and but your your brain and your nervous system are made out of fat they're made out of cholesterol and you need that fat and cholesterol from the meat that you're eating like DHA EPA so it may be that you weren't getting enough fat you weren't getting enough fat for your body and to to support your uh neurological system and so uh that's great I mean you know don't look give tus in the mouth you know just see like okay don't know what's going on here but just I'm happy about it eat a lot of meat eat a lot of fat don't eat anything else and um that's amazing that you're that you're getting more function I have heard of other people with shubal poy uh sort of getting a bit less and and then the rigidity being lessened so they don't have to get like botox injections which is amazing and so um it it' be interesting to see you know how much improvement you get a lot of fat so you want to get like two grams of fat to one gram of protein focus on red meat if you can and um and you know butter if you if you tolerate it you know try that and um you're getting that really high amounts of of fat lot of really healthy 3s the DHA and the EPA from grass-fed butter grass-fed beef or you know other sources of animal fats that that are high in Omega-3s and um hopefully this just keeps getting better there's probably going to be a limit on how much improvement you get just because you know there is what just the definition of cerebral py is that there's there's a stable lesion and a p basic some damage of some form from some reason from some cause that's caused a bit of damage and and um and um that probably isn't going to go away but the rest of the brain and nervous system can potentially help um uh you know carry some of the burden and and and and at least uh make things run as well as they can so hopefully they do and uh that's great that's great news and I'm really excited to see how much how much uh more Improvement you get David uh vaison thank you very much for the Super Chat I have stage three or four chronic kidney disease I'm considering carnivore diet would that be safe presently I fairly tired and have mile ankle edema yeah I think it'd be exactly what you need and it's there's no situation that I can think of that um a a proper biologically appropriate diet for our species would ever be a bad idea I can't think of any anyway so anybody in any situation any issue it should improve on a proper biologically appropriate diet for our species and all the best evidence shows that that's a carnivore diet a high fat carnivore diet and so um yes I not only thing it would be safe I think it would be really important for you to do that um it's the plants that are damaging your kidneys you know sorry to say but um you know there's a lot of plant toxins that are nephrotoxic like oxalates but there are other and um you know just high blood sugar and glucose you know this damages directly the little small little structures in the kidneys it makes them so they don't work as well and so you're getting away from that you're only giving your body what it needs you're not get taking any in anything that's going to harm it and uh increasing your protein does not damage your kidneys that is a myth that is a lie um that is something that um has been roundly disproven the studies actually show the data actually shows that as you increase protein you increase kidney function so um you know maybe look in the chat here um people if you people that have had experience with that have improved their kidney function you know write in the chat there's just I mean there's thousands of people all my patients that that have um kidney issues they all improve on a carnivore diet I've seen people you know with with worse kidney function than that um go back to pretty much normal function and in in a matter of months is pretty remarkable so yes I a it is safe and B I think it'll be beneficial hey everyone if you need a little extra help getting started on a carnivore diet and my online resources that I have for free aren't enough for you you can go to www.how carnivore decom and sign up for a 30-day carnivore challenge where you'll have online Resources Group support weekly Zoom meetings as well as the ability to chat live with myself Simon Lewis and the others in the challenge who can help you and support you and give you extra advice and help you along the way so if that sounds like something that would be beneficial to you then please go to howt carnivore docomo George Converse thank you very much for the Super Chat what are your thoughts um oh and also we should we should stop the super chats here because I've got to go in about 20 minutes so I think definitely got definitely got enough here uh to contend with so uh yeah we'll just U maybe no more Super chats guys I don't want to I don't want to miss any of these uh what are your thoughts on getting um use on using skincare that is plant-based skincare or any or any Animal product skincare or not needed at all generally not much needed but I Tallow tallow's fantastic emu is fantastic you know I partnered with stone and spear Tallow you links are in the description of all this um they're great you know I just use just the normal sort of Tallow stuff no scents or anything like that never found anything that work better on my skin nothing than animal fat especially Tallow in particular Tallow comes from Latin for sebum Tallow is the Latin for sebum which is our normal skin oils because they found that it was very similar to our skin oils and so that's just sort of you wash soap you just strip off all the natural oils that are supposed to be there and what you have damaged dry skin now you put Tallow back on it it's all good nice shiny healthy skin it's fantastic so yeah I would I would I would not use plant-based skincare products or Oils I don't want that stuff in my body and it was a good uh saying that someone said which was never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat because uh in 20 minutes it's going to be in your bloodstream anyway so uh yeah don't do that so I I just put Tallow just use Tallow animal fat because I happy to eat that too Roger J Shankar thank you so much for the Super Chat for the very generous Super Chat it's very kind of you greetings from India can carnivore cure eczema is solic late uh in food related I'm not I'm not sure if solic lates are a cause of eczema they can certainly cause a lot of other problems uh but yes yeah you can absolutely uh get rid of eczema on a carnor d many people have maybe some people maybe you know put in the comments you know have you have you helped your exema rosacea psoriasis other sorts of skin conditions uh yes thousands and thousands and thousands of people that I have heard of personally I've done this and I'm sure hundreds of thousands millions of people around the world at this point uh at that point oh but it's an anecdote it's only five million anecdotes you know yeah sure what happens what matters is what happens in real life and when anybody tells you oh there's only anecdotes for cornivore diet it's called because the most heavily studied the most rigorously studied diet on Earth is an animal-based diet is the a carnivore diet with a side salad the ketogenic diet ketogenic well you can do any kind of ketogenic diet well no because what we were talking about are the kinds of ketogenic diets that they actually do in these studies and yes you get rid of carbohydrates you have to replace it with protein and fat but they don't replace it with plant proteins and fats because it's next to impossible to get a proper diet uh without well you have to have tons of supplements from the plant-base and you have to you know drink you know having a lot of plant oils and Seed oils and the other sorts of things which is not ideal and so they don't none of those studies do that they have thousands of studies looking at meat based high fat meat-based ketogenic diets so it's a lot of meat and some non-carb vegetables right so it's carnivore with a side salad so the most rigorously studied diet on Earth is a meat-based an animal-based diet high animal-based diet and high F animal-based diet that's the most rigorously studied diet on Earth and it's one that has been shown again and again in randomized control trials and and direct Interventional trials to be the most beneficial and efficacious for multiple Health outcomes and uh conditions so uh no it's not anecdotal that those are the facts a meat-based ketogenic diet is an extraordinarily healthy diet for multiple Health outcomes so just call every time you hear that uh especially online because that's just oh it's just anecdotal it's just an no it damn well isn't and you damn well know that so they're trying to pretend that um that we don't actually have the data on this uh but we do David Walker thank you for the Super Chat hey I'm a 21-year-old male trying to reverse bigo with carnivore how long would it take for me to see results are there other things besides carnivore I can do um I don't know if there's other things besides carnivore I mean just sort of just avoiding you know other sorts of unarm unhelpful things in your environment lowering stress getting better sleep those are definitely helpful I would get in the sun actually um obviously you don't want to maybe expose too much those areas that that are that are depleted of melanin but you know still getting sun is is good for you and um it it just depends you know there are a lot of different people that I've spoken to you know after a few months they start seeing that the Vitiligo fill in and um you it's an autoimmune issue autoimmune issues go away on Carnivore diets and so you know if only Michael Jackson knew about carnivore diet back in the 80s you know wouldn't have had to wear that glove and uh do all the weird things that he did but um it's uh it goes away fairly quickly and so uh it might be different for you any autoimmune issue you want to stick to red meat and water high fat red meat and water beef and lamb that's it don't have anything else optimize your sleep and prioritize your sleep don't oh yeah I'll get you whatever I can deal with it don't do that get eight hours of sleep at night reduce your stress get out in the sun exercise do all these healthy things that we all know are healthy and then add in the other thing that we the missing link to that Health which is a carnivore diet and um yeah in a few months I'd expect that to see significant Improvement if anyone else has Vitiligo maybe share their experiences as well Miss e thank you very much for the Super Chat I have Lupus new ultrasound shows fatty liver I have been strict carnivore for six months Li diet for three should I adjust fat and protein could it be damaged liver due to lupus mixed diagnosis fatty liver uh well look all the all these things are possible but um you know the important thing is to know you know what was your status before you started carnivore you know you have to see where you were before and where you are after to know what Direction things are going did you have fatty liver before and um is it better or worse now did you not have it before and now you have it if you haven't had it before and now you have it that would be extremely rare I've only seen people reverse fatty liver when they go on a carnivore diet um but if you're having other sorts of things if you're having medication medications that can damage your liver um maybe Dam you know things for your lupus that can potentially damage your liver there's a lot of things that we take damage the liver you methre say destroys your liver but we give this to a lot of people with autoimmune issues and so you have to get monthly you know blood test for liver function when you go on things like meth methotraxate um so you know all those things matter so I think the thing to do is you know and there's some suggestion of a you know that that Dr lustic talked about that that there are some concerns that he has with grain finished meat and that they're high in Branch chain amino acids and that um sort of excess Branch chain amino acids can are associated with fatty liver disease but it's an association there's no causation there and there are a lot of people that just do grain finished meat and don't get fatty liver in fact reverse fatty liver but that's a that's a theoretical and if if that's something you know you're just you know working on your differential like okay what could be contributing to this you know maybe go to the grass-fed options and going to grass-fed and grass finished U meat options like beef and lamb and seeing how you go certainly cutting out the chicken the farmed Fish Factory farmed chicken and pork and even eggs because they have really high linolic acid you know is that is that going to be a driver for fatty liver uh potentially so you know if you're having a very high Len acid things or things are high in BCAAs you know I sort of looked at some of those studies and they were just sort of they're just correlative and they weren't like that strong of a correlation so I'm not sort of I I'm not really convinced by that um but you know uh you know that's that's a that's something to think about if uh you can't find any other other anything else so uh that's what I would suggest you know just get you know try to clean things up in all these different ways just get more tests right so you need to you know your medications can cause these problems other things can cause these problems you could have had more of a problem before and now you're just seeing the results of that after the fact and that it actually could be improving you don't know so you need multiple data points to see what the trend is and if it is trending in the wrong direction then those are some areas to look at but that's typically the opposite of what I see I I've never seen someone developed fatty develop fatty liver from going Cor ever and um and but my patients uh I'm you know I tell them you need to eat a lot of fat fat does not cause fatty liver just doesn't um carbs do excess carbs do I mean that's how we get you know we don't we don't make F gr by feeding U you know geese a whole bunch of fat we get it by stuffing a tube down their throat and pouring grains down there that's how you get fuagra that's fatty liver that's literally French for fat liver and that's how you get that you don't get it if fat did it give them a whole bunch of fat well you're only going to absorb what your body wants and that's why the saying goes uh that's quicker than fat through a goose they eat a lump of fat goes right out in a few minutes right it's h it's very quick and so um you know it's not uh it's not that's not something that's going to cause fatty liver because you're not your body's not going to absorb it if it doesn't want it just that's how phys ology Works um so think about medications think about the other sorts of things ways to clean up your everything and get more data points uh because you could very well be getting better and this not be even an issue but first protocol of medications uh second second is looking at the trend line and then um thinking about other options from there good luck with that I'm sure you'll be fine Cal hunting thank you for for the Super Chat thanks for all your help having a hard time kicking my my raw whole cream and raspberries but uh I am down to 10 raspberries well look you're making progress um you know and you know some whole cream and and 10 raspberries and you're not eating anything else you're still doing better than 99.999% of people out there so you're already doing a great job and you know who knows you you get a little bit more down a little bit more down and eventually just get rid of them see how you go for a month see how you feel you know if if the raspberries weren't you if you didn't feel that they were doing all that much harm to you and you enjoy them you know you add them back in you don't see anything really negative you know that's fine you know it's just uh it's worth checking you know but you're doing really good you know you're you're you're down to 10 raspberries I mean like you know who can say that most people can't you most people are eating just high octane garbage so you know don't don't sweat it you're doing great Steve large thank you for the Super Chat I just want to thank you uh for all I've learned in the past 106 days of carnivore feel amazing well that's awesome uh you you're very welcome I'm glad that that it's uh helpful and congratulations on uh on feeling amazing and um you know eating proper food and getting out of this entrenched system of of illness uh and thanks for sharing Jessica Goan Goan sorry um this has changed my life um well thank you for the Super Chat first of all she says this has changed my life I'm 40 weeks pregnant baby number two two-year-old daughter has a rare denovo mutation husband has mental health stuff and my migraines and inflammation are gone everyone's just better thank you wow that's amazing thank you so much for sharing that um and um that's I'm I'm so happy for you I'm so glad for you and uh that's amazing that you're that your baby and um you and your husband are doing better and good luck with the pregnancy and baby number two you're going to be a carnivore baby and uh and uh very excited uh for them because they're going to be doing a lot better than their peers and then being actually healthy for once instead of sick everyone's sick and that's not that's not what you want to see so thank you for that Andrew gulia kerus uh thank you for the Super Chat and Andrew says love your advice well thank you very much I appreciate that I'm glad it's glad it's helpful Chuck thank you for the Super Chat what is your stance on electrolytes on Carnivore um most people get everything they need from from meat they eat when you're transitioning early on and your insulin levels are coming down your body has to sort of readjust to that because higher insulin draws in more electrolytes and so actually your kidneys actually have to overcompensate and get rid of more electrolytes to overcompensate for insulin which is going up and it's going up and it's going up and it's going up in people when you're an infant when you're a newborn your insulin is very low you know so I'm going to start eating this these high octane carbs it starts going up and up and fasting insulin goes from five where it should be I had a patient last month fasting insulin was 72 should never be above nine never right and so um obviously you know people are going to you're K have to compensate in that direction to actually get rid of more electrolyt so you don't get too much sodium pottassium and so on in your blood because that can kill you if you have too much potassium potass too much potassium does kill you that's lethal injection uh when you they neiti someone and they give them a high dose of potassium chloride and that's so much potassium just stops their heart so you know if you're not getting rid of more and more electrolytes when your insulin's at 72 fasting you're going to die right so your body compensates in One Direction can compensate back the other direction when that but then when that insulin is coming down because it takes decades to get up to a 72 but it takes months to come down to normal you know it's quicker and so your your kidneys may draw off too much before it sort of compensates back so sometimes people need a bit of electrolytes sometimes if they're getting lightheaded and dizzy when they stand up that can be from a bit of dehydration due to a bit of electrolyte loss so you add some more salt drink some more water usually sorts it out usually your body compensates within a few weeks might take longer if you at a 72 and it takes longer to come down so just see what that what that's doing you sure of get that keto flu weird Li headedness things like that just think that could possibly be uh due to a bit of dehydration and electrolytes other than that once you're adapted once your body's back in normal homeostasis you don't need them almost always I really not seen people need them after that uh Bobby quinnn thank you for the Super Chat um if Synthroid stops reduction of endogenous T4 how can one know if the carnivore diet is helping thyroid function while on T4 monotherapy it doesn't necessarily stop it I mean it it tells your it gives you enough and then your your brain says okay we don't need to stimulate this as much with uh TSH but um but you you can actually see it go up and so you can actually see it go up a bit and up a bit and up a bit and so you can actually reduce down the dose and you see it come up a bit and up a bit and you reduce the dose and you come up a bit and up a bit and uh and and I and you see that and so um you know you see people with thyroid issues uh able to reduce their dose because their thyroid function is going up and up and up like okay you don't need as much of the Synthroid right or the Le thyroxin or the thyroxin you know it's all the same stuff uh just by different names and so no it doesn't completely suppress it I mean it does yeah to an extent but your body will start making more of stuff and you can see that and so you get to the point where you're seeing like oh okay my thyroid function is getting better or one thing is your TSH right so if your TSH is um you know a three or something like that but you have sort of normal uh T4 T3 T3 is really the more important one because that's what's actually active in your body and you'll always convert T4 into T3 so you can have enough T4 and and be bottomed out on T3 and not feeling too well but if your T4 is 14 your TSH is three and then you're doing carnivore and all of a sudden your T4 is still 14 but your TSH is8 well that means your body is not having to work as hard your thyroid is not having to work as hard to make the same amount of thyroid hormone right so that means it's working better so it's less stimulus is providing the same result so that means it's getting better and so that's a good sign right there that uh that things are getting better and you could potentially come down off the thyroid medication and your body would just take take up the slack no problem okay there's a comment here from smiling for you um directed towards Little Ellie Melly um who said um and first of all for people have no idea what I'm talking about so uh you my girlfriend El Marie when we were traveling in in um overseas uh sometimes when try people trying to say her name they um that's how they were pronounced it they didn't know how to say like El Marie they say it Ellie Melly is it Ellie Melly you know so it's just sort of a joke they called her Ellie Melly and so uh so now I call her that um so Ellie Melly I did not know that you and Dr chaffy have a cooking channel and even though I haven't made it yet those dumplings with the chicken skin look so good and I've shared with others well that's cool yeah no so we have um have something on Instagram it's called kitchen carnivore and uh something same name on YouTube as well uh we have sort of more videos on the Instagram one as opposed to the the YouTube one but we have both and so people can check those out if they want to have some some ideas dumplings make like chicken skins you get them from the Butcher and they just throw them out they actually pay to have them taken away so don't let them charge you too much for those um and uh and this where we put the little meat in the middle wrap them up you can put a bit of egg on it and just sort of air fry and it crisp that and they'll seal that off and then you can deep fry it uh in like Tallow or lard uh or you can sort of tie a little bit of string around it and and deep fry those things as well um but there's a lot of other recipes that we have on there also if you want to check out and we're going to start making more of these things we've just been uh a bit laxed recently but we're starting to post more on there now uh Chase thank you for the Super Chat uh started beef and water only a month ago and feel amazing with the exception of a mocha which has a good amount of sugar and caffeine in it every time I cut it out I get nasty headaches any advice well you can well generally that's from the caffeine you could potentially be getting some from the sugar drink a lot of water that's a number one for combating headaches in general you know major trigger for headaches is dehydration so make sure you get enough water maybe transition to uh uh caffeine pills uh because you can get rid of all that other garbage and sugar and nonsense but you still get the caffeine you won't have the headaches um and then you can sort of slowly come down on the caffeine if you are getting those nasty headaches what you can do is you can take like half a caffeine pill like you know 50 milligram sort of half a Noto sort of thing and or 25 or something like that and you take that with a lot of water and um and that can that can reduce your headache and um and then sort anytime you get sort of one of those caffeine headaches you just take a bit of caffeine just to take that edge off and it's going to be less and less and less as you go and so every time you'll need a bit less and that's a way you can just sort of uh you know so wean off of the caffeine without getting massive headaches so good luck with that uh Leon Flores thank you for the Super Chat could we still eat three to five hours before bedtime should I force myself to eat right after a workout I didn't feel hungry after my workout today I ate four hours prior yeah you I mean first of all yes you can eat before bedtime I don't think there's a problem with that unless you're eating carbohydrates and that interrupts your blood sugar your insulin your melatonin and your growth hormone when you sleep and so you get things out of balance there um and uh I try to eat after I work out sort of think of it as like you you're just working out you're hunting down you're taking down an animal you fight it you kill it and now you get to eat it and so you know there there's there's thoughts one way you know every Every Which Way about you know is it a benefit you get this anabolic window after you work out or is it is that you know or whatever I don't know don't much care but you know I feel I feel good eating right after I work out and I do it in that regard and um for that reason and um but just do what's right for you you know if you don't want to eat after workout don't just eat when you're hungry eat when it you know things taste good eat until it stops tasting good and you can definitely eat before bedtime if you're only eating meat um and and yeah if you're going to eat you know if you ate four hours before your your workout yeah you probably don't need to eat all that much um I tend to avoid eating uh much before I work out just because it tends to give a worse workout because I'm I'm much more sedate and sedentary I'm like ah you know my body's saying like oh hey you know we got our energy for the day you don't need to go work for it now um but also it's um you know you're dedicating a whole bunch of blood and resources to your intestines it's now not available to your muscle and brain so you get tired you get lethargic and that's normal and you go into a rest and digest mode and that's normal too uh four hours is pretty good I generally would leave like five hours if I can before eating or not or eat like a half meal if I really need to eat something during the day before I worked out um but H just see how you go you know whatever works for you is really what you want to do I wouldn't worry too much about it as long as you're eating the right thing and enough of it uh meat fueled Mass thank you for the Super Chat can I invite you or or pay to invite you on a podcast you can certainly invite me you don't have to pay me happy happy to do it so just email me uh at Anthony chaffy gmail.com it's in the description here as well and um yeah happy happy to do that not a problem chick thank you for the Super Chat can carnivore help alpha 1 anti-tp and deficiency since it seriously affects the liver aat is uh made in your liver uh to help protect the lungs thanks that's a very good question I don't I don't know one way or the other I haven't seen uh any any data on that one way or the other um but one thing you can do is remember we said earlier um the most robustly studied die in the world is a ketogenic diet and a ketogenic diet is absolutely applicable to a carnivore diet because carnivore diets are ketogenic diet and they're meat-based ketogenic diets and that's what all these studies are is meat-based ketogenic diets and so if you go into PubMed or Google Scholar Google Scholars actually works great and so you can you can use that as well um just put in ketogenic ketogenic diet and you know uh alpha 1 andri and deficiency and see it there might there might well be a study that's out there it's just they don't get publicized because there's no product behind it the product is don't eat carbs that's the product it's just people actually wanting to learn and know and and forward human knowledge that's real science uh the fake science is all this product mobilization and marketing that uh Food and Drug companies do to push out these studies to support their product that's not real science that's marketing and that's propaganda so uh take a look take a look on on Pub metet or Google scholar and just look at for uh for you know ketogen diet and alpha1 antirion deficiency and uh and see if there's anything there there might be either way it's worth a try it's going to help your it's going you know eating properly is going to help you in a lot of other ways but just remember any sort of question that you guys have for does this help with this sort of thing does carnivore help with this you know take a look and and and search around for ketogenic diets helping that thing because if ketogenic diets going to help it a carnivore diet will help it and probably help it more because it's a better ketogenic diet it's it's the the gold standard ketogenic diet and um any any ketogenic diet studies are applicable to a carnivore diet because carnivore diets are animal-based ketogenic diets and that's where to study so uh yeah take a look see what you think and let us know because that' be good to know too Sheldon Martin thank you very much for the Super Chat to the question about natural pain relief Wim Hoff breathing method works wonders for pain relief it doesn't cost money it's just breathing that's a very good point so those sorts of breathing exercises like whm Hof meditation just you know being able to sort of Mind Over Matter your pain I mean think about it um you know that way you go into an ice bath or a cold shower and you're like oh my God if you freak out it's going to be more it's going to be much worse of a situation but you're working on your breathing you're doing these sorts of things and you're just like okay yeah I'm fine this is cool and um yeah she can definitely do that so uh yeah that that's a very good suggestion thank you Sheldon cats are nice meow thank you very much for the Super Chat uh I was diagnosed with cutaneous lupus can carnivore diet or reverse this thank you for all you do any any and all autoimmune diseases that I've ever seen have improved dramatically on a carnivore diet you need to be as strict as you can with just uh beef and water so or or really just red meat and water so um it's uh it's important for that there's a lot of reasons for that basically you're not getting in all the garbage plants and things like that that can come in um when you are eating um when you're eating uh pigs and chicken they're being fed things that or fish that are being fed things that they're not supposed to eat either they can't filter the stuff out properly and it gets into their tissue and their meat so that can get into you and that high linolic acid can can potentially cause problems as well so um yes it can definitely help lupus and uh any form of lupus and any form of autoimmune issue Ive never seen an autoimmune issue not helped by a just a red meat and water diet so it can definitely help and it should and I hope it does and good luck with that need to reduce stress need to optimize sleep need to take care of those other things that are important for your health as well um meat food is a major part of that it's something that we do every day generally and you just get constant inputs of harm you're getting constant buildup of harm or you can go the other way you constant uh buildup of health and so getting rid of those toxic chemicals getting rid of those nasty things getting in all this healthy stuff and you're going to start reducing your uh antibodies and your autoimmune issues are going to go away andh yeah good luck with that I'm excited for you anybody in the chat if you suffer with autoimmune issues or uh lupus in particular because I had a couple lupus questions today uh please do put that in the chat and say tell us what your experiences has been and maybe some things that that tripped you up and some things you had to do to change to make sure that you got a good result because that's very helpful for people when they're trying to figure this out uh Stacks thank you for the Super Chat four months carnivore um never had diarrhea till this week um I believe it's by acid will this go away I started it started after I consumed air fried beef fat and pork R could just be that you're having more fat than your body can absorb bile acid helps you absorb fat I mean the bile helps you absorb fat it shouldn't cause diarrhea if it's um you're eating more fat than your body can absorb then it's just going to go out as lose stools that's that overflow mechanism that's why I say you it's physiologically impossible to overeat fat because you just won't absorb it you know it's not that your body excretes your excess fat through your stools no I'm not saying that I'm saying that the fat that you eat your body absorbs what it wants and what it has bile for and what is left over in your gut doesn't get into your body it goes out into your stools and so that's generally what people have uh loose stools and so you started eating more beef fat and pork rinds there's more fat there and so that's going to uh maybe be a lot more than your body can absorb um so you can reduce that now if you are taking anything else that could affect this uh you need to you want to drop those things too and see how that affects it so coffee tea caffeine in general any non- sugar sweetener like Stevia M fruit sugar xotl all these sorts of things arrol um which is M fruit sugar all these sorts of things uh will cause diarrhea um magnesium supplements too much of that can cause loose stools and medications many medications but you know a very common one is metformin that can um cause diarrhea and so at least speed up your stools and so that can cause you know serious diarrhea and things like that um and so get rid of all those if you're only doing meat and water pull back on the fat you added more fat and you got consequence that people typically see when they eat more fat than the body can absorb so it could be a combination of coffee and more fat but you know if you're not doing anything else it's just the just the increased fat pull back on the fat okay thank you Jimmy for the Super Chat this will be the the last question guys and um then we're going to wrap up because I've got to I've got to hop on another call um thank you very much Jimmy uh just got uh nude work done n o o work done and was told that uh maybe blood work hoping that's blood work got represent his blood work just got blood work done and was told I'm pre-diabetic and have high cholesterol doctor recommended eating soy products fruit uh veggies whole grains nuts seeds beans what do you think I think they probably that would probably kill you uh eventually anyway um no that's the last thing you want to do in your entire life especially I mean Jesus Christ yeah eat eat grains and and seeds and things like that if you're a diabetic I mean why why would someone suggest that this is a consequence of you high fix your hyper high blood sugar by eating more sugar like great great great idea doc thank you for that um no so if you go carnivore you will not be diabetic anymore you won't be pre-diabetic or diabetic you be normal because diabetes is not a disease it's um it's a uh toxicity it's carbohydrate poisoning basically uh there's other things that can do too but um blood sugar's too high it's the end of the story so so don't add in more sugar don't add fuel to the fire uh soy is is horrific you know that stuff is just you know just tons of estrogen and nonsense in there seeds and nuts and beans tons of lectins that can kill you if you don't process them right and uh yeah tons of Cyanide and seeds yeah great great call there um high cholesterol according to whom that's a value judgment you know we don't have any experiment Al data showing that certain levels of of cholesterol is good or bad in fact I in fact the the population data shows that higher levels of Co of cholesterol total cholesterol and higher LDL cholesterol is beneficial and people live longer right so uh watch my video on the truth about cholesterol and heart disease and then my interview with Dr Nick norwitz um who was involved with Dave Feldman they did the lean mass hyperresponders uh data they showed people with keto carnivore diets with so-called high cholesterol um for an average of 4.7 years actually had a reduction in their atheroscler sclerosis right so no this does not cause a heart disease diabetes can diabetes is a major risk factor for for heart disease diabetes doesn't come from eating meat in fact in the car in the carnivore study out of Harvard with 2,000 patients 100% of the diabetics 100% of them came off 100% of their injectable diabetes medications and improve their blood sugar and reverse Di and lot of them reverse their diabetes entirely so your doctor means well but that's that's the old propaganda that that he's still or he or she is still uh a victim of and unfortunately a lot of people are still on that that's fine we can forgive them their ignorance but uh that's not good for you to uh to eat a whole bunch of that garbage you want to eat whole Meats lot of fat and animal fats and no sugar no grains and nothing on that list that your doctor told you to eat um and you'll be fine I wouldn't I wouldn't worry uh necessarily about your cholesterol uh because cholesterol was a scapegoat for the sugar companies it was never the cause of heart disease and uh that's a fact they said that not me it's published in the journal American Medical Association 2016 uh their own internal memos detailing how they paid off three Harbor professors to falsify data and published fraudulent studies to make it appear as if chol cholesterol caused heart disease when is much more likely to be sugar and then to exonerate Sugar and say it's safe one of those professors named head of the USDA he was the one who authored and published the USDA declaration in the late 70s saying that cholesterol caused heart disease stop eating fat cholesterol and dietary fat cholesterol don't raise uh serum cholesterol anyway so that's that's useless to begin with if you just stop eating carbohydrates your LDL is g to go up so stop stop eating for five days your oldal go bang right up um is that bad for you no fasting has been shown to be very beneficial for cardiovascular disease and and all sorts of health issues and so you know why why because LDL goes up because LDL isn't the problem LDL doesn't cause any heart disease just doesn't and so um you know just don't worry about that and there's many more documents and more Publications showing that you know uh the sugar companies paid off a lot of other doctors as well not just uh those from Harvard but anel keys and many many more and we know what they got paid we have their contracts at least those Harvard professors were paid $6,500 that's equivalent of of $55,000 Us in today's valuation so they basically got like a you know a mid model you know Toyota and uh out out of the bargain that's that was worth selling out the health of the world for just a you know midsize Sedan like great great job you know and I mean what what's first of all just complete sellouts but what what a cheap date you know I mean it's just like that's that's all it took that's all it took to to buy your integrity and um and and and flush the health of Humanity down the drain I these guys are are mass murderers you know on the scale of of Stalin and Ma and Hitler you know they they've been responsible for the death and disease and of uh what billions of people now billions of people around the world are listening to this terrible advice you know and and they're getting completely sick they're getting diseases that have never really existed in any great number and now they're the number one killers in the world these non-communicable chronic diseases which nearly didn't exist a 100 years ago now you know the 90% of deaths in America Australia in Europe are from these non-communicable chronic diseases that didn't exist in any great numbers 150 years ago certainly 150 years ago and um 74% of deaths around the world right so what the hell is that about so these people are responsible you know they're responsible for those deaths they're responsible for people being sick and miserable for decades and having very hard painful lives filled of disease and dying decades early after Decades of disease and hardship they are absolutely culpable for that and anyone who pushes that ideology uh knowingly is culpable for that as well and I'm sorry but the drug companies now and the sugar companies now they know the history of their own companies they damn well know and the fact that they didn't they haven't come out and said hey this was  I took over as CEO and I found this out and I am so sorry I apologize to the World on behalf of my in my organization institution and uh and field but of course they're never going to do that they'd be out on their ass and the the you know shareholders would be pissed and and demand that you know demand their heads um so they don't or maybe they just don't give a they work their way up there lower down they would have known this stuff too it's don't get to be an executive uh member or on the board member or CEO without without knowing where the skeletons are um you know beforehand so uh these guys are absolutely culpable and I think they're resp they're absolutely responsible you know as c means who's a whistleblower uh for big food and big farma said that they know that they're making people sick with this food and uh and they they're profiting off of it on the back end too because they're selling the pharmaceutical the drugs to to toh sort of mitigate the symptoms of these diseases and he said I know they know this because I've been in the boardroom meetings with them when they said it right so this is um you know that's malice of forethought to me you know that's that these These are criminal acts at this point and they certainly were then so I I wouldn't uh worry too much about that watch my video on the truth about cholesterol and heart disease uh watch my interview with Dr Paul Mason watch the videos that Dr Paul Mason does the different lectures that he does on cholesterol and heart disease as well uh wildly different what the actual data shows and and then you just look at the historical record and you realize that no serious scientist independently came up with the idea that cholesterol caus heart disease it was the sugar companies who invented that idea and then found a bunch of sellout douchebags to perpetuate this and push it like anel keys and all these other guys from Harvard and that's because there were serious scientists who independently came up with the idea that sugar was to blame for the rising heart disease and I think that it that's true among other things but um you got to pred there's like this the tobacco companies they were just trying to like oh there studies coming out saying oh AOS scos or um you know smoking control heart disease and empyema and cancer what do we do we just got to put out studies oh well our studies say that it doesn't and everything's great and everything's fine and you know makes your teeth whiter it's just like oh shut up you know and so um you know and we we caught them for lying we've caught the sugar companies for lying why the hell is there not a reckoning for these bastards you know um because they weren't necessarily caught in the act of doing it but now they are now they're do now they're still lying and pushing this nonsense so I mean I think there should be a congressional hearing on this um that chance of that though with all the trillions of dollars that they have at their disposal you know to spend on lobbying and so on but that is what there should be and there should be there should be people held criminally responsible for these these uh these actions and continued actions okay all right thank you everyone I really appreciate I do have to run I'm actually running very late so uh I really appreciate it thank you all very much um it's
