    "transcript": "foreign okay hello everyone let's see here okay it's sort of uh 11 people here Okay so we've got a number of questions uh put in uh by everyone so thank you very much for everyone to do that um if you guys have you know comments you can obviously comment in the chat session and uh you might see that and hopefully comment on that as well if I see it and then if you have sort of new questions uh we'll try to get to those as well uh towards the end after we finish up the rest of the questions and uh yeah I'll go from there [Music] so first question is from Carmine this is I'm three days into a five day fast and typically at the end of my fast I incorporate uh colon cleanse I've had problems in the past with polyps but thankfully the last checkup was clear near the end of the fast I use some laxatives that I take when preparing for a colonoscopy something came to mind which never occurred to me before am I flushing out pardon the pun any good bacteria for my colon when I do this yeah you're definitely doing that um you know it's a sort of an unnatural way for your body to work this is forcing things to go out that's not necessarily you know going out by Design you fast for five days you're not gonna have anything in your gut anyway so it's not like you have like these big blockages and you haven't gone to the bathroom because you know you you need to take a laxative you definitely don't you know if you want to do a real colon cleanse five days of fasting we'll do that there's nothing there's nothing going to be there anyway you know you're going to make some mucus and bacteria and that's it so I wouldn't I wouldn't um think that that's something that's necessary or beneficial I don't think that's something that's going to add any any value uh to your life um you you don't have to fast at all I don't think I don't think that's something that's necessary but I certainly don't think that you need to do a colon cleanse um after a fast as to your polyps those uh quite often are caused by uh High insulin levels so hyperinsulinemia you get skin tags on the surface of your skin you get polyps on the inside of your colon sort of like you think of those as skin tags in your in your colon so you know getting onto a carnivore diet just stopping eating carbohydrates in general that's going to to help that significantly so that's um that's not surprising that those have been better and I think that that will continue to stay that way as long as you're eating like this Mike asks I've been working on trying to help someone with a lap band surgery on their stomach um that as you know creates just a small pouch to limit food intake she doesn't have a gallbladder and says fat causes too much loose stools I see that as a semi-good thing to at least see where she is and to slowly work up from leaner beef till liver starts compensating for loss of gallbladder I know carnivore is the most nutrient dense way to eat and most bioavailable as well and that it is vital for her being only able to eat such small quantities at any at any given time my suggestion is hamburger meat and eggs or a piece of steak and eggs and as she can handle the fat and Thyme to get the ratio up do you know of any other food ideas that may have helped in your experience with such patients I don't want to overlook something obvious now I think that's I think that's a good approach um it's you want something small enough and dense enough right so meat obviously is the way to go um things like rendered fat like tallow can be a bit more difficult uh because that can just sort of just go through much more quickly so if she needs a bit more time and bile to drip out you know things like just actual fat you know is going to take a little longer for that to to render out and then get absorbed um she she will still make bile she'll still make bile from her liver just won't be stored in her gallbladder because she doesn't have one and so it'll just drip out constantly so the problem there is not not a lack of bile it's a lack of a concentrated store of bile that's ready to go at any time and so it's going to be dripping out bile constantly and then so when she eats she just has to eat smaller meals throughout the day so that she just sort of catches this bile that sort of just floating around in her in her stomach and lower intestine and and small intestine and uh and then she'll be able to absorb it that way but she'll she'll need to eat multiple times a day which you know sounds like will probably be what she needs to do anyway because of her her gastric band so I would uh yeah I would say the same thing hamburger meat's probably going to be the easiest for her to digest um and deal with eggs as well and I would also suggest that she does not drink any water within two hours of eating and certainly not during the meal because she doesn't have much real estate there anyway and so filling that up with water is going to you know waste a lot of space that she really needs to get food into some people think about like oxbial and things like that I'm not a big fan of that just because you know you want you want to use your body's own bile and uh and you don't really want to go above that because you know your body's made a certain amount of bile for a reason I think I don't think your body just makes things haphazardly and so if it's making a certain amount of bile that's probably because that's how much fat it wants and if you're taking an ox bile you're forcing your body to absorb more fat now in her case it's a bit of a gray area because if she's really having trouble absorbing this stuff because she's just not really able to time things right to get the get the you know bile from her liver then um you know and she wants to eat sort of a bigger meal in one go that she's not going to be able to digest and absorb properly otherwise you know it might be a good option I wouldn't rely on it though I wouldn't I wouldn't I would try to time it so that she's having having multiple meals throughout the day that are small enough that she's comfortable eating that way and that she has enough bile to take this stuff in that's what I would do but that the aux file is is an option but I just I would use it as a last resort some people will form a pseudo gallbladder and and that will work like a gallbladder So eventually she might be able to you know eat bigger meals but she probably can't really eat big meals anyway just because of her her gastric fans so that's what I would do is just split these things up and have and try eating multiple times a day and don't drink any water before or during the meal that makes a big difference um okay chat disconnected why is chat disconnected I don't know why chat's disconnected oh there we go my this is so stupid YouTube you being absolutely ridiculous put on top chats and it says chat is disabled I'm like okay so I put on live chat and it's like oh look there's always all this chat and like absolutely stupid why would you put it on top chat anyway why would that be the default like live just show the chat my goodness like who came up with that they should be fired um okay great Mike um sounds good all right uh uh question from Monique I'm starting to blush as soon as I eat something it doesn't matter uh what I eat uh beef pork or eggs as soon as it as I break my fast my cheeks and nose get hot and red what could this be this morning I even had some minor blushing after drinking water and electrolytes I have no idea honestly that's that's very interesting I mean especially like you know drinking water and electrolytes you know you have to you have to sort of wonder what sort of reaction you're getting doesn't necessarily mean it's like an allergic reaction or just something something's triggering something right um you know if you're eating beef pork and eggs and that's doing something where you have to wonder if there's something in there that's that's uh triggering that um you know but if you're just drinking water uh with electrolytes you know then God only knows so I mean if if there's a commonality between the meat and the water with electrolytes it's the electrolytes right you know and so who knows I don't know um if you had electrolytes with artificial sweeteners or whatever but um I don't know if you're on uh in the chat but if you are maybe you can let me know if you have any other symptoms as well or if it's just some some blushing and some redness if it is that and you don't notice anything else I just sort of chalk it up to something curious and strange and just keep an eye on it and um and uh and and but otherwise don't worry about it if you're not if you're well otherwise so question from Wendy what are the best ways to get fat into a child who doesn't like butter or beef fat or fatty Cuts uh funnel in a tube like they do with Geese for foie gras I don't know um it's difficult you know I mean kids can be very picky eaters sometimes you have to just sort of work with them and and um you know just sort of find different ways and different things that they'll eat I mean it's you know fatty Cuts does that include bacon you know most people will like bacon um if they are being honest and so you know it's um you know might be maybe someone's trying you know if if they're okay with bacon you can do that um just try to find different different fatty Cuts they don't like butter you know the thing is too is that you know we we tell children since they're born that that's bad and the stuff is bad you don't want to have butter and all these sorts of things and and it really gets ingrained and so even when I was growing up you know I I really liked the taste of beef fat and bacon and all that stuff but I was like oh my God the grease oh it's so bad for me oh my God but it's like this guilty pleasure and that but I did feel guilty and I would actually work myself up to feel sort of nauseated that I was that I was eating this stuff so that I had to unlearn I had to undo that in myself and I did eventually so now I'm you know obviously very much a fan of fat um so you can do that with the kids as well just sort of start working things up and work and working things in you know eggs have a good fat content especially the yolk you know if you take away the egg white the egg yolk is is 80 calories from a fat so it's really good but just the normal eggs is 60 so it's it's that's a good source of fat as well and um you know just see if you can get eggs if you can get bacon um you know ground beef you know you can you can increase the amount of fat in ground beef pretty easily without people really realizing that the fats uh that there's more fat in it because it's all just mixed in and mixed together and it tastes better when there's more fat in it and so you can just sort of say oh yeah this is a hamburger oh wow this tastes really good you know and um they won't really necessarily know that so if it is sort of a conditioned response it'll be less likely to pick that up but I think you just slowly but surely sort of work things in and just talk to them about like actually the Fat's really good for you and all that sort of stuff that's good for your brain it's good for your body you know and um and so uh funnel method yeah um so uh you know just just give it a try and see how how it progresses and just sort of keep keep teaching them and encouraging them and letting them know but letting them eat sort of things and then just find different things that that are just get a little more fat a little more fat a little more fat and eventually they'll they'll recondition themselves to to actually you know like it again and it should be okay but just um you know you don't want to force anything because you know then you're you know then you're sort of gonna make him fight against eating meat in general so still try to find meat that they like so find things that they like and um and then just talk about it and uh and see if they come around they usually do it doesn't like those either yeah I don't know see what you can do hopefully hopefully eventually you'll come around a question from Joe Dr chafee when I drink hot water like the temperature of hot tea it often feels like there's a balloon of air in my gut somewhere uh is this bloating it's not painful just annoying after a few seconds I get the urge to tighten my abs diaphragm and I burp my kids find it fascinating I just drink a regular bottled water I stopped drinking alkaline water two months ago would this be an indication of something more concerning anything I should get checked I test negative for h pylori also had an EGD done and all biopsies came back negative I found grade they found a grade one uh small as possible hiatus hernia but the surgeon said it's not concerning at this time um well when you have when you have air in your in your stomach like that that's because you've you've swallowed air really and so there's probably something to do with how hot the water is that you're sort of sipping it sort of calmly and you're just getting in a whole mouthful of air down with you so that that's almost certainly what that that's from it wouldn't be creating gas you know like a like a carbonated beverage or something like that so if it's just hot water you know that's going to be [Music] um you know that that's going to be just from you swallowing air so just uh you know if it's too hot or whatever and then that happens that's what it is but it wouldn't it wouldn't be dangerous you know you just sort of you just sort of burp and and get it out of yourself so I I wouldn't be too worried about that um but you know if you don't want that to happen then you know just try to uh you know drink something in a way that that you don't get as much air down uh it could be this is the hot the hotness of the water is uh you know making that that easier just to take down air as well foreign that's not bothering you then yeah I wouldn't worry about it question from Carmine in your video with Simon and Scotty brizzle you mentioned about a methane gas tax that could be introduced in Brisbane to the farmers of cattle as much as 3 500 per cow I find this very disturbing for a couple of reasons one my son lives there and secondly there seems to be no limit to what these people will go go to to make a sick population what do we the average Joe do to try and stop this insane plant-based movement well on a political measure we have to just stand up politically and just be like well we're not going to vote for you we're going to vote you out of office and we're gonna we're gonna make a big deal about this you're trying to screw up our food supply and our supply lines we need to be vocal about it you know squeaky wheel gets grease and so if they if they can just keep getting away with this they're they're going to and so until people push back and be like hey you know back off they won't back off you know people push until they meet resistance and so the point is you make that resistance as soon as and as sharp as possible you know this is why a lot of people say that you know like no we're not going to give you know because everything whenever you change something you don't change something by huge drastic measures right like Hitler didn't just jump into the to the Holocaust right it was a very very slow controlled steps and and every single step was a logical extension from the previous step that's that's the only way you can do it so you just you encroach just a little bit people sort of get tussled with it and then they sort of calm down and you just get used to it it's the new normal as uh they are always trying to say when doing this to you and then you get used to that and you step a little bit more and a little bit more and a little bit more so this is this is sort of an example of that and so they never want to push too far because then people go hey back off so you have to see what they're doing you have to understand that they're doing this little by little by little to affect the same results right and so this is why a lot of people would be like no no we're not giving an inch anywhere like well that's just unreasonable this that and the other like yeah yeah well we know what you're doing we know that you're you know what your tactics are and it's not going to stop here all this is all we want this is the only thing we want once that's happened I'll then we'll just do we agree with you on everything nonsense it's never the way those are going to take you know you've given in you give an inch they're going to take a mile always right so you just uh you never give an inch and so you have to you have to sort of make noise and you have to say like this is this is not something that I agree with and I'm gonna do something about it I'm like you're not going to get my vote if you do this sort of stuff you know that from a policy standpoint you know because there are there are policies going in that are that are uh you know affecting this sort of thing you know people want to protest people saying you should go vegan and try to influence people uh through you know thought and and debate then that that's that's fair game and then you just you you can debate them and that's why I do this channel to put out the other side of the argument but um uh you know it's um from a political standpoint you you then have to address it politically and either make noise and and and uh write to your your politicians and say like hey I'm really against this I don't think this is something that we should be doing that they actually listen to that one if you write an actual letter in they take that more seriously than a phone call or an email or nothing you know because if you've taken the time to sit down and write a letter like you're pissed you know and this is something you're serious about you're taking very seriously it's not like just like a Spur like oh I'm angry you know it takes time takes effort to write a letter and post it and put a stamp on it you know not all that much but a lot more than people are used to doing right now so I would uh that's what I would do and just and just keep keep pushing this message around being like hey this is this isn't what it's supposed to be and the more people that get on board with this and push back and say hey we're not on board with this you know the better it will be but yeah it's difficult um yeah looking tan healthy thank you so much oh I was in the sun I was in uh Esperance in southern uh Western Australia this past weekend and I'm just just in the Sun as much as possible it's been very very nice and um uh Mike is saying I'm probably secretly getting ready to give Sea Wolves one more go I would love to it um the my my knee I have just some some arthritis on the um on my patella on the kneecap the wrestling is perfect it's really frustrating that's the only piece of arthritis in my body but as a result it flakes off bits of cartilage into the rest of the knee and then the knee blows up and I can't I can't do anything so it's really frustrating so I got I got my knee scope and got all those little floaty pieces out back in end of September and so I've been trying to rehab my knee properly and then go out and actually play rugby uh this year and um so I went to practice last night and like it's definitely overdid it oh my he's just wasn't ready to go back so we'll see um I don't know I'm really hoping to to get this better so I can actually play again I would just or just run again I mean I you know I really miss being able to run Sprint and hit people so we'll see we'll see how that goes because my body I feel great you know I can I can work out forever but I just you know the knee just holds me back unfortunately [Music] so a question from Mike what are your thoughts of taking a frozen steak out of the freezer at 4am leaving it out to thaw on the counter from 4 pm to cook it is vacuum sealed prior to freezing and not opened until ready to cook yeah it should be fine you know I I do that with uh unvacuum sealed things as well um I will take out um yeah my name might not even be completely thought out by them there's those little weird trays things that just thaw things out I I don't know how these things work there's like some conduction thing where you conduction play you put it on there and you just they just defrost right in front of you it's crazy but um you can you can certainly leave it out it's not it's not going to go bad or anything like that I'll even meet out all the time you know I'll take take a steak out of the fridge in the morning before I go to work and just leave it there until I get back and then it's room temperature and I and you can cook it at a more uh regular rate you know or a more standard uh uh temperature and time and things like that because like depending if it comes out of the fridge or or it's actually room temperature it's different cooking times right so um and um so yeah I I that's fine you know if it's vacuum sealed it's it's in the it's in a case of bugs aren't going to get into it that's one of the things if you're if you're leaving meat out just flies can get on it they can lay eggs in maggots and a whole bunch of gross stuff and that you don't necessarily want and um you know so that's but if it's already sealed then that should be fine yeah that I don't I don't see any problem with that like uh let's see here so Wendy asks if you could pick one video and one book to help convert someone to carnivore what would they be it's a good question hmm well I am biased but my the first video I ever did on um on YouTube was uh is that called like the facts about carnivore and vegan diets and that was that was what I did in prepare preparation for a debate on vegan and carnivore diets and so that that I made that specifically to make the argument on why we should do this and not do uh vegan and not eat plants at all so I think that that covers at least in at least covers most of the main points that I think are important to make um and so I think that video is is a good one um as far as books you know I mean you could do you know Dr Baker's book um I haven't read Dr solidino's book but a lot of people like it um and that was before he started eating fruit and honey and things like that it was all just about plant poisons and different sorts of things like that but I think probably you know one of one of the good ones is going back to uh you know like Western a price or um or fat of land from Bill Homer stefonson you know I think I think those are probably uh you know fantastic books you know and um so one of those two I think would probably be the best um and then maybe when I finish my book maybe that book hopefully that would be will be a good argument as well [Music] and and okay so Mariko asks I'm seven days in I find it super difficult to fall asleep and difficult to wake up I eat fat and electrolytes how do you know what is missing exactly well you can take a blood test and you can check your vitamins minerals electrolytes hormones all that sort of stuff you aren't missing anything on a carnivore diet is the short answer but as far as nutrients are concerned but you know coming from whatever dietary past you came from you may be deficient in certain things but you'll catch up on a carnivore diet you know you have to throw some liver in every now and then early on and and that'll help you catch up but um you'll get there you'll get there eventually anyway as far as the sleeping is concerned um you know sort of wonder what what else you're eating or you still drinking coffee or tea or having any sort of caffeine people don't uh you know realize this at first but you know the same amount of coffee will affect you much much more extremely on a carnivore diet and so you'll be much more wired and you'll have much more difficult sleep afterwards um saying you're having difficulty going to sleep and then difficulty waking up it could be that you're you're not going to sleep for so long that you're exhausted and not sleeping enough and that's difficult to get up so I would get rid of all everything possible besides meat and water no coffee no caffeine or anything like that make sure that's out of it first and then you know optimize your your your sleep environment you know turn off the lights turn off screens get off the phone get off the computer stop watching TV at least an hour before you go to bed light's low and everything like that it really makes a difference um you get those I've been playing around with like those blue light blocking sunglasses thing that actually helps you know that helps wind you down because you're not getting all this stimulation from the light and you're just you're just sort of just chilling out and even if you're on your phone or whatever you're not getting those those blue rays in waking your brain up that's what I find when I go to sleep I just I'm out like that and um so you know you you can you know do things like that just turning off the light turning the lights down low reading a book listening to like calming music whatever book on tape podcasts those sorts of things and then you know getting all light out of your out of your bedroom and uh even using like a sleep mask mouth tape all of these little things actually do add up to getting much better sleep like since I've started using a sleep mask I usually just use a sleep mask when I was um you know on on doing night shifts and things like that I have to sleep during the day and I just could not sleep with with the light up with uh when it was light out and um you know so I started using sleep mask now I just use them all the time and I sleep so much better and so you know that's what I would do is make sure you're only on on meat and water nothing else no caffeine and and then optimize your your sleep routine go to bed at the same time every night you know really do that get Morning Light get outside get you know direct sunlight in your eyes don't stare at the Sun but just look in the direction of where the sun is just then you'll get these direct lights um people are doing that cold therapy stuff where you basically you take a shower in the morning and then just for the last couple minutes you just put it on like full blast cold water it's miserable but you get over it for the first like sort of 10 seconds it's not comfortable and then you just it does it's actually not a problem and that seems to to help regulate your circadian rhythm and and will help you with sleep and help you with better quality sleep as well so Liz asks what are your thoughts on drinking homemade kombucha I have a hotel Container full of scobies and I don't have any room left um I mean I wouldn't you know just just knee I mean it is it is still a plant I don't need plants and so you know having it homemade you you at least know what's going into it you know if you're adding sugar or not hopefully not and if you're you're buying from a store it's almost certainly going to be sugar and a bunch of other things in it as well so it's going to be better uh then then store-bought if you if you make it right but I think that any of this stuff is not ideal you know it's um you know my my hard rule is you know no plants no sugar nothing artificial that goes for drinks as well you know so no sauces seasonings or drinks that contain those things as well so um so for me I I don't I don't do that sort of stuff but you know if you if you are going to make it and you and you want to do that at least you know making it at home at least you know what you know what's going into it so at least there's that um okay let me see here so I think that's that's all the questions that were asked uh that were submitted anyway um yep that's what that's all the ones so if people have other questions you can pop them up now or some comments or anything like that uh we can do that so question from Serena thank you Olivia do you know anything about um blepharitis uh that affects the eyes and causes [Music] um chalazons those are not something I have too much familiarity with especially because I can't even pronounce that word I think I've seen that written down the chellozons thing once um so no unfortunately I don't I don't know much about that um so inflammation of the sort of the eyes um due to the blepharitis is usually Underside and getting like puffy baggy eyes usually that's from different sorts of interactions you know different allergies and things like that you can certainly get it from food you can get it from um allergies to whatever like you know cats are pollen or something so you just have to sort of try to remove out different causative agents that might be irritating things so sometimes makeup even the same makeup that you may have been wearing you know for years sometimes you can develop uh different sensitivities to them and and actually especially if you've been exposed more and more and more to them um those those are more likely to develop sensitivities as well so I just I just sort of see what's what's in your environment and try to get those out and and see see what helps um so now that Tony has been seizure free for some time due to switching to carnivore which is awesome I'm very happy to hear that um how long should we wait before talking to talk about titrating as meds ooh that's a good question so um yeah that's a difficult one I mean his doctor is going to be you know I mean this is the same doctor that was saying it shouldn't shouldn't do the dietary things because it worked so God knows what they're they're going to say but um yeah it's definitely an idiot um and um so what what you know what we do and I don't I don't necessarily treat epilepsy but when we have someone who has a seizure or has had a seizure due to some sort of brain pathology like a head injury or a brain tumor we keep them on medication for at least six months and then reassess and it you know we're happy that they haven't had any sort of uh seizure activity at that point we we look to wean them off um that's going to be a bit that that's the very that's as simplistic as it gets so because generally those are just worn-off seizures due to an insult to the brain as opposed to you know epilepsy right so epilepsy is a bit more complex than that it's going to be a bit more persistent than that uh potentially so I would say at least six months and then you can start having the discussion with uh the the gentleman uh mentioned and and then and see what they say it's it's something you have a very very careful with and I think it would be very important to do that under direct supervision of uh of a neurologist and if that neurologist is not willing to uh to uh you know entertain the idea then you can always get a second opinion that is absolutely your right it's your money it's your child's your health um or his health and so you know you get you guys get to make that decision and so if these you know just not really interested in helping with that just said no I don't think so fine you know but you know that and that and that's you know he's he gets to make that decision as well if that's how he strongly feels if he thinks that this is in your in your son's best interest then I he should say that um but you can also get a second opinion and you can talk to someone else and say hey look here's the thing we did all these dietary things he hasn't had seizures he's doing really really well what do you think and you you might find someone that says look that's reasonable we can trial him you know step down the medications and you just do this for a few weeks or a month or whatever and if that's fine then you step it down again or whatever depending on what the doses he is maybe on a very minimal dose you can just stop it um with a doctor but you know sometimes if you're on higher doses you need to you need to set those things down gradually and so um so you know I would I would do that I six months seizure free is sort of a minimum before you start thinking about coming off meds and then you can talk to the doctor and if you don't like what he has to say you can always get a second opinion uh but I would be very curious with that and I would um I would do it with uh you know the direct supervision of a doctor uh uh yeah exactly you don't want to jump the gun but don't want to wait forever yeah 100 you know um but uh yeah so that's sort of a rule of thumb is that we would keep people on if they'd have a seizure we keep them on uh prophylaxis for six months seizure-free uh before we think about that um question regarding pots hyper andronergic do you have any experience or advice on how carnivore uh can minimize this um I I don't have too much experience with that um let me just see something real quick um yeah having experience an advice on how carnivore can help them minimize this you know I I can't think of any you know any any sort of direct evidence or studies or anything that I've really seen I've seen people ask us a few times but I haven't had a good answer for them um you know a lot of these things are still in the well let's let's see what this helps sort of thing I mean I I know that this is what we're supposed to be eating and I know that this is what's going to make us you know as healthy as we can be but that doesn't mean that everything is caused by eating the wrong thing you know and so it could be that this helps um but I think it's just sort of just to sort of try and and find out and see if that does help I can't I can't guarantee that it will um there's just not not enough information on it yet so sorry about that um Carmine asks if grass-fed and grass finished is unaffordable is uh grass-fed only good enough as in grass-fed and grain finished yeah Dr Berry has stated that eating spam would be better the veggies 100 any meat is better than any plant right because all meat is good for you and all plants are bad for you you know I mean you can survive on Plants but that's it I mean it's survival food it's not it's not optimal so as in bad for you as in it has things that are bad for you right whereas meat not really you know I mean you know maybe if it's if it's processed with a bunch of garbage you know that are from plants like sugar and whatever then yeah okay but those are going to be the bad things from the plants not from the meat and so I would uh no so grass grass-fed grain finish is perfectly fine almost all store-bought meat is going to be that okay so so unless you're getting wagyu which is just basically keeping grains and and sugar and alcohol its whole life uh most of its life anyway your the majority of a cow's life is just on brass just out in the field eating grass you know doing what a cow is supposed to do and then in the last few months they they put them in a feedlot and they feed them grain to to bulk them up and put on fat and get that marbling that we like right so the majority of the cow's life is going to be on on grain or on grass I'm sorry and so yeah no that's perfectly fine I get the majority of my meat is that you know I get it from Costco I buy it in bulk it's just a lot easier I have better access to things in the states like I could just buy a whole cow that was just grass-fed and finished its whole life that was great that was the best cow I've ever had in my life it was it was a 10 year old cow it was even better because it had so much more flavor and nutrients in it but uh yeah so no that that's fine you know grain finished is totally fine yeah and any and again yeah like Dr Berry says like any any meat is going to be a better better option you know I think of it as you know I've said this before but you know as uh gold and silver in the Olympics right so silver medal lost to gold but the silver medalists also beat everyone else on earth right and that's how I think of grain finished beef you know it's not it's not gold but it's better than anything else okay so it's it's fine yeah um [Music] So currently titrating off a seizure medication used for bipolar disorder and have heard upping my fat will help tremendously what are your thoughts do you think carnivore will shorten the withdrawal period it can there's a there are um there are studies looking at different withdrawals from like alcohol or bits or asapines and B just being ketosis and they find that they have an easier time subjectively their own interpretation as well as objectively they don't need as many medications to sort of get them through the withdrawal period and you know bipolar um you know there's a reason that you know they seizure medications or work for bipolar and seizures and migraines there's similar things happening and I think a lot of these things have to do with our cellular metabolism and that's something that you know uh Dr Palmer wrote about uh quite you know quite uh conclusively in his book Brain energy and so uh yeah I think that just being on a carnivore diet uh with fat and having your ketones up is going to help is going to help that and is going to help your um you know condition be it bipolar or what have you so I would um yeah just just keep doing what you're doing and it's like am I going back to Costa Rica for the retreat I haven't I haven't been contacted by them uh to do that I wouldn't mind I would actually love to go back to Costa Rica um but um you know I'm I'm in Australia it's difficult to get over there it is sort of three days of traveling going back and forth so it's like a day and a half each was like 40 hours you know each way but there are better flights too which is just a pain in the ass it's just how many of those ones they just weren't any good flights available but um no I would love to I'd be happy to to be thrilled to be part of that and just sort of hang out in Costa Rica again I would love to go back there but I'm not uh particularly I'm not involved in it at the moment anyway um but I don't even know when that is when is that um I don't know if anyone knows but yeah so on a lighter note when I played for the SeaWolves what was your position getting stoked for the first game nice so I didn't I didn't actually play for the Sea Wolves I played for the saracens that turned into the Sea Wolves but when The Sea Wolves were starting I was playing with them in preseason and then I'd already committed to going to Bangladesh and so I I left for that and then I came back and just got on Carnivore and I was just feeling amazing so I went back out to to play with them and that's when my knee started acting up and it just started swelling up it was really really disappointing because the hostess charging ready to go I was just about to to start going playing with The Sea Wolves in their first season and we won like the whole damn thing too and I was just like I've been very uh would have really liked to be a part of that and then the second season when I rehab my knee I was back out playing and uh and feeling great but I just been I just been out of practice uh with uh you know medicine for just far too long and I was just like I have to go back and then get going again my brother was just like why would you do that just take another year off and just be part of this sort of uh thing I was like well you know I've already I've already played professionally I've played at a higher level than this I don't I don't need to do that um and I need to get on with my career so so I decided to to not to take just to take the job down here in Australia in retrospect Maybe you know maybe I should have just stayed uh and played that season because I I was I was just feeling amazing I was in such good shape and I was playing rugby down here and I was just you know killing it so it was um you know it was uh well until until my other knee actually acted up as well but I think a lot of that had to do with a lot of the fitness and training we were doing doing a lot of things like on our knees and so it was like grinding my kneecap into my knee and so that's you know and we did a lot of that sort of work it was like it was great core work it was great um Fitness sort of stuff we had we had a great trainer that we work with here but it just was just those were the wrong things for me to do with my my particular knee conditions and I was thinking about that all the time I'm like oh this is probably a bad idea but I just did it because I was just like you know that was that was a drill that's what we were doing and um so so that my other knee sort of had the same problem that first thing he had so who knows it may it may have just acted up during the second season with the Sea Wolves as well but um who knows I think I probably could have could have done it but uh my position was in the back row so I played seven and eight uh predominantly eight although seven was my my favorite generally uh it's just my you know if you don't have a number eight that knows what uh they're doing it's really annoying because it's an important position uh but when I was playing Seven um it was openside flanker I was very very defensively oriented and I just I would make like 40 or 50 tackles a game it was just like you know people my friends like described it as like it was like I was just a defensive force of nature like it was just like I could just shut down entire teams like just me and um and you you know a lot of people have said you know you you win and lose games by your back three you know and then particularly like your open side flanker that can that can completely change games because if you're if you're that disruptive in defense and you're you know I I had I had fly hats just literally Running Scared for me you know because I just if we won a game and it didn't matter how well I played um if I didn't take the fly half out of the game I consider that a failure I consider that I did not do my job as an open side flanker I needed to punish them so hard that they came out of the game and I had to sub out because of you know just getting just a batter and abuse and so when you do that when you're able to play like that and you're able to disrupt the back line like that then I could just shut some down they have no offense you know so I was always fast enough that I could break out and I could you know the fly app would have to just ditch that ball away as quick as possible they tried moves or switches or whatever I was I just I was a very good Defender and I could I could just pick up and read plays and just always break things up so it was um I felt that I I didn't had more of an impact at seven at eight I was much more offensively oriented and I just ran the ball and I I ran the ball very aggressively I wanted I wanted the contact I wanted to hit people if I was going and I had a gap like I literally I'd be like me one-on-one with the full back or Winger or something like that I'd make a break through the line and I go and I have like the entire field on either side and all I have to do is just pick a direction and I'd probably score I would just I would like like turn and cut back into them and just to run them over like this is such a bad such a bad um Habit to do but I just I just wanted to hit people like I wanted that physical I wanted that contact and so whenever I did just go like I was just like oh I want to hit this guy I'm like no I should just cut and I would do it and I would I would usually score but um most often I tried to hit people and uh and that's just how I played so uh yeah but then I played in The Centers as well just fun you know because I played a lot of sevens uh rugby sevens and I played that at a high level and um and just it just sort of was fun to sort of get out there and you know because I was so physical and because I wanted that contact am I charging through like guys that are bigger than me and there's multiple guys trying to hit me and I'm barreling through all of them like a you know bowling pins you get out playing sevens with like most of these guys are these little spindly guys like there's just there's no chance in hell they're tackling me so like that was a lot of fun and then I started playing the in the backs like in the centers just for fun just I would play like in like the second side games or something like that and I played some you know um you know first side game Super League games at Center as well I played a season Center just just for fun and um I played a couple of wing as well just when we needed it but yeah it's mostly back row uh one of my favorite I know NRL team do support I actually haven't been watching uh rugby league here uh I'm just watching anything I just don't watch TV really um like if it's on or something like that or someone someone's watching or it's on somewhere I'll you know keep an eye on it but like I don't actually I don't think I have TV I think I just want I have Netflix and that that's it I don't think I have like actually like Network sort of stuff so uh but yeah uh so question uh what are your thoughts on feeding before you train I like to train fasted but I've heard there are benefits of switching back and forth no I don't think there are any benefits of eating before because you're you're diverting blood into your to your digestion as opposed to your muscles and I just feel terrible and you're putting yourself in a rest and digest mode and your body's saying hey you know um conserve energy so it's not actually mobilizing energy for you to to work because to say hey no we got energy we want to shut down we want to want to conserve things and so I always train fasted if I don't I regret it and always and certainly would always perform best uh in games matches when I was fasted so yeah I would definitely definitely do that um Punisher I tried to I tried to I tried to see how many people I could take out a game always legal I never I never did cheap shots or dirty things or anything like that I just I just tried to every time I hit somebody I tried to put them in the hospital and just every single time and um yeah so that's that's just how I played because they're trying to do it to you you know it's like one of you who's going to the hospital and uh it can be you or that man I think that's that's an easy choice for me on who I'd pick so okay all right guys well um I think that's it for the for the questions here was one more um oh I think just one more is it how do we as commoners not influencers help spread the gospel of carnivore to Word of Mouth just talking to people showing your example you're doing great and people ask me like wow you look you look great you're doing well this is why and you know then they'll get interested and they'll see what you're doing they'll see the results and then that works as a Grassroots movement before I started I had this platform I had you know literally hundreds of conversations with people you know talking about the way I ate and why I ate that way and so I just I put all these arguments out that's why I can just sort of regurgitate these things very easily is when I'm in discussions with people or debates would go what about this and what about this what about this I have an answer right away because I've done it hundreds of times and and that's why and that's and that's how you get good at things you just just practice and so the same thing you know um you'll just just talk to people they'll be interested in what you're doing and and then you'll be like wow you only eat meat isn't that bad for you I'm like well no actually it's not it's really good for you blah blah blah and so you just just word of mouth and and just you know just showing uh the example that you're setting and showing how good your health is and the health of your family I think that's the best way of doing it and it just spreads it just spreads from there uh uh so Mike says this is a good way dock your newest slideshow about why we are carnivores is helping me get new carnivore candidates yeah so that that's the thing too is sharing sharing different podcasts and things like that that you find helpful and interesting uh and that that sort of convey this sort of message that that's that's also a very good way and when they get interested enough obviously if they're just going like God you're crazy you know that that's not going to go anywhere but you have to you have to sort of like you know plant the seed of interest and then say like okay well do you have anything else that I could look into and say yeah check out these podcasts and things like that so cool all right um you referenced me in your college courses too oh well thank you that's very good that's very kind to you very flattering um great all right guys well I I think we'll we can um uh end it there but thank you very much everyone for for coming on and joining the live and um and for uh you know submitting questions and everything like that and and for people watching this uh
