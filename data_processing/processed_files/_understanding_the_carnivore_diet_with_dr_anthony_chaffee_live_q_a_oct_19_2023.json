        "body": "all right hello everyone sorry for the delay but um back doing lives again so thanks everyone uh for coming on and um and and asking questions so today is well it's the 20th of October for me 19th of October for people in the US and um I have uh to go into the office today so um we'll be doing about an hour hour 15 minutes and I'll I'll have to stop at around um 10:30 a.m. my time which is sort of 10:30 pm. Eastern Time 7:30 p.m. uh Pacific Coast time so uh so get uh answer as many questions as we can by then so first question is from Josh he says um hi would carnivore likely improve sorosis that's a good question I have I have spoken to a couple of people with sarcosis and and they have improved now that's anecdotal so we just have to see we don't really have great reasons or explanations uh for sarcoidosis like a lot of things we just they just these things that crop up and people have problems with them and then you know we don't have great treatments for them because we don't really know what's causing them so the likelihood is is that this is something environmental exposure related such as diet and changing that exposure can can improve things and that certainly seems to be what what um some people have experienced anyway also you know just like i' I've said with other things if you're going cornivore and you improve your health in other ways you're eating an ancestral diet you're eating a biologically appropriate diet your body's going to improve in a lot of ways that um uh that are going to to help and so even if you're sarcosis specifically doesn't improve your health in general is going to improve and so you dealing with the sarcosis is going to be a lot easier because you're going to be healthy in a lot of other ways as well um so hopefully it does help with that um I can't say for sure but there have been people that have improved and uh but I can tell you that you'll improve in many many other ways that will still be worth it uh either way so good luck with that and if uh you know and just let let us know how that goes either way I that's good good information t o have question from Donna thank you very much for the"

        "body": "o have question from Donna thank you very much for the o have question from Donna thank you very much for the Super Chat I have CS CFS slme Hashimoto and am new to cornivore two months um I've experienced significant oxalate dumping twice do you Advocate adding non- carnivore foods to slow it down perally Norton I think that's fair I think it's um if it's it's not something your body is is clearing well itself and that can help then sure you know I mean it's it's the idea of using things medically uh you wouldn't use a medicine every day all day year round for life um for most things certainly not for acute issues uh that's the whole idea is if you you do have to take something every day for the rest of your life are you really treating the issue or are you just covering it up and so that's a lot of medications now are just covering up and not addressing the underlying cause so I think that the oxalate dumping you know would you know if if that's what's going on is is the underlying issue and then you use medicines to sort of you know or like you know some low oxalate foods that you can use sort of medically if you want to think of it that way so that you're it mitigates The Dumping response from your body this is something that's it's sort of hard to measure and it's hard to know exactly what's going on because there there aren't great ways of measuring it um I understand from Reading Sally's book and speaking with her that it's difficult and sometimes you have to just go uh symptomatically by these things but if you know you're having a rough time and it's not improving on its own and you add in you know 50 80 milligrams of oxalates uh a day and that helps well then okay great it shouldn't have to be a permanent thing you shouldn't have to do that forever uh it can take a while to get clear all this stuff out of your system um but eventually you you should be able to come off of that and so you know I think I think you're doing the right thing certainly with with you know autoimmune issues uh it's very beneficial to go on a on a complete Elimination Diet like a carnivore diet because you're getting out a lot of things that are that are triggering these immune responses and so if you need to add in a bit of oxy containing foods I don't I don't think that's a problem as long as that's actually helping um speaking to Sally she said that that a lot of people most people won't have the really horrible oxalate dumping um and so most will just have a bad couple days maybe bad couple weeks and then they'll get through it but others will have a very very serious time with it and so for those people I think it's you know I mean she she's the expert on that one so you know you know that's what she's found to be most beneficial for people so that that's what I would go with and I would think of it as a medicine you're doing something medically you're treating an issue specifically and that issue you know shouldn't have to be treated forever it's just while you're dealing with that so yeah if that's if that helps then yeah defin itely go for it question from troner thank you for the"

        "body": "r that bunny for president thank you very much for the r that bunny for president thank you very much for the Super Chat pattern a LDL confirmed great ldlp uh 24771 hdlp large uh 5692 LDL sitting at 334 cholesterol hdlc 4.8 ratio Appo B 194 doctor is freaking out is this normal for carnivore healthy five months in the diet look so your your your LDL is going to freak your doctor out but you know your LDL would go up just by not eating anything not not eating fatty meat not eating anything at all really not eating carbohydrates because when you go into uh you know our primary metabolic State what what we term fasting metabolism the LDL goes up you're mobilizing fat you're running on fat you're running on ketones so you need more of this stuff to transport this um at least I that that's what it seems to me to be the mechanism either way when you fast when you stop eating or when you stop eating carbs in general your LDL will go up um there was a study in humans where they fed them 36 eggs a day very high high saturated fat and cholesterol um and after uh you know a month or more they check their cholesterol levels again and it did not change so it did not affect it at all so your dietary cholesterol actually has no effect on your on your um serum cholesterol and uh saturated fat intake doesn't generally have an effect on it it's your metabolic state that has an effect on it so if you fast and you eat nothing at all your LDL goes up when you eat 36 eggs a day it does not go up so this is not diet related this is met metabolism related and the important thing is pattern a pattern a you have these large buoyant LDL molecules that's what you want and so that's not really associated with cardiovascular disease it is associated with longevity though and just higher LDL in general is associated with longevity and uh and and these are large studies there was there was one that recently came out I think it was with 44,000 people in Scandinavia and they were looking at that really older people and people living over a hundred and all these sorts of people and the Really The Long Live people and they found that the two biomarkers that best predicted whether you're going to live over 100 was low insulin and and high LDL cholesterol right so was it LDL cholesterol or total cholesterol I think it was LDL cholesterol anyway um that was something that uh my my friend Mike meter um he uh he posted about and did a video about so if people want to find that and look at that more they can go and check out his YouTube channel um goes by metabolic Mike and so he talked about that a couple weeks ago and uh but yeah very interesting and there are other studies as well with actually millions of people showing that higher LDL cholesterol regardless of pattern a pattern b or whatever uh higher LDL cholesterol associated with lower all cause mortality meaning they lived longer so uh I wouldn't worry too much if you you know and the thing is is cholesterol was a scapegoat in the first place we we have hard documentation of this we have you know um documentation from the internal memos from the sugar companies published in the journal American Medical Association in 2016 showing that they paid off Harvard professors and anel keys and a bunch of other people to falsify data make things up doctor evidence and push out in order to uh cast the cast aspersions on cholesterol and and to exonerate Sugar and say that it was safe uh it's not safe and um and neither seed oils none of these processed food nonsensical things that we eat that didn't exist 100 years ago none of these things are good for you if it didn't exist if your ancestors weren't eating it 500,000 years ago or 50,000 years ago or during the last ice age you should not be eating it if it didn't exist back then you definitely shouldn't be eating it so um I would um I would just remember that I did a a a video after a debate I had with some cardiologists and things like that which you know we won there was two cardiologists on my side we won against three others I was the only non-cardiologist and uh yeah we we did very very well you know we we spanked them I think we won like 86 um 86% of the vote you know was in favor of us and so it's um you know it's a scapegoat it was never a problem so I don't know why we're looking at it anymore it's not a great biomarker a better biomarker is your hba1c and your fasting insulin if if those are low and in good levels you're fine you know um even if you had pattern B LDL cholesterol you know a lot of sdldl the small dense LDL does that cause heart disease or is it or is it being caused by the same thing that's causing heart disease right so is it the smoke or is it the fire right is it in a cause or is it an effect I think it's probably more of an effect I think it's probably more of the smoke so and also it's it's it's actually pretty weakly Associated it's not as strongly Associated as as metabolic issues so sdldl high levels of sldl having pattern B increases your risk of heart disease by 70% so 1.7x okay all right well that's significant fine uh metabolic syndrome increases your risk by 600% so 6X and type two diabetes increases it by 1,000% 10x which is up there with smoking so what the hell are we looking at cholesterol and getting all worried about that for and and if you correct the insulin if you correct the diabetes if you correct the metabolic syndrome which you will with cornivore diet or a ketogenic diet that's also been shown um that's really what it's been shown clinically is with ketogenic diets which a carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet that that is what you're just going to get rid of your sldl anyway because sdldl is is caused by eating this crap anyway you're glycating oxidizing damaging your normal LDL molecules and has become that's the problem so that's where it comes from so you address your metabolic issues you'll address your sdldl in the first place and you don't even have it you know if you have pattern a I would imagine that you don't have metabolic syndrome or diabetes either and so you know I would be very happy with that that's basically my picture very very similar anyway um I have really high HDL I have really low triglycerides and I have quote unquote high LDL cholesterol I think we need to revisit that because I don't think it's high I think it's exactly where it should be because I'm eating exactly what I'm supposed to eat and um everything else is exactly where it's supposed to be so why would that be just aberant for some damn reason so I did a video going into a lot more depth with this just called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease and um and you can get that I I talk about a lot of different studies and a lot of different papers I link most of them probably we have to go back and and and and Link a few of the other ones but uh but I I talk about them by name so you can look them up by that reference as well so uh check that out see what you think and be able to make an informed decision that way a nd good luck with it uh de thank you very much for the"

        "body": "nd good luck with it uh de thank you very much for the nd good luck with it uh de thank you very much for the Super Chat what is the right response to addressing plaque in arteries on cornivore do I pair with 48 to 72 hour fast I'm afraid cardiologist will want me to switch to plant-based well uh plant-base will lower your LDL cholesterol but generally because it's it's going to uh uh you know replace the cholesterol with plant sterols which actually interrupt and impede your body's natural workings and processes because your body needs cholesterol your hormones are all made out of cholesterol all your cell walls and membran or cell membranes are made out of cholesterol your BS made out of cholesterol your brain is is uh uses a large portion of cholesterol as well and and plant steril get picked up in there and they're they're not as good and you get pretty you know you're building a building with shitty concrete you're going to get a you know pretty deric building that's going to fall apart and that's what I believe the evidence shows with plant sterol so yeah your LDL will drop down but is that a good thing we were just talking about how actually LDL probably exactly good for you because you make it your body wants it it's not affected by the things that you eat it's affected by your metabolism and so yes well you know is affected by the the plant stero that you eat that will lower your cholesterol but that's a negative right you're not able to make vitamin D as well because that synthesized from cholesterol as well you get those plant steril in there not happening so if you fast your cholesterol is going to go up right um if you just don't eat carbs your cholesterol is going to go up if you don't eat plant sterols your cholesterol is going to go up is that a bad thing I don't think so I think again this is a scapegoat and this is this that was shown that's not a that's not a contention that's not a theory that is a fact it was used as a scape Cat by the sugar industry that's in their own words right so that's published in the Journal of American Medical Association in 2016 and that's in that's Linked In A lot of my um uh videos that I talk about it and certainly in that one on cholesterol so check that out um addressing plaque in the arteries no I think that that eating a lwi inflammatory diet eating your biologically appropriate diet and not eating carbs and sugar and Seed oils and alcohol and smoking that all these and nicotine nicotine can directly damage your artery walls and cause plaque buildup so don't do that and uh it's even suggested that it's the plant stero that are actually getting deposited in the lining because macras is hang on tightly to cholesterol they don't really like the plant stero so they sort of puke them up and if they're puking those up in the cell in in the in the lining of your arteries that can build up and they've actually found some of those um in different plaques and things like that so um that's uh you know you know at the end of the day it's your choice you get to decide what you do with your body and what you eat and what medicines you take so just remember that um what do you do you you eat an appropriate diet you eat a biologically appropriate diet low inflammatory diet you lower stress you meditate for 30 40 minutes every day that's the only uh controlled trial has ever been shown to uh reverse plaqu was uh meditating 408 40 minutes a day and that and that removed plaqu so stress is a big one and um but eating the right things is a big one too so you eat a low- inflammatory diet you reduce your stress and then you check your plaque levels again you know check them in a year it's not going to it's not going to change you know dramatically in a couple months months check it in six months to a year um you you get your Baseline now you get it again in a year and you remove your stress you remove the inflammation that should improve and and we're starting to see that more uh you know anecdotally now as well and and removing visceral fat that's something that Dr sha Omar is showing that people have blockages in their cerebral um circulation sub provascular circulation and uh you remove the visceral fat with a combination of carnivore diet sprinting weightlifting and some other sorts of interventions that he goes into um and but they're all lifestyle stuff you know and they're all stuff that we do that I do and that's why we connected was because we're like Hey we're we've come to the same conclusion from sort of different directions and he finds that you remove visceral fat and blockages clear up as well and he did a study with over 6,000 people looking at visceral fat and reversing it and seeing its effects on metabolic health for the National Institutes of science so he you he knows about this so I would just keep doing a high fat carnivore diet and arm yourself with uh information and understand um what's going on and and uh and go from there and then just and just check get objective markers this is the blockages I have now check it again in a year doing what you think is right see what's happening adjust from there Tall Cedars thank you very much for the super sticker I appreciate it um also guys we're sort of coming up I only have about 20 minutes so maybe um don't do any more Super chats so that um so I can get

        "body": "hanging um uh s goolan 90 thank you very much for the hanging um uh s goolan 90 thank you very much for the Super Chat uh hi Anthony If plants are truly trying to kill us with defense chemicals then it doesn't seem very effective since people still eat them and most people don't know plants are doing any harm to them look that's a good point and the thing is is that is that different plants have different amounts of poisons but you know if you get lost in the woods and you run out of food you can't just eat any random plant most of them will kill you most of them will do a very effective job at uh at defending themselves uh most plants on Earth are termed inedible meaning that if you eat them you can die you can get very sick and so uh they're actually doing a great job and the thing is is that what we're not realizing is that slow poison is still poison and just you know I mean we we I I'm sure you wouldn't contend that smoking is not harmful we recognize smoking tobacco plant as harmful right you eat tobacco you'll die right it's very toxic we smoke this stuff it gives us a bit of a high and we and we feel nice with it but you smoke too much you get very sick as well acutely right then and there you know people first start smoking they smoke once and they're getting all buzzed and weird and they have two and they feel nauseous and all these sorts of things so you can build build up a tolerance to any drug to any toxin um there's there's a famous um story of a of a I can't remember his name but um it was an ancient Greek king and he was very worried about getting poisoned so he would dose him micro do himself with Hemlock and other poisons that were used at the time and and he build up an immunity to it sort of like in in Princess Bride with you know the ioane powder he sort of built up this immunity to it then he could poison himself poison the other guy he died he didn't because he was immune to it uh you can build up these immunities what does that mean you're this is a toxin that's harming you and you build up immunity over time um and there's this King that that built up immunity to Hemlock and things like that and then his his um his country got taken over and he was just like oh they're going to torture me and kill me and hurt me and all that sort of stuff I don't want to do that so I'm GNA so he drank a whole cup of Hemlock it didn't kill him because he was immune to this stuff not immune but he had built up a big tolerance to that so you know but 100 years ago we did not have the chronic diseases that we have now right 200 years ago a thousand years we did not have any of these things and you know native populations don't get these diseases when eating their natural diet this what they used to be called diseases of the West because it was like only Western people are getting this well when people started eating the food of the West they got the diseases of the West so you actually can get sick does it kill you overnight no but now they're just smoking and we still recognize that as toxic these are still defense chemicals it's just have more innate ability to detoxify them and to weather them um than we do other things but the thing is is that you know if you look at cats and dogs you know you have to keep them away from food and plants that humans eat because they'll kill them right so like night shades Tomatoes potatoes eggplants Peppers these sorts of things can be very toxic to cats and dogs and um and you chocolate you know can can kill dogs all these sorts of things so they are there are toxins in them the plants are trying to defend themselves it's just that we have a better ability to detoxify some of these things than others but they can build up and they can slowly get get you right so you know if you're dying at 60 90 even 100 you're dying decades early because we're designed to live 120 years and so if you if you died at 85 wow he had a good life no he died 35 years early right and that's that's generally from chronic talk if you smoke for decades that's going to harm you that's a poison that's a toxin right and the same is true of these other sorts of things it's just that you know they take they build up over time and uh so they actually do a good job and if you you know you we can't eat eucalyptus we'd get very sick if we did but we can eat spinach and okay well I mean Liam Hemsworth put himself in the hospital with acute oxalate poisoning from eating you know spinach smoothies every morning for three weeks so that's doing a pretty good job but you know most people will eat you know spinach and things like that especially if they're doing it you know not every day in huge amounts they'll be able to sort of weather that right but we can't eat eucalyptus but a koala can koalas can't eat spinach though and they can't eat other vegetables that we eat right because there are toxins in there they are trying to defend themselves it's just animals have built up an ability to detoxify certain things so that they can eat them but all all plants are poisonous it's just that certain animals have evolved certain defenses against specific poisons so they can eat that plant with those poisons and survive and and that's the thing that we need to understand and and realize and really respect about plants is that they are trying to defend themselves and whether or not they kill us that night doesn't mean that it's not causing harm and it doesn't mean that it's 100% safe for us or that we're biologically adapted to it or that they don't have toxin because they do have toxins they definitely have toxins it's just we're better able to to weather and detoxify them than other things so uh thank you for your question that's a very good uh point that is that is good to uh you know just good to bring up and good t o think about uh snowland thank you so much uh for the"

try carnivore great they are mostly eating leaner cuts of meat uh should they be adding fat they are also transitioning slowly um still eating some salad and diet pop yeah look fair enough you know if sort of eating more meat is very important eating less of the other crap is also really important as well um and if they if they can't do it just all in one go you know that's that's fine they're at least moving in the right direction yes they need more fat so fat is very important it's it's an essential nutrient you need it you need it for your brain your body your hormones these are you know especially important to um you know to young adults and and certainly to developing you know adolescence um need more fat so one to two grams of fat per gram of protein that's what you want to aim for it tastes better anyway so if you want you want to get fattier Cuts or you can add butter or tallow um as well and those are those are some good ways of uh of bolstering up the fat um eggs are good too those are fine and uh yeah so that's um that's totally fine you know just just you know try to eat more fatty meat try to eat less of everything else and and then at some point just have them say okay well I'm going to try it for 30 days of just nothing but fatty meat and see how you go and then just make a decision from there and but yeah definitely eat more fat and um Good Luck to that I'm I'm I'm I hope they do very well I'm sure they'll feel a lot better uh shuriken LM thank you very much good to see you buddy um are you going to write a book with a diet for type two diabetes because I noticed that my blood sugar is not under control could it be my eloquest um I take blood thinner for my replaced valve not that I know of I don't I don't know of eloquest um affecting blood sugar I wouldn't think it would um so with type two diabetes and we really just want to avoid carb sugar seed oils alcohol all that sort of stuff also stress there's different medications certainly prazone Picone those can uh really just cause diabetes um and so you want to get rid of those if you can um and then um and then you want to reduce stress as well that can be a major issue also um and then just just yeah just eating proper that should that should help most people um also how are you judging your blood sugar is it your hb1c or is it your spot test or you have a constant glucose monitor sometimes those ca constant glucose monitors uh run a bit high and so you you you spot check and say okay is this adding up is this lining up um also artificial sweeteners I've seen people with uh you know who monitor their glucose closely they've noticed that artificial sweeteners absolutely derange their uh their blood sugar and things like that so um and can be can possibly increase insulin secretion and insulin production as well which you don't want so I would think about all those things I would reduce stress uh I would spot check your blood sugar and if that's all normal then your CGM may be running a bit high or your HB andc might be marginally high because you know uh uh it's thought that you know when you're a bit more healthy when you're eating carnivore diet and you're not having all these plant sterols It screw with the cell membranes they get in the red blood cells cell membranes they die earlier that your red blood cells live longer and so you're actually looking at like a three and a half four month average for your blood sugar as opposed to what we're assuming is a three-month average because they don't necessarily only live three months and so that's what you have to think of as well so if you are if you're basing this off your hb1c most people will have HBC below 5.5 which is sort of the border for pre-diabetic um some people are a bit above that but they check their blood sugar all the time it's like it's just you know 65 65 65 65 that should not be a 5.6 then or a six but uh but sometimes it is so uh that's probably that case that their average is it's actually a longer average actually looking at a four-month average as opposed to a three-month average and and so so that's what I would do but most people reverse their type 2 diabetes with just a carnivore diet but the other things add in it as well so artificial sweeteners stress medications I don't think elois um does that but um but I'm not sure and if you have a replac bve like you need it you know unfortunately uh probably no no getting around that but uh but good luck with that let me know how that goes uh Gil Ram Ramirez I started carnivore a strict carnivore a month ago for weight loss uh no health issues started at 257 currently at 246 great job what do you recommend so I can speed up the weight loss less food cardio extended salt water fast uh thank you uh look I would I would just let your body do its thing I don't think you need to micromanage these sorts of things um you know I lost a decent amount of weight uh in the first couple weeks that I went on a strict carnivore I just really just dropped greens I wasn't eating processed crap I wasn't eating carbs I was already you know on a ketogenic diet even though wasn't doing keto I just wasn't eating cars because they didn't make me feel great and um and I just dropped vegetables and I started eating a lot more meat and I lost 23 pounds in in 10 days then I didn't lose anything because I was working out I was lifting weights and I was losing fat but I was also gaining muscle so it offset it actually perfectly offset I weighed the exact same every single morning for months after that was 243 PBS on the nose every single day and it was pretty crazy so I wouldn't worry too much about the scale I wouldn't worry too much about speeding up weight loss you lost 11 pounds in a month most people would say oh my God that's too fast that's bad for you no damn well isn't um you know that's what your body wants you to do so just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good do not go lean I don't think that's the right thing to do I think it's it's not just a calorie Source it's a nutrient it's an essential nutrient so eat as much fatty meat as tastes good to you as long as you're not on medication or other sorts of things that are going to screw with that and and lift weights you sprinting that's what you want to do card extended cardio is um um not as good as weightlifting and sprinting by a long margin um I wouldn't do saltwater fasts I don't think you need to you know if you're fasting if you're limiting food then you're going to lower your metabolism and so yeah sure you know you can starve yourself into smaller pants size but that doesn't mean that it's going to be the best way to do it this not going to be it's the most that's not necessarily going to be the healthiest way to do it and your metabolism going to be suppressed you start eating again that's going to come back on because your body's saying like no we're in a famine we need to store this right so don't mess with it let your body know you're not in a famine you're not you know a deplete of resources that you're doing fine and uh and your body will react you're already losing weight just let it go you're probably gaining muscle too remember that that that I mean I didn't I didn't lose weight for months like months and months and months and months and months but I could look in the mirror and I knew that I was losing fat and I was putting on muscle I don't care what my weight on the scale says out of you know past just a cursory interest it's not it's not it's not telling you body composition right so body composition um is more important than weight health is most important of all right you're feeling better you're doing well that's what you that's what you want and you're and you're you're clearly losing fat you're going to be putting on muscle and so I wouldn't worry about the weight side of the thing uh I would just keep doing what you're doing eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good lift weights Sprint get outside in the sun and get proper sleep the rest will take care of itself you don't need to you don't need to get to the Finish Line in two months you know for me I wasn't complet I could I still had a six-pack but I was definitely overweight it took eight months before my body got down to a stable body fat percentage and I was lifting weights for three four hours a day and playing rugby like it takes time don't worry about it it's a marathon not a Sprint although you should be sprinting not doing marathons so anyway um you know just good luck with that you'll be fine don't just don't don't worry about it just enjoy the ride enjoy feeling great enjoy the fact that you are losing weight and you probably had difficulty with that before and now now you're just doing it just by eating as much as you want to of what you want to so that's great so lift weights do Sprints eat meat be healthy and the rest will come good a nd good luck with that okay Bloom um thank you for the"

        "body": "t question is from ge1 ri4 thank you very much for the t question is from ge1 ri4 thank you very much for the Super Chat very generous of you um Dr jaffy I started low carb before the pandemic and am about 90% carnivore now but my calcium CT score went from low a year ago to medium this year could about of coid or Co vaccine have been a factoring my CT potentially I mean we that's the problem with these sort of things we don't really know what the hell it does to our body and and um and the different ramifications longterm or even really medium term of of this illness and the vaccines and that's that sort of people's contention is that okay well we don't have long-term data so you know that's a bit that's a bit risky to put something like that in your body which is it is you know if you don't have long-term data on something you don't know what happens long term so um calcium score can go up for a number of reasons people say oh goodness you have a high calcium score you need to go on a Statin well what do statins do they say it protects you from Heart Attack by stabilizing the soft plaques and turning them into hard plaques which don't crack as easily what is that that means your CAC score goes up right so your CAC score going up that means you need to go on a Statin which raises your C score okay so is is a higher CAC score necessarily bad well they say no they say well there a soft plaque and turns that soft plaque into hard plaque and that's better I don't know if it is or not but that's the contention so you could have soft plaque and maybe that's stabilizing solidifying so CAC score going up is that necessarily a bad thing well if it were then there's a big Mark against taking statens isn't there because statens raise CAC score so it's not even by their argument not necessarily a bad thing to have your CAC score go up okay um but as far as plaques are concerned can that go up on a cornivore diet sure if you're stressed out and you're not sleeping properly um that you know that that can cause these problems as well and you know the you know it's diet is not the only thing that that causes atherosclerotic plaques you can get certainly get this from stress again only RCT that ever showed a reversal of arterial plaques atherosclerosis was was meditation reducing stress 40 minutes a day mindful meditation deep breathing and do that for 40 minutes a day these people reverse their atherosclerosis right so you're reducing cortisol you're reducing stress you're getting better okay so there are other things that can be at play here it also can be that your soft plaques are going down but some of them are stabilizing so your C score sort of went up because the the corn already calcium score doesn't actually show the amount of soft plaques you have just the calcified plaques so I would I would expect that if you do other things sleep properly reduce stress Sprint lift weights eat carnivore um you're 90% carnivore now but what else are you eating are you having seed oils bad idea are you having sugar artificial sweeteners I don't think those are a good idea either um carbohydrates you know so uh you're doing low carb but are you doing no carb right because there's a difference and if you're eating enough carbohydrates that your insulin goes up that causes metabolic distress and problems and can cause glycation can cause damage to your arteries and um and so on so it does depend on what else you're eating does depend on a lot of other things but if you're reducing stress getting better sleep and improving your diet getting rid of the seed oils process Foods sugars carbs things like that you're going to improve and um and so I wouldn't uh worry too much at this stage I would just continue doing healthy things reducing stress reducing inflammation exercising properly sprinting weightlifting and check it again you know check it again in six months or a year see what's going on um also and remember that the CAC score does doesn't necessarily look at the soft plaque and atherosclerosis is just the calcified version of that also if if you were put on a Statin at one point your CC score is going to go up so that's going to go up no matter what you do right because that is what statins do they they um uh they they are you know that's in that they say we we uh uh solidify and strengthen these plaques right and that's a good thing we add calcium to it okay is I don't know if that's a good thing or not hardening the arteries I don't know but that's what they say they do and so if you're on a Statin your CSC score is going to go up as well so just remember that remember there's a lot of factors here uh could um you know getting you know getting these sorts of illnesses cause problems potentially I I you know it's we don't know everything about it yet Ian you could look in up Peter mcalla and Dr Peter MCA Dr U Malone they've done a lot of work in this area and and there's a lot of others as well they've seen a lot of the associations with increased significant increased uptick in um other sorts of diseases you know since the pandemic and things like that and and see different associations and see if there are people and there are people certainly having cardiac issues 100% And so you know is that is that one of those things potentially and so that that is a factor too but the other things you can address at least and you can go on you can go on Peter mulla's um you find Peter mccoll's uh treatment protocol for sort of detoxing the body from all this all this stuff that we got during the pandemic and uh and hopefully that all helps you out and settles things down as well and and then I would just not worry too much about it and just you know check it again in six months to a year and uh you probably will find an improvement actually okay all right everyone thank you so much I really appreciate it I do have to run um I will be posting a new video um I didn't do one uh this past week just uh because I was traveling I was in uh you know France for the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals which was amazing that was a fantastic experience so U maybe we'll talk about a bit about that on the next live but uh that was a great experience and so I'll be posting another great um interview on Monday Australia time sun afternoon evening as per usual uh in the US so uh hopefully we can get as many people as we can there for the the premiere and that really helps bolster things up and get YouTube knowing that people like it and hitting like and all that sort of stuff and that gets that out to more people and so if everyone can sort of hit like here as well and leave a comment um also leave a comment about your vision right so people that have improved their Vision please tell me what kind of vision issue you had what kind of classes nearsighted farsighted sort of things uh that you had and and what improved how long it took and all that sort of stuff because that is really interesting and I've heard more and more about that you know and others that have improved different sorts of health issues leave that in the comments as well you know what issue you had and what what got improved by and we we need this data we need more and more people talking about the things that they're improving uh because that's what encourages other people to to try this themselves and obviously if you get a whole bunch of people saying look I had this specific issue and it got better in this way and you have thousands of people saying that you know that's that's very good data right so uh please do that and then I will see you guys um on Sunday or Monday for the uh the next episode uh we'll do that as a Live premiere and we'll be chatting in the live obviously the video is pre-recorded but I'll be chatting with you guys uh while we watch as well so great thanks everyone have a great rest of your week and great weekend and I will see you for the premiere see you [Music] everyone"
