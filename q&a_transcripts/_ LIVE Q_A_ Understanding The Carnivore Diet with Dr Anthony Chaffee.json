    "title": "\ud83d\udd34 LIVE Q&A: Understanding The Carnivore Diet with Dr Anthony Chaffee",
    "transcript": "foreign hello everyone very sorry uh for the delay got just a bit uh stuck with a few things but here now so thanks everyone for joining um all right so today I just wanted to do just a live I want to start doing more weekly lives on uh YouTube and just answering questions Carnival questions or other questions that people have um that they submit the time or um uh submit earlier as well sometimes I get questions from people and uh and sometimes it's a bit you know just a bit long of an answer to um to give over you know text or email and things like that so sometimes they're good for these sorts of Live Events so so I'll compile a lot of questions questions and things like that that people send in and then answer uh questions as we go as well so thank you very much uh everyone for joining Mike good to see you and and everyone else here so if people do have questions um you know please do throw them out there I'm gonna like I said I'm gonna try to do this sort of around the same time maybe sort of hour variance but sort of same day and everything like that so we'll see how that goes all right so we have a question here how can you go carnivore while third trimester pregnant so I think it's the same as going carnivore any other time I've had friends that have gone carnivore during their third trimester and really it's just the same thing you're just eliminating out things that are that are bad for you and just eating things that are good for you so you're just just eating a lot of high fat meat and listening to your body and eating what your body tells you to eat and then as much as your body's telling you to eat I should say and then you know just eliminating out certainly the processed foods certainly all the packaged Foods all the seed oils and all the other high octane garbage and um and if you can just get get rid of all the vegetables and things like that as well I think that's a big reason why people get a lot of morning sickness is because their body is much more sensitive to things that are harmful at that time because they have to protect the baby and so if you're putting in things that are not you know the best for it your body's going to get a bit sick and upset and say hey no get this out we don't want this in our in the body because this is going to hurt the baby and so you throw up so I've seen a number of people that have had horrible morning sickness that has completely gone away as soon as they stopped eating all plants and they just just focused on meat and if you think about it animals in the wild they don't eat they you know they don't uh get morning sickness they don't eat things that they are going to give them morning sickness and so you know do you have pregnant gazelles running away from pregnant lionesses right and one of them is going to win right and they're both pregnant so it's you know it's interesting that we are the only species of animal that had such a hard time during pregnancy and I don't think that's normal I don't think that's a that's a normal state of being I don't think you're going to survive too long in the Arctic Circle uh when when you're just puking up a storm and you have swollen ankles and you just can't move and and you're just you're just miserable for nine months it doesn't really work you know because it's it's very inhospitable territory and then like you you cannot have dead weight pulling you down like everyone's got to be gotta be moving so it just doesn't make sense to me so going going carnivore in third trimester is just the same as going cornbread any time just get rid of the junk and just eat fatty meat until you're full and stop eating when you're done uh Mary thank you so much for the Super Chat it's very kind of you um she asks uh she says have she's been doing mostly carnivore for three weeks and suddenly broke out in hives on her chest and arms okay I'm sorry about that I don't normally get hives I have hereditary Angie edema but that's not histamine ever heard of this I'm concerned uh no I haven't heard of that um for for going carnivore there can be other things that obviously will cause hives obviously allergic reactions and things like that um you know what what exactly are you eating at the moment is just meat and water is it red meat and water is other sorts of things I mean obviously you're reacting to something um the best thing to do is and if you want to sort of put in the comments I'll try to try to catch your comment as well um if you if you want to answer that exactly on what you're eating and things and um but the the best thing to do is is have a food diary and a symptom diary and sort of sort of track exactly what you're eating when you're eating at what time and then if you're getting symptoms you're getting hives when you're getting them try to see if there's a correlation between what you're doing what you're eating and what's happening um and then you can see maybe it's something you're eating well maybe it's just like oh every time I have bacon this this stuff you know pops out so there's something maybe in the bacon that you're reacting to that is weird though but you're all reacting to something right so that that's what hives are that's a reaction to something in your environment or potentially to something that you're eating as well um so mostly eating red red meat mostly steak eggs some berries butter so I just I personally would just cut that straight down to just red meat and see how you go if um and then do the uh because that's that's about as you know pure as you're gonna get and just eliminate out everything else and then try try tracking things see if that helps your symptoms okay well it was something that you eliminated if you're still getting those symptoms then there could be something else I would doubt it would be the red meat um because I've never heard of that happening and people don't get allergic to red meat it might be something that's you know polluted the red meat that you might be reacting to you know some people talk about you know histamines your older meat and things like that like if you cook something leave it as leftovers and the next morning they have a bit of a reaction I've never heard people getting hives though that's a that's a very serious histamine response um so that's what I would do I would just eat red meat and water and and see how you go if you're still getting that you know track things with a diary and see if there's something maybe with the food that's that's uh being related to it maybe something else and you can you can try fasting for a couple days if you still get hives if you're getting hives I mean you're fasting well it's definitely not something that you're eating so you know it's just process of elimination you sort of eliminate out different things different possibilities keep track of the timings and and just see what you're reacting to because you know it is something so and that's that's pretty pretty strange that that would happen so very sorry that that is happening um at Super Chat from Paul uh thank you very much Paul I appreciate that um that was very nice of you and doesn't have a question attached but I definitely appreciate that oh and I should actually put these up oh I can actually put these up yeah I'm doing this on streaming or just sort of new for me but I can actually show some of the comments which is actually kind of cool that's a new that's a new one um let's see I think Peter had another comment up here where are you okay yeah Peter said um uh just bought a super chat but but didn't attach uh to my comment that's that's totally fine if you do have a comment Peter do uh put it up or uh or a question or something like that do do you put that up and I'll take a look for it um and I think there's another one um question from Jenny any known results for pituitary tumor and PCOS or PCOS and pituitary tumors are obviously different PCOS being polycystic ovarian syndrome pituitary tumors can be from a number of different ideologies and um well it depends on it depends on the tumor but you know there are people that have used uh ketogenic diets in general and sometimes carnivore diets in particular to to help fight different tumors and Cancers uh Dr Gary fetke in Tasmania used uh you know High you know very close to carnivore if not carnivore high fat meat based ketogenic diet to suppress his aggressive pituitary tumor which he is uh successfully done and and has not had any progression as far as I know in several years which is which is fantastic PCOS responds very very well to any ketogenic diet in particular a carnivore diet because PCOS is I mean a number of different causes of it and I'm certainly no expert I'm not an OB GYN but I have looked into this and it just seemed to be a very strong relationship between insulin resistance and high blood sugar and PCOS so there's women make well we we make most of our our hormones from cholesterol roll this is why cholesterol is vital to our existence and you have about 27 steps between cholesterol and testosterone women make testosterone first and then they convert testosterone into estrogen in the ovaries and high insulin levels actually block the conversion of testosterone into estrogen so uh in women so in women you'll get too much testosterone too little estrogen and and you'll get the problems with PCOS we can get body hair you can put on excess weight and you become infertile it's the number one cause of female driven infertility in at least in the Western World anyway and so just getting on a Carnival or carnivore diet ketogenic diet that's going to reduce your insulin that's going to improve your estrogen testosterone balance significantly and that can that can reverse PCOS or other causes of PCOS as well but that that certainly is a major one and that and that can help a lot I think a carnivore diet is probably even better than that because when you're having deranged hormones uh there's nothing better than a carnivore diet I see I see people's hormones improve dramatically on blood tests constantly and um you know part to do with the insulin and and the blood sugar and everything like that but also to do with the fact that there are a lot of hormone disruptors in Plants this is this is one of their defense mechanisms is to screw with our hormones so that we can't be fertile we don't feel good we can't procreate we can't you know raise a whole bunch of other little munchkins to go eat that plant right so it's protecting itself in the future as well and so you eliminate all those things and you're going to optimize your uh your hormonal Health as well uh we just got a couple super chats so I'm just gonna go through those thank you very much for all of these guys really appreciate it you know you don't you don't have to do um the super chats I do try to answer the questions as much as I can but obviously this sort of you know makes it more more visible so it's easier to see um a question from All fathers thank you very much for that it's very generous of you um says I am carnivore for 72 days and keto five years prior and wish to have lab work done soon would like to know which specific panels to select that covers all of the pertinent bases and I'm a patron love it yeah thank you very much I appreciate that and so far as one of the members of my patreon account so I appreciate that um so you know there are a lot of different things that you can look at I think some things that are helpful are looking at your hormones uh your your androgens you know like testosterone um you can look at you know men need estrogen as well that's actually important you have to get the high sensitivity estrogen to see exactly where you're at because normally just says yeah you're below this you want to be below this but you actually want to be above uh you know a certain percentage a certain number as well you want to be in a good range if your estrogen is too low that can actually cause problems in men as well so uh but you know definitely checking uh your androgener testosterone DHEA is something that when everyone ages after the age of 30 that tends to go down uh it's a precursor to understand and that is a precursor to testosterone which then goes into estrogen so it's all in that chain that hormonal chain but it's a hormone in its own right it has purposes and functions in every cell in your body uh long before it turns into testosterone so that's uh something to check as well you can get a thyroid function panel um if there's any issues with that you can get a reverse T3 or if you're having symptoms of low thyroid I would get a reverse T3 and uh and see what you're going there and then getting vitamins and minerals you know so B12 D3 um you can check your folate as well and um magnesium and zinc quite often folate magnesium and zinc are better looked at uh called erythrocyte uh study so they look at the red blood cells and they look at the amount of folate magnesium and zinc that are in the red blood cells and that tells you because these are these things are active in your your cells they're not active just in your serum right so and there's not necessarily I mean sometimes it can be pretty similar you get your serum and it's you know it's pretty accurate but it's but it's not as accurate as if you're checking inside the cell um so there could be a discrepancy sometimes so when I tend to to look for those things I look for a read through a site folate magnesium and zinc um you can also check your hba1c that's probably the most important biochemical marker you know you've been keto for five years and you've been carnivore for 72 days I think that's going to be just right exactly where you want it to be so I don't think there's probably any problem with that probably not any any problem with any of these things this is really just sort of a baseline if you're feeling unwell in some manner then you know getting a a specific test for that it's probably a good idea but you know just your HBO and C is going to be low because you're not doing anything that's going to raise your hpa1c and um and that's pretty much it I don't I don't see really any utility looking at cholesterol because it was it was never a marker for heart disease that was that was a con that was a lie that's that's a well-documented fact in the peer-reviewed medical journals uh the top peer-reviewed medical journals in the world like Jama the Journal of the American Medical Association so I just I just don't consider that something worth looking at hba1c is much more sensitive and fasting insulin you know is actually even better than that and looking at you know what your insulin is doing if your insulin is just staying at a nice low normal level I mean it just really just doesn't matter what your cholesterol is I don't think um if you wanted to check that you could I would get you know check your HDL and triglycerides if your HDL is high and your triglycerides are low You're great and you can just look that look at that as a Baseline and then in six months you check it all again and just make sure you're going in the right direction some people you know might need to to add a bit of liver people with the MTH FR G mutation have problems metabolizing folate and so they might have slightly low folate quite a lot of people are not symptomatic with this some people are it's still very rare it's still the vast minority of people will have any any discrepancies but some people aren't you know and then they just metabolize things a bit differently the meat that we're eating now is not as healthy as as wild caught you know horse Mammoth and and cows you know so if you're getting grass-fed and finished regeneratively raised cows I don't think you're ever going to have a problem with nutrients um but if we're you know like me and you're just getting Costco meat because that's what you have access to then um you know you might possibly you know need a bit of a bump with uh you know a bit of liver every now and then I don't think you need to go crazy on the liver I think people most people know that I think that you want to eat it in proportion of the animal there's thousands of pounds of you know potentially over a thousand pounds of uh meat and fat on an animal skeletal muscle meat and fat on an animal and there's one liver right so that's going to feed you for years and you're gonna have one liver the whole time so I don't think you need to eat an abundance of liver but if you're one of these people that maybe have that gene mutation the MTHFR gene or you know or you know for whatever reason you're just not getting exactly what you need you know add in a bit of liver there's plenty there so that's what I would do and you know if if you're feeling well I mean I I haven't checked my bloods in I don't know three years four years something like that because I feel good I don't think there's there's much point in that if you feel good you know if you want to if you want to just check and just make sure everything's fine then do that as well you can also check your um uh uh igf-1 you know that's as a marker of how much growth hormone you have and and that sort of goes down as we age but you know I see this this go up this goes up with a carnivore diet with a high fat meat-based diet it also goes up with anaerobic activity so anaerobic exercise being sprinting and weight lifting and that will optimize your hormones as we age as well and continue to put on healthy lean body mass and strength throughout throughout your life which is directly related to longevity and cognition so there was a study I saw in medical school where they looked at people's leg strength and leg strength in older adults was directly related to cognition right so the stronger you are the more muscle you have the more strength you have in your legs seem to have a relationship to uh you know not going senile that's something to think about and uh thank you very much Andy thank you for all you do so thank you I really appreciate that thank you for the Super Chat it's very kind of you um down here another super cat or Super Chat from from uh care bear cat thank you very much I really appreciate that and a question from uh Adam thank you very much for the Super Chat uh let's take a look at your question says I'm trying to lose fat and build muscle eating one Carnival meal a day sometimes two can I get enough protein to build muscle any suggestions absolutely I mean that's what I do that's what I've been doing and that's what most people do I mean like look at Genghis Khan and the Mongol horde they would go five days without eating they'd just be just ravaging the countryside and then they'd eat 10 pounds of horse meat in a day and then go do it again right so you can definitely get enough protein I mean if you I I don't see much utility in tracking apart from just interest you know seeing how much you're getting like oh actually yeah I'm actually eating quite a lot or maybe you're not eating enough and because your hunger signals are going to be very different on a carnivore diet and so it's very easy to under eat you know I did that when I was in my early 20s you know whatever 20 years ago 20 plus 23 years ago um and I I was definitely under eating because I never felt hungry I never felt hungry the way I normally did now I understand that I had to I have to relearn you have to relearn your hunger signals and so I did so now I know when I'm hungry but what I did was I just ate when things tasted good now right and that's how I re I figured out my Hunger signal so as long as you're eating fatty meat to the point that it stops tasting good you should be fine your body will tell you how much it wants there might be days that meat doesn't taste good at all fine you know that's your body just telling you hey we don't need it today that happened to me once that had me one time where I was like working out a lot and I still have you know enough quite a lot of fat to lose um before I you know got down to to where I am and I did you know I was lifting weights for three hours and it was at rugby for three hours and you know it was the end of the day I hadn't eaten all day and we're like okay well I have to eat because I did all this workout I'm going to be doing this big workout tomorrow so I have to eat now because I need the energy for tomorrow and everything in me was telling me don't do it the steak sounds awful I'm like why does the steak sound awful I love steak that's the best thing that I've ever had you know like that's my favorite thing to eat why does it why does it sound horrible and we're just getting we get used to this idea that we have to eat all the time every day but that's only if you're eating garbage you know that's only if you're eating uh you know highly processed low uh low nutrient food you know that cause you to overeat and you probably need to overeat because there's such a paucity of nutrients that you need to eat a lot of this stuff just to get a basic level of it if that and then you have to take vitamins on top of it so um you know but the thing is is that your body knows a lot better than we do your body knows exactly what nutrients it needs and when it needs it and if you're not in its way and throwing sand in the gears like you can actually just listen to that and so eat meat fatty meat when and as it tastes good and then just stop naturally when it stops tasting good but if you get to the end of the meal and you finish that meal and go my damn that was good good to the last bite you need to make another steak so you know you keep you you want to attempt to have leftovers you need to retrain your body on how to look at your hunger signals and you need to go to the point that it stops tasting good you don't have to force feed yourself I don't think anyone should force feed themselves I think that gives an unhealthy relationship with food and that's what we're trying to get away from trying to be have a positive experience with food at all times right and so just just eat when it tastes good but keep eating if it tastes good and eventually get to the point where you have a bite and just go like I mean it's all right but I just I'm just not really enjoying it that's that's when you're done and so you just stop there so you'll definitely get enough protein you'll definitely get enough uh nutrients for that if you do it in that way if you're taking caffeine or you're taking other stimulants or pre-workouts or something like that that will suppress your your hunger and so you won't necessarily eat as much as you should and you won't recover as much as you should so I would just be mindful of that as well but if you want to lose fat and build muscle work out Sprint lift weights don't do cardio except to like warm up but don't do like prolonged cardio the main exercises should be anaerobic so like high intensity interval training so you can do like a hit class or you can do Sprints bike Sprints assault bike and then weights working to failure pushing yourself extremely hard until you cash out and then you stop and you go on to something else or you rest and you do it again and you rest and you do it again but you maximize your your output and effort okay that will stimulate your body to build muscle it will stimulate your body to optimize your hormones for men it will increase testosterone increased growth hormone decrease cortisol cardio on the other hand does the opposite so it will reduce testosterone reduce growth hormone increase cortisol right so you'll get skinny but you might have internal abdominal fat so it's a tothy thin outside fat inside right and and you will actually slim down you might actually catabolize your muscle you might actually not not going to build up big strong healthy muscles you're going to actually slim down and atrophy your muscles as well now they'll be good for cardio you know for long distance running and things like that but they will be smaller you won't be building muscle so you want to be doing sprinting and you want to be doing weights so that's that's what I would suggest and then you need to eat enough so you need to give your body the stimulus to build muscle and to optimize your hormones and then you need to give your body enough nutrients and if you're eating to if you're eating to the point that meat stops tasting good then you'll be fine and you try to eat you know twice a day I think that's perfectly fine if I'm not working out then eating once a day you know to that point is more than enough and then I'm not hungry for 24 hours after that um if I am working out a lot and I'm pushing myself why am I a hunger signal really doubles and I can't get enough in one meal and so I have to eat twice a day right so I'll have like a big steak like like two pounds of beef and I'll be full and that's enough as what I want and then I wake up in the morning go like I want another steak you know and so so just listen to your body and just uh you know take it uh you know take it that way so and until you relearn your hunger signals just try eating twice a day you know just just see how you go with that I think you'll be fine you know especially if you're losing fat you probably won't need to eat as much when I was when I was still losing fat um I never needed to eat more than once a day in fact you know occasionally I only ate once a day or not didn't even eat once a day and uh but by the time that I got down to a stable body fat percentage sort of like you know sub 10 body fat uh my Hunger literally doubled after that and so I was eating twice as much as I was before and so instead of one big rib eye I would have two big rib eyes a day and that's just because my body was saying hey we want to keep this body fat percentage we don't want to lose any more body fat this is this is the rainy day fund right we want to keep this here so everything we're doing you need to you need to bring it in first before we put it out there so um that's that's what I noticed and so my Hunger like doubled after that and then when I work out it doubles again so you know that's that's what you can expect as well so depending on how much uh you know body fat you have how much weight you have to lose your body's going to be you know using that as well and uh and then if you're working out it's obviously you're going to change that that factors again but again it all comes down to stimulating your body in the right ways and eating until fatty meat stops tasting good and not eating all the other crap because that will screw things up so thank you for your question oh goodness there we go okay so thank you very much uh AJ appreciate that um 45 year old female 207 pounds how much to eat a day on beef butter bacon and eggs well look just just the same the same as I told Adam it's the same thing so your body will know how much you need far better than we need and the idea that you can you can track calories and things like that we can boil down these very complex organic biochemical interactions organic molecules with biochemical interactions in our body down to just how much calories they emit when you burn them in a bomb calorimeter in a lab is is just sophomoric I mean it's just it's too simplistic it doesn't it doesn't reduce like that we're not combustion engines so we we don't just run on combustion fuel yeah we are chemical factories you know and so we have a lot of these chemical interactions so there are dozens of carbohydrates they all have unique individual complex um organic you know chemical interactions with other other chemical compounds and they're all unique and the same goes with all the dozens of aminos and the hundreds of uh fatty acids right so you know there's different fatty acids that have very different chemical interactions in your body and behave very differently in your body than other ones do and so you can't just say fat equals nine calories per gram like that's that's dumb like it's just stupid you know because like they're not behaving that way you know they are they are reacting chemically in our body and having different chemical reactions so you can't you can't just say it comes down to down to energy it's just not it's just not that simple it's far more complex and a lot of these things have a lot of hormonal interactions as well and stimulate different hormones like insulin that have different effects on your body and that insulin affects leptin and that leptin affects every other hormone in your body and so these are very is a very very complex interplay between all of these things so it's uh it's not really possible to tailor um you know and break out the numbers and break out the calculators and figure out exact equations that are perfect for you now you can get it you can get sort of a number and and sort of like if you you know do this and do X Y and Z and hit these sort of macro and most people will probably be okay with that but it's not going to be perfect for everybody and it's not going to be perfect really probably not going to be perfect for really much of anybody unless they get really lucky but your body knows exactly what it's doing if you let it so if you're just eating beef butter bacon and eggs nothing else no artificial sweeteners no sugar and not like sugary maple bacon or anything like that you can just listen to your body signals and if meat tastes good or eggs taste good keep eating and if they start taking not not all that interesting anymore that's when you stop and so if you do that your body will will respond and so as long as you're eliminating out all of the other garbage that's going to mess with that and mess with your signals raise your insulin block your leptin and make your brain think that you're starving to death and need to eat in abundance in order to survive then then you can actually listen to your body signals some people will have from years of dieting and eating the wrong things um deranged hormones so they'll have high insulin that will correct but they'll also have very high leptin so have leptin resistance because they're leptin been trying to raise up and raise up and raise up just scream at the rest of their body like hey we have enough stop it and uh and unfortunately become leptin insensitive some people in that position uh will have difficulties losing weight at first so focus on your health a number one so it's uh it's you know a lot of people come to this because they want to lose weight and most people do most people lose a dramatic amount of weight quite quickly in fact however some people are in that position where they are hormonally disrupted and it's going to take a little time you have to let your hormones heal and get down to a more normal level so your body can work uh to uh you know in a more normal fashion and there will be people that say you know you know weight loss uh you know doctors and things like that that will say if your leptin is above a certain level like in Australia's over 100. if it's over a hundred then you cannot lose weight on your own you will have to get uh bariatric surgery uh well I've flat out seen the opposite I've seen people go on a carnivore diet or at least a very close to carnivore keto diet and their their insulin comes or their leptin comes down and their weight loss comes down as well and people can lose weight uh even though they're left in super high they don't lose it as fast as the others they don't lose it as quickly as some people you know I mean there's some of these some of these guys um you know like my friend Sean White who have done a couple uh lives with you know he lost something like 280 pounds in a year I mean that's amazing not everyone does that you know Kelly Hogan gained weight in the first six months and then she lost a ton of weight after that I would have I would I would be very suspicious that she had very elevated leptin and and had disruption of her other hormones as well and that it just took that amount of time before her hormones got back down to a more normal level and then and then it started flying off and that's what I see in my clinic people that have elevated leptins over 100 well over 100 some people they can still lose weight it's just much much more slowly and so for them we say we focus on their health a lot of people have like autoimmune issues and other sort of health issues blood pressure issues those all start getting better one lady um I have she is doing she's doing very very well she has four very serious autoimmune issues and she they're all improving significantly and to the point that she's coming off all of her medications which is fantastic and um and she's lost you know five kilos in a couple months which for some people would be very discouraging but for her she's fine she's like hey I'm doing this for health and if I lose no weight at all I don't care because this is this is absolutely revolutionized my health and you know coming off these medications and not having flare-ups of Crohn's and rheumatoid arthritis and other sorts of things it's just like it's it's life-changing but she is losing weight and her leptin is well above 100 and that will come down and that will keep coming down and once it comes down to a more you know normal level and the rest of her body sort of gets gets in line with that I I expect her to lose a significant amount of weight so for you I saw a sort of a long answer hopefully that was mostly helpful um but for you I would do the same thing I would focus on your health eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good eliminate out all the other garbage and just just listen to your body focus on your health focus on those wins focus on like your energy levels your medications are you getting better or is your blood sugar improving is your blood pressure improving are these different if you have autoimmune issues are those improving just look at your health look at your energy look at your sleep look at all these positive things in your life and don't necessarily just get hung up on the weight because that will happen that will come but that's not necessarily the point that's a that's a symptom it's not the disease right so you want it you want to make sure that you're you're focusing on the right things you're focused on good things you're focusing on all the good things that are happening in your body and to your life and you know because some people can look at that and say hey I have all these benefits of autoimmune issues are getting better I'm off these medications but I didn't really lose as much weight as I wanted to so you know I guess it didn't work for me well to me it sounded like it was working amazing amazingly well and so you know it's just a matter of sort of you know focusing on the right things and at least focusing on other things besides just the way and you can also put on weight put on bone density and gain weight gain muscle gain bone gain weight but lose fat and then your your weight store stabilizes I lost I lost the significant amount of weight just dropping vegetables I was already not eating carbs about five and a half years ago when I came back to this and I lost 23 pounds in 10 days right but then I didn't lose any weight at all I say the exact same weight because I was working out a lot and so I was putting on muscle and that was replacing the fat that I was losing so for months and months and months and months and months I didn't lose any weight but I could look in the mirror and I was definitely losing fat and I was definitely putting on muscle so I wasn't worried about I don't I wasn't worried about my weight on the scale I was worried about my health and my you know musculature my body composition and my athletic performance that's that's what I cared about and so that's what I would suggest to you as well okay Tanya thank you very much for the Super Chat as well um Tonya says been carnivore since April but still have the menopause spare tire going on 52 years old and I only need to lose seven to ten pounds uh but it's but it's all there not budging uh what to do well you know the thing is you know same same idea you know especially when you're going through menopause you pass menopause your hormones are going to be different than they were at 25 or when you're 16 obviously so it um those that can improve and I've seen people older than you come out of menopause on a carnivore diet so uh I always caution people you might want to be careful maybe think about using um precautions if you're you know sexually active because they're you know Dr Berry talks about I think it was three ladies that came out of menopause five years after not having their cycle and uh they got pregnant and so he had three women come in going what the hell did you do to me and um eventually they were they were actually quite joyful it was it became a you know a blessing for them to have have be able to have another baby but that can be quite shocking and a lot of people uh I I mentioned that to other people and they were just like absolutely not that that sounds horrible um but um you know it's just something something to understand that your hormones are going to get better your your health is going to get better and that could happen you know so just be mindful of that um as far as the the weight sort of not budging well there's a couple things are you eating just meat only drinking water are you eating enough are you getting enough fat these are all important things so if you're if you're chronically under eating if you're just eating just oh I don't want to eat too much because I want to lose weight I want to lose this spare tire you can maybe lose some weight at first but eventually your your body is going to slow down your metabolism because it thinks that you're in a state of of of famine right so it's asking for a certain amount of food and it and you're you're not providing it so if a cow is on a field with a bunch of green grass it doesn't just go you know I'm gonna I'm just gonna go light this week cow just eats what it's hungry for wine just eats what it's hungry for so if it has the resources available the right resources available it's going to eat them and so what's that signaling to the body is that we have everything available we don't need to go into you know critical uh damage control we're the only species that do that you know that we know of I mean obviously God knows what's going through the head of a cat but I would imagine that they're just they're just going by their instincts and you know we're not doing that right and when you're eating carbohydrates you're eating a whole bunch of things you can disrupt your hormones like your insulin like your leptin then you sort of have to you know because it's um you know it you have to do that because you are being told to overeat and we know we're overeating because we're getting fat and we're getting sick and we're getting unhealthy and so obviously you know you have to okay maybe maybe under eat just don't eat to the point that uh you feel full and that's uh that's been um in Japanese culture for hundreds of years that you just you just never eat until you're full as far as I understand I can't remember what that's called but that was that was explained to me um by actually Brian Sanders um if I'm not misremembering but um that's the idea and a lot of people you know I've heard a lot of people say you know doctors and things like that saying you know you want to leave the table when you're when you're 80 full you always want to be a little hungry that doesn't make sense to me you know I don't think any animal in the wild does that I don't think they're breaking out the calculator to figure out what to eat you know I think you need to do that then you're probably eating the wrong thing right you're not listening to your your body's instincts and so you need to eat enough you need to eat enough fat if you're eating enough all the time you're eating enough nutrients fat is not a calorie Source fat is a nutrient that is a an essential nutrient it has essential fatty acids has essential vitamins and minerals that only exist in the fat and animal fat and so you need them you need the lean you need the fat and you need enough of both and so if you're not getting enough of both you are telling your body in no uncertain terms that you don't have enough available and so your body says okay we need to slow it down and so you'll find that if you're eating the right thing and you're eating enough of it that is actually more conducive to weight loss than trying to starve yourself now you can starve yourself but you'll slow your metabolism and when you start eating again you'll put on fat again because your body says okay well we survived that famine we need to put on some fat to survive the next famine so you need to convince your body that you there is no famine you're you're in the Land of Plenty everything's going to be fine and um and you don't need to you don't need to restrict okay and you and so your body doesn't need to store a bunch of fat and not let go of it you know um bariatric surgeons will tell you that if uh even after bariatric surgery they have to eat they have to eat enough and so sometimes it's difficult because your stomach's all cut up and chewed up and I think it's I think it's a horrible surgery I don't think anyone should get that it mutilates your body there are a lot of side effects and not just immediate side effects you can have a lot of immediate side effects and have to get reoperated on and do all these sorts of things and get serious um malabsorption issues you cutting out parts of your stomach and intestine that actually that actually are involved in absorbing different nutrients you can get pernition or I mean pernicious in here you can get you can cut out the parts of your of your stomach that that secrete intrinsic factor you cannot absorb B12 without intrinsic factor right so you cut those parts out of of the stomach that's it you're on B12 injections for the rest of your life or you're dead right so I don't think that's a good surgery I don't think that's a good um I mean some people will have you know benefits from that a lot of people actually put on the weight again and their stomach will stretch out and stretch out and stretch out and go back to the same size you know because it's not it's not changing people's habits they're not changing they're not teaching them hey what's healthy for me to eat they're just trying to make it painful for them to eat too much but what the hell is too much you know I mean that's a good question as well I mean too much bread is any bread you know too much you know of of things that are bad for you is any right so you know I I just don't think that's a good idea and then you know 10 15 years down the line you get other very serious uh uh issues or potentially can get issues that you you'll need other surgeries for I don't think it's a great idea um but you know in any case it's um it's something that they will tell you that you still have to eat enough you still have to eat a certain amount or else you'll you'll actually you won't lose weight and so you know I know for women um what they're told is if you eat less than 1200 calories a day you will not lose weight right so there goes the idea of calories and calories out doesn't it right well you're eating less calories they should just they should just lose weight well no because we are not bomb calorimeters we are you know chemical factories and we have a lot of hormones and a lot of signals and a lot of you know Sailors on this ship they're just saying hey yo nope nope nope nope you know there's a storm we need to tuck sails and trim sales and survive you know that it's not it's not a one-to-one like that it's all calories come in oh but we'll just use it no that's not how it works that is someone so anyone who says that someone who fundamentally misunderstands biochemistry either has never taken it or has just simply not paid attention and you know any doctor in America is really is really strange to me that you know medical doctors in America you know just don't understand that core concept because biochemistry is required it's it's one of the prerequisites in America so we all took it you know we all took you know a year of uh um biochemistry 400 level biochemistry right you should damn well know this stuff that is very complex interactions everyone's took taking organic chemistry in America who's a doctor why do you not remember that that every single uh you know carbohydrate has different chemical interactions why why have you just forgotten that because you go to medical school and this is this is the you know the terminal degree right there's no further up from there in in America in other countries that's like the first one and then you get a masters after that which is I think is completely backwards but you know you you what you learn in medical school well that that's it this is this is the highest one that was my undergrad so this supersedes that right and so they're saying no no calories and calories that no that is not how it is you know medicine is not not even close to his scientifically rigorous as uh as any undergraduate scientific degree like you know biology chemistry uh certainly not mathematics dear God not mathematics and like so you know people forget this and they you know um Dr Robert lustig who I use just a you know hero of mine I love that guy he talked about this you know he has a degree in Biochemistry a nutritional biochemistry that's what biochemistry is it's all about nutrition and how these nutrients and different chemicals interact in our body that's what nutrition is you put chemicals in your mouth how do these chemicals work in your body and your metabolism right that's what biochemistry is and so he learned all about this stuff and how a calorie is not a calorie and how this is all you know very complex and then he went to medical school and said no no calories in calories out okay I guess that's what it is because Medical School supersedes anything you learned before that well no and so um that that is absolutely not the case so long-winded answer again I'm sorry but um I would just eat until you full and uh eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good uh you know eventually if you're if your hormones or or you know improving you could you could lose that but again you know we're not 16 anymore we're not 25 and so it can be that we may not get down to the exact you know body weight or body style that that we want to unfortunately but that's but if you're going to be able to do it that's the best way to do it so eat until you're full eat enough give your body that stimulus and then do all the stimulus that I that I mentioned to everyone else Brent go on a bike you know hard assault bike uh you know sort of action you know that that high intensity interval training and and lift weights that will stimulate your body to lose fat and and put on muscle and that is the best way that I've found to to get rid of that but again you know not everybody's going to get back down to their their 16 year old self unfortunately but a lot of people can can't and you can at least get down to you can at least optimize your your body for where you are at the moment we spent decades uh damaging our bodies unbeknownst to us we've been doing what the hell we've been told to do and it was wrong and we've gotten into this position but unfortunately you know that that does take a toll on our body and we don't necessarily um you know all we can't all necessarily get back to uh our Baseline unfortunately but that's the best way to do it if you can do it so hopefully that helps uh thank you very much for Super Chat uh Tamor um hope I pronounced your name right so said that their carnivore for the last two to three years last few months uh going to the toilet in gaps of seven to ten days is that okay yeah totally fine you know that that's really I mean you're you're going to go as often as you have ways to expel and if you're absorbing 98 of the food that you're eating which you do on a carnivore diet and if you're eating less gristle and just sort of the soft fat and the soft muscle you know it could be close to a hundred percent that's what the Salisbury diet or Salisbury steak was was was a ground beef ground up in such a way that oh that it separated out all the gristle from uh just from the meat and the fat and then you added in sort of more butter on top of that and so you had like no gristles like a hundred percent absorbable and you know almost nothing came out and that was why he thought it was really important because people had very bad GI issues like Crohn's ulcerative colitis there's no medications for this at the time really not any good ones anyway and uh you found these these are the things that you just had to eliminate out anything that was going to come through right certainly any fiber right and he called the gristle the the fiber of the meat right and so that that's not being digested is not being absorbed so it has to go out um but yeah so that's normal so if you're if you're just eating meat you're not eating anything else you're not going to you're not going to have as much waste to expel right that's not constipation constipation is not frequency constipation is consistency of your stool so if your stools are dry hard Rocky that's constipation right so you can look up you can just Google the Bristol stool chart b-r-i-s-t-o-l stool chart and that'll show you the different consistencies as you want to be in that you know sort of nice middle range where it's just sort of soft and um you know malleable and uh but not you know but fully formed right so you do that by eating enough fat um and so if you're getting dry hard Rocky stools you're just not eating enough fat your body's absorbing all the fat and there isn't any excess going out to keep that stool soft so you know if you find that it's seven to ten days and it's hard to get these things out you need to eat a lot more fat um but if it's just soft nice normal consistency then then don't worry about it I did a video uh on this specifically called um it's called like fiber constipation and diet I think I've renamed it to like you don't need fiber on a carnivore diet um I might rename it again because I'm not exactly thrilled with that title either but that that's the thing just look look up for my channel on you know fiber videos and um and you should see that and that it goes into a bit more detail or another Super Chat I am not going to attempt to pronounce that name because I don't think I'll be able to so I'm apologize uh but thank you very much for the Super Chat uh hi Dr chafee I'm a chiropractic student here in Perth oh great um and uh have been on a ketogenic diet for five years just wanted to know how can we support the health movement being Allied Healthcare Providers well look the same thing you know I mean it you know as as a healthcare provider you need to focus on the overall health of your of your patient and the people around you so you know try to go for a holistic approach right so you know you're you're in there someone's having back pain back issues something like that what is one of the most important things you can do to help someone with back pain eliminate all the crap that's causing inflammation that's exactly exacerbating their back pain that's the main one right and so you need to talk to them you can talk to them about diet in that context and you'll see if you start treating patients with this and you start getting more on like a ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet is the elimination diets are getting the stuff out of there especially at ketogenic keto carnivore Elimination Diet where people are have higher ketones higher ketones actually suppress inflammation so not only are you eliminating out things that cause inflammation you are promoting something ketones which suppress inflammation so this actually suppresses pain as well and so this is something that I've seen people with with serious radiculopathy that they've had surgery and their nerves have just been compressed for too long they have permanent damage and it's like hey I'm really sorry but this is you look at the MRI we look at surgery everything's decompressed there's no more bone there there's nothing that can be pushing on this nerve anymore but you still have pain that means that there's nerve damage you know and that that nerve damage could heal but it may not and so we just have to sort of see but there's no other surgeries that that are going to help I've seen those patients get better on a on a carnivore diet right not all of them but basically all of them who've tried have at least improved their pain because you reduce that inflammation you reduce the experience of pain you reduce that pain propagation of the nerve and and that'll help so excuse me so you need to just focus on that you can tie it into what you're doing someone has neck pain they have back pain you know you can tie this in and say hey what are you eating if you're eating high octane crap a bunch of you know processed carbs and sugar and Seed oils I think of omega-6s you know I mean all these seed oils these rancid fatty acids they're gonna cause huge inflammatory response in your body you know what's that going to do your pain it's going to exacerbate your pain so I've had lower back pain since I was 15 years old I always used to joke as a teenager that had the back of a 60 year old man I've always played a lot of you know High Impact Sports and all these sorts of things and then for some reason in my 20s I just had no back pain and I I had this hang up thing you sort of hang upside down the inversion table and that really helped and that that actually did help and all of a sudden I just noticed I just didn't have back pain for years and then all of a sudden I'm in San Diego and I was playing a rugby down there in 2007 and uh and all of a sudden I was just like oh my back's a little sore I'm like well that's funny like normally my back's always sore now I'm noticing that it's sore for the first time I was like God my back hasn't hurt in years and that was when I was you know I just come back from England that was just sort of had just started slipping off a carnivore diet I started eating a bit more you know carbs and veggies and things like that and um my back's starting to hurt again I backed in her for years you know and then my back's you know hurting again for a long time and uh now it doesn't you know I mean I do have back pain you know because I have I have something wrong I'm sort of scared to get an MRI I probably don't have any more discs in my lower back when I was 20 I already had pancake discs uh that had no they were fully desiccated there's no there's no gel in the inside at 20. so I'm like oh that's not good so it's probably just bone on bone in my you know l45 region but whatever you know I'm functional I can still squat I can still uh you know uh you know do what I need to do and um and when I you know I'm like working my back out and keeping my back in shape I don't really have any pain to speak up when I eat anything outside of this horrible stabbing back pain I'm not that I intentionally eat anything outside of this but if I'm at a restaurant the last time this really happened was when I um when I you know had said like a restaurant there's some rice and beans they sort of got mixed in I was trying to scrape it off but it was like little bits and you know those little bits of meat there's like you know sort of little chunks of meat or whatever it wasn't like a steak and so I was like trying to scrape little bits off it was like you know it's still sort of on there my I had like stabbing back pain for four days after that so you know I I definitely noticed that and so you can definitely help your patients a lot by by getting them on the right dietary track they're going to lose weight they're going to lower inflammation they're going to reduce their pain and they're going to be able to do your programs do your exercises do the things that work with you to strengthen their back and and improve their health so that you know they can actually just be healthy and you know it is you know it's sort of you know the better we do at our jobs as Healthcare Providers you know the less work we have you know and then sort of the ideas sort of to put yourself out of business but I think that's a good aim I think that's a very altruistic proper appropriate aim and if that's not your aim maybe you know a different vocation is is right because that is what we're supposed to be doing we should be trying to make people healthy so that they don't need us you know I do consultations with people rarely but you know I try to push them to to watch my videos because I'm like hey you can get all this information for free you know please do that if that answers your question I don't want you to have to pay for something some people that will look at that say how I have these specific questions due to my particular situation so okay that's fine let's do a consultation and we set something up and um you know the idea is to you know I don't do like coaching things where we have our 30-day you know carnivore challenge thing and that's that's a little different you know that gives a support group and people talking and answering questions and talking about things and having sort of weekly Zoom sort of uh things like this but as far as consultations are concerned like I'm trying to address people's questions and and get them healthy so that they can they can do this on their own and and quite often I'll have a consultation and I won't have I won't need more consultations or maybe a couple consultations and I don't need them after that you know and and same with the the carnivore challenge group we try to give them a month of good support to get started and get going and then you know or maybe people stay on for a couple months you know but at some point you know we want them to get independent and then they can go off and just be healthy you know and maybe help other people so that is is a good thing I think I think it's it's important to do that um you know the Goldman Sachs meme that came out or the the picture that came out and one of their I don't know if it's a shareholder meeting or something like that but it was one of their meetings and they said you know is it really a viable business model to cure people of their disease or should we perpetuate chronic disease States and just sell them the you know the sort of the management for the next 40 or 50 years you know these are the these are the same sort of companies um you know with the same Paradigm the same business model as the Statin companies that are saying everyone over 50 should be on a Statin everybody over 40 or 50 of people over 40 should be on a Statin and if children have high cholesterol you should put them on a Statin the hell you should you know they're there's these are drug dealers they're trying to get people hooked and addicted early on so that they can have you know a customer for life and they can just be an addicts forever I don't agree with that I think that we we as as Healthcare professionals need to try to fix people we are not fixing people at the moment but this is a major thing that that we can do to fix people so hopefully you can do that I'm sure you can I think that's that I think that would be very laudable if you were able to talk to your patients about dietary interventions uh that could improve their pain improve their symptoms and improve their health I think that you'll be a much better person much more I think you'll be much more uh satisfied with your with your profession uh because of that and it will help you as a as a professional as well because people will tell their friends this guy got me better this guy doesn't want to just rack up the bills and so I'll have to see you three times a week for the rest of your life or you're just never gonna you know be able to walk properly I think that's that's a bit disingenuous and I don't I don't think that's uh that's right to do you know um I think you need you know if you're if you're able if your your treatments are working they should work and they should get you to a point that you should not need them anymore right and so you will you will build a reputation of someone who gets people better and so you know maybe at first you're not building up the clientele like like others are they're having these return customers but you will find I bet you that you'll find that there will be enough people that come back and come back because hey because they trust you and they trust you to try to get them better and get them home and not need you and they're going to tell their friends like hey this guy changed my life I don't have back pain anymore I don't even need to go to them and that's what he's trying to do right and they're going to trust you more and they're going to refer you uh uh they're they're going to refer their friends to you as well so I think in in the long run it's going to to be better for you as well as for them but even if it's not better for you it's it's important to do because it is better for them so just my two cents on that or just my ten dollars on hand because I was a super chat thank you so much uh Rachel thank you again for the super chat um would you expound on upon what it may look like to relearn your hunger signals I'm one year in and still question if I under e and don't want to overeat uh and why I don't feel like a superhero yet well I'm sorry you don't feel like a superhero yet um you know if it is very important to eat really just meat and water I'm really just red meat and water is going to be the best for most people some people actually uh will actually be quite you know feel pretty awful on even you know pork and chicken and even fish especially farmed fish and dairy and eggs so especially people with with autoimmune issues there's gonna be much more sensitive I think it has a lot to do with with the animals are being fed they're not being fed but they're supposed to eat they're being fed a bunch of you know grains and corn and soy and they're getting a bunch of this you know linoleic acid and and polyunsaturated fats and other sorts of seed oils that are getting fed to them they don't they can't process and get rid of these sorts of things so their body stores them up and then it gets into their their bodies and their fat and then we eat them and so even though we're avoiding seed oils we're getting seed oils we're just getting them second hand and so that can certainly affect you uh going mostly to red meat seems to uh sidestep that so if you're not feeling like a superhero I would see exactly what you're eating are you eating just red meat and only drinking water are you having any coffee or having artificial sweeteners more fruit sugar Xylitol Stevia are you having electrolytes with stevia in it or one of those things as well those will not make you feel good there was a study that I saw recently in mice that showed that the equivalent of one can of diet soda with stevia so foreign for us right so much smaller little can for mice that that reduced their fertility rate by I think 55 percent right so one can of of stevia diet soda sort of thing equivalent you know had a massive massive effect on their fertility so God knows what that's doing to their body and you know you're not going to feel good right if your fertility is messed up it means your health is fundamentally messed up so that can be that can be a problem too um not eating enough that can be a problem as well relearning your hunger signals you have to sort of think about different feelings that you could be having say okay this is this hunger so if you're feeling a bit tired or feeling a bit just off and you're just not feeling feeling good you don't have much energy or maybe you're having cravings maybe you're thinking like that pizza sounds really good or that oh my God that bread smells amazing ask yourself okay am I hungry is this what hungry feels like right try eating meat try eating you know a steak or something like that if that meat tastes good then yes you are hungry and you should keep eating until it stops tasting good so you need to keep eating until you get to a point where you're so I'm really not enjoying this and then you just think about it you have you have to be very conscious about this about about you know how you're feeling and then the taste of of meat in response to that feeling I think oh I'm feeling a little off and you try to eat something like oh God no that's that's not what my body wants well maybe something else is going on maybe you're fighting off a cold or a flu or something like that and your body just doesn't you know doesn't doesn't want any any food at the moment and wants you to sort of take it easy so that's it's sort of a bit you know it's very it's very dependent on the experience of of the person um because all the all these signals feel a bit differently but that's how I did it is I just sort of thought I was like I'm just gonna start feeling a bit off of like okay is that does that mean I'm hungry you know and I just I would try eating like whoa that tastes amazing and I ate and I felt better afterwards and so that seems to be a way that people can can do so I would I would at least eat once a day or at least try to eat once a day and uh and eat until fatty meat fatty red meat stops tasting good and at least do that once a day if you're more slim or you're working out a lot try it twice a day and if you're ever feeling a bit off you know try eating again and try eating meat and if it tastes good just keep eating also if you're eating during the day in the morning in the afternoon something like that and you eat until you're full it will automatically make you lethargic and you'll you'll be you know pushing shunting a bunch of blood to your digestive tract you're gonna you know not have that blood available to your brain and your muscles you're going to be more tired you're gonna you're gonna turn on your parasympathetics you're going to rest and digest mode right so your body's saying hey we've got our nutrients we've got our our resources take it easy let's not waste resources and it's going to say hey just be calm be quiet and um you know and so you want to just listen to that and um you know and rest normally but if you're in the middle of the day and you're working you know that that it's not really conducive uh to to feeling your best at work or doing a workout so that's why I naturally just eat towards the end of the day and I eat maximally and I feel feel great and then I just sort of have a very chill evening uh go to sleep sleep like a baby wake up and have the whole rest of the day feeling great and I don't need to stop and eat and all that sort of stuff so there are things you can do to sort of play around with um and I did a video sort of like um you know faq's frequently asked questions and one of them was on being tired and things like that also getting enough water that that's very important as well you need to get enough hydration throughout the day so hopefully that that answers your questions and Eric thank you very much for the Super Chat I appreciate it um and uh Francisco very very appreciative of of the super stats very generous of you thank you uh so Francisco says I'm a 49 year old retired Marine diagnosed with young onset Parkinson's I'm very sorry to hear that uh can I reverse symptoms on Carnivore did your dad have long-term success um you know there's there's there's no studies that I know of that that say you can reverse this sort of stuff there are studies showing uh relationship between higher LDL cholesterol and less Parkinson's so you know higher LDL seems to be protective against it or at least there was a there was a correlation between higher LDL cholesterol and and lower rates of of Parkinson's there have also been studies uh with lectins we're actually showing them tracking up the vagus nerve from the gut into the brain and damaging the parts of the brain that have to do with developing Parkinson's and that people in I believe Denmark they looked at all the people that got you know vagotomy where they cut the vagus nerve and over the course of like I think 20 30 years or something like that they had like a 66 percent uh lower rate of developing Parkinson's later on so take that for what you will none of these things are perfect studies but they do give us a bit of information I can tell you that my father has really not progressed at all since his diagnosis with Parkinson's uh and being carnivore has has not progressed at all and in fact he's improved in a lot of different different ways he had Fairly mild Parkinson's symptoms at the start maybe a bit of a of a Tremor and a twitch sometimes not all the time and then um you know maybe just a bit slower and I had a couple of Falls you know uh which is you know Common presentation of of people developing Parkinson's they know they're not able to catch themselves if they're sort of if they stumble um as well as as they were able to before and so you know he's had he's had a few Falls and things like that so he has to be a bit more careful but he really has not progressed at all and uh and that's not normal you know most people do progress and they continue to get worse and and I you know and you and you would see this you'd see them sort of getting a little worse and a little worse and the medications being a little less effective and a little less effective and having go up and dose and up in dose and still less effective and just it just keeps creeping on he has had none of that you know and so that could just be because he's you know his his particular uh you know case is um is such that it's not going to but that that's what I've noticed and um and and so you know it would be great if we had more studies looking at that directly um but we don't at the moment with Parkinson's in particular there are other ones with keto that you can sort of glean information off of and and see an improvement but I think in any case you know eating a biologically appropriate diet you know what is what is maximally beneficial to your body and your biochemistry and your biology that's going to put you in the best position to deal with anything now it may not stop and completely reverse all of your issues but it's going to maximize your health and your body's ability to to deal with that and you're going to be in better better health you know as this is going on and it could very well stop the progression depending on what is causing that progression so you know not everything is Diet related not everything not everything is directly caused by diet but everything's going to be wrapped up because if you're you're healthy you're eating all the right things and even if you have like a purely genetic issue you know you're not going to be compounding it with all the problems that you get from from eating the wrong thing so I still think it's it's very very worth your while even if it does nothing for your Parkinson's it's going to help your health in so many other ways and it could very well help your Parkinson's or stop its progression or at least slowest progression or at least make you uh much more healthy to deal with its progression um yeah I'm sorry I wish I wish I had a better answer for you but I think it's definitely worth worth your time to to try it and do it and I I really do hope that it helps and I'd be very interested to see how you go uh if you do try it so please uh if you do yeah please keep in touch and let me know how you go because you know some of these things we're all trying to just gather more and more information um to see how this how this goes for different people in different situations and then be able to help other people like yourself in the future so please do let me know how you go and Crystal thank you so much for the Super Chat uh hello from Seattle hello hello from uh well from Kirkland originally uh been carnivore since uh September 22. um anything or anything coming from an animal uh to so probably honey I'm guessing uh to Lion diet of beef salt and water in the last month but I'm still having IBS D symptoms I've tried high low fat uh no liquid fat any ideas um well you know well IBS you know generally actually works you know responds very very well to just getting rid of fiber you know that seems to be uh you know very positive for that um I don't know if you're still drinking coffee or artificial sweeteners but I'll get rid of all of those because those those at NT as well it's caffeine in general those all act as laxatives so I would I would get those just far away from you and um IBD symptoms those really are just you know from eating the wrong things and so again you know getting rid of all of those other things just being beef salt water and it I mean you know beef salt water obviously that doesn't have coffee tea or or artificial sweeteners but some people still include those things in uh even though they're doing everything else is just beef salt and water so if you are in that camp I would get rid of that if you are just doing beef salt and water um I would well I just keep going I mean you've only sort of been on it a month um and you know people with IBD like Crohn's ulcerative colitis you know like they generally improve within a few weeks but they may not get complete resolution of their symptoms for a couple months um I have really yet to see someone get you know not get complete resolution of like Crohn's or also colitis doing just beef salt and water uh in a you know in a matter of a matter of about three months usually on biopsy it's clear by then I haven't really seen anybody have a have a positive biopsy after three months on beef salt and water some people are a bit more sensitive and have to be on grass-finished beef and water right so it may be that you're in that camp that you're just a bit more sensitive I don't know if you have a full diagnosis of of Crohn's or UC but you know if if you do or you possible that you may then you know you might need to just really go for grass-fed and finished uh beef really red meat and um and and see how you go with that some people are just a bit more sensitive and then just just takes time and then just eliminating out sort of everything else optimizing your health optimizing your sleep reducing stress meditating chilling out doing things that that relax you and you find enjoyable all of these things play a role in your body and your health and but obviously I think the major component of that is is doing exactly what you're doing which is eating eating that so if you're getting loose stools but they're not like bloody diarrhea like you would get in Crohn's or also colitis you can play around with the fat um if you're doing low fat and you're still getting diarrhea um well that can be you can go too far the other way you know if you get so constipated that you're having these dry hard stools that are getting sort of half stuck there you can have liquid stools that actually go around it it's called spurious diarrhea or overflow diarrhea and so what that is is you having diarrhea you're having you know liquid stools and then you know for most of the time and then every now and then you get this big Rocky chunk that comes out and it's like horribly painful and difficult to get out and then and then you're just back to liquid after that so that means you're eating so little fat that you know you're you're you're basically bordering on getting an obstruction so you really need to really ramp up the fat that you're eating in order to get that stuff moving out and then you can reset the reset the load or you know even take you know some laxatives or something like that to just clear the pipes and then start fresh with a with a better fat level you know I mean if you're just if you're just not eating fat and you're still getting loose stools I mean there's something else going on that's not diet related right or or you're getting so constipated or not fat related right you're getting so constipated that you're having that overflow but if um you know if you're having loose tools because of the fat content and you're not getting those those hard dry stools um that are blocking the blocking the way um you say you haven't you're not using liquid fat which is great you know like some people have like the Tallow and things like that they just can't really absorb it all that much and so they have to uh just eat the whole fat so the meat has fat on it you just eat that fat and then other people very few but some people have have a problem with even that like the cooked fat on a steak or a lamb chop and what they've done is they've actually started cutting off the visible fat uh from those cuts of meat and then just eating those uncooked which sounds a bit weird but it just sort of tastes a bit waxy you know it's just it's just sort of just waxy sort of chewy it's not you know it's not it's not as nice as the cooked fat but it's not bad it doesn't taste bad and um and they find that that they can absorb much easier and then they have much more normal stools as well so that that's something you can think of as well and if it's unrelated to the fact that you're eating then it just then I would just go grass-fed and finished and just give it a bit more time and and see how you go uh thank you very much for the for the super chats very you know very generous of you unlisted YouTube video so I don't think that's probably their name um I'm on testosterone replacement therapy I inject 200 uh mils per week I noticed today it is uh suspended in grapeseed oil yeah unfortunately uh is that horrible that's gross um do they make better oils that could replace the grape seed oil yeah you know I don't think that I don't think it is awesome I don't think that is something that you really want uh you really want in your body and you know this is something that you know when people go on different uh fat soluble vitamins you know they take like K you know vitamin K2 and D3 supplement uh you have to look at the ingredients quite often if they're suspended in soybean oil or sunflower oil or you know something like that canola oil God knows why they don't just use you know actual fats but that's what they do so yeah I you know it's um you know is is the worst thing ever I mean it's you know it's it's you know you're not eating this stuff every day you're certainly not cooking with it uh but no I don't I don't think it's great I don't think it's it's something that you want for Optimal Health um I don't know if they do that in um different suspensions it's not something that I really um have experience with you know prescribing myself so I don't I don't know all the the different options but I do know that you can get uh creams as well and from my understanding talking to uh different endocrinologists that the creams are actually uh better for you if you can do it it's daily so it's not something you do weekly or sometimes they do monthly injections as well but it's um but it it matches your body's normal patterns with testosterone normally you have you have your maximal hit of testosterone in the morning that pops up and then that has an effect and that test how strong level goes down but the after effects of that testosterone are still going and whereas with you know so you're having this pattern is up and down this up and down which is which is normal and so when you have an injection it's just always up right and it's sort of up and then it sort of tails off you know towards the time you're going to get get the next injection and so it's just sort of an abnormal pattern for your body to have uh elevated and depressed testosterone and so what you could do is you could you could talk to your prescribing doctor about getting onto a a cream you know and you just put that that on in the morning and um you know and if that's okay with you you have to be careful you don't you can't you know being kind you have to wash your hands you want to wash all that stuff off your hands because you go and touch someone else you pick up your baby um you know you you you shake someone's hand you you know hug your wife things like that that can get that can get on them and get through their skin and that can actually be a problem too so that's that's sort of a you know a downside a logistical downside of of the creams is that you have to be more careful around other people whereas when you do an injection it's just you know stuns in your body right and there have been cases uh one I heard when I was a kid of uh you know someone who was on trt and uh and they're like two-year-old kid they'll start all of a sudden had like precocious went through like precocious puberty and started like you know growing like body hair and doing all sorts of different things and getting a deep voice and like whoa what the hell is going on and that was it it just wasn't wasn't washing his hands properly after using this cream or it had him he was holding his baby and it was just he was getting just pumping this kid full of bunch of testosterone so uh that's not what you want uh but it's you know it's easy easy to avoid you put it on on parts of your body that that are you know you know generally covered by your shirt you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water it shouldn't be a problem and you're just careful about who you come into contact with on the parts of the body that that um that that touches so hopefully that helps I I unfortunately don't know if there's other oil suspensions that they have my guess would be probably not just because those are the oils that are that are uh well those are the those are liquid at room temperature anyway and they're just they're easy no no one actually in the industry you know uh well most people don't think of these things as toxic whether the industry knows that they are or not they don't really care it's cheap and it's available and it works uh for what they're doing so um I I don't know of any others that that have different suspension so you know if that's something that that you think is maybe a problem you can try it you could try the cream and just see you know see if you feel better on that if you don't feel much of a difference you know that's fine but you know there's you are going to be getting the omega-6s and the other sorts of oils that are going to build up in your body as well with those injections although it's it's not all that much so it's just sort of uh personal preference on that one uh so Eric thanks so much for the Super Chat said what about Jujitsu is it is that similar to cardio or more high in density I do it three two three days a week depends on how hard you go um it's it's you know if you're really pushing yourself that's definitely more high intensity so that's going to be you know because you know it's something you can jog a marathon right but you know try sprinting one right eventually you're going to if you're if you're working maximally you're you're going to get to a point where like you have to stop right so that's that's what you want you want that anaerobic activity where you're pushing yourself past your aerobic uh maximum right so you're not able to supply enough oxygen to to make the ATP necessary right and so you have to go down this anaerobic pathway and it's less efficient and all that sort of stuff and you eventually you cash out and you're just like okay nope that's all I got and so that if you're if you're pushing yourself really hard doing a very high intense manner then yes that that is a perfectly uh that's an excellent workout absolutely that's a question from Sam uh Super Chat thank you so much uh for the Super Chat hpa1c is 5.2 percent excuse me uh for three plus years on keto it's fantastic Carnival over 10 months now hp1c has risen to 6.1 percent uh no other changes during this period any difference between glucose rise and glycation from carbs and protein thank you for all you do you know so this is something that um you know you'll see if you if you track your glucose and you do like a daily fingerprint and you check your glucose through the day you'll find your glucose is the glucose levels is low and you'll find if you take check your uh fasting insulin that it's low as well so why is that not adding up right so you can have a glucose level blood glucose level and if it's average blood glucose level that that generally indicates this level of hba1c but there are things that can artificially go lower uh your hba1c or artificially raise your hba1c and it all comes down to how long the red blood cell lives because the the hba1c is assuming that your red blood cells are living on average three months but they there are things that can kill them off earlier or make them last longer if they're dying off earlier then they're not being exposed so the blood sugar is long and so the the the glycated you know end products which is what hba1c is uh will be less right because there's there's less exposure it hasn't been exposed for three months is only been exposed for two and a half months two months whatever then if your red blood cells are healthier and they're living longer than three months then you know they have longer exposure so they'll have more exposure to a lower level of blood sugar and they'll have a slightly Riot a higher hba1c our red blood cells live as long as they're capable of living um and as long as they are capable of folding and moving through very small capillaries and folding in half and sort of going through these little tight narrow passageways there are a lot of these the narrowest of these really are in our spleen and that's on purpose and so as soon as it starts going sort of squeezing its way around not folding and smashing through really quickly through these little small capillaries uh there are immune cells in your spleenexual bam smash them up and take them and eat them and recycle them into you know into new red blood cells after that and so um if you're if you're the the cell membrane is getting a little more stiff and crinkly and it's getting harder to get through those things that's when it gets eaten so if you're if you're eating um plant oils so um you know and and in keto a lot of people use coconut oil which is good you know it has a lot of good saturated fats but it also has plant sterols it has other things that aren't great for you and those plant sterols can actually replace your healthy cholesterol in your body all over the place but um in this particular case in your uh your cell membrane so all of our cell membranes are made out of cholesterol the lipid bilayer that makes up our cell membrane is cholesterol remember seeing that when I was in eighth grade I was just like our whole body is made out of cholesterol how can cholesterol be bad for us I'm like all right well there's something else I don't know now I'm in eighth grade I don't I don't know everything I'll have to just you know put a pin in that and think about it well I kept that pin in there I'm looking back going like you know that's that's garbage so you know that's the thing so when you when you replace that healthy good cholesterol with these plant sterols that are not as good and not as functional you'll get stiffening of the cell membrane and those um excuse me and those and those cell membranes will be a bit more stiff and they won't last as long and so they'll get they'll get taken out they'll get taken out of circulation faster and so you'll have an artificially lower hboc not to say that it will be low necessarily it would just be lower than what it would be if they survive to six or sorry to three months and then if you're on a carnivore diet you're not getting all those plant sterols you're only eating animal fats then your red blood cells are in your your cell membranes are going to have be more healthy and they're going to live longer so we have there's a guy he's called UK carnivore has named Steven and I did that after a three-hour live session with them uh last week they did that he and and Richard Smith did like a 24-hour carnivore q a marathon with a whole bunch of different people like myself and others and um and uh you know he's he's a diabetic uh he works in diabetes with people with diabetes and gets people on a carnivore diet and he sees exactly that so they have their constant glucose monitor they're checking their blood sugar multiple times a day every day and they're like wow it's low low low low low low it's very perfect normal perfect normal perfect normal their hpa1c is worth 6.1 well that's interesting because that does not track at all with what their actual blood sugar is and so the HBO and C is a surrogate for the average for three months but you can get your own average you can just look at your own blood sugar so if you're if you're checking your blood sugar and it's all normal ranges all in very good ranges and that doesn't that doesn't equate over to that 6.1 well that's what's going on is that you're you're just even more healthy than you thought you were and your red blood cells are living longer than three months and so that's something that we do see so I wouldn't worry too much about that if you are not having any seed oils not having any uh sugars or artificial sweeteners or anything like that if you're just doing you know meat salt and water uh I would I would expect that's what's going on sorry just a bit of a tickle just because I've been talking so much uh thank you very much Sandra for the for the Super Chat I really appreciate that and Anderson as well uh thank you so much there's a few of these that are that are don't have questions attached or just uh just very very kind thank you very much and Sandro uh again thank you so much I was very kind of you and uh kismeta thank you very much as well for the super chat um they say try carnivore from Mostly vegan had racing heart carbs and it got better uh is that a broken metabolism blood sugar oxalates try reducing carbs slowly Well you certainly can um racing heart is uh specific right so that that's a high fast Pace right so really too fast if you are getting that you should see a doctor and get an ECG EKG see what's going on um in rare circumstances people in general it's very rare for people to get low potassium um and I've never seen it on a carnivore diet I've never seen someone with with a like a low potassium on on a blood test ever on a carnivore diet but there is a theoretical that you know when you reduce your insulin that you can um you know go on a ketogenic diet your insulin sort of goes down and you can sort of lose some electrolytes but in reality you're just your body has already compensated for something wrong that's happened that your your insulin is up and that's causing you to hold on to things too much and your body's compensated by throwing things out the door uh more in other areas of their microtubules and then your insulin comes down it doesn't just keep throwing out too much it goes okay well we can go back to normal now we don't need to compensate for this this problem that we're having with too high of insulin so it can be um uh that your body just normalizes straight after that some people maybe they have like in that first couple weeks maybe they have a bit of a disruption in their electrolytes I have never seen someone get low potassium not to say that it couldn't happen I'm just saying I've never seen it um when you get low potassium like actually low clinically low potassium on a blood test then you get past a certain point you you put yourself at risk of uh arrhythmias and you can get a high very fast heart rate and it's irregular sort of like a fluttery sort of a big fast it's called atrial fibrillation so it's going really fast so people can get atrial fibrillation from that and so if you're getting that I would absolutely if you find that your your blood if you're if you're checking your pulse and it's super fast it's well above 100 per minute and it's irregular it's not just the same Pace or the same sort of uh yeah sort of you know like a metronome just sort of you know the same sort of you know pattern if it's an irregular pattern you know all over the place okay well that that's something that you should go see a doctor about and get your you know get at East ECG EKG and then check your potassium I have never seen that on someone going on a carnivore diet or keto diet I've never seen that but if if that's what you're experiencing that's what I would do I'll go to a doctor I get those tests and if you have low potassium you correct the potassium right you can take you can take potassium supplements and um and so on what a lot of people get when they go off carbs or on a carnivore diet is they get a pounding heartbeat and it's really noticeable and they can hear it in their ears and I got it too I had it for a couple weeks I thought it was really weird it kept me up at night it was hard to sleep I'm like what the hell is going on thankfully I was you know a doctor at the time so I was like okay I was just paying attention to it and I could I could hear it clearly uh without having to feel my pulse and so I you know I just sort of listened to it and I timed it I was like well it's not it's not fast you know it's just like you know 75 that's perfectly fine um it's completely regular there's absolutely nothing irregular about it it's not a weird pattern or anything like that so I don't know what's going on but I'm not really worried about it at the same time um and a lot of people in that situation where they have that that big heavy harping they go I'm getting palpitations and and you know we use a lot of different terms to mean sort of the same thing and because we use different terms sometimes it's hard to know what we're all talking about so I try to be very specific with all of this stuff um so sometimes they'll get that big heavy pounding heartbeat and they'll you know go to the go to the doctor or whatever and they'll go to the doctor and they'll get an EKG and or a Holter which will check it for a few days and they'll find that well everything's fine everything looks fine but they're like okay well it doesn't feel fine there's feels like it's all weird um and they check their electrolytes everything's fine everything's normal potassium is perfect magnesium is perfect calcium is perfect so what are you gonna do and um well I think I don't know what's going on at that point if everything else is normal but it is something that I've experienced and that other people have experienced and they go away um I think it could potentially have something to do with ketones itself themselves because uh your cardiomyocytes actually prefer to run on ketones they run better on ketones as does your brain and so I think it might have something to do with that where now your ketones are going up and your heart goes like you're like you're putting jet fuel you know into your car you know all of a sudden you're like oh my God yes and it's just it's all of a sudden it's just it's Off to the Races performance working really really well it doesn't mean anything's wrong it doesn't mean there's there's problem with the electricity of the heart it could just be something as simple as I don't have the answer for this this is this is my guess on this is that it could be that you're now getting this this more optimal Fuel and your heart just working better and thumping harder but either way um as long as your EKG is normal ECG in other parts of the world and your electrolytes are normal then you know it it'll go away you know if it's that pounding if it's racing if your heart rate's over 100 you need to get that checked out and taking a look at um and uh you know and if you want to uh you know sort of slowly reduce the carbs and things like that you know that's fine you know and if it's if it's really uncomfortable or weird you know adding in a bit in every now and then for for your uh you know for your sanity is one thing but as as long as your BCG EKG is normal your electrolateral normal um it's it's probably what what I and others have experienced which is that heavy pounding heartbeat that is freaky but is not dangerous and it's actually I think of it as your heart getting more healthy and you know and then you just and then that will slow down and it will go away and you'll go back to normal so uh that's what I would recommend and thank you very much Michael uh for the super chat um I eat red meat shrimp crab bacon cheese lmnt twice a day and that's that's the electrolytes uh company that does electrolytes hopefully it's not cheese Elementary hopefully that's another comma there uh twice a day and I'm adding Real Salt to everything ghee and butter and I have no idea how much salt or fat I'm getting uh too much or too little general amount of fat or salt per day generally you know again you need enough fat you need enough uh lean right there are things that come with the fat that are essential um not just the fatty acids uh you know but different nutrients and vitamins and things like that um if you if you aim for about one gram of fat to one gram of protein in your meat which is about what a rib eye is that's that's that's a good range egg is a little less than that a whole egg egg yolk is a little more than that uh fat I should say um and uh salmon for instance is a little less than one gram of fat to one gram of protein but it's in the ballpark right and so you know if you're eating in that range you know some people are going to need a little more some people are going to need a little more fat some people are going to need a little more of the lean it's not just the protein that they're needing it's the other things that come with the the lean meat as well um so aim for that aim for sort of like gram for gram Factor protein and then and then just from there you know I think that you know going by your stools if you're getting dry hard Rocky stools you're not eating enough fat right because you have a limited capacity to absorb fat based on on our bile secretion from our liver our I think that our bodies don't do anything uh by mistake I think it's making it a certain amount of bile because it wants a certain amount of fat to come back in return for that investment that it's made in making that resource which is which is bile and so you know it wants that amount of fat but it doesn't doesn't want more doesn't need more and so you know you'll make more and so a little bit extra a little bit more than you can absorb shows that well it gets into your stools and keeps the stool soft but that shows you that you've saturated your body's ability and desire to absorb fat so I think that's how you know if you're getting enough fat is if you're getting uh you know normal consistency stools you know with the the understanding that if you're drinking coffee or tea or or having artificial sweeteners and there can be like Stevia and element so I would get the normal non-flavored you know horrible tasting ones uh rather than than one that has like Stevia or erythritol both of which can act as laxative certainly erythritol among free sugars it's 100 a laxative it even says that on the on the back if you buy those things and um and so I would you know I would avoid all of those things because I can that can screw it up because if you're not getting enough fat and you would normally get dry hard stools but you're drinking coffee and taking uh artificial sweeteners then it might normalize it and think like oh yeah everything's everything's normal having normal stools so I'm getting enough fat well maybe you're not maybe you're not getting enough fat and maybe if you stop eating those things you'd get these dry hard Rocky stools or maybe you're getting diarrhea you're getting loose stools um but that's because you're taking these things that are a bit of a laxative and if you stop taking those then you'd have normal stools so you don't actually need to change the fat so all that stuff aside if you're only eating meat and water and no artificial sweeteners you know the element unflavored unsweetened fine and you know nothing else uh then just look at your stools you know aim for gram for gram some people need two grams of fat for one gram of protein you know some people need a bit more protein than they need fat so just do you know aim for gram for gram and then adjust from there just based on your own body's needs and and you can really go by taste you know I I still think that's the case you know your body's your body tastes nutrients it goes for nutrients it doesn't just go for calories right and so if you're eating a whole bunch of lean ground beef it starts to taste not great pretty quick you know but you add fat in there it tastes good right so you know your body wants both right so now go by taste eat until fatty meat stops tasting good look at your stools make sure that those are the right consistency and that that usually is um uh you know how how most people are able to do this pretty pretty accurately so super chat from Kevin thank you so much um Crohn's disease carnivore several times but diarrhea never ends after a few weeks um I've tried bile acid binders like bone meal Dairy and vegetables any tips well I I wouldn't use dairy or vegetables especially for Crohn's because that can that can exacerbate your Crohn's anybody with crohn's should be or any autoimmune issue I think you need to start with just pure red meat and water and you know grass been finished uh red meat if you're if you're still having a few problems after a few weeks um then and sort of similar advice to previous you know making sure that you're not having any coffee tea or artificial sweeteners uh again Dairy and eggs will generally cause problems with people with crohn's and 100 vegetables will anything with fibers is going to be a bad idea and um insoluble fiber in particular and so I would just get rid of all that and I would um just try to go just red meat and water grass-fed and finish if you can if you can afford it you can have access to it or just just normal Safe Way red meat and water if you if you if that's what you have access to um and then yeah get rid of that absolutely everything coffee tea anything like that and then if you're still getting getting diarrhea is this is Crohn's diarrhea is this bloody diarrhea are you having a flare-up um that that will pass there are studies showing that an elemental diet just excluding everything else except basic nutrients which is what meat is is a better treatment to get people out of an acute flare-up of Crohn's than prednisone prednisolone steroids right so so that should calm down eventually if you're just getting just loose stools you know are you eating a lot more fat than your body can absorb if you're only eating red meat and water um you know try pulling that back don't add in uh you know the the rendered fat like Tallow lard duck fat um even butter and ghee your body those will go through your system a bit quicker and you can just not absorb that so that can cause loose stools a bit easier eat the whole fat you know fat that's on the meat and if you're still having problems you know just eat eat the the you know the raw uncooked fat and then cook the meat on its own and eat that separately and um and hopefully that that should should sort you out you know not ending after a few weeks um you know I would still keep it up I would you know you can you can do all those things that I mentioned but you know especially if you're if you're if you're if you're having active you know Crohn's then you know it may be that uh you just need a bit more time three weeks is still uh it's still early days for these sorts of things so I would I would give it a bit more time as well and uh momentum fourth thank you very much for the Super Chat and hemochromatosis inherited from my dad and eat a lot of red meat uh do you know how this works on Carnivore so I haven't had any uh hemochromatosis patients myself I have spoken to Dr Sean Baker who has and he said that they actually improve on a carnivore diet and they get a bit more control um it's you know it is how your body metabolizes iron it's not just the amount of iron that's coming in that's that's the issue with hemochromatosis and so a lot of times when we have these genetic issues uh and you start eating a normal biologically appropriate diet our our bodies start working better even though we have these genetic issues and so I can't say that that for sure will happen with you but that's something that Dr Baker has seen a few times um and so either way it's going to improve your your system and your health in a number of ways and will make it well worth your time and effort to go on a carnivore diet and you know and then you know treatment for hemochromatosis that sort of levels get too high is you know the venipuncture and you you know you you do some bloodletting with your doctor maybe that you still need to do that but your health will improve in a thousand other ways as well and I think it's it's well worth your time and effort to keep doing that and you know if if you follow in the in this in the same pattern as as if as the the patients that Dr Baker has seen you know it could very well mean that you don't need to do that nearly as much or maybe even at all so um but that's something that I've spoken to a few people with hemochromatosis and I've always sort of given that that advice um and I'll say Hey you know and let me know let me know how that goes um and uh you know so I'm still so I encourage you as well see how that goes see how you feel with it and and please let me know I'd like I'd like feedback on this because you know it's something that you know we you know we need as much information on this as we can but I think it's I think it's gonna be well worth your time and effort uh to do that uh regardless and uh Cafe effects thank you so much for the Super Chat there's no question attached but uh thank you for that um okay and just let's say and Super Chat from Crystal thank you so much um so she says never honey tea or coffee and no artificial sweeteners just beef salt water multiple autoimmune issues trying to be patient uh we'll try grass-fed okay so there you go um yeah um yeah that's that's a bit of a shame some people are just a bit more sensitive with autoimmune issues and they really have to they really have to be on just uh grass-fed and finished water so [Music] um you know this is this was crystal earlier talking about you know the IBS and IBD symptoms so uh yeah you know having having multiple autoimmune issues um you know is going to take time you know not everything uh is going to heal as fast as others I do see people with with crohn's and ulcerative colitis improve a lot on just red meat and water in in a few weeks but it can take it can take longer than that and rheumatoid arthritis um multiple sclerosis things like that these can take uh longer as well rheumatoid arthritis seems to to improve in in weeks to months Ms is going to take several months uh Hashimoto's can take over a year not everyone will improve completely on these things some of these some of these autoimmune issues actually cause permanent damage obviously you know they're attacking your body and so with Ms it's attacking your your nervous tissue your nerves right and so it's causing damage and demyelination to your your axons and your nerves in your in your in your body that can cause serious problems serious neurological uh problems but you can heal I've seen people heal on this this is anecdotal but I've seen people reverse their their symptoms and and regrow um the lesion like their lesions the damaged parts of their nerves and their body actually start getting better on MRI um you know there was uh you know Dr Sarah who I had on the podcast she had very bad multiple sclerosis in her 30s and uh was was you know crippled she was basically in a wheelchair and uh six months later she was doing ballet right and her MRI showed that she had her her lesions and damage to her nerves were actually resolving on MRI so that's amazing and so but again you know six months you know and so that's uh so I would just be I'll be patient and just do sort of everything that we talked about you know try to try to mess around with the fat and um and uh you know try to eat the the solid fat and even uncooked fat as well and just see see how that that goes for you and you know then just make sure that um you're giving it enough time and you know a lot of these things can take take a while to heal when someone has one autoimmune issue it predisposes them to having more autoimmune issues and it sounds like you're in that case so it's just gonna it is will take time regardless uh but there are definitely things that um that that can help you along the way as well you know just just like we talked about with a solid fat the uncooked fat uh reducing fat if you need to and then going Grass Grass finished if you can so good luck with that I hope it goes well uh please do let me know how you go um Super Chat for Mitchell thank you very much uh best suggestions on how to get started uh while over the road driving us oh well over the road driving a semi semi truck with limited to no time to sit down and cook before having to uh to go to sleep truck shop food is about the only other option and it's total garbage yes that is a difficulty I guess it depends on how long your your trips are you know you could pre-cook things I don't know if you have a little fridge or a little way of you know sort of cooking things or whatever but you could you could pre-cook meals you could pre-cook steaks and then put them in a fridge or put them in a sort of a cooler or something like that and uh and then just just eat those and just sort of ration out how much you're you think you're going to need each day um you know when I go camping you know sometimes I'll I'll do that while I'll uh you know get a quick bunch of steaks and just come up into cubes and just bring them you know a big bag of that um or um or you know cook them on the go and then little cubes and cook them on fire obviously that's that's camping though um but then at one point I was just sort of I was just like all right well I just went to a grocery store so we're stocking up on on food because I was serving like a two week trip you know camping and Hiking going up all around Western Australia and I just decided to buy like a couple hams this is like whole big hams and um and I just ate those they're just cutting off huge chunks of of ham with you know the fat and the skin and the meat and I would because it was a bit more lean than I wanted people think it's like oh ham it's very fatty it's not all that fatty it's actually quite lean and um you know the hind legs are always uh more lean on animals and uh and so I was I was getting butter and so I get like a thing of butter I cut a slice of butter and put it on with ham that's what it was like cheese you know like ham and cheese but I would eat ham and butter and so that's what I did as well so you can you can you can do that too you know hams I mean they're they're designed to be preserved right I mean that's why that's why we've made them you know so that they they can just sit there and and for you know the whole you know Season Winter or whatever and then you just have you have these food stores right and so uh you can do that as well so I would pre-cook uh these things and bring them in a cooler and just have enough uh food to go for the for the few days that you're going or if it's a couple weeks um you know you need to plant a bit more uh out there I have even just bought steaks from the store and just just eaten them raw you know they unless you are contaminating them they are very unlikely to be contaminated so the idea that you're going to get food poisoning from meat is just it's just not borne out by reality you know 98.5 of food poisoning uh cases in America at least last time I checked several years ago what are are from produce right not from meat and the ones that are from meat are from food handling errors so it's like someone at a restaurant who's cooking your food maybe one of the ingredients was meat and he didn't wash his hands or she didn't wash their hands and you know they go and touch something and they get you know E coli on it or whatever and people get that is that from the meat no that's from somebody's you know hands dirty hands that they didn't wash right there was meat in it you know a famous case was Jack in the Box back in the 90s I want to say in Seattle I think it was in uwu District actually at University of Washington and and uh I think like six people died of E coli oh my God you know the contaminated meat no there was someone there who didn't wash their damn hands and they they you know got that contaminated their contaminated hands on the burger so there was meat in the burger but that's not from the meat right you cook the meat and there's no bacteria that's that's sterilized now right Jesus sorry guys and um you know so that's someone else contaminating it right and so um that's not from the meat so if you're just buying the stuff you know from the store in America or in another Western Country there are very very very stringent uh you know checks they have they they sample all these things if there's any contamination they have to deep clean the whole thing they uh they have deep clean sort of every six hours in America um and if there's any sort of sign of contamination they have to de-clean again they can't keep processing and so this is like basic it's close to a sterile environment that they're processing these animals in is possible and then they take samples and you know packages of meat away from that and send it off to the lab any sign of contamination they they just pull the whole load back and this is why you occasionally you get recalls but it's actually very rare that that happens and whereas with you know plants and produce and things like that it's it's the much more common occurrence literally 98.5 of food poisoning comes from produce and so you know it's I've eaten raw you know if that's not what you want to do you can get a little hot plate or something like that or just pre-cook I think that's probably the easiest way to do is you just pre-make these meals or just buy a big old ham and some butter and do it that way I have momentum fourth thank you very much for the Super Chat uh there's no no question attached thank you very much I appreciate that um Buck doesno good name wow so impressed at the time you've spent tonight helping people I miss a lot during work around the house but YouTube won't have fun well thank you very much I appreciate that and well it's you know it's good to good to sort of feel these questions and and to talk to people and and hopefully it's helpful um thank you very much for that an explanation would be effective long-term exposure uh to load density lipoprotein cholesterol uh beginning early in life on the risk of coronary heart disease a mendelian uh randomized analysis oh so this is um Peter I think this is uh who commented on my Instagram post about this live um yeah uh I I did respond to your comment on Instagram I tried the link for that that you put there um but I didn't open up I said the that um you know the web page wasn't found so I did try to look for that um before coming on today because that would have been great to sort of take a look at um but the um I so I don't know what that that paper says but I do know that there are a number of studies with hundreds of thousands of people showing that higher LDL people over the age of 65 that higher LDL cholesterol equates to longer life and lower cancer rates and lower infectious disease rates and lower Alzheimer's and lower Parkinson's and less likely to go to a nursing home so there does seemed to be a direct relationship to in older adults with higher LDL cholesterol and Better Health and Longevity um and the you know all the original studies sort of suggesting you know a correlation between higher LDL and uh and heart disease you know I've been debunked shown to have been fraudulent and the you know like the Framingham say I mean this is something that's been you know touted as as just one of the you know the the game changers in cardiology as far as cholesterol is concerned you know that was completely misrepresented the the results were completely misrepresented by the AHA the American Heart Association because they're imminently corrupted uh at least they were then I have no idea where how their their ties run now but I I'd have no reason to suspect that they're not completely corrupted as they've started out corrupted uh by industry by industry uh funding and money and bribes and so they misrepresented the Framingham study the Framingham study and they said that the Framingham studies showed that higher total cholesterol LDL equated to higher rates of cardiovascular disease and death in fact they found the exact opposite so the lower your your cholesterol uh create I think was like I forget the exact you know um you know uh the exact amount um from the study I'm just I'm just not remembering the exact figures but lower cholesterol equated to I think like an 11 certain amount of lower cholesterol equated to like an 11 rise in your risk of cardiovascular related death so like heart attack or stroke right so you know that it was a bit funny there so you have a lot of these studies that show like hundreds of thousands of people um tens of thousands of people and hundreds of thousands of people in various studies that that show that look this this isn't even related to heart disease and in fact you can find an inverse relationship in a lot of these these things which were actually misreported and said that they they prove that cholesterol has a correlation there's nothing nothing no studies ever that have ever been able to show causation none um there have been Interventional randomized controlled trials reducing cholesterol reducing LDL cholesterol reducing saturated fat which is always what people suggest it replace saturated fat with with unsaturated fat especially polyunsaturated fats and that will reduce your LDL cholesterol and that will reduce your your risk of heart disease heart attack and stroke and death from these afflictions and in fact that's exactly the opposite of what was found in these randomized control trials so they replaced saturated fat with polyunsaturated fats and most of which will be linoleic acid because I think it's something in these seed oils is polyunsaturated fats eighty percent of these things are linoleic acid and they found that it did indeed lower the LDL cholesterol but in fact what it did was increase death and death from heart attacks and strokes right significantly so you know these are randomized controlled trials that they're reducing LDL and more people are dying so that's that's the highest level of evidence that's much higher than than you know epidemiological um things but I'm I'm interested in reading that if you want to uh I don't know if you saw my comment on my Instagram but I've replied to that and the link didn't work so if you can send the link again or DM me with the link but just replying on that comment it's probably easier to find it there because DMS get lost very easily and I also did a uh I also did a um uh you know a video on cholesterol called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease um that the guy go over a lot of that and a lot more than that too a lot more of other studies as well and have links for for pretty much all of those in the description there's a few that that I reference by name but an author but um I don't know if I have the links for all of them but about some point I'll go back and make sure I do but most of them are there and uh Super Chat from from Ali um is is a I'm sorry I don't know how to pronounce that um thank you very much for the Super Chat loaded question okay um any tips uh for having thick full hair while on carnivore um and two any supplements you may recommend for people on Carnivore in general I don't think well answer the second one first I don't think you need any supplements I don't think you need to supplement anything unless you have a diagnosed clear deficiency right so if and most people will not do that if you're if you're on a carnivore diet because this is our biologically appropriate diet this is what has everything that we need but again we're not eating wild animals anymore that are going to be as healthy as they can be regeneratively raised grass-fed and finished uh cows have four to five times the amount of micronutrients that uh you know other other beef does um some of the eggs there was a there was one guy uh he's a regenerative farmer he was talking about his eggs as compared to you know the national average for eggs and he was saying that the average egg in America has 41 milligrams of folate and his eggs had over a thousand so I mean that's like you know 20 25 times the amount of of folate anyway so there's a big difference and so if you're but even then even just on you know normal deficient eggs and beef most people will have you know more than enough of these things but um you might be one of those those few that that don't get everything that they need and and so maybe you need to add in a bit of liver or if you can get you know the regeneratively raised stuff you know even better um so you know if if any supplement you know is you know it's probably good enough to get you know it's only necessary if you if you really need it you know if you're if you're if you if if you're eating what you're supposed to eat you generally don't need supplements right but again we're not eating exactly what we were you know Ray you know started eating or biologically designed to eat because animals aren't as aren't as healthy um which is a good reason to go regeneratively raised if you do have a deficiency if you do notice that your folates a bit down or something else is a bit off adding in some liver is is usually enough for everybody you can you can get that perfectly well if you're coming from a deficient state if you're coming from like a vegan diet or a plant-based diet or you know plant-based processed food diet which is what which is what a standard American diet is a 70 plant plant-based it's just most of those plants are highly processed right so they're they're even more devoid of nutrients and so you know if you're coming from that nutritionally deficient State you know sometimes adding in a bit of liver a bit more liver or you know if you're you're going to be deficient in a lot of things you know maybe taking some supplements on top of liver or whatever targeted you know magnesium zinc or you know D3 or something like that um B12 folate all these things just to sort of get you topped up and then using the diet to just sort of keep you there can be a good idea depending on how deficient you are I think if you are you know just go into a carnivore diet that those are all going to start improving anyway it just might be a bit of a of a leg up and a boost to get you there quicker to take some targeted uh supplements if you have those tar you know specific deficiencies on blood tests generally you know just adding in a bit of liver will it is exactly what you want that's just Nature's multivitamin you know liver and so you may not have to keep doing that you know maybe just you know take a bit of this stuff until you sort of get topped up and then just eating you know steaks will just keep you there in a few months steaks will probably get you there on their own this may be just a bit faster or if you're one of those people that just uh metabolizes things a little differently you might need to just keep a bit of liver in your diet as a regular occurrence and some people will definitely be there uh tips to have uh thick full hair on carnivore just beyond carnivore most people get better hair they'll get uh thicker hair that the hair follicles themselves or the hair strands themselves are actually some will get will get thicker and bigger and that you may maybe you won't have more hair but the hair that you have will be more full and so that can give the the appearance of a thicker hair will will be thicker and but it just won't necessarily be more plentiful um if your hair follicles have you know sort of gotten damaged they can be damaged through insulin uh basically through damage from from insulin High insulin all the time as you're getting insulin resistance that that's related to hair loss as well and especially like male male pattern hair loss but even even women can lose hair thin their hair because of that as well and you know my girlfriend L she she works in the hair industry and she has has um you know business and hair extensions and so she's she's seeing all the people that have that want thicker fuller hair and she says that that vegans and vegetarians always have the worst hair it's always the thinnest it's always the weakest it's always the less healthy and so you know that's that's because there's nutrient protein uh and fat deficient and they're they're not going to be as healthy you're having higher insulin levels insulin resistance and all that sort of stuff it's going to damage those hair follicles eventually those hair follicles would be damaged enough that they won't produce a hair but they can still be alive and so if that's the case you can actually reverse some of your hair loss by doing this because it will it will sort of revitalize and that hair follicle and it'll actually start growing hairs again and I've seen people do that and I've seen people get much much thicker and Fuller hair you know a guest of mine on the podcast um Dr Sean O'Mara I'm a guy's you know got just an absolute just you know I'm thick full head of hairs like I'm like a muppet thickness of hair you know it's like you know and uh like Ernie or something that's just big thick uh hair you know and he's 59 years old and he's in great health and his you know skin is better his physique is better his health is better his hair is better you know and he looks younger now than he did you know 20 years ago on a different diet so it's um you know it makes a big difference there are some people that will find that they have um you know short-term sort of hair loss and a lot of people when they're losing weight and they're sort of changing all their their you know nutrients and things around they can lose lose uh some hair if all your vitamins and minerals and everything like that are in a good area and you're getting enough protein you're getting enough fat you're eating enough some people under eat and you know there are there are studies with fasting showing that like people that long term fast you know they can they can lose hair but you know they eat over 100 grams of protein a day they don't lose hair right so are you eating enough are you getting enough protein are you getting enough fat are you getting enough for your body so that it's not your body's not having to cut corners on things that don't really matter as much like your hair so that to keep the protein and nutrients available for the other parts of your body that are they're more important so making sure you're getting enough food and everything like that now some people will find that they have a bit of a turnover on their hair and they have have like sort of starts their Fallout Cycles because hair is grow and they fall out and they grow and they fall out that's just the pattern of hair and so you're it's normal to have a bit of hair loss every day and then but there's always hair sort of growing back in and in women that's a bit more concerning because if you if you go through that pattern you sort of have a lot of hair loss it can be more noticeable because they have long hair and they're like dude this is getting this is not okay and uh what what people generally notice is that it does come back and it can often come back thicker and more full but it takes a lot longer for women to notice that than for men and men have you know short hair all of a sudden they're like hey this is actually getting better um you know my I've mentioned before my brother you know had it got way thicker hair he was like a teenager again you know after like six months on Carnivore and so but that was much more noticeable for him because he had short hair all right so you could you could see that more quickly and so that's what I would do just eat enough eat enough fat eat enough protein eat enough for your body and supplement if you if you have to if you need to and if that's what shows on your blood test and if you're just starting out on on the diet coming from a nutritionally deficient State uh you know get using liver or some targeted supplements could help um but you'll get there eventually on uh on just a carnivore diet with a bit of liver every now and then either way okay so question from Nate thank you so much for the super chat um I'm a bit underweight trying to put on muscle can you put on good muscle on omad so one meal a day I feel cognitively better on one meal a day but also want to gain muscle well you can you can gain muscle but you have to give yours well you have to stimulate your body you have to be lifting weights doing sprints and you have to eat enough if you're not eating if you're not doing both of those you're not going to put on muscle right so you have to be able to eat enough when I'm working out and I've you know now low body fat percent well a stable body fat percentage I'm not like emaciated or anything um then then I need to eat more I have to double the amount of meat that I eat on a daily basis or else I don't get I don't get enough meat I don't get enough food and my body's not gonna put on enough muscle so I can still work out but if I if I'm not eating enough you know I'll I'll gain muscle but it'll be slower if I'm eating enough and I'm eating you know I can't get enough in one meal a day when I'm doing that so I have to eat twice a bit I literally double my intake when I'm when I'm working out a lot and when I get enough and I eat to the point that my body's like yep that's enough I put almost very easily now more easily now at 43 than at any other point in my life ever it's it's just ridiculous and so it's um but it's it's because I'm eating enough you know if I if I'm getting the point where I can't eat all that much as I'm just so busy with work I'm not able to to cook you know three you know two pound steaks a day um and you know just logistically you know just not able to do that you know I I sort of plateau is like that's just sort of where I'm at I sort of I sort of stabilize around 240 pounds of um you know of body weight with you know under 10 body fat and usually when I'm working out more and more I get down around five or six percent body fat and then when I'm not working out I sort of stabilize around 10 body fat but you know so that's like 240 um you know six percent body fat right and if I'm not eating enough that will start to sort of slip down right and so you know that's just this is what you have to do you have to eat enough so one meal a day you're gonna feel good cognitively just eating meat and if you're not and if you're eating meat sort of later in the day if you're eating you know if eat it if you eat maximally during the day you're going to be a bit more tired and lethargic so I can see that that can be an issue so if you have to eat in the morning or eat sort of Elsewhere else um elsewhere in the day besides night uh what you can try to do is just try to eat sort of half as much as you think you want and then you you'll you'll still get you'll still have that edge because your body's like okay well that was good but that's not enough you need to go you need to go you know kill a badger or something like that and eat it you know because that's just not enough uh food for the day so you'll still have it'll still have energy in that that sharpness of mind um and so that's what I would that's what I've done personally or you can try eating later in the day sort of as soon as you get done out done with your workout try to eat then wait a few hours try to eat again you can do that having a bit of breakfast you need to eat enough basically and you may not be able to do it on omat maybe you can but you know you just have to see if you're eating maximally and you're eating until meat stops tasting good you're not forcing yourself and uh and you don't need to eat more than once a day fine but if you find yourself wanting to do that twice in a day and your body's like okay well I I eat two pounds if I do omad I eat four pounds if I eat twice a day and and that's enjoyable for you like that tastes good the whole time and you're putting a muscle obviously your body needs more than that and that's what I found for myself is that now I'm at a stable body fat percentage my body just just needs more uh just needs more more food more meat if it wants to put on muscle and maintain that muscle so you can definitely put on muscle you need to eat enough uh thank you very much for the Super Chat from P there's no question attached but thank you that's really kind of you and a question from Lori um nephew's allergic sensitive to the sun uh Exposed Skin breaks out in a rash is this diet related uh lack of B3 too much seed oils um well die in general can absolutely be related I mean we we are designed to be in the sun right and so if you're if you're out in the sun you're getting scorched you know that's a problem right something's happening to your body uh often it's from what we're putting in our body what we're exposed to uh there's tons of things in sunscreen that are horrible for your skin uh like Benzene I mean benzene's a known carcinogen right this isn't this is in sunscreen like what in God's name are we doing here and um you know as as sun exposure has gone down this is a linear sort of progressions less less sun exposure over the 20th century cancer rates have reciprocally gone up so there's an inverse relationship between sun exposure and skin cancer rates skin cancer rates right so what the hell is going on there it's not directly related to the sun we're being more damaged by the sun Maybe or maybe there's something else going on as well we're putting things in and on our body they're really not good for it and um I think seed oils are definitely part of that there are a lot of um well there's things there's different defense chemicals in plants that make make you more sensitive to sunlight there are animals that will get into you know certain plants and eat them because they're they're run out of forage this usually happens with with livestock when they're in a pen or so or in a you know field and they run out of grass and you know they haven't been fed enough so they eat plants that they're not supposed to because they're just they're starving we're just very hungry and um and they can get horrible Burns so they eat this stuff and they get very sensitive there's a thing called Verano coumarins that are in every citrus fruit so lemons limes oranges grapefruit you know everything as well as carrots parsnips celery this thing called celery dermatitis I did a post on that on my Instagram by these kids that got was chewing on celery and uh and the juices sort of ran down her face and she got like second degree burns on her face so really horrible just actually just tore up this little girl's face and this kid who was squeezing limes and lime juice was sort of running down his his arm and he got these chemical burns down his arms because there's Brandon coumarins react to UV light so UV light will will activate them and they'll irreversibly bind to proteins and DNA and damage them permanently damage them and look at these horrible horrible Burns you get chemical burns on any part of your Exposed Skin and you're eating those things those are getting in your body and you can get very sensitive to sunlight as well so it depends on what what your nephew's eating but it could definitely be food related as well and you know get back onto like just a meat-based diet then you know he's not going to have those exposures there are also things in seed oils and again going back to those plant sterols that we were talking about earlier that can disrupt your body's ability to defend itself from the Sun as well so plant sterols get in the way of of um this is a theoretical but this is this is a potential um use the potential action that these plant sterols lower your cholesterol they get in the ways you know you can't make as much D3 vitamin D vitamin D is actually sunblock it's UV protection that was what what is sort of what we think was what it was originally developed for you know tens hundreds of millions of years ago in the first sort of forms of life that we founded in and that um and that and that's why you see so we get exposed to the Sun and that's why we actually produce D3 not in our body on our skin right so not everyone knows that we when we get exposed to UVB not UVA UVB stimulates vitamin D uh production on our skin it's on our skin and so if you take a bath you take a shower you know you go into a pool or a lake or whatever and you watch it oh that can that can wash off right or if you're if you're actually washing with soap and water it will wash off and and you won't absorb it right so it actually takes six hours about six hours for for that that vitamin D to absorb and so you need to be uh you need to not wash yourself for six hours after you've had exposure to the sun if you want to absorb that vitamin D so you can get all this vitamin D oh that'll that'll produce all this vitamin D but you won't absorb it right and so if you're if you're screwing with your cholesterol and eating bunch of seed oils and plant sterols and all that sort of garbage and you're not going to be able to make proper vitamin D you don't have proper defense against the UVB and you're going to get burned you're going to get scorched and you can get a lot of other rashes and things like that from all these these other chemicals as well so um yeah I think it's it's absolutely related um certainly can be we are designed to be in the sun like we're not trogling with ice we did not grow up in a cave you know and so you know we're supposed to be out in the sun and so if you're if you if you just can't be outside you know that's not because of our genetics that's not because of how we're designed we're not designed to be indoors houses didn't exist when we first came onto this planet and so you know we should be able to be perfectly fine in the sun in fact it's very healthy exposure vitamin A or sorry UVA uh ex triggers uh nitroxide no uh production in our body which is actually quite healthy for us and this is a good exposure vitamin D we obviously need Vitamin D um but you know it's also as a protect it's also a protected against UVB which can be a bit more damaging so you know it's um it's it's uh almost certainly to do with what um your nephew's eating unfortunately and it could be stuff that they're putting on his skin you know it could be you know different sorts of lotus certainly any any plant-based lotion or or moisturize or anything even vitamin E is not good so I I um it's good after the sun it's good for your skin outside of the Sun but you know I learned in my Dermatology course in medical school I don't have a study for this is just what we were told by a professor of Dermatology at the time and it's just part of one of our lectures what was that uh UV light actually mutates vitamin E so if you have it on your on your skin and it's most sunscreens most lotions all have vitamin E because everyone knows oh vitamin E is good for your skin so this is where my skin has vitamin E therefore it checks all the boxes right and so you know if you if you have this on your skin you go into the sun they can actually change that mutate That Into You know another chemical is actually much more harmful to your skin and what what she said at the time was that that um putting vitamin E on your skin and going in the sun increases your risk for skin cancer by 20 times right big difference you know I think it was 20 times anyway it was a market increase anyway and um and uh I don't know 10 to 20 times I forget exactly what but anyway it was it was a big increase in uh in in in skin cancer risk so just something to think about there's a lot of things um are involved in that and uh thank you for Super Chat ali um so more questions three uh any benefits by consuming red wine and apple cider vinegar I don't think so I don't think you're gonna get any benefit you know maybe if you're eating plants and a lot of other things and it's hard for your body to digest and break them down you may be but if you're if you're just eating meat I don't think they they add any benefit and they can absolutely bring harmful things you know I mean red wine you know I mean just I mean apart from the alcohol itself I mean think about all you know the different tannins and uh and other sorts of uh you know harmful uh chemicals that are in there as well I mean tannins are going to bind you reversibly you're going to denature and bind to different proteins make those unavailable you can't absorb them you can't use them um so that's that's not good uh either so I don't I don't think that those add anything on a carnivore diet um for any concerns of iron accumulation for men and good to donate blood no I don't I don't think so I mean you know we we weren't you know we were designed to bleed you know we were designed to you know fight things and be in fights and maybe get caught and bleed and all that sort of stuff but I don't think that that's uh that was in our our nature designed to be what we need to be cut and and mauled by a line at least once a month uh in order to to maintain healthy iron levels um you know I don't think our bodies that um is that silly you know it's gonna it's gonna work well on its own without having to be harmed um so no I don't I don't think there's any any issue for that if you want to donate blood it's a very good thing to do it helps it save literally saves lives we use blood all the time and it is a very important resource and so people are able to donate blood that's obviously a wonderful thing for people to do I don't necessarily think that it's um you know a important and vital for people to do for their own health um it is thought that you know women live on average five years longer than men um because potentially they menstruate and they sort of reduce that iron load and that and that they have less oxidative stress however if you're just eating carnivore diet or oxidative stress is going to be far far lower so I don't I don't know if you're going to get any benefit on top of that but also you know averages are are a funny thing you know because you have an average for anything you know and and people attribute well it's because women menstruate you know that that may be why well it may be why it may be a contributing factor but it's also you know men are you know much more likely to involve themselves in in dangerous occupations they're much more and certainly historically when that when that figure came out you know when I was a kid I heard that in the 80s that when we live five years longer and maybe it's because of the blood loss well up until that point it was predominantly men in military you know going to Wars dying in Wars right you can't die in war if you're not in a war right um casualties of uh civilians obviously but you know but but as far as soldiers is concerned and or are concerned and you know and they're much more likely to do you know work down a coal mine or on an oil rig or and all these other sorts of you know very dangerous occupations which you know are going to lead to some people dying you know and so that can also obviously affect the average life expectancy because again it's just an average life expectancy it's not necessarily saying okay if you're dying of old age how old do you make it to you know uh that's not the same thing but um no I don't I don't think that you necessarily have to worry about that if you want to donate blood I think that's a very laudable thing to do and it certainly will help other people and will certainly save their lives and and make other people live longer so that's that's uh worth it in in itself on five what about consuming whey and collagen powder and creatine you're going to get tons of protein tons of collagen just eating meat if you want to take some some whey or collagen powder I would just get the stuff that it's only weighing collagen power absolutely no other artificial sweeteners or uh you know flavorings or any garbage like that um but you're gonna get you're gonna get all the protein and collagen that you need just for meat creatine depends on what you're doing but you know red meat has a ton of creatine in it and you probably don't need to supplement on top of that if you're if you're just getting just getting all of your food from from red meat you know if you're if you're into lifting weights you're into sports and you want to take some creature on top of that and you find that that helps you go for it I think the vast majority of people don't need to do that I like I said I've never put on muscle faster or easier than I do right now just eating 99 uh you know of what I eat is red meat and so I get a bunch of creatine I get a bunch of you know you know leucine and Arginine and all these other sorts of you know uh pro-anabolic proteins that are amino acids that are that are very very good for you and I've you know optimized my my testosterone for the age I'm at and my growth hormone and all these sorts of things you know my body just works well you know I don't have the levels that I had you know as a as a 25 year old and I'm not 25 but you know I'm putting on weight and I'm putting on muscle and and maintaining it uh easier than when I did in my early 20s actually and then certainly any other time in my life so you know it's um you know yeah I don't I don't think you need to take that stuff you know maybe if you're if you're you know um you know competing in whatever sort of athletic endeavor a bodybuilding or whatever um you can try it you know I would just I would just try a few months on Carnivore and just eating red meat and see how you go and maybe you add in a bit of creatine see if that helps do anything for you then come off of it see if there's a difference you know just just experiment with yourself and and see if that's something that that you would benefit from a little more of yeah so Sarah thank you very much for Super Chat and what do you think about oxalate dumping um well look I I read Sally Norton's book um on oxalates called toxic superfoods which I think she lays out an extremely compelling case for oxalates being very harmful and they are and uh and for oxalate dumping as well and I've had her on on my podcast and she that was kind enough to come on to our book club our patreon book club um a meeting when we read her book and uh and answered questions and spoke with us um as well which was great so um I I think that um you know she's well she's worked with a lot of people that have have experienced these problems and um and I I think that uh that that some people really do have have oxalate dumping issues absolutely I mean we do um you know she's she's showed evidence that you do sequester these things in different tissues and that that can then come out and that can cause problems in itself getting in your system turning into oxalic acid and all these other sorts of things and um you know and so you know that that can be a problem I think a lot of people you know when they they have some issues going on like a lot of a lot of people had issues you know that we were talking about here and they're okay I don't know what's going on what about this where this well maybe some of those things are oxalate them you can get diarrhea with oxalate dumping you can get you know other sorts of you know joint and muscle pains and things like that with oxalate dumping so potentially all these people if you're still listening that's that's potentially on the cards as well but a lot of times there are other sorts of things that are going on that you can troubleshoot and that and that seems to fix it and I've I've noticed that with a lot of people that it does fix a lot of things um just these there's other things that that are going on you fix all those things I have come across a few people but it literally it was a few people um who have gone through that and we've troubleshot everything and they were like okay you know this is helped in a lot of other ways but I'm still having these core issues uh that are still remaining and um and we sort of like okay well you know just through process of elimination you know this could be you know oxalate dumping and then go on Sally's you know protocol and and start you know just the very low bit of oxalate sort of introduction and that actually does help it's like okay well look that for whatever reason you know this oxalate dumping or just something that's behaving very similarly to it this is what's going on and so you know just having doing that protocol that she laid out lays out in her book is seemed to be helpful so I I definitely think that it's something that people can be affected by I think it's it is quite rare even uh well to the point of causing like extreme issues ongoing you know Sally uh unfortunately had had a very bad reaction herself and she's worked with a lot of people that have had that too but she told uh told me as well that you know some people that actually most people won't have those huge extreme oxalate dumping issues that most people will just have like a very bad day or a very bad week and they just have some some really cruddy feelings and then they go away other people get that for a prolonged periods of time and she said also that she has noticed that a lot of carnivores don't get those same issues and she thinks it might have something to do with the fact that we're not taking in tons and tons and tons of of calcium unless you're you know using a lot of dairy but she says she's seen sort of down the track sort of two three years down the road some signs of oxalate dumping because it's sort of you know and then at some point something triggers off that release um you know but I've seen you know a lot of people you know Dr rimka she was like a vegan vegetarian for 12 years obviously eating a lot of oxalates and things like that then just went bang on the carnivore and you know from what I understand she hasn't had those issues and a lot of other people as well and so it's it's going to affect people differently and I think some people absolutely will have that that as a problem but I think that it's um you know it has it has a solution if it's there but that it's again a minority of people uh will have those extreme problems that were that having you know months and weeks of of serious issues that they need to sort of intervene um you know and do something about most people it'll it'll sort of sort itself out you might have you know a few bad days or or you know several bad days or a couple weeks where it's just not feeling the best and then it sort of resolves but there are some people I do I do think that get uh worse times than that and I think that going through Sally's protocol is good for them but I think you troubleshoot the other things first and make sure there's nothing else that you're missing uh because so many people can just blame this oh this must be what it is it must be oxalate dumping that's that's their first troubleshoot and there's a lot of other things they understood using erythritol and and drinking coffee and doing this and doing that and all these other sorts of things that are like well those you address those first I think because those are those are easy fixes and um so just just try that first um um so great another Super set thank you so much really appreciate it um it says I have IBS after three days of carnivore a chicken but it made me have intestinal um acne Agony a Tony um I can eat some carbs quantity without problems why um well you know the like I was saying earlier you know some people have serious problems with different kinds of meats as well I think mostly because of what the animals are being fed and you know most most chicken is being fed you know corn and soy and different sorts of feed that aren't really good for the chicken chickens are supposed to be eating bugs and worms you know that's what that's what chickens eat and so you know if they're not eating that then they're they're not as healthy as they can be they're going to build up a bunch of you know polyunsaturated fats and omega-6s and all that sort of garbage and that can be that can be a problem as well um you know and it depends on on the carbs that you're eating as well I think that there are the only studies that I know of that are Interventional in nature with fiber and carbs um show that you're removing fiber and carbs uh can significantly benefit people with crohn's and ulcerative colitis but also there's one with just fiber uh that showed that people with with IBS were just you know symptomatic gut issues you know whether that's bloating or just discomfort or whatever some sort of GI upset not necessarily IBS but inclusive of IBS that when they increase you know so the parts amount into four groups and so it was just like that one group just said stay the same eat the exact same amount of fiber that you're eating one group increase the amount of fiber another group reduce the amount of fiber another group eliminate fiber and the one that increased fiber got worse I want to stay the same stay the same as you would expect as you would hope uh those who've reduced fiber all improved those who eliminated fiber all resolve their their GI upset so fiber can can be a problem as well you know easier to absorb uh you know carbohydrates you know the starches and simple sugars um back in cause other sorts of issues but not necessarily the same problems that like the insoluble fiber will that sort of just is like a scouring pad just sort of scrapes all the mucin and and lining off your off your gut and causes other problems so um I would if you're eating a meat that doesn't agree with you don't eat that meat that's fine um you know red meat is going to be more palatable and more digestible and feel better for most people and so I would just just focus on the meat that makes you feel good and uh and that you do the best on and if you can do that with regeneratively raised animals even better I think you'll be better off for that not as accessible and and could be more expensive so it's not something that everyone can do so just eat the meat that you enjoy that makes you feel good and that that you can afford and and you have access to and that's what I would do uh of course from David Johnson thank you very much for the um for the Super Chat uh it says hi doc my girlfriend went carnivore and appears to have her Stills disease Auto inflammatory uh into remission for now that's fantastic um 50 days without taking her daily and a king Crush shot him I've come across that before but oh interesting um do you have a view on this well I you know I don't have um too much experience with with Stills disease but just in autoimmune issues in general just seem to respond very very well to a carnivore Elimination Diet and there are studies like like I mentioned with crohn's disease just eliminating carbs and fiber improve uh people with crohn's and going on an elemental diet is a better treatment for Crohn's than uh than prednisone prednisolone and so you know that that shows that there's something that in what we're eating that is causing the problem right for whatever reason and uh some people think that there is that sort of an autoimmune response because we're getting leaky gut we're damaging our gut and bacteria and lectins and other sort of plant toxins that normally wouldn't be able to cross into our body are now getting into our body and then our body's reacting to them and making an immune response but you will any sort of foreign object or molecule the body's going to be like nope you've got to go and it's going to build up an immune response to that and uh we'll make antibodies towards and then some people in the genetically susceptible will have uh cross reactions called molecular mimicry where some of those antibodies will just be close enough that they'll just be they'll have a bit of an affinity for your own normal cells or one of the antigens on your cells and so it'll sort of stick to that and then your body will sort of react to that oh that one's bad get it right and so your body starts attacking itself but it's often it was previously thought that your body then become sensitized to your own body and says oh well now this is attacking that that must be bad now let's get more specific for that but I don't think that's really necessarily what's happening because it because when you eliminate out eating those wrong things those antibodies go down and so we see that you track these and like you know say Hashimoto's right and you can track these antibodies I haven't I don't know how many patients with Hashimoto's but their antibodies go down when they get if we get them on a carnivore diet you can track them their antibodies just going down down down down down no other no other treatment right no medications no anti-inflammatories no no steroids or anything like that their antibodies are coming down and um well why is that well because you're you're reducing eliminating taking away the thing their body's reacting to and making those antibodies full in the first place and so just making these things making these things not getting a reaction not getting around okay well I guess this thing's gone now and those things can go away and so that seems to be what's happening there can be other other sorts of things as well people talk about you know the microbiome has a very strong um correlation association with different autoimmune issues and it could be that some of the gut bacteria are producing things or doing things that are you know related to developing an autoimmune issue or protecting you from an autoimmune issue could very well be but the same thing is is the case is that if you're eating what you're supposed to eat your body's going to be healthy you're not going to be putting things in your body can that can react to or will react to and you're also going to be cultivating the correct microbiome oral biome and gut Flora that that you're supposed to have because your microbes in your in your Elementary track from your mouth you know all the way down uh they eat when you eat and so if you're eating you know the wrong things you're going to get the wrong bacteria and you're going to promote the wrong bacteria to grow in your mouth you're going to get cavities you're going to get gingivitis you're going to get you know tooth decay and and other sorts of problems and you're also going to get the wrong bacteria in your gut and you're going to get you know dysbiosism one form or another and that can cause other sort of health issues or it could be you can cause direct you know issue to your health or it could be that that's just related because you're eating the wrong thing and that's causing bad Health but also that you know and that's promoting the different gut bacteria which are then associated with that health but it does seem to be that when you do fecal transfer tests uh in mice that that there's there's something going on with the microbiome itself and so you have two mice that are genetically identical so you have identical twins and they they put in just a fecal transfer um from you know some rude obese and you put that into a mouse and they're fed the exact same thing in the exact same conditions and one mouse gets fat and obese and the other one stays uh you know lean and healthy very strange very strange um you know especially because you know why are they why are those bacteria even you know still alive if you're not feeding them the right thing right why aren't they dying off and uh because they don't really have anything to eat it should promote other bacteria that are more healthy and or or better able to eat the healthy food so it's interesting but um yeah I for for multiple Reasons I'm sure people with autoimmune issues uh just do very very well on a carnivore diet generally best with a red meat and water diet so I'm very happy uh that your girlfriend's doing so much better that's awesome and question from uh Bruce to our hamstring two weeks ago uh doing a hard going too hard in a Sprint a lot of bruising halfway down the back of the leg below the knee pain is easing up each day eating more beef and icing any advice to heal faster uh just know exactly what you're doing um you know if you're on if you're just doing beef more I think that's the best and giving your body you know a chance to heal um you know that's a bit concerning having a lot of bruising uh you know sometimes people can actually tear the attachments of the hamstring off the bone and um you know that's something that would need to be reattached it's usually easier to reattach that early on before it's had a chance to scar down and it's just it's just an easier operation and so I would I would probably suggest going to see a doctor just to make sure that you haven't you know done like a like an actual full like Evolution I mean I can pull that muscle off the bone or something like that and that this is something that uh will heal on its own as opposed to something that needs to be reattached as well so um that's what I would do I would just I would just get a once over by a doctor to take a look at the knee or take a look at the hamstring and just make sure they don't think that there's anything any need for like a scan or Imaging like an MRI or something like that to see and um and if that's if that's okay then just do exactly what you're doing just just rest and um you know walk and do things to uh you know to to the point that you can just don't don't push it too much that you you end up hurting yourself again and just yeah just eat meat drink water rest up and ice I'm a big fan of icing you know some people have said oh you know the whole rest highest compression elevation thing it was and all that all what it's cracked up to be I have had fantastic results with icing injuries joint injuries uh ankle injuries sprains things like that I have fantastic results and uh and then other times where I'm not as aggressive with icing I didn't get the same results so I just for for me icing is still definitely on the table I think it's still uh you know very good uh you know way of rehabbing injuries like that especially um you know like uh sprains and things like that I absolutely had a huge huge huge uh benefit from icing um joints and things like that when I when I had joint injuries like that so yeah hopefully that gets better soon hopefully it's not anything too serious that you need uh actual uh surgery intervention for so uh thank you very much Mitchell the Super Chat back in high school I was told I had a Candida overgrowth on my in my gut uh if a new Test shows it's still present any idea if this uh should be enough or would you recommend I pair this with uh you know the treatment for that well you know if you have overgrowth you know I still I still think that you know medications can help with that um you know most of the time when you get your you know if you're eating the right thing you get your maybe having some you know fermented dairy products you know with like uh you know lactobacillus um uh live culture yogurts and things like that eating that with meat seems to help uh with its digestion and and seeding that in your gut um that that that can just breed and cultivate the better bacteria that will then sort of edge out and force out candida and things like that which are more opportunistic um than than your normal flora so if you have good healthy Flora then that usually pushes out things like Candida but if you do have Canada overgrowth um you know taking some medications just to stomp that out I don't think is a bad idea so uh yeah just just see how you go and um you know if it's uh you know and just be the right thing maybe some some fermented uh Dairy and all that sort of stuff and then um you know but if if that's not enough that's not doing it I do I do still think that medication are beneficial uh thank you very much for the super chat um I have high LDL High total cholesterol High non-hdl also High fasting glucose um so as I was mentioning before you know LDL was was never a marker cholesterol in general was never a marker of of heart disease you know so so there are a number a number of very large um studies showing that you know higher LDL equates to longevity uh better cognition so less Alzheimer's Parkinson's dementia um in pregnant mothers with higher higher total cholesterol and LDL they have lower rates of kids with autism you know and so uh you know a lot of studies showing that that higher LDL is is not only not associated with heart disease at all but in some studies like the Framingham study it showed a protective mechanism that that lower cholesterol actually was associated with more cardiovascular death so I don't I don't think that um that that is necessarily what you have to worry about now and you can you can damage your LDL you can damage your cholesterol and you get the small dense lipoproteins but that's not necessarily the problem in and of itself it's not that those are then running a muck in your body is that your body is damaging those things or something's damaging those things and those and that same process is also damaging other things and so that can be like a you know Canary in the coal mine they're like okay hey look there's something else going on here that can that can be a problem um you know if your HDL is high and your triglycerides are low then that's more indicative that you have healthy good LDL I don't know if you're on a carnivore diet I don't know what you're eating at the moment but I would suggest that you know if you're on a high fat carnivore diet you're going to improve your health in general and you are going to have more healthy large buoyant LDL cholesterol molecules which are what your body makes and use and need and less of the small dense damaged LDL cholesterols that you don't really need and don't really want having a high fasting glucose um so again I don't know if you're on on a carnivore diet or not if you are you given more time you know if you have diabetes and you need to be on medication I think you should stay on your medication until such time as your blood sugar is coming down down down down down to the point that oh actually you need to start ratcheting off your blood sugar medication because now it can be too low and that certainly happens it happens for I mean everyone that I've seen and I I you know and especially on a carnivore diet when you get rid of seed oils and things like that so if you're not on Carnivore diet I would go on a carnivore diet high fat meat based diet eating fatty red meat until it stops tasting good and don't eat all the other things it's just as important what not to eat is what to eat probably I don't know more important so no plants or fungus no sugar or any sweeteners nothing artificial and that goes for sauces seasonings and drinks as well right so I would just focus on uh just eating just whole Meats red meats for preference and for best results and I don't eat all the other things and continue on your medication if you need to be on it but be mindful of the fact that your your blood sugar and uh and blood pressure and all these other things will start to normalize and you can get to a point that you'll have too much medication on board and you'll need to work with your doctor to start coming off of those so be mindful of that uh question from Uncle John thank you so much again for the Super Chat Dr chafee when you work out what kind of resistance training are you doing dumbbells machines body weights give us an idea of your workout please so it depends it depends on on the day it depends on what I have access to I have a X3 bar sort of back there behind me um I try to use that uh when I when I sort of think about it in a cam you know it's sort of hard to excuse yourself for not doing an extra reward because it literally takes 10 minutes to do the workout um it's just sort of getting just motivated to do it um I do like going to the gym if I if I don't have access to the gym or the the um uh the X3 bar I'll do bodywise I'll do do some push-ups and some body weight squats um if I have access to something I can do pull-ups on I like to do pull-ups as well and those are those are great you're just doing those sort of three things you know uh actually probably be enough for most people um I do like going to the gym I like doing weights I tend to do I always do everything to failure so I'll always do as many push-ups as I can um I mean that you sort of get to the point with squats that you could just sort of go forever but you do the best you can you sort of do a lot of them anyway uh with body weight squats um so I like using waste because you know you can you can wear yourself out quicker and so you know especially with like the the variable resistance like the bands that's really good too because it just gives it gives it sort of a more uh intense workout because it gets harder you know the more the further you go out and and so you can wear yourself out you know and that's pretty good and so I like that and I always go to exhaustion I always go to the point that I can't go anymore so I go to maximal effort um and for maximal duration to like I can't go anymore and so if I'm doing weights I like doing weights too because I can do I can do different things that I can't really get with the X3 bar and so you know there are there are other things that I like to do in the gym as well and again but just working maximally and working to uh to fatigue and exhaustion I haven't I haven't been as as good um recently I haven't really been on top of things from an exercise point of view as much as I have before so but that's something I want to get back into and get get back into working out you know sort of four days a week and just make sure that I just you know lifting weights like four days a week or doing some sort of resistance training like the X3 bar at least four days a week if not more and uh and I don't want to get you know my knee all the way better so it doesn't you know swell up every stupid time I try to run um because I have you know I just have uh torn up cartilage on my kneecap and so it just flakes off little bits of cartilage and that the whole knee just sort of swells up which is really unfortunate because I I like running I like sprinting and I like playing rugby so um but I still try to do I'm going to try to do uh Hill Sprints for some reason my knee doesn't swell up if I do Hill Sprints so that's what I try to do is just weights um bicycle Sprints and Hill Sprints and then weights to exhaustion and always working maximally until I till I wear wear out and then you know wait rest and do it again just until I get bored of that and then I go home another Super Chat from uh from DJ thank you so much really appreciate that so I guys have sort of neglected a lot of the um uh the other you know comments and questions um not not on purpose but just you know had super chats and things like that that I needed to to get through uh or get to um and so but you know do try to uh put these things in and um I'll try to get get some of these as well so this is this is from from DJ had a comment before this to see um and so commented 43 years old same meal or two every day for 14 months um 305 to 210 pounds fantastic should I change anything to slow down weight loss or simply eat right and stay out of the way about exactly that just just just eat until your body knows exactly how much it wants in fact as you as you get uh lower in body fat percentage you're going to get to a stable body fat percentage and your appetite is going to go up and you're going to want to eat more you're not going to put on fat you're just going to be able to maintain the musculature that you have and if you're if you're lifting weights and exercising you're gonna you're going to put on muscle which is great so yeah so exactly it do exactly what you've been doing that could change so eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good every day and uh and and listen to your body signals relearn your hunger signals make sure you know when your body's asking for food and give your body enough and once you get down to stable body fat percentage you will not you will I you know don't be surprised if you see your your uh your your hungry hunger go way up you'll definitely uh you'll need more after that so yeah just keep doing that just keep it just keep giving your body what it needs and you'll be fine uh one thank you so much for the for the Super Chat uh hello Dr chafee do you think alternate day fasting would be beneficial to body composition I'm on the carnivore diet and weight lift uh bodybuilding Tempo style uh thanks for all that you do um I mean you can like if I I think that you do that too much you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna drop your metabolism and you're and you're gonna find that you not only don't lose fat but you start putting on that you actually put on fat because you're gonna you're gonna screw with your metabolism I think it's much better to uh to just give your body what it needs and then just just work your ass off you know in the gym and you know doing doing uh you know weights and Sprints and things like that and you'll you'll you'll get very lean um you know there are people like uh uh you know Richard Smith who did a lot of professional bodybuilding competitions um and he always competed naturally and he would get down to like you know three percent body fat just from a carnivore diet just working his ass off and so he would just get absolutely shredded and so he won the European you know Pro Championship um and that's and that's a non-tested competition and he he went in natural right and so it um you know he did very very well from that there are people that do more keto carnivore sort of approach and they would sort of Ratchet down as they're coming up towards competition time to getting you lean up but they they're very careful um you know Robert Sykes um who I had on the on the podcast he talks about this and he he body Pro bodybuilder and and uh coach as well and so he's talking about you have to be very careful very slowly reducing the the amount of things that you're eating because if you go too too low too fast you'll you'll actually gain weight because you are um you're going to slow your metabolism down and so you're not going to be getting the muscle gains you want and you're going to start putting on fat so I still think that um it's best to just give your body what it needs and uh and then just just work out hard if you're competing for a competition you need to get leaner than you are but then you might you might think about you know uh what Robert does but I'll be very careful with that and just understand that you if you go too far and do too much you can reduce your metabolism too far and you'll um you know and you'll uh uh actually go the opposite opposite way well thank you very much for the super chat um I well thank you everyone for all the super chats and all the questions as well um I'm probably gonna have to wrap up I've been doing this for three hours so um I'll probably have to wrap up in the next uh sort of a little while so I'll take the next sort of few uh questions and then um and then I'll uh I'll have to say goodbye and see you guys next week um so for this one it says thank you for answering uh questions for everyone uh the question how to improve back after a fall so no broken or damaged discs hard time bending over picking things up I'm sorry about that on Carnivore this has helped tremendously lost 50 pounds in two and a half months that's fantastic any tips heard stretching is not good well it just depends it depends on what you're stretching it depends on how how much you're stretching um you know if you're pulling your body if you if you have damaged torn muscles right and you like like our gentleman before who uh tore his hamstring you know if you have a tear an actual damage to your muscle you know is it a good idea to start to start stretching and pulling this and tearing it more probably not you know so you you want to let that you want to let that heal but you also want to be but our bodies heal in lines of stress as well and so you know if you're when you're up to it that acute phase where you would just have just damaged yourself and you just need to actually just heal but then you'll get to a point where you uh you know are are well enough that you could actually start doing things and so this is where like physical therapy or physiotherapy depending on what part of the world you're in comes into play where you start doing exercises and actually you know muscle building you know very light sort of things at first but you know the things that build up muscle uh and sort of strengthen those muscles in that area because again our body heals and lines of stress so if you're if you're stimulating that part of your body and those muscles they're going to stimulate them to grow and rebuild and and get stronger so I would uh keep doing what you're doing with the diet side of things sounds like you're doing great on that on that aspect and I'll get in touch with a physical therapist and and someone who can help you rebuild and strengthen those muscles in your back and and around your body so that you strengthen those muscles and strengthen your body and um and and and that will reduce pain as well and return functionality which is uh you know the whole point of rehab as well um it's a comment there from uh H young thank you Dr Jay for all information and educating us on how we can help with us well you're very very welcome I'm glad that it's helpful hopefully it is helpful to people um that's uh the whole sort of point so thank you for for that um Holly Ruth uh thank you for the super chat um rheumatoid arthritis for 30 years 70 or 57 year old female five foot two 96 pounds LDL is 218 HDL is uh 139 trickless rights or 39 inflammation um information bad worried about question mark so um maybe maybe asking if I'm worried about something um also eat about 300 grams of protein a day uh that's a lot of protein um but uh you know if that's what your body's asking for that's that's one thing that's that's I think that's more than I eat but um you know you definitely need to be getting enough fat so you don't just get all of your your energy and nutrition just from from the lean you need you need the fat as well fat is an essential nutrient um and your HDL and triglycerides all of that looks fantastic you know again I don't I don't look at LDL as uh as a as a marker of heart disease I look at that as a marker of longevity and uh your HDL is over three times your triglycerides which puts you in a very rare category of extraordinarily low risk of heart disease that is extremely healthy ratio that you have there so I wouldn't be worried about that at all um you know ra so so I'm assuming that rheumatoid arthritis um and hopefully that's doing better um you know generally that will improve with a carnivore diet and you know not eating anything besides meat and water and really improving most on red meat and water you need to get enough fat so if you're eating 300 grams of protein a day um I don't know how much fat you're getting you know are you getting enough fat are you getting you know far less grow are you getting 300 grams of fat as well generally people need about the same amount of fat as they do uh protein that just seems to be how how that ratio sort of works out I would you know being five foot two and 96 pounds I don't I don't know if you would be um you know I don't know if you'd be uh uh eating 300 grams of fat as well 300 grams of protein so it's it's it's not necessarily that that's too much protein but it's probably more than you need um and so you know it it's just making sure that you're getting enough fat and if you're eating too lean then I would increase the fat and that will probably offset and replace some of the the lean stuff that you're getting so that that's what I would do okay sorry and um thank you very much uh Yemen for the Super Chat uh could I do goat instead of beef as beef is banned in my state uh in India because religious reason absolutely goes great so red meat in general so you know any ruminant animal right so you know uh cow Buffalo um bison deer moose goat sheep you know all of those things are perfectly fine so I absolutely yeah uh uh thank you very much for the Super Chat said uh hello Dr chafee I'm on Carnivore die for about three months and started to reverse 14 years of Vitiligo just wanted to say to let others know that's awesome uh that's something that's something so cool so Vitiligo is another autoimmune issue and it causes uh you know melanation of the skin so you get like just just white patches on the skin and that can go over your whole body and it can be you know very upsetting you know obviously because it's um you know they're just there's this visually distracting sort of thing and they're going like well what the hell is that and uh and I've I've now come across you know another person I've a number of people that have not only stopped the progression of their Vitiligo but actually reversed it and then and the melon and came back which is fantastic is absolutely amazing so that's really good to hear and I'm very glad you're doing well thanks for that um High vibration alignment thank you again for the super chats from from previously um she's adding on to her her previous comment sorry I forgot to mention I was ketovor before also have a stuck kidney stone I'm worried as a doctor says it's my diet well it's not carnivore diet anyway you don't get you don't get kidney stones from a carnivore diet um 75 of kidney stones or calcium oxalate Stones right so that's not from meat you know you can get you can you make some oxalates from the degradation of of uh collagen so some um you know uh people that are trying to mislead you will say oh well you get all this you know oxalates from collagen they don't tell you how much is in there you get you get a couple milligrams of oxalates from that your body can it can deal with uh you know up to 150 to 200 milligrams of oxalates a day so you know a couple milligrams uh from from from collagen is nothing you know and it's just when you're getting you know 600 milligrams from half a cup of spinach that's when you start running into problems right so no it is absolutely not your your uh diet if it's a low oxalate or no oxalate diet um but you know Sally Norton has actually seen people get you know uh kidney stones down the track from oxalate dumping and again it's these calcium oxalate Stones right so where the hell are the oxides come from they're not eating oxalates uh after the fact and now they're still getting this so this is this is coming out of their systems coming out of their tissue and you know binding to calcium and getting pulled off and making Stones so um you know it's um you know Keith sort of made this comment I'll address it too much protein is better than kidneys not not really you know that that's the the the idea for a long time was that too much protein was bad for your kidneys but that actually wasn't born out by the data so there are studies that actually show that more protein actually equates to better kidney function um and that's where the studies show so it can be that you can get way too much protein you know like you know more than like 4.5 grams per kilogram um and um you know that's that's a that's a monster amount of of protein and then you start getting into the realm of uh you know like protein sickness and rabbit starvation things like that where it's just you know that's when you start having those problems but but generally too much protein actually actually is good for your kidneys um unless uh but yeah it's but that's what the studies show is that more protein actually is better for your kidneys um okay let's see sorry there's a couple more Super chats here that all that I'll answer and then I'll um I'll sign off um so each time I start carnivore I get sensitive teeth and tartar and I can eat one and a half kilograms of red meat as a 58 kg girl easily is that um is that not too much um no it's not necessarily too much it depends on what your body needs um you know I mean there you know it depends on where you're coming from you know if I there's a girl I had or a lady I had on my podcast um and she you know went from from you know being vegan and half starved and she was anorexic she had BMI down to nine and um and she she was very very sick and almost died and you know she was eating at one point uh 8 000 calories of of fatty me today because she she was at such a deficient State her body needed so much nutrition so much fat and protein and milk and meat that that she needed to eat way more than I need to eat you know as a 240 pound man um you know she she needed way more than that because her body was was so deficient she needed to to build up right so I'm maintaining where I am my body just needs what it needs to maintain but if your if your body needs to build up and you're going to need a lot more so one and a half kg of red meat if that's what you're hungry for if that's what tastes good and you're doing well um and you're healthy then then I would just listen to that as long as it tastes good you know if you're getting the point that that if you're only eating red meat and you're not eating carbs or sugar or artificial sweeteners or any medications that can increase your hunger like prednisone prednisolone that if you're if you're only eating just the meat then and you're you're eating until it stops tasting good then then then do that you know if you're forcing yourself to eat more than that then don't do that obviously um the sensitive teeth is a bit is a bit weird um again Sally said has said stuff about you know oxalate dumping can cause you know tooth mouth pain tartar buildup and things like that as well so it could be just a bit of dumping and then it just gets out of your system most people find that they have much better teeth much better oral health and especially when your your oral biome changes over and you get a much more healthy you know mouth Flora that can be much more healthy so people reverse their gum disease stop getting dental caries and cavities and um and it can help with with uh you know sensitivities wanted certainly with tartar and a lot of people don't have a lot of that build up so I think that's probably just a matter of time when that will will improve from that side of things okay all right okay so so that's that's it for the the Super Chat sorry I wasn't able to get to um a lot of the other questions as well um but you know that it does it does sort of pop it up and make it more more apparent when people do that so um thank you very much uh for everything and Mike good to see you still still with us that's awesome thanks for for making it through the
