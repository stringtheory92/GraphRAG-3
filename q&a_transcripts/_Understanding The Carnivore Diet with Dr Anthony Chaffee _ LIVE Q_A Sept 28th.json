    "title": "\ud83d\udd34Understanding The Carnivore Diet with Dr Anthony Chaffee | LIVE Q&A Sept 28th",
    "transcript": "foreign good evening good afternoon to everyone everywhere um thanks for coming on my life so this is for September 29th in Australia September 28th in the US and uh welcome good to see you everyone if you guys one of the person's just name is fake person that's always funny um if you guys want to put in the comments where you guys are calling in from and um everyone has a questions just put question and I'll go through those and try to answer them as best I can all right see if anyone's down here now hello from Brazil Jack hello how are you well all right well when until the questions start coming I guess we'll talk about uh you know Maggie's um Maggie's fundraisers are still doing that it's on give send go that's reached probably about what would it be about three quarters or well between two thirds and three quarters of of the way there and so that's amazing so thank you very much everyone who's donated to that thank you everyone that that has uh contributed uh thank you Jerry for the Super Chat I appreciate that and um if there's a question who wants to go with that just put that in in the chat and I'll I'll hit it as well and yeah so so we're still trying to get more we're trying to get up to uh 50 000 Canadian dollars that's how much she needs to keep her heard and not have to sell off any to to afford to pay for the rest but we're well on our way and um you know it's already made a huge huge huge difference in her life and um and uh For Her Herd and so that would make a huge difference because that has a knock-on effect right because if she has to sell half a herd now she has to sort of regrown trying to build back and build back and buy more and things like that as she goes and that's difficult takes years to get your herd back up and so it's and the herd sizes are just going down and down because no one can afford to keep their cows now and so you know they go to auction and it's not other ranchers buying the cows it's the you know the packing plants buying the cows and then they you know uh turn into beef and and all that but um that means that more cows are going into to make beef than normal and it um it means smaller herd sizes and so the herd size is in in that area are going down and that's a problem because it takes a while to build those back up so we've seen a lot of people from from all over there's a lot from Canada and the US and New Zealand it's great and Bay Area California very cool my uncle uh lives in Half Moon Bay we should go up to see him when we go up from Southern California Louisiana awesome I've only been to New Orleans I haven't been outside of that um seeing the rest of Louisiana that would be really cool to see the rest of them and and yeah and if people could hit the like button um that helps you know just helps Drive things up and helps the algorithm spit this out suggest this to more people as we're going which is uh which is you know we just get more people involved which is good so the Super Chat here from DM thank you very much for that hi doctor on Carnivore two months and love it learning a ton from you well that's good it's good to hear I like taking a Metamucil any negative impacts if I still want to take it thank you so Madam useful you know it's just a fiber supplement really so do you need fiber probably not and you know it's just a bulking agent that you know for these purposes is the bulking agent so that you can sort of move your stools but your your stools are going to pass normally and better if you just eat more fat and so if you're getting blocked up if you're getting dry hard stools then you need to eat more fat by definition and so um you know people say well I'm definitely eating enough fat but I'm still having hard dry stools so to me if you have hard dry stools then by definition you are not eating enough fat because of eating enough fat you'll get overfl you'll get you won't be able to absorb all of it and some of that will get in your stools will keep it soft it'll go out and so that's that's definitional for me if you're if you're getting dry hard stools you're not eating enough fat if it's just in frequency that you're worried about you're only going once or twice a week and you're normally used to going three four times a day don't worry about that because you're absorbing 98 of the meat that you're eating whereas when you're eating plants you're not absorbing you know 90 95 percent of the plant because most of the plant is made out of the structural component of fiber you can't absorb that and it has to go out you have to excrete it so with Metamucil um you don't need it you know because you don't need that bulking to move things through and just have something to I mean your body doesn't it's like it's like oh my God if if I don't have anything to move through my bowels everything shuts down your body's fine with that I mean think about fasting you know people fast for a number of days they don't they don't die of bowel obstructions and and complications of of colon disease right actually actually do better and when you're you get surgery on your bowels like you rest the bowel like you either fast or you take in low residue diet so no fiber diet right that's um that's a good thing also remember that fiber is um sort of think of it as a solid component it can cause like a lining and just basically physically gets in the way between your enzymes and the food and then digested so so it doesn't digest as much and then digested food and your gut lining so it impedes digestion and absorption and that's and that's a benefit supposedly that people say that well this is good because it blocks 30 of the the absorption of the food so that you're not getting you're not absorbing all this horrible crap you're eating okay well you're not eating anything horrible that you don't want to absorb on a carnivore diet so if you reduce by 30 or even five percent the amount of meat that you're eating that's actually detrimental you want to absorb all of this stuff because it's all good for you if you're eating a whole bunch of sugar and and other sort of plant toxins great you know fiber is going to stop you from absorbing as much of that maybe that's a positive there are studies suggesting uh it can be positive there's other studies saying that it's not a positive there's a study with over 2 000 people that showed that people had more fiber had higher risk of cardiovascular disease so that's not great and we're more symptomatic with constipation they were getting hard difficult to pass painful stools bleeding fissures bloating all these sorts of things they reduce the fiber those symptoms got better they eliminated fiber they resolve they all those symptoms all resolve so you know studies aren't perfect but if you just think of a mechanism what is it doing well it's bulking it's moving things through you don't need that you just eat enough fat okay what else is it doing it's blocking out nutrients that you want to absorb when you're on a carnivore diet so for us it's not necessary and so um yeah I I don't think you need it if you're if you're worried about it and you just and you're just having difficult to pass tools just eat more fat you'll be fine Russell Sheridan do you think including butter and fat makes uh including butter slash fat makes a better health worse health or no Health difference if included in plant-based meals no I think it's better 100 better fat is an essential nutrient it's that you know people say it was like oh you don't want too much fat I don't I don't think that's a thing I think that's um I I think that's just thinking about it a bit differently than uh than our body uses it our body has a limited capacity to absorb fat you know with the amount of bile that our liver makes without bile it's very difficult for your body to absorb fat and so I think that the amount of bile your body makes is the amount of fat that your body wants I don't think your body just makes a random amount of bile to get a random amount of fat that that wouldn't make sense to me physiologically and biologically because other things are so tightly controlled why would this one just be completely random so I think that your body wants a fat and needs the fat and they say okay well but if you're eating all this junk and junk food and carbs and sugar then it's bad no you know like it's like it's like saying that you know uh you know another nutrient like you know protein or or you know these essential amino acids well those are bad for you if you eat even with carbs why would that be they're essential you need them the carbs are the bad thing and well but with with that then you'll get too many calories no it's an essential nutrient that's that's how I think about it so yes you know if you're eating if you're eating vegetables and all that sort of stuff um you know plant-based meals or whatever at least at the very least you're getting these essential animal-based fats and nutrients you need these things and so a lot of a lot of harm and and what I think we call diseases are a byproduct of not eating the right thing partly because you're eating things that our bodies have a hard time dealing with like non-bio available nutrients and uh direct toxins or things that disrupt your hormones or your digestion or Draw out nutrients things like that but also just not having the essential nutrients that we need so that combination of causing this harm and not having correct nutrition is a problem and so if you're having a plant-based meal but you know that that's if it's purely plant-based it's not going to have all the essential nutrients you need and there are essential fatty acids and essential fat soluble vitamins that you have to have and so if you're adding in animal fat or butter then yes that's better that's definitely better because you're getting you're getting more nutrients and you're getting more of the nutrients that you need and that's really good for you it's uh it's a very very good for you your brain is made out of fat your nervous system is made out of fat your whole body is made out of cholesterol your hormones are made out of cholesterol this is a really important nutrient so yes at any point uh even if you're eating horrible crap if you're eating it with something good for you that good thing for you is still good for you it doesn't all of a sudden become bad for you it's just it's the other stuff that's that is and remains bad for you Lisa Lisa thank you very much for the super jab this is very kind of you and um I'm very generous hi doc thank you as always for what you do uh what's your advice for carnivore an ALS a friend of mine uh diagnosed a few months ago um beg in mouth Boston um so ALS is is a tough one so I don't I don't know enough people that have been on Carnival with ALS I've only sort of heard peripherally like from yourself you know that they've had a friend and would this be something that would help them I haven't actually seen anyone get on this and try so I don't know um unfortunately there are things that can cause serious problems and harm and uh and that that diet's not going to fix I think that it would help them in insofar as it would eliminate out a lot of other garbage that they wouldn't have to contend with while they're dealing with the ALS now is that going to slow stop halt or reverse the ALS I have no idea I hope so I would hope so and there are some things that seem to be very dependent on diet so for instance in the animal kingdoms is something I learned when I went up to Maggie's Ranch she was telling me that she you know she went to veterinary school and she's basically been the vet for her or a major part I mean she does like cesareans on her cows when when needed you know so she's very up on uh you know animal issues and cow issues there is a a disorder that cows get which is their version of muscular dystrophy now we look at Muscular Dystrophy and oh that's genetic and that's all there is to it um and there's certainly a genetic component um but in at least in the cow version it comes down to a genetic component susceptible to this and they have a nutritional deficiency I believe she said it was selenium and so you add in selenium into the food because sometimes they don't have all the nutrients in the feed or in the grass or in the hay or whatever and so if they get deficient then they they can get this muscular dystrophy and so when they add in selenium or whatever the the nutrient was if anyone knows please put that in the comments and we can I can stop guessing um then then they don't have it anymore and reverse it so and there are so many weird things that people have that just go away so I mean I've seen people with Elders danlos which is a connective tissue issue a connective tissue issue connective tissue disorder and I see people basically become non-symptomatic with that and normally you'll have joint dislocations and a pain in their joints and and uh and other problems and then all of a sudden Pain's gone jointly dislocations are gone their joints work better and the connective tissue is tougher and stronger and Tighter pretty amazing so there are there are genetic components and they're also nutritional components so with ALS that's something I'm very curious about that's something that I that I I hope I can have some patience and people like your friend who give this a try and I'll be happy to work with them directly and and help them out as best I can to make sure that they succeed and um and to see how they do because that's that's a very important piece of information and uh but you know just optimizing your life in general getting proper sleep you know getting the light blocking glasses getting sunlight being out in the sun going back to our normal circadian rhythms you know walking around Barefoot you know I don't know much about grounding but there does seem to be an electron transfer electrical you know current transfer you know through the body when you walk barefoot so presumably that's how we were designed is it how much of a difference it makes I have no idea but it is there it is a phenomenon that you can measure and certainly the light in the eyes and and getting tracked onto your circadian rhythm that is that is known to be a major issue and and then the proper food so you know getting proper sleep circadian rhythm proper food and eliminating out all those other things that are certainly going to make life worse for everyone and especially compound things for someone with ALS I think you do that and you address those things and um it's at least going to help them from that sense and and improve things that can be improved um and I would hope that it would improve ALS but I don't know unfortunately but I would still recommend just pure fatty red meat and water and nothing else I mean with these sorts of things you just want to be as as pure as possible you know grass-fed and finished from a regenerative form if you can and just really do it the best that you can to give yourself the best shot at at succeeding and if if your friend is interested and wants to talk to me directly I'm happy to to talk to them you know for free and and just try to help them out as as much as I can I have my email I put in there for um for collaborations and you know things like that it's just Anthony chafee gmail.com and if they're interested you know just have them email me I don't see all the emails so if I don't get it just bump it up a couple times until I do but I I would be more than happy to help and hopefully they give it a try and hopefully it helps thank you question from sin offwar I have a question do we know how long the opposite of fat adaption takes like once you are fat adapted how long does it take to become carb adapted uh it seems to be a few days so it's not too long so looking at Professor Ben bickman um you know he talks about different studies that uh well that that incorrectly say that a ketogenic diet makes you insulin resistant how could that happen if you're not even if you have low insulin right um I mean I guess you could you could affect insulin receptors and all that but you know it doesn't really follow um the way they measured that is they just did a glucose tolerance test so they gave someone a soda and they said oh look their blood sugar went up uh higher and it took longer to come down okay um but did you check your insulin at the same time their insulin was low so if their insulin was high and it took a long time for that to come down that's insulin resistance because there's a lot of insulin out and not a lot of happening right whereas um what happens to people in ketosis or insulin is low and so the blood sugar goes up insulin is still low and it takes a little while to rise up why is that that's because normally when you're eating a lot of carbohydrates your pancreas pre-loads insulin pre-mix it and has it sitting there ready to go right and then you eat carbohydrates and goes get it out there because you know you're building up a tolerance for a toxin really and so you know when you're an alcoholic you know or drinking regularly your body makes more of these enzymes that break down uh alcohol right so you can get this the hell out of your system as quickly as possible and so that's the same with carbs and so you're pre-making insulin because that's the the counter for carbs uh you know blood sugar that's too high so when you're not doing that and you're and you're you're just eating you know a normal human diet that you don't have to pre-make your insulin because that's not an issue and so at first you don't have enough insulin to bowl us out and slam out and drop it like other people do but in a couple days you start doing that again so according to Professor bickman who has been studying insulin and its effects on the body for 15 plus years um you know he's professor at BYU he is literally written a book on the subject so um you know it's uh you know that's uh that's what he says is so it should just take a couple days it's not it's not that big a deal it's not really going to like knock you back I mean you already run on carbs right because when you but you just make them yourself and so you you get energy up you burn you know break down fat uh from your fat tissue some you know some of these nutrients go to your liver your liver makes glucose and glycogen and things like that so you always have glucose and glycogen so in that sense you're always carb adapted because you're always running on carbs anyway you check your blood sugar it's normal it's always normal and that's how that's how we know what normal is that's where it's supposed to be that's where your body wants it to be and so when you um when you're on a ketogenic diet carnivore diet everything's everything's normal you are running on carbs so you are carb adaptive but you're also keto adapted you're also able to run on ketones and carbohydrates so when you go back to eating carbohydrates it's not that you can't run on carbohydrates anymore it's just that it takes a couple days for your you start pre-making insulin again because oh Jesus we're doing this again okay fine and then it just shuts down your ketones really so the only difference is that you just don't have access to your ketones anymore but your blood sugar was always there and it was always able to be used so I wouldn't worry um yeah so in that in that respect you're always carb adapted foreign coffee says started the carnivore diet and feel much better already from Trinidad and Tobago thank you yeah well thank you for sharing that's great I'm glad you're doing better and I hope that uh well I'm sure it will just keep getting better after that so uh good luck with it keep going and uh you'll keep getting better as you go buying games uh brain games maybe uh backs uh say thank you for Super Chat says back surgery for uh CES in 2018 leg muscle loss from neuropathy as a result CES stands for called Aquinas syndrome for people they don't know I am which is sort of a compression of the lower nerve roots in the in the lumbar spine so the spinal cord ends at around L1 and then sort of the nerve Roots come down that's the call to aquinet means horse's tail in Latin and if that gets compressed you can get caught Aquinas syndromes you can press those nerves and causes causes problems it's not good it's an emergency so I'm sure the nurse have healed as much as they will the muscle continues to degrade will I eventually lose ability to walk well hopefully not the the the muscles that are normally afflicted by akata aquina um are usually sort of lower down and so they shouldn't necessarily affect all the ones up in your hip and things like that depends on the the level of your compression but the um you know things like well yeah it does just depend on where on where your your impression was but um you can it can certainly cause difficulty to walk it can cause you to have a drop foot where you can't lift your foot up you know can't walk properly you can't have weakness and um but but it shouldn't make you completely paralyzed from the waist down unless it's a high up lesion which you know again I don't know what what level your lesion was but the thing is is it it shouldn't continue to get really worse and worse and worse I mean you know you can have atrophy because the the muscles aren't being innervated and that can continue to atrophy but if you keep working at it and working at it what is left can grow and if and and can grow and develop and you're just stimulating so the more you do the more you'll stimulate um you're more you stimulate the growth and it can even stimulate the nerves to to work a little better um so 2018 so that's a while normally we tell people that after about two years you're gonna get whatever recovery you've gotten that's how much you can expect to to keep and maintain now that said you know you just have someone and say okay well you know you got out of high school and you're this big and you're that athletic and that's what you're going to be you're a grown adult and that's how much you're going to be well you can develop where you you know you know where you you ended up with in your development right so an adult I've been in my adult frame since I was 17 or 18. but I I was 100 I was 177 pounds um at 17 and now I'm 240. you know so my frame is the same but I was able to develop the muscles after that right so that's what you can do you know you can build things up as much as you can also if you're on a carnivore diet and it doesn't say if you are or aren't I've seen pretty amazing recoveries neurologically now that doesn't mean everyone will but I have seen some crazy things happen there's a guy Dave Mack who I've had on podcast and I've been on his um that um you know he's uh and he's on YouTube and everything like that you guys can check it out and uh he had a stroke when he was 19 or so you know late teenager and and for 30 years he had very stable neurology he had he had right-sided weakness forever and he did a ketogenic diet which actually helps with neurological recovery that's been shown in studies especially for tbis traumatic brain injuries and uh and you know for epilepsy and migraines and and these sorts of things too we know that that it helps a lot so you know he 30 years later went on a carnivore diet and within months he was walking normally and and uh significantly reduced the amount of weakness that he had from a stroke that was 30 years old so it's pretty it's pretty amazing what our body can do if we just get out of its way and what can recover so that's what I would do if you're not on Carnivore diet get on one and just try beef and water fatty beef and water get a lot of fat in there your brain and your nervous system is made out of fat and cholesterol so that's what you need and um and then just give it time and I would just get get in the gym working with a physical therapist and an occupational therapist and try and work on as much as you can and try to giving back as much function as you can and at least stop it from from getting worse if the more you work at it the more you'll be able to preserve and hopefully reverse so good luck with that oh goodness there we go so Jerry Graham thank you for the Super Chat just had Labs showing B12 of 999 been eating ketovor and organ Meats how long should I avoid organs and other advice to lower B12 before I get new Labs my doctor is requesting um never I think that that's a perfect score honestly uh pretty cool triple nine but so I don't know what country you're in and they use slightly different values but they they balance out to be sort of the same in the US and Australia and Europe and things like that in Australia um the reference range is like depending on now the reference ranges change it change everywhere uh even from Lab to lab in the same city because they go by the average population that that lab has seen that year right and so the change every year and they changed every lap that you go to and so that's not accurate right that's not telling you where you should be that's just telling you do you fall in the range of everybody else well everyone else is sick right everyone else is unwell and metabolically unhealthy and nutritionally deficient so that's not the that's not the metric you want to you know compare yourself to okay those aren't the people you want to compare yourself to so the reference range in Australia is like 160 to 650 or thereabouts depending on on where you are and yet below 400 is um has been shown to cause demyelination of your axon so nerve damage in people so under 400 is a true deficiency where your body is not able to maintain a normal function right so not good so that's half of the reference range right so you'd be 200 I'm like oh that's normal you know 300 yeah fine 420 geez oh look you're you're doing really well your upper upper half right no that's um that's really low so the range that that I look at is if you're 25 and you have no medical issues what does your what do your numbers look like and so for B12 that's 800 to 1200. your smack in the middle of that if you're in Australia in America it's slightly higher sort of I think it's like a thousand to 1500 or something like that if I'll have to go back and look but it's around there anyway so so that's fine to me the only problem is wow that's way too high is because we are you know most people are nutritionally deficient in B12 deficient and so you're comparing yourself against people that that don't have enough and so it looks like you're too high but you know in the in the land of the blind the one one-eyed man is King right so you have you know you're you're doing better than them and it looks like this is crazy disparity and um but it's not actually your normal they are abnormal so I'd be fine with what you're doing um you know organ meats are fine in proportion to the animal right so if you're hunting and you take down an animal just remember that you get hundreds of pounds of normal muscle meat and fat you know to every pound of organ right you got one liver one heart two kidneys one spleen a bunch of intestines right and fat you know that's that's a lot of what's in the abdomen is fat and so that's what you need to focus on is um uh the fat and the muscle meat and organs great but just keep that in proportion you don't need as much of that and so as long as you're keeping it in proportion having you know liver and organs a couple times a week but not in like huge quantities you'll be fine and that B12 is is perfectly fine I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about that um at all so that's perfect you're doing great Mark Breyers um if you have health issues going through eating grain how would that impact your health if you eat grain-fed meat when that still cause disease um oh through eating great yeah so if you eat grains and you get problems and grain-fed meat would that be a problem well it depends it depends on how well that animal can process the toxins that are in grains or any plant and so if an animal is eating what it isn't does it is designed to eat then it can detoxify and eliminate out those problems and and it doesn't get into the meat they're filters for that right um but if that's not what they're designed to eat then no that filtration they'll still filter but it won't be won't be perfect right and so this is why some people recommend against eating uh you know Factory farmed chicken and pork and farm-raised fish because they're being fed corn and soy and garbage like that they are not designed to eat and they don't filter it out perfectly ruminant animals red meat animals with as big room in this big complex digestive tract um they seem to be able to do detoxify these things much much much better now it changes their nutritional complement and you know their Omega-3s and omega-6s yeah especially if it's intensively brain finished now not everyone does that you know I was talking to Maggie and Mac up in Alberta and other ranchers as well and when you you add in a bit of grain to help keep them fat through the winter and things like that you're not talking about 95 100 grain you're talking about kicking it up you know 30 60 grain the rest of it's like hey and feed and grass and things like that it's just a sort of a Top-Up so they're still getting nutrients and all these sorts of things it's very different different way of doing it and and you get different results and so um you know most people so that that actually seems to be okay and cows can can I mean I saw an article saying that they could get rid of glyphosate right they could they could just burn that stuff out so that doesn't get in their meat either so it depends you know it's still going to be a filter but that's that's why people with autoimmune issues should really stick to red meat because you know they they try pork or chicken and it and it and it gives them a reaction and it gives them a flare-up of their autoimmunity so that's probably what that's from is those those toxins that they're not used to uh breaking down and chewing up they can get into the meat so yes that can be an issue and that's why you stick to red meat grass-fed and finished if you're if you're Ultra sensitive but most people even very sensitive people do just fine on even grain finished beef and lamb so just see what see how you do if you're spotting you're still having a problem then um uh then just go for grass-fed and finished and that then should be fine Glenn Condren asks what uh what if you've lost your gallbladder is a very common question um and uh I have addressed this on other videos I should make one just just call this uh just so people can look it up but uh doesn't matter your gallbladder stores bile but your liver makes the bile and so your liver is still going to make the bile just going to drip out constantly and so it may be that you can't absorb as much of that in one meal so you just need to eat the same amount as your body still needs a certain amount of meat and fat you just may need to split those meals up throughout the day now if you're getting loose stools diarrhea that means your body's not absorbing as much a lot of the fat that you're that you're eating so you need to space that out and so uh just still judge by your stools most people actually a lot of people I don't know the percentages but a lot of people will form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is just an out pouching of the common bile duct and that just works like a normal gallbladder and so they don't have any problems uh eating eating big one one a day fatty meal as well so just depends but you can still absolutely do it because you still make bile you just may need to split up your meals but not necessarily Joseph thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chafee thank you for what you do been on a strict carnivore uh carnivore uh for almost two weeks and already feeling the effects great question at what point will the normal hunger pains go away FYI Costco Ribeyes Rock yes they do um usually usually a few weeks you know usually you don't get Cravings after a few weeks now if you you are getting hunger pains and and uh uh carb cravings and things like that you may be under eating it's very easy to under eat on a carnivore diet and so you're just like yeah I'm not hungry I'm not hungry just eat a little bit or whatever and I'm fine but then you start feeling like you're really hungry or you're having like carb Cravings that may be that your brain is screaming at you you need to eat a hell of a lot more so you should be eating enough fatty meat that you don't get those feelings and so if you are eating rib eye keep eating until it stops tasting good not until you feel yeah I feel comfortable your body still wants it if it tastes good because you get negative feedback it tastes good now but the next bite it tastes slightly less good slightly less good and slightly less good until eventually it doesn't taste good and you just go hmm I don't I don't actually want to eat anymore and you stop and that's I believe you know I haven't asked any I'm you know haven't come across Dr Doolittle but I would expect that that's the same Sensation that other animals get in the wild certainly the ones that we get and so that's how your body tracks or tells you how to track what to eat and how much to eat you start eating other things like carbs and sugar and lectins and things like that that disrupts your hormones and your satiety signals and blocks leptin and raises insulin and does all these sorts of things that drains your hunger signals and your satiety signals and then you overeat it's very easy to overeat and they're addictive and so you definitely overeat when you do when you're doing Carnival you don't have any of that bothering you so you can actually listen to your signals so you have to know what to look for and I think that taste is is a major component there if fatty meat tastes good you are still hungry you should keep eating until it stops tasting good now you the other side of that people say oh I'm just getting tired of of rib eye and oh gosh and like try other meat and little it just doesn't taste good well then you're definitely not hungry and you don't need to eat you don't need to eat just for the sake of eating right so you know unless you're like completely emaciated or something like that or have a you know an eating disorder or something like that you just do this is a survival issue um but you know many people I've spoken to with anorexia do very very well on a carnivore diet and um and and find it much easier to eat and eat a healthy amount and put on weight and be happy about putting on that healthy weight as well so um so yeah so that's what I suggest just make sure you're eating enough make sure that you're eating until fatty meat stops tasting good and and you should be fine and so you shouldn't you shouldn't get those those cravings and those feelings as much if you're eating enough so good luck with that send off work thank you for the Super Chat I have a question do we know how long the opposite of fat adoption is okay so we already asked that one so that's the carbonation so just so you know guys I mean there is a bit of a delay in um and how I can I can answer these just because they you know they come down but I do I try to answer all the questions and I certainly uh get to all the super chats as well um and I try to answer other questions also but obviously it's you know it's um I make it a point to to answer all the super chats so this is about the uh carb adaption from fat adaption so you all you're always carb adapted you're always working on carbohydrates you always use carbohydrates and um you know because you make carbohydrates when you're in ketosis uh when you start eating carbs again you really just stop your body from making ketones and you're still using carbohydrates and then it just takes a couple days for you to start pre-loading insulin so that you can effectively keep your blood sugar down but you're always running on carbs so you know you never you never go off that um so yeah you're always carb adapted really Leonardo thank you for the Super Chat uh hypothesis ketones uh is not a starvation survival function as commonly thought but a result of abundance dietary or stored fat that gets interrupted when we eat plants thoughts no I I agree I don't think this is a survival function I think this is our this is our primary metabolic State this is the primary metabolic state of essentially most animals at least in the wild so carnivores and herbivores are in a state of ketosis or starvation State um because they're always getting meat and fat they don't they don't take in a bunch of carbohydrates so carnivores because they eat animals with fat they go for the fat first they're eating fat and meat right so they absorb fat and protein High proportion of fat to protein generally and then but also herbivores because they don't you know they're taking in a bunch of fiber which is just all carbs but that's not actually what they absorb because no vertebrate animal can break down uh no vertebrate animal can break down a fiber and so it's actually the fiber is there to feed their gut bacteria and the gut bacteria eat that break down all the fiber and then as their waste they secrete short chain fatty acids which are also 100 saturated so they absorb the fat they absorb the waste the sort of weird to think about the byproduct of this bacteria that's what they absorb and then the bacteria die off and they break those down and absorb those as proteins so what a cow eats is grass but what they absorb is fat and protein what a gorilla eats or green leaves what they absorb is fat and protein and all the way down down the line so um yeah so that so gorillas and cows are in the same ketogenic so-called starvation state so it's not a starvation State the only reason we call it a fasting state is by the time we were able to look at our biochemistry at a molecular level everyone was eating carbohydrates and says okay what does this look like when we eat oh it looks like this great and okay what about if you stop eating does it look the same well no actually about 24 hours it looks this other way oh very interesting that must be a fasting stain that changes okay but if you eat anything else on earth except carbohydrates it also looks like this so-called fasting stay so they just jumped the gun a bit you know they didn't test things out um as much as they should have and and this is this is up until current day and that's what I was taught in Biochemistry you know two decades ago and uh it's wrong right because when I eat 5 000 calories in ribeye I am not fasting and so whatever my whatever you can say about my metabolic state you cannot say it's a fasting state because not fasting right so I think that that's our primary metabolic State that's and that's the primary bulk state of of most animals in the wild except you know birds and bees and things that eat nectar God knows what their metabolism is like but uh for for the other carnivores and herbivores out there you know you're running on fat and protein and so I think that's that's uh that the what we call a Fed State what we call our primary state is actually a pathological defense mechanism that your body's defending against high blood sugar because high blood sugar is toxic it damages it cause direct damage to your body and kill this is what kills diabetics is this prolonged high blood sugar right so as glucose molecules physically fuse to other molecules and they damage them they cause permanent damage and disruption to your body and so your body looks at that and goes sweet Jesus what's going on here you slam up insulin to try to get this out and and save the save the you know the body and so that that's that's just a a a defense mechanism that's not our normal state right because if we're eating what we're designed to eat what we're normally eating what we were eating during the eye stages that's not the state we're in and so you can call it ketosis you can call it whatever you want you know people say that the the Inuit don't go into ketosis but that's really because they're just their ketones are pretty low uh you get better at at using your ketones as you go and you get more efficient at it so at first you have high ketones because your body is not keto adapted and it's not and so you have just like if you're insulin resistant your blood sugar goes up and it's harder for your body to get this into the cells to use so at first your Ketone resistant right because you don't have the mechanisms set up to use ketones properly because you haven't been using them you haven't been making them and you know just like when you go back to eating carbs all of a sudden you're not making enough insulins you're like oh God okay gotta get those wheels turning again and so for ketones it just takes a bit of time but when you've been on it long enough your ketones aren't that high that's because you're using them you're using them better and whatever happens it's supposed to happen right because you're eating what you're supposed to eat and so whatever happens is supposed to happen and the the Inuit you know they say Well they're not in ketosis I don't know because they're making ketones they're making blood sugar they're making glycogen they're not just running off of the uh you know I mean there's glycogen in meat and organs but is that enough to run all of their energy demands is there insulin chronically elevated no I don't think so so not that I know of anyway so I think that they are in ketosis I just think that it looks different when you've been on it your whole life as opposed to just a six-week study right so um but yeah I definitely agree that I we the fasting state is not a fasting state that um that I think that's our primary metabolic State and that's where all of our heavy machinery come to bear that's where all the beneficial biochemical actions happen that's where autophagy comes from mitophagy replacing your mitochondria and and bulking up their number um um you know all the different benefits you get from from fasting all these are all that we know what fasting is so good for you so you go on a carnivore diet it just mimics fasting no no fasting mimics the metabolic metabolism you're supposed to be in all the time anyway which you would be in if you were on your proper diet how can we say that eating a whole bunch of grains and sugar and processed crap is normal for us none of that existed in the last size stage or any ice age or before the 1800s why why are we eating things that didn't exist before you know before the 1800s I mean there are things we're eating now that didn't exist before we were even born right why the hell are we eating them you definitely aren't adapted to those things right uh what are we adapted to we're adapted to meat whatever you're adapted to that's what you're supposed to eat that's what that's a that's an immutable law of biology is adaptation you you get stressors and survival pressures and whatever can adapt best to that situation survives and thrives and we not only survive we not only thrived we became the most dominant species on Earth during ice ages when all we had to eat was meat right so we are well adapted to eating meat we are not well adapted to eating any plants and you know some people have a bit of adaptation eight to ten thousand years with agriculture a lot of people don't a lot of people have not been introduced to agriculture until they were met by the Western Colonial Powers a few hundred years ago and many of them still didn't eat any of that garbage they knew better it's only in sort of the recent century and a half that they started doing that the Native Americans were still eating mostly meat until you know we wiped out the buffalo in the the American Indian Wars you know Buffalo Bill which I still think is just a an atrocity just an absolute atrocity and um but that's what it was and so in the 1800s the Native Americans and planes Indians were the tallest human beings on Earth that's been well studied and documented and now they are not they started eating a western diet they are more likely to get obese and sick and diabetic and metabolic issues and cancer and these other sorts of things when eating a western diet so what does that mean that means if you know that means the food is causing the disease because if they don't eat the food they don't get the disease and we eat the food and we get the disease we just get it at a lower rate because we have had a bit of protection we've had a bit of adaptation ten thousand years is not that much but it does something and so we have some adaptive measures to protect us where the Native Americans don't the native Australians don't sub-Saharan Africans don't have as much and so that's that's where you see a lot of disparities in health come from that background how long have you been exposed to these nasty plants that we really shouldn't be eating if you've been exposed to them longer you can do better with them if you have not had much exposure to them you know genetically in your in your genetic past then you're not as adapted to it the law of nature the law of biology is adaptation and if you have not had time to adapt you should not be eating or exposing yourself to that thing you want to expose yourself to things that you are well adapted to and what we are well adapted to All Humans is meat and so that's what you should eat Lee Martinez uh thank you very much for or maybe Leah Martinez thank you very much for the Super Chat I asked this question already but wanted to send a Super Chat oh well thank you 66 year old all blood work is great except for uh protein and tibc which are both low carnivores 16 IBC GI blood counts not not recognizing that one maybe that's something else maybe put in in the in the chat um what that stands for either way I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about it so sometimes you have like little aberrant blood tests but you know again this is this is what we're designed to eat and so as long as you're only eating fatty meat and you're getting enough of it and you don't have any sort of other medical issues then um well really it doesn't really matter what your medical issues are if you're eating what you're supposed to eat they're going to work better but you can have other medical issues that have nothing to do with the the food that you're eating um so um yeah no I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about um about the protein and things like that just keep eating and you'll sort it out as long as you're feeling well that's the important thing you know you treat patients you don't treat blood tests you know if you're feeling well and there's no issue then you just keep an eye on it and uh and then you you can check it again and um and see what's going on with it and if you're getting symptomatic with something and then you check your blood and something's off then you say okay well what what could this mean what could this be doing but if you just have an aberrant blood test that's not necessarily an issue and as long as you're feeling well and you're doing well and so I wouldn't worry too much and everything else is fine so you know yeah I would uh yeah I would just keep going as you are and just put a pin in that and if you check your Bloods again you know take a look see what's going on it could be perfectly normal for you people sit in different ranges normally and so if that's normal for you then that's great um Basics asks hey Anthony uh love what you do well thank you very much uh were you going to make a documentary in the same style as a game changers well I'm yeah I don't know I was thinking about it actually but um you know I just God I just don't know when the hell I would do it um but people like Carrie Mann from homestead Howe just jump right on that train and we saw how much of a massive benefit this made for him and he started talking to a lot of people who was massively helping he's just like no we need to get a documentary out we need to get this on Netflix we need to do something big and uh and so he's working on that so he's working on a carnivore documentary and so I've uh well tried to help out with that as much as I can and put him in touch with different people that can help with that and uh and I'll be presumably um in it as well and and talking to him and talking about all this sort of stuff in that documentary and so hopefully that that gets out now um Brian Sanders has been doing this for six years now so he's he's um you know the the um creator of food lies and the you know created that so he's making this documentary about food lies and and now not necessarily carnivore but but the vilification about meat is dead ass wrong and showing this is wrong and actually eating animal based is very appropriate it's more appropriate so it's not a carnivore documentary per se but it's pretty damn close and it really goes exactly the opposite of where every other documentary says oh my God Less meat Less meat Less meat Less meat oh just just the meat just causing disease or just stop eating it and you'll get better eat any ass plant that you want doesn't matter it's hemlock whatever just eat it just just plants because that's what they say more more fruits and vegetables Less meat you do better okay well which ones you know they are different you know and most plants on Earth are in Edibles you can't just tell people just to eat any random plant and it'll be good and any meat will be bad that's ridiculous that is just ridiculous again going back to adaptation and these immutable laws of biology anyone who studies biology should damn well know this life is about adaptation and if you've not been adapting to something you're not designed for it if you have been adapting to it for millions of years then you are adapted to it and it is beneficial and it is good for you and you know people like Simon Hill will say well just because we're adapted to it we've been eating it for millions of years doesn't mean it's actually good for us okay new name one example anywhere on Earth that that's true anywhere you know Lions have been eating meat for millions of years but yeah but but a fresh spring salad is going to be better for them really okay prove it right so why would it be different for humans and no other animal on Earth why would the laws of adaptation only apply to other animals and not humans that is ridiculous that is a ridiculous statement so you have a lot of these ridiculous statements and then you have the Messiah and the akikuyu who then people will say well but dakikuyu yes they're not doing as well they're much less healthy um but they you know they that's not the vegan diet I would recommend or the vegetarian diet because they do eat some meat and dairy very little that's not the vegetarian diet I would recommend okay so they're doing they're doing vegetarianism wrong that's always the classic excuse you're just doing vegetarianism wrong well your studies say that more fruits and vegetables and Less meat equal better [Music] but there's an entire population with three quarters of a million people in the akikuyu who in 1931 were eating clean non-processed food diet plant-based and the Maasai who are eating a clean non-processed food animal based diet and the Messiah Were Far and Away more healthy better developed five inches taller bigger brains more uh more body lean body mass and stronger and healthier had less Health defects right and birth and um um uh developmental defects right well that's but that's not the vegetarian diet I would recommend okay you said less meat better these guys have more meat they're doing better these guys are having more plants Less meat they're doing worse so your studies are crap if a study does not disagrees with reality it's wrong period doesn't matter right so even even like mathematical equations you know Richard Feynman said physicists he said it doesn't matter how brilliant your theory is and it doesn't matter how smart you are if it doesn't agree with experiment it's wrong and so you write this mathematical proof and Einstein was known to do this and right this mathematical proof say I prove this great and everyone's like my God you're a genius then they go and observe things and go like yep that's not what's happening throw it out and Einstein would throw it out because he was smart enough to know that it didn't matter what he thought he proved in a mathematical proof he just looked at it and said yeah that's not what's happening okay obviously there's something here going on that I don't know I don't have all the variables and so we toss it out and that's what you have to do and so oh but there's this study and it said I don't care first of all the majority of studies come from uh food the Food and Drug industry how would you listen to any of those you know the Coca-Cola just Coca-Cola not Kellogg's Pepsi Nestle General Mills all the rest of them just Coca-Cola spends 11 times the amount of money on nutritional research every year then the National Institutes of Health NIH right vast majority of of these studies are put out by the the Company's trying to sell you this right so you know I'm sure you know heroin cartels are going to put out as many studies as they can to tell you how great heroin is right why would you trust that you know it's the same thing these are cartels these are drug cartels they are making you sick they are making you addicted and they are profiting this is this is the opium trade this is the new opium trade where people are making entire Empires based on your addiction and your sickness do not listen to these people and other and then they're putting out studies saying how great opium is I bet they are right why would you listen to that why would you listen to this crap it doesn't agree with reality right so well more plants less less meat that's better because meat causes harm that's their contention but you have the Messiah more meat more Dairy drinking blood barely any plants and they're the healthiest people in that region right and they interbreed they intermarry right so they're genetically similar right and you have three quarters of a million akikuyu at the time mostly plant-based clean no processed food no pesticides no fertilizers anything like that not doing very well and it wasn't and and they supplemented them gave them uh you know nutritional supplements because they're all deficient got them up to Optus enough didn't help didn't help their health issues it wasn't until they replaced the plants they were eating with meat that's when they improved okay so again it doesn't meet with reality it's wrong okay and um and so people like Brian Sanders are making documentaries showing all the lies and how wrong this stuff is so that's coming out hopefully that'll be done this year he's put a lot of work into that and I'm really excited to see that um I have a bit of a cameo in it if they decide to keep some of my my things I've said in there uh which would be great but uh but it's massive it's massive I mean they've been putting us together for six years so I'm really excited for that so that'll be uh so people don't know Brian Sanders just look them up on on Instagram um he has a YouTube channel and podcasts as well uh it's all run out of like his uh Instagram Pages um food lies and I think it's the website like foodlast.com or something like that but certainly on Instagram and so that's Brian's um Instagram and you can you can find all the YouTube channel and podcast stuff through that as well and I've been on his podcast and he's been on mine so really nice guy and um and he I'm really looking forward to that documentary and then I'm really looking forward to Carrie uh Carey Mann's documentary as well was that that one is specifically carnivore like carnivore Hells people are going to be following people and tracking people as they go They're saying okay I'm gonna get started on Carnivore and and they're doing before middle and after and seeing how this affects people in real time which I think is really really powerful one of the one of the most gripping and Powerful food documentaries which really started the genre was uh it's called fat sick and nearly dead as people were this guy was very sick on well he's taking all these medications he had I think he had some autoimmune issues and he basically went to just a clean non-processed food diet and was juicing vegetables but he was still eating meat but he was just sort of juicing things and stuff like that and you could see him he was just losing weight and skin getting better and like throughout the documentary he was going around talking to people he was just looking healthier and healthier and healthier as he went he's always drinking this green smoothie so that was influenced by the by the vegan Community like Dr Joel Furman if I'm not mistaken I'm pretty sure it's Joel Furman and um and uh so that had that sort of bent but it was very it was very powerful now this was only him it was only his progress um was in the carnivore diet we're gonna be showing all sorts of people or Carrie's going to be showing all sorts of people not just one person getting better and and really talking about the science behind it and things like that so hopefully it has has a similar impact and um yeah so so exciting times so um I don't know maybe I'll do one I am working on a book I'm hoping to get it out at the end of the year I'm sort of getting more on on top of that and um uh yeah so we'll see we'll see if uh if I can get that out by the end of the year early next year and and um and then yeah we have these cool documentaries coming out on in the pipeline as well so that's exciting Juju Berry thank you very much for the Super Chat question eight weeks on Carnivore when I weight train I cannot sleep at night any thoughts 24 male eating two big Ribeyes and one pound of ground beef well you can play around with what what times you you train and work out sometimes when people work out it just sort of Lights them up and they then they you know wake themselves up and so if you're working out late at night that might be a problem I have I have that problem sometimes and sometimes if I would eat meat and I wouldn't eat as much as my body wants it'll just sort of pick me up and my body's like yep that's enough to get us going for a bit and I'll go kill something else right here's energy go kill something and um you know food not not people but um you know and so so I've noticed that as well so just play around with with how much you're eating and when you're eating and when you're working out so normally if you're eating a big fatty meal at night and you eat until it stops tasting good until you're really full and your body says no that's enough normally people get very lethargic and tired and sleep very well after that I certainly do some people don't some people need to eat earlier on okay fine just listen to your body just and play around with it and also play around with what time of day you're working out if it's if if you're working out at night and that's waking you up okay you need to try and work out a bit earlier than that and uh but you should be able to um should be able to find something that works for you and hopefully you do do two big rib eyes and a ground and a pound of ground beef that sounds like a lot but is that enough for you keep eating until fatty meat stops tasting good try to have leftovers right because if you're finishing everything on your plate and you're like yeah that was good well you know you probably need more you should cook more and and keep going until you're like look I really don't want to eat anymore and so you have a bit left on your plate that's fine eat it tomorrow it's totally fine so anyway good luck okay uh thank you very much less Kaiser for a Super Chat the Buckeye state says hey well hello when I told my doctor I was starting carnivore he was happy hey that's that's pleasant surprise uh it's happening more and more which is great he wants to use me for a guinea pig um as he has had many patients ask him about doing this diet but double my statins Jesus Christ okay um well look you got you can you well this is this is your decision and taking any medication is is always the patient's decision um you know and if and you can have a conversation with your doctor you say hey look you know I don't you know this is I'm thinking that maybe I don't want to take this for for these reasons or maybe you're happy to and all that sort of stuff but you know it is it's perfectly fine to have a conversation and just and just um you know relay any misgivings that you may have one thing to remember with statins is that um is that how how they re lower LDL cholesterol is they they don't get rid of like the small dents so there's over 100 different particles of LDL right and so or different types and so the ones that we we probably don't want around are the small dense LDL okay so SD LDL that's a pattern B in your in your LDL cholesterol so do statins reduce those no they do not how statins work how they lower your total LDL cholesterol and again there's over 100 different kinds it stops your body from making the large buoyant LDL that you want those are the ones that you want okay and so that I can actually lower the ones that you want and then you have it disproportionately high ones if you don't want like the SD LDL so according to the now people can watch my interview with Dr asima hotra Who's an Interventional cardiologist from the UK he wrote a whole book called A Statin free life and so people can watch that on my YouTube channel and and get the lowdown on statins and and cholesterol how I met him was we did a um a debate on on cholesterol you know did have we got this right that that cholesterol is actually a driving factor for heart disease and we already know that it wasn't and we we won that we won that debate against sort of three other cardiologists and professors of medicine and things like that I was the only non-cardiologist there which was funny but it's something that you know I've looked into and um you know so there's uh there is information out there showing the LDL and cholesterol in general was really never a marker for heart disease in the first place and you know we're we're lowering it in our diet we're lowering it not with drugs and our disease rates are going up right and people say uh you know dishonest people will try to mislead you and say well you know death's related to cardiovascular disease peaked in the 60s and 70s and now I've been coming down steadily since well that's because our interventions have been getting better and we've stopped smoking as much right the rate of heart disease is going up the prevalence the incidence of heart disease is going up it's much higher than it was in this in the 60s and 70s much higher as a proportion of society and as a percentage of people getting it each year and first-time heart attacks people having their first heart attack there are more people getting first-time heart attacks they're just surviving right so it's very dishonest to try and switch the goal posts and and say hey the rates of heart disease is going up well actually death from heart disease has gone down not what I just said I said the rate of heart disease didn't I so when someone switches like that and they and they use weasel words and try to change the direction of what we're talking about you know they're dishonest and so if you ever catch anyone doing that call them out on it immediately because they are they're a fraud and they're trying to con you and don't let them so um your doctor's probably not going to do that the doctor sounds like a very good guy and that is interested in this but you know just that's how people think about statins but just that's that's what statins do they lower your your large buoyant LDL molecules it stops your body from making those it also stops it making in your brain Lipitor or atorvastatin um and and other statins some of them will cross a blood-brain barrier liberatory which is Atorvastatin um unless I'm completely blank but I'm pretty sure it is that crosses your blood-brain barrier if I'm not mistaken and I'm not going to stop your brain from making cholesterol and a big proportion of your brain is cholesterol right you need it for myelination of your axons and things like that so that's not good so that's not actually what you want and so just remember that and remember that the the from the the studies published by the drug company so this is this is as pretty a picture as is ever going to be for statins show that if you've had a heart attack and you go on statins for at least five years you will on average increase your life expectancy by five days days right for years at least five years or more 20 plus years whatever of taking these things if you've had a heart attack if you have not had a heart attack it does not increase life expectancy so what are we doing here and there was a study with over 11 million patients and they found that higher LDL cholesterol of any particulate size they didn't even look at distinguished the particulates just said LDL period people with higher LDL cholesterol 11 million people big study hire the LDL the lower their all-cause mortality meaning they lived longer so people higher LDL cholesterol live the longest okay so you know just think about that and you can watch my my video just called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease where I talk about how this is really just this has been a scapegoat and it's it's not the cause of heart disease and and there's a lot of evidence for that and in fact just the best evidence is that the cholesterol being the cholesterol model and theory of heart disease in the first place was put out by by the sugar companies and they paid off a number of different professors three from Harvard at least Ansel Keys famously who came up with that model and they were on the payroll for the sugar companies and they did not tell anybody and that's illegal and one of those Harvard professors was named head of the USDA and he was the one who authored and published the 1977 declaration saying that cholesterol causes heart disease stop eating it stop eating saturated fat and that's and that's what changed everything was hotly debated for decades before that and then that shut down the argument so and that was false that was fraud that was they were bought and paid for and we have documentation of that that was published in the journal the American Medical Association in 2016. okay that's a matter of historical record that happened we have clear documentation we even have their their um their contracts we know how much they got paid these guys got paid sixty five hundred dollars back in the 60s that's the equivalent of fifty five thousand dollars now so selling out your health and your parents health and having your parents and grandparents die early and then die of dementia uh was you know they they got a new Camry for that that's that's what that's what the health of your family and your children was worth to them it's sick and um and I you know it's just sad that these people have all passed away so that we can't execute them for their crimes against humanity because truly those are crimes against humanity the hundreds of millions billions of people that they've affected and damaged and killed prematurely because of that terrible terrible lie that they made is is staggering I mean I don't think we'll ever be able to calculate the amount of of harm that this has caused but I mean you're talking about billions of people that have been serious I mean all the kids have been raised on a low-fat diet with a bunch of processed foods none of them have developed properly all the developmental issues developmental delays shorter stature um smaller you know shrinking IQs things like that that was all directly related to eating the wrong thing and not getting enough fat cholesterol for our brains to develop properly and eating a whole bunch of things that that screw with our lives and now the drug companies are complicit with it now and say oh everyone over 40 should be on a Statin purely because you're over 40. get bent like I have absolutely no interest in anything that these people have to say um so I love that your doctor is is uh interested in this um you know watch that video that I did the truth about the carnival or the truth about cholesterol and heart disease watch the interview I do with Dr C Malhotra watch the one I do with uh Dr Paul Mason that's that will that was really interesting that's that's one of my favorite ones um that will tell you a lot about cholesterol and statins and then you can make an informed decision and and have a discussion an informed discussion with your doctor and it sounds like this is a reasonable guy and uh we'll we'll likely have a very reasonable and reasoned um conversation with you so uh yeah so just just give it a shot but yeah that's awesome and uh sounds good so keep it up Joseph thank you very much for the Super Chat question uh 33 uh healthy male with Asperger's carnivore high fat help fasting helps greatly well that's great to hear suggestions to improve being on the spectrum that aren't gimmicks I've seen Esters MCT oil uh sulfurophane uh epicore Etc well I'd say the hell away from a sulfurophane that's that's something that's so toxic that the plant doesn't even keep it in its full form just like with cyanide they keep keep it separate and you start chewing it and releases these chemicals which then bind to form hydrogen cyanide which is deadly to all life and then sulforaphane is the same same sort of mechanism where you you chew up things like it's in broccoli and other sorts of things you chew it up and then releases these chemicals which then bind and combine to to make sulfur a thing so that's so toxic that even the plant doesn't want to get near it it's just it's just a kill switch you're going to kill me I'm gonna take you out with me right you start chewing me I'm going to release this toxic poison that's going to get you right so I you know maybe in low doses whatever maybe it helps because you know what is medicine is just a poison that that in certain doses at certain times gives more benefit than harm but if you don't have that if you're not in that moment and at that dose it only causes harm or just doesn't do anything anything beneficial anyway so uh you know until we have some you know trials you know uh some some phase three trials going out there showing that certain dose of sulforaphane helps in this for asperger's I would I wouldn't I wouldn't touch it but that's just me um no the the main thing is is being on a proper human diet having things that are that are beneficial to your brain like meat and fat in particular animal fat Omega-3s fatty acids which you can get from from beef but if it's grain finished for too long intensively grain finished it will have much less Omega-3s so you know have a have a tin of sardines in your in it in water don't have it in like sunflower oil or any sort of seed oil or anything like that miserable uh oils like that um just in water without herbs or anything like that just get them plain plain plain and um you know maybe some cod liver in its own oil and things like that those sorts of things those are going to have great great amounts of Omega-3s or you'll just have salmon or fish or whatever once a week something like that um that is going to give you the things that you need to to grow and maintain your brain and then specifically avoiding things that are going to curtail it so uh being in ketosis not having any any carbohydrates right whether you're in or out of ketosis is not really the issue it's just staying away from carbohydrates because there are I mean there are papers out that argue say you know uh there's one I believe it's called um uh ketosis as a treatment for autism and it just goes through all the evidence that's why this is this is probably a good idea and their entire treatment facilities for people with with uh autism and Asperger's who uh which is on the Spectrum for autism uh who are having great success with ketogenic diets in general and I think carnivore is the best ketogenic diet so just just keep it carnivore ifat red meat have some omega you know fish and get for the Omega-3s once or twice a week you know sardines are great you know the bigger carnivorous fish they they'll sort of get more of a load of heavy metals and so the smaller fish that sort of don't eat a lot of other fish they don't have as much of a buildup of these heavy metals that can be a problem so uh you know that's why sardines are you know probably a good option there too but yeah so you're getting those Omega-3s getting those things that are good for your brain and your body and they're just avoiding all the things that are going to screw it up like carbohydrates which will raise your insulin which will drop your ketones and ketones are the most important fuel for your brain and so you start running on glucose and your brain will not run as well so those aren't gimmicks those have been shown in in studies to be effective um MCT oil maybe esters maybe I don't I don't know of any evidence for that but you can play with it but I think that if you are eating just high fat carnivore diet you're going to get all of that that you need your ketones are going to be up uh you're going to have a lot of healthy fats and cholesterol around to build and maintain and run your brain and that's what you need so and you'll get all the things that you need too because some some um forms of autism can be just from nutritional deficiencies like there's one Texas A M showed that you can get this from uh carnitine deficiency only 70 people say oh that's that's a non-essential amino acid only for about 70 of people the other 30 don't make enough or or any at all and so they have to get it from their diet it only comes from meat so you're doing the things that you need to do you're eating the things that your body needs and your brain needs and then you're eliminating out all the things that could potentially cause harm and so that's great so just fatty red meat and water grain finished sorry grass fed and finished if you can because that has a better complement of Omega-3s maybe sardines once or twice a week and don't need anything else certainly no seed oils certainly no plant oil certainly no sugar certainly no carbs and I think you'll do great and just keep going as you are and you'll just keep getting better and better so good luck with that thank you P Anderson thank you very much for the Super Chat 53 year old female feel amazing and thriving on Carnivore five months strong grateful for all you do and share thoughts on labs April to September's numbers total cholesterol 163 to 212 HDL 46 to 56 triglycerides 136 to 87 LDL 94-137 glucose 99 to 106. uh that all looks fine I mean the glucose I mean was that a fasting glucose on fasting glucose what time of day was it um you can have different sorts of variability because of that it's really important to get your Bloods tested in the same way in the same fashion uh every every time you do it all your Bloods so first thing in the morning fasted from the night before 9 pm so you want first thing in the morning between 8 and 9 A.M faster from nine PM the night before at least same hydration status so two to four glasses of water in the morning no less no more um sedentary sedate calm don't get road rage on the way to get your blood test done and uh no exercise physical strenuous physical activity or sexual activity the morning of or the day before and don't take any meds the morning off to wait for after um you have to do that in the same way and you do that in that same way you'll get more consistent results and it makes a big difference especially for things like glucose as well as cholesterol so I wouldn't worry too much about the glucose I mean you know a better thing is looking at your fasting insulin and your hba1c because that tells you what your blood sugar and Insulin been doing for months right um it's going to be fine it's going to be better and um but your cholesterol looks great so you know total cholesterol is a meaningless number total LDL is a meaningless number except insofar as it'll You Know It uh means that you're probably going to live longer right um but it doesn't tell us what kind of LDL you have pattern a or pattern B but if your HDL is going up which it is if your triglycerides are going down which they are then that that indicates that you likely have pattern a more of a large Point LDL cholesterol molecules that you want and not the small dense damaged ones that you don't want and so those LDL cholesterol that LDL that of 137 that you have those are good those are good LDL that are kind of benefiting you and so I you know I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about that also remember that if you just stop eating carbohydrates in general even if you don't change anything else your LDL will go up if you just stop eating all food entirely your LDL will go up why is that fasting raises LDL okay so is it the high fat carnivore diet that you're eating if it's making your LDL go up it's making your HDL go up but is it making your LDL go up well it's the same as if you're just fasting your LDL will go up if you were fasting so is it the fact that you're eating a high fat carnivore diet or is it the fact that you're not eating carbohydrates is that what's raising your LDL I would I would bet that it's the latter and then not eating carbohydrates and sugar and alcohol and Seed oils is bringing your triglycerides right down so that's how you can that's how I would interpret those Bloods as well obviously that's just a snapshot and we don't know much else and I don't know anything about your your medical history but when I look generally at cholesterol you know that's those are the sort of of my thoughts there so let's see there we go um Molly Malone uh thank you very much for the Super Chat there's no question there but maybe there's one down I'll take a look um not seeing one now here we go so Molly Malone uh thank you for the Super Chat question 70 year old female nomads um 132 pounds no weight loss 78 days straight carnivore hair falling out at alarming rate since day five everything else is great so well 135 32 pounds I I don't know how tall you are or how much you know excess fat that you have to lose if you have any to lose but potentially um are you eating enough are you eating enough fat normally if you're having problems with your hair or problems with your skin or problems with your nails usually people aren't eating enough and specifically not eating enough fat so you need to eat fatty meat a lot more fat than you've ever thought imaginable because it's a lot more fat than when we've been a lot more fat than we were told was ever safe and so you need a lot more than you think and so just make sure you're eating enough make sure you're eating enough fat keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good and quite often that will actually trigger weight loss because if you're chronically under eating you're you are repressing your your metabolism and your body's saying hey look we're in a famine we need to store all of this we can't give up any of this stuff right whereas when you are steadily eating enough your body goes oh hey we're not in a famine anymore great now we don't need all this extra stuff let's start using it and start building and repairing right so that can happen as well and um also we only have from uh you know just years of eating the wrong thing and restricting diets and things like that we can get leptin resistance and other sort of hormonal issues um so that can take a long time to sort of repair and and you know when we're uh 70 you know it's it's we've had a lot of Decades of harm from eating the wrong things and sometimes they don't repair all the way so you can check your thyroid you can check your leptin you can check these these sorts of things and see if that may be part of the problem that you're having with uh not losing weight also hair loss can be from thyroid issues so you can you can check all that now carnivore diet won't cause thyroid issues but you can have like an underlying thyroid issue that you didn't know about before generally it will help that and improve that also something to to know about with hair loss is that it's not necessarily permanent hair loss because you can actually trigger a Fallout phase you have growth phase stationary phase and then Fallout phase and then regrowth right so it grows back again so the hair falls out and then it grows a new new uh new hair out of the follicle so that can happen and that can sort of trigger you know any sort of major change in your diet or or stress levels all these sorts of things can trigger a Fallout phase but in general these grow back better and so in women it's it's a bit upsetting and unnerving because your hair is longer and so it takes a lot longer before you realize okay no it is growing back in okay right because it may take years freely you know to grow long hair so you can look it can look very different but generally people get thicker hair as a result and so but if you're if you're feeling that your hair is not as healthy as it should be or your nails are not as healthy it's thick and strong and hard to cut um like they should be then eat more eat more fat in particular you need the fat you need the protein you need enough fatty meat for proper Health but you know that that is something that people can see they can they can trigger a bit of a Fallout phase keep eating make sure your thyroid is in check and all these sorts of things and um and that should come back that should be shouldn't be a problem so just keep going with that I think you'll be fine just as long as you're eating enough make sure you're eating enough make sure you're eating a fatty meat and um I think you should be fine uh Mary Blanchard says can I can I use um apple cider vinegar or just use salt and water I I wouldn't uh I wouldn't use apple cider vinegar I just I don't know what the sort of a reference to but I would just I just sort of saw that and uh I would avoid apple cider vinegar I would just avoid any any plant-based anything they may have some sort of benefits they're going to have other detriments you know and and so is that really what you want to put in your body you don't need any of these things you just need meat was apple cider vinegar around in the last eye stage probably don't need it then so that would be my my offhand sort of remark to that uh mindfulness naturopath thank you very much for the for the Super Chat thank you for encouraging me to get into uh carnivore lost 40 pounds in the last few months and reverse my PCOS awesome that's great to hear uh well very well done yeah I mean that's the thing with PCOS is it's um it's largely driven by insulin resistance you know and you're having high insulin levels High insulin can actually promote the the generation of of more testosterone in the ovaries and block its conversion into estrogen so you end up getting too much testosterone not enough estrogen and people can have very serious issues with polycystic ovarian syndrome which is which is the leading cause of infertility in in women and so that's a very big issue so and it's and it comes down to insulin resistance this is the funny thing you know when when you go to fertility clinics and they go like hey yeah you have PCOS here go on that foreman it'll lower your insulin resistance and you'll get pregnant in no time like why are we not seeing that connection with PCOS and metabolic disorder right and why are we not seeing well we can reverse Type 2 Diabetes by putting people on a ketogenic diet why can't we and which is you know the Hallmark of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance insulin resistance causes PCOS why wouldn't we connect those dots or you know some of us why don't they connect some of those dots and and realize that you you can you can reverse PCOS by by getting rid of these carbohydrates and things like that and eating a proper diet as well so that's great I'm glad that you you uh tried it out and um you know took the risk off the reward so that's great you know like Jordan Peterson says you know you have to go out and you have to face dragons and dragons are scary because they can kill you but dragons also have treasure and so if you don't face that risk you don't you don't get the reward right and so you took the risk you went against 50 years of the medical and government establishment saying my God don't do that you did it and you you got the reward so well done Lying Eyes thank you very much for the Super Chat can you reinforce the importance of going completely carnivore and the reasons not giving up sweeteners or fruit interfere with your improvements um well look I just think it just comes down fundamentally to what we're biologically designed to eat you know as I've mentioned before so you know what you're designed to eat what we've adapted to eat uh is is what's going to be optimal for us and so if you're if you're taking in anything that didn't even exist a hundred years ago like artificial sweeteners you know why are we why are we doing that why are we entertaining that now you know fruit so fruit we can go into the specifics but now all fruit is not made equal most fruit on Earth will still kill you you know the cassowary bird eats 150 different kinds of fruit every single one will kill you right because they evolved with the cassowary bird and it can own that seed can only germinate if it goes through the digestion of a cassowary bird so if Castaway birds leave an area those plants die out and if something else starts eating those fruit and the cassowary birds not eating it they die out so it has to be very attractive to the cassowary bird it has to be very very off-putting or deadly to anything else trying to eat it or else they die right they die out and so you know they have to protect they have to protect their own so then there are other fruits and things like that that we do better with especially the sweeter ones but we we've engineered these things to have way too much sugar and that Sugar can be a problem and it's less of a problem than eating you know refined separated sugar because there are things that are beneficial and you know vitamin C can Offset you know some of the the the problems with and different vitamins can offset the problems with the fructose um fiber can reduce the absorption by about 30 percent of fructose so you know you'll get less of it but there's you know you eat enough and it's going to be a problem and um you know when were we eating this stuff traditionally we're eating this stuff uh never during the Ice Age and outside of the ice age or in places that didn't have ice covering it you know 365 days a year uh we had access to some of these things which weren't all that sweet mostly pretty tart and bitter or or or tart I should say um and bitter you wouldn't you wouldn't need it because that's telling you something's bad in there um yeah but not sweet anyway and it was it was available you know a few weeks out of the year and uh and that's it you know and we didn't have it every day we didn't have access to it all day every day not for millions of years anyway you know maybe during certain periods around the equator for some people but other people that were in the northern southern latitudes during the ice ages no so we certainly don't need it and even even the sweet fruits do have defense chemicals they just have less right and so but they're a few random coumarins in all citrus that react with the sun and cause damage to your body they bind you reversibly to proteins and DNA and they damage them you get that on your skin and the Sun hits it you will get chemical burns on your body right so there are defense chemicals in there they're just there's just maybe less of them they're not going to kill you sort of things this it's safe it's not going to kill you that day so you can get a hit of energy but it's not perfect energy it's not all the nutrients you need it's not necessary we know that because there are people surviving these ice ages and in the extreme North and South did not have access to fruits for tens of thousands of years okay so we don't need it right and so if it's not ideal it's not necessary it's not optimal and so adding in a bit of fruits and things like that okay if you want to and if you do okay with it go for it but you're eating carbohydrates you're going to derail your your metabolism your insulin goes up and it's going to take you out of our primary metabolic State you're not going to be able to to make blood sugar and glycogen and ketones and you're not going to feel as good you're going to sort of feel good for a bit because you have a bit of a sugar rush and then your insulin stays up and your blood sugar goes down and you can't push out ketones and you feel worse so I feel a lot better without any of that a lot better I drink a glass of milk and I feel fine for a minute and then I'm like oh my God I'm tired because same thing I get reactive hypoglycemia my body is isn't as suppressed the ketones right so I don't think it's great uh to do I don't think it's optimal I do know a lot of people that are doing you know having some fruit uh you know with carnivore and they do a lot better than they were doing before but then they drop the fruit and they're like wow I'm doing even better still and so that's great and so if you want to add in a bit of fruit and you do fine with it go for it but I just I just recommend people try it you know try going off and just try having just meat and see how you feel and if you feel better great if you don't fine you know but just just try that yourself I feel a lot better without it and so you know I mean my main thing is just it's just like Brian Sanders just like meat has been unfairly vilified and that's and plants are actually Toxic by Nature so we should really think about this a bit better but if people want to eat any of that stuff that's totally fine so just do some self-experimentation um try it you know both with and without and uh and see how you feel and and see what you want to do that's that's um that's what people should do laughing gas thank you very much for the Super Chat hundred grand sweet uh hey Doc obviously not um uh hey Doc is your physique achievable on a carnivore diet and general exercise or did you have a specific routine and program what would you recommend for someone who wants similar results in physique so so this is what I look like out of shape so I'm I I don't I've been back in the gym sort of the past two weeks um but literally two weeks and before that I haven't been really going all that often uh just just due to time and just them I've been out of you know out of the routine um so the diet can maintain your physique and a low body fat and musculature or whatever you've done that but yeah I've spent years in the gym working out and things like that I just I work out I try to work out like lift weights and things like that I would always try to lift weights four days a week and then I'd have rugby practice on top of that and and other sort of Sprint training plyometric trainings and things like that independently so I was working out a lot and I you know built up a lot of musculature and um you know when I was just back on Carnivore I was you know I've always been sort of muscular because I've always sort of worked out a lot but now I really hit into it and was because I had a home gym and I had time on my hands so I would I would lift weights for three to four hours a day every every day and maybe have one rest day a week maybe uh but yeah I was just just living like a beast so uh yeah no you can get this you can definitely get on a carnivore diet it's been easier to put on muscle and get lean on a carnivore diet than anything I've ever done before and so just keep eating uh fatty red meat preferably you don't need a bunch of protein shakes or anything like that you'll get hundreds of grams of protein just from eating steak and or whatever meat and uh and then just work out um sprinting great Hill Sprints even greater and lifting weights and going to failure I go to muscle fatigue and exhaustion that's how I just I just work until I've worn out the muscle group it's a lot harder on a carnivore diet so I was doing like crazy sets I was doing like 20 sets you know like I think was Metzger you know professional bodybuilders that you just did sort of one set he's like oh after that you do two sets resets whatever like yeah sure you get more work out of it but you know there's a detriment because it takes longer for you to recover it didn't take any time at all for me to recover um I you know I was doing this um like something I could do it every day but I thought that was stupid I wanted to let it rest so I was doing it every day so I was doing 20 sets of bench 20 sets of dips 20 sets of flies 20 sets of incline every other day it was hours and hours and hours and hours it's just ridiculous but not all that much rest in between and uh you know a couple minutes and so you know it's um you just recover so much better now I don't I don't know if that's better or not I don't we haven't really done tests and studies on on people that eat the way I do and recover as quickly as I do uh Dr jayquish is of the opinion that you don't want to do that you just do one set to failure especially with the bands the banded exercises and that's all you need to do and you get sort of diminishing returns after that fair enough um but either way uh you you however many sets you're doing uh and you know three sets to failure is fair enough if you want to sort of split the difference um and uh or I mean just one set to failure whatever if you're doing them sort of just slow and steady and doing them right really good reps good sets um so here you go see what works for you but but just at least whatever you're doing doing it to exhaustion where you just really worn yourself out get the whole body and consistency that's the key whatever you're doing work to failure so push yourself and do it consistently if you're gonna go four days a week like I do Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday without fail you get those done and other days are bonus maybe you want to do an extra leg day on Wednesdays or you want to do sprints on Saturdays go for it but those days are sacrosancts Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday that's that's my routine and I'll I'll add in other days but I those days get done and you just do that and you keep doing that and you keep working out if you push yourself up that was the difference but I have friends of mine that well I would go work out with and they were like oh yeah I'm working out four days a week five days a week this and the other I'm looking at I'm like it doesn't look like you've ever been in the gym and then we go uh to the gym together once and I I realize why because they really just didn't push themselves you know they do decent amount of weight like on say bench and uh they just go on and you're going like okay yeah you're doing great they just rip out 10 real easily I'm like great man keep going and they just try to put it up and I'm like what are you doing man you're not done and like I try to like push back no hey keep going keep going they're like fighting me to put it on literally this happened a friend of mine uh it was just pushing in fact and I was just like I was leaning on it and pressing it back on him saying like you're doing another one and he was able to force my body weight up and put this thing on the rack it's like I'm sorry if you're able to lift the bar with all the weights and my body weight off the ground and put it on on the rack you clearly are not done right and so that's the thing so they're doing some work but they're not actually taxing themselves and stimulating that muscle growth so that's what you want to do and uh yeah absolutely you can absolutely get a fantastic physique you just put in the hard work and eat the right food and so carnivore is the right food and I've just described the right work so uh you'll you'll do fine man just it has to be consistent you have to keep it up you know it doesn't happen in two weeks you know you talk to people and say how's my how are my legs look how does my butt look it's getting bigger like you know things like that like it's been two weeks you know you you're doing great and you can notice difference in two weeks if you're working hard and you and you you know and that that is something that you can see but you know it just Waits six months and then start looking more monthly you know take monthly pictures and all that sort of stuff but it takes it takes a long time especially if you're coming from from a zero Baseline if you're not if you haven't really been working out a lot um you know it's just it's it'll take time but it will come you just have to stay consistent and so if you just go for a couple weeks and then sort of Peter out you know that's that's not going to get you what you where you want to go uh Super Chat from Don thank you very much you're in depth uh and understandable responses are like no other thank you well thank you Don I appreciate that and I do try to make things well I do try to answer things thoroughly anyway and and sort of give people uh good answers so I'm glad the people uh like that so thank you uh Diane Max thank you for the Super Chat High 52 and two months carnivore I have a hole in my eardrum that won't heal do you think this will help lost 10 kgs so far I'm feeling great I I don't know about that unfortunately um you know the body does pretty great things when you give it what it needs um and I've seen some a lot of things heal but you know if you've had a hole in your eardrum for a while the likelihood of that growing back is um you know not high but you never know um I don't I don't know of anyone who has had that issue um that's told me that that's resolved but maybe someone in the chat if you've if you know someone or you are someone who's had that same issue maybe you can address a comment to Diane Max and and let them know what you're experiencing that uh Jacqueline Norton thank you for the Super Chat there's not a question attached but maybe there's one down the line here I'll take a look there we go so Jacqueline asks uh can carnivore diet help with bursitis I've been doing carnivore diet for two months now not 100 but doing the best I can and still suffering with bursitis and advice please so bursitis is just the inflammation of the Bursa and so these Bursa sacs that sort of are padding and lubricant for tendons and other sorts of moving Parts in your body and um and it can be very painful when it is just means inflammation so it can get inflamed and and uh and irritated and painful uh carnivore diet really does help with inflammation it can really reduce the amount of inflammation one because it removes out a lot of things that cause inflammation and secondly because when your ketones are up ketones directly suppress inflammation so yes you can get uh relief from that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to cure everything but it can reduce your the expression and your sensation of pain and inflammation certainly if you're not doing it 100 percent you're not going to get you're not going to get all the results that you could get so I don't know what what version of this you're doing if you're just eating more meat but you're still eating carbs or fruit and sugar and things like that if you're doing that you're not in ketosis your ketones aren't up you're not going to be suppressing these um these inflammatories inflamasomes and things like that and so that's not going to be as beneficial and you're sort of eating other things that can precipitate uh inflammation as well uh so you know I would just give it a shot with just full 100 percent meat and water only fatty meat and water only the high fat helps reduce um reduce the inflammation so that's what I would do is just give that a shot it will reduce inflammation will that relieve all of your problems and cure your issue can't say but it does help a lot of people and they they find that their expression of pain is much reduced uh on on this way of eating definitely some people find complete resolution of their symptoms which is amazing and so yeah just just uh try it full on for at least 30 days and see how you go Edward thank you for the Super Chat start a carnivore diet six days ago I have Ankylosing Spondylitis waking up near pain-free all week until today had a beer yesterday time to quit thanks Doc yeah well there you go um yeah well look six days already in your in your your ankle losing Spondylitis is is improving that's fantastic and that's just a testament to the fact that it's it's what we're eating that's increasing inflammation increasing our our uh antibodies that attack ourselves and so you get rid of those and the problem goes away and then you you have a beer and then you know comes right back and so that's you know it's a good test and it's good proof positive that you're doing the right thing so you know really good job uh recognizing that and then using it to to um you know to to reinforce your commitment to getting better so well done Edward and uh look forward to hearing uh how well you're doing in the coming months Homestead house my buddy Carrie how you doing man this looks like you sent that Jesus Christ an hour ago sorry buddy uh but he says 100 Dr chafe your voice will be a vital part in the carnivore documentary appreciate you and thanks uh for helping so many well well thank you buddy it's good to see you and uh sorry it's just taking me longer to to get through these um then uh just normally takes this long but uh but yeah really excited for that for Carrie's project and the carnivore documentary if you want to check out his YouTube channel there the homestead how he originally had as a homesteading YouTube channel and grew that up pretty big and then Discovery carnivore and really helped him and his family and just went whoa this is crazy and use that platform to um use that platform to uh you know just show like how great um the carnivore diet is for people and so that that's that's really awesome because he already had a big platform and was able to reach a lot of people that that wouldn't really come across this and um yeah so that's awesome so yeah he's doing great work because people should check his his stuff out uh send it media thank you very much for the Super Chat 24 two months on Carnivore lost 25 pounds still about 20 30 pounds overweight have high blood pressure just checked it and it was 170 over 87 on lisinopril any advice on how to lower it and come off meds so 24 is really young or having that high of blood pressure so a stay on your blood pressure medication but you know you need to talk to your doctor because there are other things that can be um causing high blood pressure that could be you know that that you know just normal blood pressure medication isn't really helpful with and there's other other reasons why you can have high blood pressure that's you know pretty pretty high and and difficult to control with blood pressure medication normal blood pressure issues again can come down to insulin resistance and so going on a ketogenic diet a carnivore diet can significantly reduce uh the need for blood pressure medications when when our body starts recovering um so hopefully that's the case but you know if it's not doing and so full on Carnivore no carbs no sugar or no fruit no honey no anything like that just fatty meat and water that's it and um and if that's not doing the trick and helping and also because you're 24 and your blood pressure should not be that high uh talk to your doctor and get investigated for the the sort of the less common but more serious types of blood pressure because that's you need to rule those out in your case because at 24 uh that's yeah I mean unless you were like 400 pounds overweight your blood pressure should not be that high so it's there's there's a greater suspicion that there's something else going on um and one of these these less common causes of blood pressure that you have to investigate you just have to investigate especially in your in your case keep going with just pure uh red meat and water for best results fatty as you can and um yeah and just just uh talk to your doctor about investigating some of those those other causes of high blood pressure okay just trying to work our way down here to some of the other questions a lot of conversations going on here which is great it's like so many different conversations going on that have nothing to do with me it's funny there's people chatting away which is great DC learning to live thank you very much for the Super Chat hey doc thank you for all you do your amazing question oh thank you first of all question I'd love to do an interview with you on managing cancer uh with carnivore diet would you be interested uh I'm so an interview like interviewing me um or or something you wanted to talk about yeah no absolutely happy to um just email me so I have my little for contacts and collaboration uh you know for collaborating on on things like that I have my email in the description for most of my YouTube um things and podcasts and it's just Anthony chafee gmail.com just shoot me an email and uh and yeah we can we can discuss it sounds good Liberty threads clothing thank you very much for the Super Chat should I introduce fruit to help bulk on Carnivore um well if you want to bulk fat maybe but um no I I don't think you need that no you definitely don't need that um if you want to put on lean muscle mass the easiest way to do that is eating uh fatty carnivore diet hands down I've never put on muscle ease here more easily and it's just it's lean lean muscle mass so if you're if you're eating carbs and fruit and all that sort of stuff sure you'll you'll you'll look a bit bulkier but that's going to be fat and glycogen that you're putting into your body and your muscles so if that's what you want you want to go for a look like you did carnivore all the way up to a bodybuilding competition and then you ate some carbs and fruit the night before and your muscles swelled up with the glycogen fine but that's not actual muscle mass you're not actually bulking with real muscle it's just giving you the illusion of muscle it's just looking bigger but it's not bigger just puffing up your muscles it's like you're injecting oil and things like that into the muscles have them look all bulky and weird not the same thing you know they may look like they have big muscles but they don't have big muscles they have uh you know weird stuff mixed in with the muscles so yeah you don't need to do that uh just eat fatty meat until he stops tasting good and work your ass off and you'll you'll put on a lot of muscle Laurel Roeder thanks for the Super Chat there's no question attached but I'll look at one here there we go so Laurel says 66 year old female keto with intermittent fasting 24 to 48 hours one to two days a week lost 30 pounds in two years great carnivore for two months too hungry to fast not losing weight but feel amazing I miss autophagy and fasting ideas 20 pounds to go so you get autophagy on carnivore so you get AutoPage you get my autophagy just by not eating carbohydrates and having your insulin low so if you're doing Carnival you will be getting that and that's that's why we get that with fasting is because you know it's uh it's getting us into the metabolic state that we're supposed to be in anyway and we would be in all the time if we were eating what we're supposed to eat which is a carnivore diet um too hungry to fast maybe it sounds like you may not be eating enough really shouldn't be all that hungry normally people's hunger signals are much more suppressed and subdued so if you're feeling hungry all the time you probably need to eat a lot more and if you're eating too little and you're chronically under eating you're going to lower your metabolism and you're going to stall your weight loss and so you know you just want to eat until fatty meat stops tasting good and generally that will will trigger will trigger uh more weight loss um but you you are already um going to be uh experiencing autophagy and recycling of your of your cells and and the organelles within the cells as well because it's not just the whole cells that get turned over that you can swap out parts inside the cell as well so just like your you know your radiator goes out in your car you don't have to get a new car you can replace the radiator and that's and that's part of autophagy is replacing individual components of this cell and making it making them work better so yeah you you get that with just a carnivore diet you don't have to fast so you'll be fine um what was that so Noob just says thank you so much for going through these questions Dr Shafi well you're very welcome and you know hopefully um you know this these questions these answers are helpful to people and um and the people get something out of it so okay so I've got about um oh Christmas so I've got about a maximum of of an hour to go guys um because I've got I've got some calls to make after this so I'm going to just try to get through the rest of the super chats and um and and so maybe uh you know we'll see where we're at at the end of the super chess but uh probably you know don't send any more because I I don't want to not get to them uh so the next sort of 30 minutes to an hour I'm gonna need to wrap up um but we'll get through all the super chats anyway Asylum uh thank you very much for the Super Chat two months carnivore I'm having trouble with my athletic performance in BJJ everything is amazing besides my cardio and strength well it just depends on what you're doing um and when you're eating so if you're if you're working out on a carnivore diet uh you you generally want to work out fasted you don't you want to work out on an empty stomach I always train on empty stomach I always played on an empty stomach I always competed on an empty stomach even before I I knew why that was I just felt naturally a lot better when I did that and if I would eat during the day I would eat a smaller meal during the day and uh but preferably I wouldn't eat anything until after I trained that was even just in school sports you know if I was wrestling you know after school I didn't when I was just like I was like oh shoot you guys I was like oh I don't know if I really want to do that because I got a big workout today in wrestling and um but you know several hours sort of generally between but even then I would I would notice it so um you know with with any sort of you know martial arts or BJJ and those sorts of things like you really want to be on an empty stomach because when you're when you eat food it just you're pushing you know blood to your intestines and you're you're yeah that's blood that's not available to your brain and your muscles right and you go into a rest and digest phase and your body just says hey why are we fighting why are we struggling why are we fighting just chill out we got our food for the day you know take a nap take it easy your job's done so you know just remember that um you need to eat enough right but you need to eat enough at the right time so you know if you're going to eat during the day eat a smaller amount just a bit to take the edge off um but preferably eat after and then eat a lot a lot of fatty meat and uh you have a Brazilian barbecue afterwards and um and and then hopefully that'll be good for the next day you know if you need to eat a bit of you know the next morning or during the day just have a have a small amount to take the edge off so you're not crashed throughout the day and and you know five hours plus before your your uh training and that's what I would do make sure you get enough water get make sure you get enough sleep um as well those are all the normal normal sort of things but you know just uh as far as as far as eating is concerned make sure you're eating enough and make sure you're eating at a time that's not interfering with your workouts and uh and good luck with it carnivorous dude thank you for the Super Chat thoughts on deuterium overdose due to GMO so that's a good question I I don't know the difference in deuterium low deuterium being heavy hydrogen um I don't know that of of the differences in deuterium loads in GMOs I do know that there's a lot more deuterium in you know plants and that we eat and when you're eating carbohydrates you it raises your deuterium load as well um and because just not getting rid of enough of it when you're not eating carbohydrates you make molecular water and so uh or metabolic water I always say that wrong metabolic water because you're you're you're making water uh when you're burning fat so for every uh one gram or one kilo of every one kilo of fat that you burn in your mitochondria you produce 1.1 liters of metabolic water which is deuterium free and so you know that lowers your overall deuterium levels and looks like I got a little visitor here hey buddy and um and so that goes down so you're eating any sort of plants and especially uh you know grains and carbs and things like that then you're going to raise your deuterium which is which is harmful which actually damages your body damages your mitochondria and you know as we're we're quickly discovering the mitochondria are vital for overall health you damage your mitochondria they don't work properly your cells don't work properly your brain doesn't work properly your hormones don't work properly and and we don't work properly so we get a lot of uh metabolic issues and serious diseases from that so I don't know if it's different for gmoso send it media um thank you for the Super Chat 24 in carnivore lost 25 pounds 25 to go in great shape I have high blood pressure currently on lisinopril but would really like to come off mad so I think this was this was the previous one uh where I had a blood pressure of 170. uh so yeah just um there is a delay guys so I will I will get to all of these um but uh so uh but yeah um uh yeah so I answered that question earlier so you can go back and look at that but that's um that's uh just you shouldn't be that high of a blood pressure at that age you need to go talk to your doctor and see if there might be something else causing the high blood pressure there are certain investigations and tests to do for for people and certain people have uh some of these rare reasons why they get high blood pressure and then you need to know about it because like the blood pressure medication doesn't always help and it isn't enough you need to do do other things as well and so just check that out and keep doing carnivore um and so that'll take care of those reasons for high blood pressure anyway and then just yeah just talk to your doctor about the other ones yeah so Joan Eichner thank you very much for the Super Chat 51 year old female keto off and on for years found it hard to limit the keto snacks yeah well I mean that's a problem with with these snacks is they're they're designed to be just as addictive as the other processed food and things like that you know they're just the sweeteners the artificial sweeteners these things seem to be addictive hitting you know some sort of you know centers in your brain like they just say oh hey look that's sugar that's Drugs That's what I want or something else I I've talked to a lot of people that say it's harder to come off artificial sweeteners than it was to come off sugar yeah excuse me and um you know so uh yeah I would definitely avoid those things because they can they you don't limit them they're designed to not be limited so she goes on and says that she's a former chef and restaurant owner that's very cool 101 days on Carnivore Cravings instantly gone fantastic uh 25 pounds down in most health issues have disappeared awesome so that that's fantastic and you know in just a testament so that you know keto's is great you're getting rid of a lot of things that are harmful harmful to you and and really addressing the major metabolic issues of high insulin and blood sugar which are very damaging but there are other things that are damaging as well and you know just like the artificial sweeteners and the snacks and all the different vegetables that don't have sweeteners in it or sugar and carbs in it as well I mean these things cause problems as well so uh so that's great so really good um really good result there and thank you very much for sharing that so Angel Gordon thank you very much for the Super Chat uh very generous of you I'm wanting to try this I heard you talk about the MTHFR gene mutation in other videos I have that along with Factor five Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation would this be safe dye for me to try absolutely with the factor five Leiden and prothrombin um you know that those are just clotting issues that doesn't have anything to do with nutrition as far as you know are you going to absorb things that I know of the MTHFR G mutation just means you're going to need a bit more um folate and and potentially B12 as well so you people in that situation just need to add in liver once or twice a week and not even all that much just just a bit just to keep those levels up and you should be you should be more than fine uh the the clotting factors um those are risks you know when if you're if you are at a higher risk of clotting that is an independent risk factor for strokes and heart attacks and things like that so you know just something to know about um but I think that when you're on a carnivore diet it at least optimizes your genetics whatever they are and so I have no idea how that affects you know the factor five and the prothrombin issue you know peculiarities that you have but um you know it's not going to cause harm anyway and it's going to benefit you in all these other ways and the nthfr gene mutation that just means you just need liver once or twice a week that muscle may not be enough for you if you're getting you know Wild game you know wild Venison and moose and Elk or um or you know regeneratively raised grass-fed and finished beef and lamb goat uh probably don't even need that because they're they're very very nutrient dense but you know if you're just getting sort of you know store-bought you know uh meat like the rest of us then add in a bit of liver once or twice a week and uh and you'll be fine I think it can be any lever it could be chicken liver sheep liver pig liver cow liver whatever you can mix it up to you know it's fine David Greenfield uh thank you for the Super Chat what about pork it's so much cheaper than beef and uh what about mushrooms so mushrooms are a fungus um so my hard rule is no plants or any fungus nothing artificial or or sorry no sugar or any sweeteners and nothing artificial and that goes for sauces seasonings and drinks as well so mushrooms grows out of the ground don't eat it if it doesn't have if it doesn't move and have a face don't eat it um and uh or limited I know I say the face thing because of of shellfish some people have have actual shellfish allergies so it's not um it's not safe for everyone but um but pork is fine it's totally fine and if it and if you do well on it then that's totally fine because that's the main thing is is how you do with it some you know most of the pork that we get is Factory farmed you know from China and they're just fed a bunch of soy and garbage like that so them high linoleic acid content they have uh different sorts of things that they can't filter out properly because they're not designed to and so it's not as healthy but not everyone has a problem with that so you know if that's what's good for your budget and you feel good on it and it's not causing you any problems perfect you know just keep going with that and uh and and do that no that's perfectly fine if you're doing okay with it if you have autoimmune issues or you have some sensitivities you know you're gonna probably try to need to stick to red meat but you know ground beef is perfectly fine and uh you know and it's cheap brisket's really cheap as well really cheap and it's very fatty and you can actually cut that up into steaks as well um so you know I haven't done it myself but I've spoken to people who haven't they said yeah it actually Cooks up fine it's not all tough it you know it's like you can eat it like a steak it's fine so there are cheap beef options as well so uh but yeah no pork's fine um R Coleman thank you so much uh for the super sticker I appreciate it and Chris Schreiber thank you very much uh for the Super Chat hi I've been doing great on Carnivore for the last two months feeling better than I ever thought possible that's great to hear uh unfortunately I'm still vaping uh toxic sets into me uh yeah well look you know I mean you're you're doing a lot better because you've gotten rid of so many other things but you know I mean you're directly imbibing uh and inhaling things that are not good for you and God knows what's in those things and we have we have no long-term data on what the hell those the flavorings and sweeteners and weird-ass things that they put in these these gels and they they vaporize these things and you're inhaling this stuff and your lungs are very very sensitive to everything that you inhale no one knows no one knows what those things are gonna do sorry uh let's drop something there so um you know it's not it's not something that uh you really want to put in your body you have no idea what this is doing to you you know there's some things like nicotine uh with it it does have negative if you're just doing it for the flavor then really no points uh but if you're new for like a nicotine or something like that uh well you know that that's that's not doing great things for you too so let's assume it's nicotine nicotine even if it's not in the form of a cigarette that that causes damage to your artery lining and that's that damage is where things start going in and start forming plaques and you'll get damaged clot you know build up a a little clot and it sort of builds up some tissue and then you break down again and build up break down again and build up and that's how you get atherosclerosis right you have you have to have a damage it's damage and repair so the damage is where it starts with right so whether it's cholesterol whether it's sugar or whether it's seed oils or whether it's whatever it starts with the damage if you don't have the damage and there's nothing there's no there's no Port of Entry to invade in the first place so uh that would be my advice just get rid of it you're doing great you've done so much better and you've gotten all this all this out all this stuff out of your system it's just the last step and you know if it is addictive you know addictions do go away so after about two weeks that's usually how long nicotine stays addictive to you and then it's just habits after that you're used to doing it at certain times and so you want to do it you felt nice when you did it um but after two weeks the actual chemical addiction goes away generally recognizes six weeks to to form new habits so there's a lot at the end of the tunnel it's not that long just um uh you know just just do your best to stay away from it and for two weeks and then your and now it's just a habit and then you just form a new habit after a few more weeks you'll have all new habits and and you'll be you'll be good you won't have to worry about it again so uh good luck with that I'm sure you'll do I'm sure you'll do great absolutely relative thank you very much for the Super Chat lost another 10 pounds hey that's great total 60 pounds of seven months fantastic uh but it's uh so much harder for me to eat more than 1200 kilocalories per day my kilocalorie expenditure is between 800 1800 and 2600 kilocalorie per day per fit pit as per the Fitbit is this normal should I eat more well normally uh people say that if you eat less than a certain amount if you're trying intentionally to eat less than a certain amount or if you are eating less than your body wants to a certain extent it will be hard to lose weight and you can harm yourself so I've heard different bariatric surgeons say that that they tell their patients they have to eat at least 1200 calories a day or they will not lose weight even though it's difficult to eat that much they have to try um and uh so and and it can cause heart problem from there but if you're eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you're trying to do that at least once a day sometimes twice a day just to see and that's how much your body wants how much your body wants but make sure it's not just why I feel satisfied right make sure it stops tasting good that there's a difference so you keep eating me if that if you take a bite and go like yeah that tastes Pleasant keep eating right you finish the steak and go like yeah that was nice make another one and keep eating until you take a bite that goes didn't really enjoy that I don't really want to take another bite that's when you know you're done and so if that's 1200 kilocalories it's a 1200 kilocalories it doesn't matter it's whatever your body is telling you to do and as long as you're listening to that I think you'll be fine most people will be fine doing that especially if you have a lot of weight to lose your body's going to prioritize using that if you're giving yourself enough nutrients and your body says okay we don't need to store this we don't need to save this for a rainy day we're good now so yeah just keep doing that and just make sure you're eating enough and you'll be fine Rachel guard thank you very much for the Super Chat hey Dr chafee um you should interview at hang G and G or maybe at Hanging hanging with the Browns probably they have an awesome story okay cool I'll I will take a look at that [Music] great thank you for the suggestion I'll take a look puppy love and unicorn thank you for the Super Chat just wanted to say thank you for all the information my name is Travis I'm 48. been on a strict rib eye and lamb regimen for uh 70 days and down 40 pounds awesome I'm now hitting the gym and feel like I'm in my 20s that's great yeah and I I do as well I have crazy stamina in the gym I feel amazing when I go actually you know I go in there like like last night I wasn't I almost didn't go because it was just late and I'd been not getting enough sleep last few nights and I was like no I'm just gonna do it not making no excuses and uh just went in there and at first I was just dragging just didn't feel great but then when I started going I started feeling better and better and actually I didn't want to leave at the end um but it was late so I had to go but so that's uh so that's great and and 40 pounds in 70 days is fantastic uh just so you know you start lifting weights you start working out you're going to start building muscle and that's going to offset the fat that you're losing on the scale so you're going to still lose weight you're gonna still start you're gonna still lose fat but you're going to put on muscle so it may not be that you're losing weight quite as fast or maybe you start putting on weight or stay the same I certainly experience that same thing and a lot of guys who start working out and lifting weights regularly experience that same thing so just be mindful of that that you know and just go by your appearance how your clothes are fitting how you feel uh first and foremost so yeah great great job good to hear that Jennifer Skinner thank you for the Super Chat can I please be a moderator or or can you think about um getting a couple some people have no shame uh but you need some yeah well you know sure I don't know how to do that I have no idea how to do that actually but I'll I'll see if people can uh can do that um yes there's Jennifer again uh can I be a moderator or at least get a couple for you some people have no shame you need moderators for sure yeah um I'll I'll I will think about that um and see what I can do um uh sure um yeah I guess I don't know if have people been a bit obnoxious in in the chat I'm not I you know because I'm sort of skimming through looking for questions so I don't I don't know all but there are a lot of chats there are a lot of people um yeah potentially saying all sorts of garbage so that's so God knows um I should be able to to figure out how to do moderators I'll take a look okay um Bernie love your lives thank you for the Super Chat well thank you very much Bernie I appreciate that and snipe Force thank you for the Super Chat can carnivore help with old people smell I've seen something on Google about um uh nonal and uh and it being related to omega-7 oxidation when we get older known and all uh don't know I've never heard of that um there I mean there can be a certain smell you know sometimes you have a certain smell about when people are are old and sick very unwell and it's sort of a particular smell that you get in the hospital when people are particularly unwell and um and so sometimes you notice that so I don't I don't know exactly what that is but I've definitely noticed that and you know it's interesting because animals and cats and dogs and things like that when they have them at at like uh a a nursing home or something like that um there's you know there's weird stories about you know like a dog or a cat that will just stick by someone and just stay with them and there's like a cat that will go and just stay with someone just lay with them and just Comfort them and be with them um and then they you know they die shortly after that and it's just like so the cat sort of could tell that there was something going on there and that they wanted to be with them and comfort them or maybe that's something that death smell attracted them I don't know if God knows but it um there have been stories about that you know where animals sort of go and and uh consent something probably through smell and dogs have been trained to smell different tumors and things like that which is pretty wild I don't know how accurate that is but you know I've heard things like that so um I I don't I don't know about the old person's spell thing but it can definitely make you healthier and um and that's a good thing too and so hopefully that helps any of the unhealthy not doing too well smells that uh that that maybe can get there and fix that sort of thing as well um hopefully and then Paolo Souza thank you very much for the Super Chat there's not a question there but maybe maybe I can see if there's one down here my God there's a lot of these things Jesus all right maybe I do need a moderator there's a lot of weird ass things Jesus Christ all right well maybe that guy just needs to be yeah why don't we just let me just I saw one person doing some stupid so I just uh blocked his ass what is wrong with these people um is this quick one right here Murray Nathan question bacon versus ground pork do they provide equal nutrition uh probably pretty similar um depends on the fat content and with that description you know depends on how the pigs were raised if they're feeding them a bunch of soy and corn and things like that they're going to have higher levels of linoleic acid which are great bacon just is pork it's just fatty pork um and depending on how you make that it um can be better or worse for you if they add sugar and and different sorts of ingredients and artificial ingredients and things like that it's not uh it's not great um so but yeah basically if it's coming from the same Pig it's still Pig it's just the same as as you know brisket and steak or ground beef from the same cow it's going to have the same nutritional value given similar portions of of um of uh similar portions of fat and and lean so yeah that should be fine dude there are some weird bloody things on here um Jesus Christ I know that guy's gotta go too gee it wasn't wrong with people some lunatics um that's screaming out for mods okay I'll I'll find some mods for some mods maybe I can see if there's um some of the people on like my patreon and things like that that want to be moderators thank you let's see Jesus Christ come on where are we going here sorry I'm just we're there are a lot of comments so I'm just trying to work my way through these things um what is wrong what is going on here Jesus Christ all right Jesus sage mother oh my good God okay guys okay let's let's find that lady who wanted to be a moderator and make her a moderator and the little boy oh hey buddy there's Paulo that's good it's a good start I think she was just above that [Music] um there's the old people smell one [Music] hey little guy okay [Music] so can I be a moderator I don't know how to make you a moderator let me see maybe I can do it on YouTube um oh little boy come here all right sorry if people have questions talk about yourselves things like that and I will try and find how the hell to make someone a moderator [Music] come on what's going on here come on why won't it bloody well um fine beef it to be fit you can be uh you can be a moderator and then I have to find this other person there you go your moderator please don't uh oh Jesus what is with these people um Jesus God oh my what is wrong with these people Sam absolutely ridiculous things um okay so Jesus all right all right I'm going to try to find Paul salzos let me see um okay so I found Paul salza's one I can't put it up but I found it here on the other chat so I'm 78 good shape but decide to try the carnivore diet now for one week and feeling good great my concern is what impact all the meat and fat will have on gout as I have them from time to time so um when people have well we've been treating gout as a as a medical establishment since the 1800s with a pure red meat and water diet so I think you'll be fine when you get rid of all the sugar and fructose and alcohol and things like that you generally won't get gout maybe you might have a flare-up or two um uh you know early on but that will go away and and then they'll stay away so I don't I don't think that that's going to be a problem for you but just see how you go you probably won't have a flare-up if you do it will go away and uh it they generally don't really come back after one or two one or two goes and then you're and then you're good um let's see here as well and I want how do I get Jennifer Skinner it's not letting me put you in as a moderator because for some reason it doesn't let me put on moderators that didn't give super chats for some stupid reason so Jennifer maybe send another chat and I'll make you a moderator too uh where are you see um there okay see if there's Jennifer has any any other Jennifer Skinner why won't it let me I'd use a moderator that's weird okay I don't know what the hell is going on here Briar Rose why I have to do it on I have to do it on YouTube that's why oh this is annoying foreign what is wrong with these people [Music] a lot of things wrong with these people I think everyone yeah so thank you for pointing out this this nonsense nonsense um Nazis right um okay all right so people saying that that's got it for now let's see where the hell is everyone else um let me try and find some people I know here Jennifer Skinner I'm still here there you go and now you're a moderator great and if um Rachel Marion can I be your moderator too um let's see oh come on who else um all right I'll have to figure this out [Music] who else is going on here all right well maybe that's enough for now are they still doing it I've blocked a number of these idiots so hopefully that's good um okay I don't know I think that's enough all right so we've got a couple moderators um and and we got these the idiots out of there so that's good and uh yeah and if you're saying be careful you pick as moderate yeah I'm yeah I'm I'm with you on that that's um that's that's why I never sort of picked moderators but uh uh either way we'll start with those two and uh at least I can I can keep track of that and um and uh you know and that'll be fine and then maybe some people that from my I'll ask my my patreon members if they uh would like to moderate and things like that because um that uh that sort of easier because I have more contact with them and and I know them so okay all right well um let's see I think I got a couple more Super chats here towards the end um uh I'll just go through these and then and then we'll wrap up so thanks weird little pick up there thank you everyone for being patient um but uh you know yeah that's uh that was a bit weird there were people saying some pretty obnoxious stuff and I don't always see that so thank you all for keeping an eye out absolutely relative thank you for the Super Chat thank you for your answer just to confirm I should continue reading even I'm assuming eating even if I'm no longer hungry if the meat continues to taste good yes so that's the thing your your hunger signals and Tate and are going to be different so you're not going to feel hungry like you have before and so I think that if it tastes good or tasted bad that's a better indicator of whether you're hungry or not so a fatty meat tastes good that's your body telling you yes you are hungry keep eating this even though you don't feel traditionally hungry like you normally do so just keep eating until it stops tasting good and I think that's the best way to do it because you can definitely under eat on a Carnival diet because you just don't feel hungry just don't feel hungry like you normally do and so I did this you know when I was doing this 20 something years ago I was definitely under eating and I was I was needing for days at a time and I was just like I'm not I'm starting to lose energy I'm starting to not feel as good I'm starting to feel worse for having worked out as opposed to better so I was like okay something's wrong I must be because I'm just not eating a lot but I'm I'm just not hungry what the hell is going on so I figured I just okay I just have to eat I'm just gonna eat every day no matter what you know because this is just something weird is going on I didn't know what it was now I know and so you just you just need to eat and so eat keep eating until fatty meat stops tasting good and that's how you know and you'll relearn your hunger signals and you just sort of think about it says is this what hunger feels like is this what's the title what does this feel like try eating meat if it tastes good you're hungry keep eating it until it stops tasting good and if it doesn't taste good you know no you're not hungry you don't need to keep eating and and just go go buy that uh Lin sixth Lee uh thank you for the Super Chat not seeing any question though um so maybe there's one further down um Matt have uh Diamond thank you for the Super Chat back in 2021 I had chest pain and left hand pain got better in five minutes okay went to the doctor after three months and Echo and ECG came uh back all right uh was that heart or stress oh it's hard to say you know if you don't catch those things at the time you know it's not really it's not easy to tell exactly what it is I mean certainly people can get chest pain specific chest pain uh cardiac related feels like there's like a weight or pressure someone's sitting on your chest or like an elephant sitting on your chest like oh that doesn't feel good and then you can have radiating pain down your left arm but not not everyone does get that radiating pain or maybe the side of their neck or their jaw they can get that radiating pain but not always and so it can be atypical and in women they're more likely to have atypical ones that don't have any of those sort of classic symptoms but even in men not everyone does as well so it's different for different people um but I mean the good thing is is that if your Echo and your ECG were fine there wasn't any signs of damage then even if that was cardiac related it seems like it didn't do any permanent harm which is which is the important thing so it's hard to tell if that was cardiac related previously but good news is your heart's working good now and that there isn't a sign of of an old heart attack which sometimes you can see um and so that's that's the good news anyway is it is that your heart's working well now mod me okay yes uh awesome so uh beef is fifth yeah so I already gave up super mod great job thanks for stuffing those people down um Samson thanks for the Super Chat hi doc my muscles get fatigued and burning uh feeling easily on Carnivore diet after one and a half months and was even worse on keto diet starting seven years ago first time I did it was two and a half years ago second time eight months why is that um oh that's interesting um well I mean there's not necessarily much reason apart from you know potentially you know not being quite keto adapted yet but if you did it for two and a half years you know or even eight months should definitely be keto adapt after that point your body would be making enough uh energy and be able to make enough ATP um aerobically and anaerobically and so you shouldn't you know necessarily be building up an untoward amount of lactic acid and burn so um you know I mean I I don't get burned out or pain or anything like that I haven't heard of other people getting that as well um so I don't know if it's you know is it just that you're working harder and able to work harder and able to push yourself harder and that's causing more intensive a burn I don't know is it that you're doing the same amount of reps but with carbohydrates you can do more reps of the same weight and the same intensity without getting as much of a burn um I don't know so I would play around with that anyway you know if it's if it's that you can just push yourself harder and work harder then that's great if it's one and a half months and then it clears up later then it's probably that that keto adaption that fat adaption but you know two and a half years if you're doing that then you know that that's a bit odd um but yeah I would just keep going with it and uh and hopefully it sort of resolves on its own if you're doing keto and you're eating other things apart from just meat then you know God knows what those things were doing with you um if you're eating any artificial sweeteners I would definitely get rid of those because those can can screw up your energy Dynamics as well um and yeah I haven't really heard that before I certainly haven't heard people getting more easily fatigued and more of a burn on a carnivore diet I certainly haven't experienced that so may play around with what you're eating eat you know try to eat make sure you're getting enough food and things like that you're not under eating and getting fatigued in that way or and you're getting enough water as well sometimes your water demands increase and you're just your fluid balances change on uh keto carnivore diet so electrolytes might be beneficial as well to help retain in some water most people don't need it especially after a month and a half but just see how you go and you can play around with those sorts of things and try playing with your hydration how much you're eating don't eat before you work out only after you work out make sure you're getting a lot of water and play with the electrolytes see if that helps at all and if you're drinking coffee stop just gonna make me mod um um okay I might be able to do that but we'll see um these thank you very much for the Super Chat this will be uh the last one everyone and uh and then I'll have to to bounce off to some other meetings thank you thank you all very much but so these says I am type 2 diabetic and saw glucose Spike after eating a big steak I understand this is a gluconeogenesis should I eat less red meat and increase fat um well yeah so look if you're if you're you should you want to be eating a lot of fat anyway you know generally gluconeogenesis is is demand driven as opposed to substrate driven you're going to get a bit of a bump in your blood sugar or in your insulin but it's it's going to be small it's going to be transient and that's okay you know that it doesn't really matter one way or the other as long as you're eating what's physiological because if you're eating what your body's designed to eat then it's doing what it's designed to do so if you go out of ketosis and then back in fine if you're staining ketosis all the time fine if you've never gone in ketosis and you're just eating meat I don't care I have no idea what my ketones are I have no idea what my blood sugar is because I'm going on first principles that this is what my body's designed to do this is what our species is designed to do we're designed to eat meat and that's a fact we've been eating meat for millions of years and so that's what we're biologically adapted and designed to do and so whether we're you know designed through nature or designed through God and whatever we are designed to eat meat and so if we eat meat and and nothing else then we're going to work the way we're supposed to work and so if that means your blood sugar goes up a bit and your insulin goes up a bit fine you know if your type 2 diabetic and you're still very insulin resistant you're you're going to see bigger spikes just because your body doesn't doesn't control these things as well as others but eventually that'll calm down and you'll get back to where other people would be without diabetes and so um you know eat a lot of fat definitely a lot of fat like rib eye level of fat or maybe even a little bit more you want to get a gram to two grams of fat per one gram of protein and so that uh that's a lot of fat that's a lot more fat than most people think um they should they should eat or ever have eaten before so just uh just um you know just just uh don't worry about that if you're on medication for your diabetes continue on your medication for diabetes work with your doctor to come off of that when and as you can because you will have less and less demand for that and your body will reverse its insulin resistance and its demand for so much insulin and so much and the blood sugar spikes and uh will start leveling off and but yeah definitely eat a lot of fat fatty meat and and then after that just let your body get on with it you know if you're if your blood sugar goes up a bit so be it I had no idea you know I got a constant glucose monitor from uh Dr Casey means she has a company called levels and I just did an interview with her very interesting um interview that people uh that will be coming out in the next couple weeks and um and so she sent me uh one of these constant glucose monitors and I'll be interested just to see sort of what happens but it's purely academic for me you know it's just like I eat a steak and that's what happens interesting that's what happens when you eat a steak great and this is what it is when I'm not eating steak lovely that's interesting or when I work out it's it's purely academic to me because I'm I'm convinced that I'm doing what my body's designed to do and so if I do what my body's designed to do it's going to do what it's designed to do and if that means it go my blood sugar goes up and my ketones go down and and then the reverse happens in other situations fine that's interesting but it's not going to change anything that I do so you know I mean yeah you know you can see about how you're feeling what you're doing and when you're eating and you know but I've sort of figured that out anyway on just how I feel I don't feel as good if I eat during the day because I get tired I get lethargic I don't have energy is that going to correspond with differences in my ketones and blood sugar quite possibly but I already know that I don't feel great now maybe I could track that and say oh when when my ketones are like this my blood sugar is like that I feel better what did I do to get here and then sort of reverse engineer it but at least for me I've sort of already figured out when I feel good and and how I can do it and uh and that's then those are the sort of things I suggest to other people that they try to figure out as well so for me it's it's just it's interesting but you know I'm eating what I'm supposed to eat my body's gonna work the way it's supposed to work and that's that's really all I'm concerned about uh madav uh does erythritol make one anxious I feel so uh potentially you know I don't know if we have any studies on that but Richard told is just a weird chemical that's not supposed to be in your body it's not something we're adapted to it's not something we've been uh uh developing with and and it's not something we've been exposed to for thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of years so it's not something you want to put in your body anything that didn't exist 50 000 years ago in the last ice age in the ice not something you want to put in your body for Optimal Health that's my opinion anyway okay all right everyone thank you so much uh everyone for for uh coming to the chat sorry for the weirdness thank you for the people that uh stepped up and helped out with with uh the
