    "body": "hi Dr chaffy a significant association between low or lowered cholesterol levels and violence is found across many types of studies why do you think that's the case love the carnivores then appreciate what you do yeah I've I've seen that as well um and depression and mental health issues as well I think that's exactly it your brain is made out of cholesterol your body's made out of cholesterol your hormones are made out of cholesterol you are unhealthy if you don't have enough cholesterol that is just a fact and that's a fact that the drug companies and you know and the sugar iies have been trying to hide from you for the last 60 70 years but it's true and so it's this this is not something that you want to play with and so I think that's why you're just unhealthy your brain's not working properly you don't have the physical structures that that that can help you properly you're also doing other things that um to low you know you're doing things uh that lower your your cholesterol or eating a certain way that lowers your cholesterol that's also going to cause other problems you you're eating low fat you know high carb diets and your body doesn't work properly your brain doesn't work properly you you're not eating enough meat and your your brain doesn't work properly there's that that study out of Oxford in 2008 where they found that after five years uh vegan brains it shrink by over 5% right so you're not getting enough B12 you're not getting enough uh of these other things as well your brain shrinking your your axons are melinated with cholesterol so if you don't have enough cholesterol your brain doesn't work properly your body doesn't work properly hormones aren't able as abundant you can't make them you're going to have uh a lot of problems in fact you know that might just be one of the things right there you know people say it's like oh when someone's their testosterone is super high you know they get Roid Rage and yeah that's possible to freak out if you're if you're just completely off the charts on your hormones but if you're off the charts on the other direction if your testosterone is too low you also get really agitated and really aggressive and really angry and you're really sharp and you like snap at people and so I've spoken to so many doctors that deal with the sort of hormonal side of things and they have men that have low testosterone and they say that you know they're you know you put them on some testosterone you just bump that up into more youthful numbers and and their wives come in with them next time and go thank you he's so much nicer now you know and so you know that could be part of it as well if you don't have enough cholesterol you don't have enough testosterone testosterone is made from cholester olol and so if you don't have enough cholesterol you're not making enough testosterone if you're getting a bunch of plant oils they have plant sterols that's plant cholesterol and that lowers our cholesterol because our brain our body thinks we don't need as much cholesterol and so you don't make as much you can't make hormones out of plant sterols so you're not going to make hormones properly and you're going to have low testosterone and you're going to be grumpy and you're going to be uh grouchy and angry and all that sort of stuff and obviously that can lead to violence bance as well although it doesn't always but uh yeah I think that those are some some significant reasons why that could be 56y old male with no weight issues I have been carnivore for 100 days my cholesterol is LDL 241 HDL 43 drct wants to put me on a Statin says I'm high risk but are you though uh you know cholesterol just doesn't is isn't the cause of heart disease it just isn't that was a scapegoat invented by the sugar company so I have a uh video on uh YouTube just called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease and that goes into that um and Dr Paul Mason has a lot of videos on that um on cholesterol and heart disease and the real causes of heart disease there's a book by Dr Malcolm Kendrick um called the clot thickens it's all about that as well how this is nothing to do with cholesterol um and uh and many many many others that you know cardiologists and Interventional cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons and PhD researchers and professors of everything you can imagine all saying this is complete and utter crap and so uh you know check out that video just the the truth about cholesterol and heart disease there's also a book uh by cardiologist named Dr Aseem Malhotra called a statin-free life and he goes through the data and the literature you know it's it's not all it's cracked up to be unfortunately uh we have just been inundated with this false information and false sense of Hope from the Staten companies and what's happened you know we're reducing cholesterol reducing meat reducing saturated fat we've done all these things and putting people on statins getting them on younger and younger and younger and heart attacks are going up heart disease is going up right and around the world um this is this is the case and and deaths from heart attack around the world are going up out of proportion with the growth in in population so you know the the the deaths and rates of heart disease are going up around the world faster than the population is growing so you know it's um it's just not what it's been we've been told it was the sugar companies made this up they made it up and they paid off a bunch of unscrupulous professors and doctors such as um anel keys and bunch of guys from Harvard who then went on to very you know be head of the AHA and head of the USDA and they start pumping this out the aha I mean it's just a just a mafia sort of organization they they are just I mean were just sellouts I mean they sold out immediately I mean they didn't even wait around you know they uh you know as soon as they got on on the scene they were just like yep who has money let's do it and so the sugar companies bought them out you know they lied about the Framingham study that you know said that the Framingham study showed that higher cholesterol um uh related to or was associated with because epidemiology so it's just Association was associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease mortality and um and in fact the Framingham study showed the opposite it showed that lower levels of total cholesterol uh related was associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease mortality so they lied they were paid to lie that's in the literature that's public data and uh then the American Heart Association was paid off by Proctor and Gamble because Proctor and gam well Crisco was invented by the Germans in 1911 um as a as as mechanical lubricant for their ubro right so they were using they're using submarine lubricant they're using tank lubricants in their in World War I and then Proctor and Gamble bought this from them and they uh then went on to pay U pay off the American Heart Association $20 million in today's valuation to lie and say it was better for your heart than animal fat such as butter and Lord so I mean they're just they're just a bunch of sellouts you know and and they didn't even sell out for much I mean I gu 20 million but a lot of these professors they they did it for like six grand you know it's equivalent of of $55,000 today they got $6,500 back then it's nothing you know they they just they sold out real cheap so your health means not much to them your health is worth about 55 grand to them that's that's what they'll sell your health for um and the health of the world so uh just just you know don't buy into these people it's um it's pretty bad and then you can look at that you can look at the work of Dave Feldman Nick norwitz I had Nick norwitz on my podcast and we talked about the research they're doing just showing that this is crap uh this is not this is not actually something that um is is causing disease and in fact it the treatment is causing harm as well so I would look into those resources before you consider taking any new medications when you're in ketosis more often than not then you're going through autophagy and your body is turning over the mitochondria stimulating more mitochondri you go through mitophagy and mitogenesis so you're turning these things over so they're newer faster better and you have more of them and so they work better so your brain works better and you're also getting rid of all these plant toxins which cause a lot of neuroinflammation and damage and stop your brain from working properly",
