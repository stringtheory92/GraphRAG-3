    "transcript": "eating a lot of fatty meat eating a lot of U you know carnivore sort of things actually can help with addiction this has been shown in clinical trials with alcoholism that coming off of alcohol when they were they needed to do this with with you know in a hospital setting because there were potential for them to get seizures and and DTS that they found that the group that was on a ketogenic diet at the time felt better it was easier for them to come off it was either easier for them to stay off and they needed less medications to stop seizures so that's an objective Improvement right should I be limiting the amount of bone marrow I eat uh like liver or is it less problematic in terms of frequency and amount I find that I enjoy it's a question from Vince thank you very much for the Super Chat Vince 31-year-old male have always been more cold than average males throughout adulthood I get really cold especially in the limbs on keto for two years and now carnivore for 56 days gets better after eating how to fix this tried iodine even worse not sure well well it's not necessarily an iodine issue but you could have a thyroid issue that's not necessarily uh the cause but I mean it is one of the symptoms when you have have thyroid dysfunction either low or high thyroid you can get either cold and sensitive or hot and sensitive you can get different sorts of temperature and sensitivities depending on which direction it goes so uh it might be worth checking out uh check your TSH your free T4 and your freet T3 um at the very least and get those checked out if you want to go deeper in you can check your reverse T3 which is sort of there there's a lot of layers of complexity to testing the thyroid a lot of doctors will just stop at the TSH but that's not always good enough because you have t you have t0 T1 T2 T3 and T4 often if your T4 is high enough your TSH will be in a normal range but some people don't convert T4 into T3 which is really the active form of thyroid hormone and so um you can have issues with that or you get down to the reverse T3 that um is showing how active um biologically active that that thyroid hormone is in the cells that's where they work right so even if you have enough serum thyroid hormone it may not be enough to get the um the action in the cells that you need but your TSH might be normal your T3 might be normal your T4 might be normal um so uh sort of levels of complexity so if you feel that you're having symptoms you know do see your doctor and because you know cold and sensitivity you know is is you know One symptom that that could be at play but there are many more that would um that would that could tip you off to a thyroid dysfunction then you just check the thyroid um also the reference ranges for these things are not great because the reference ranges are from the lab and the lab is just looking at the average for the community most people in the community are metabolically unwell or and or overweight and so you know you can't you can't really trust that that's not something to go by you're not trying to compare yourself to the average person because the average person is sick it used to be the average person was well and healthy now that is not the case so it's not it's not reliable it's not a good good metric so um TSH generally want it lower than um than their upper range for most reference ranges but you can talk to a doctor that understands that and uh and see where you fall in that and um and then check the other sort of thyroid things as well so the other thing you need to consider is that if you do have thyroid dysfunction such as and and depending on what it's it's going to be caused by something and so if it's caused by say Hashimoto's disease taking iodine can exacerbate Hashimoto disease so you need you need to know and you need to know if you even have an iodine deficient because you may not so I don't I don't think it's a good idea to blindly take supplements I think it's important to test um it's best to get your nutrition from your diet but if for some reason you know the food that we're eating is you know food we're not eating you know uh wild CAU woolly mammoths and things like that anymore so the the food that we're eating isn't as healthy as it used to be and because the ground soil isn't as healthy as it used to be and so the animals aren't eating gr that's as or or you know foliage that's as healthy as it used to be and so they don't necessarily have all the nutrients especially if if they're not wild so it's um it's important to check your your numbers and if your iodine is perfectly fine well then you don't need to take iodine right iodine is generally pretty safe to supplement with however if you have Hashimoto's disease it's not and that can actually make things a lot worse so you want to check those things if your thyroid is a bit off check your thyroid uh antibodies for Hashimoto if you have any then that means you have it you know they say well well if it's below this range it's okay no it's not um if you have antibodies towards your body then you have an autoimmune disease it may be subtle at the moment it may not be very active but it's there and so you need to be aware of that and so if you have any antibodies towards Hashimoto then you have Hashimoto's thyroiditis and taking iodine is a bad idea so that's what I would do just check your thyroid check your iodine and check your levels and uh and then you know adjust as needed you may not need to take iodine if if you're getting more symptomatic with iodine you almost certainly don't need to take iodine okay super chat from sephar Roth Cloud say thanks you so much for the Super Chat cooked meat Max time out of fridge if I cook it again um I don't know if you need to cook it again maybe like reheat it or something like that uh might be a good idea it well it look it depends you know I mean if if you're in in a household U and you've got flies and things like that you I mean you don't want to leave it out uncovered you know flies are going to get on there they're going to lay eggs and you're going to get maggots and things like that it's just you don't want that um I've left Cooks meat out for you know a while um I I don't you know have flies in my house and um generally and so you know sometimes i' I'd cook a brisket leave it on the counter and just just cut off slabs as I go and I might eat that over a week completely unrefrigerated you know there's a bit of a risk you know uh with if if things are getting on it and introducing bacteria but sort of the way I think about it is um you've just you've just sterilized this thing I mean I've cooked that brisket longer and at a higher temperature um or longer and and you know at a at a similar temperature than we than we do when we autoclaving you know surgical equipment you we sterilizing those things so um things should be sterile you know when it comes out and you know if you in you're going to be introducing bacteria and there's going to be bacteria in the environment so that's going to get on there so you need to you need to be um you know aware of that and you need to pay attention you know because you don't want to get contamination you don't want to get food poisoning you don't want to get bacteria in there and if you see visible signs of that or is just smell or something like that then obviously you need to not eat that um it can be more subtle than that and you may not even notice it so that that's the thing I do that because I'm you know I found that's okay but you know other people could run into trouble so it is a good idea to refrigerate these things you know leaving it out for a few hours or even overnight as long as things aren't you know touching it and fiddling with it and you AR flies on it it's probably okay but you know use use your judgment on that uh shot gunet thank you so much for the Super Chat I went to 130 lb at 5'6 and am now uh insatiable cannot eat enough and not be anxious cannot eat enough to not be anxious sorry um but I'm also gaining weight carnivore plus ferments uh what to do well I'm assuming that you're gaining weight and you don't want to gain weight it would matter what kind of weight that you're gaining are you gain muscle are you putting on fat um that's very important and so just because you're gaining weight doesn't mean that you're necessarily putting on bad weight right so um you know you can get a body fat calculator you can get a dexa scan you can do a body composition scan you can sort of see what's going on because if you're putting on bone density and muscle mass well that's a good thing and and so how much you weigh on the scale isn't necessarily um a problem insatiability that could be from a couple things maybe you know sometimes it's when when people are underweight in the sense that their body wants them heavier than they are they want more uh lean body mass maybe even a bit more body fat to put on depends on where you're coming from if you were a bit underweight then your body's going to want to naturally do that um and you're going to be a lot hungrier especially if you haven't been eating enough or haven't been getting enough nutrients for a long time um and so you know you want to um you know you want to you want to you know make sure that well you want you just want to see I mean your body sometimes will want to put on a bit of fat it's going to want to put on a bit a bit more tissue um and so you can be very hungry because of that and your body's just stacking up nutrients I think there's another comment down here saying most definitely it's definitely fat just a little bit I'm getting extra fat in the form of butter but losing my hourglass a bit um okay so so another thing it looks like you're getting a bit of fat uh on the butter but from the butter but also you know when people eat uh you know a lot of protein in comparison to the amount of grams of fat that they're getting you can get you can get quite Insatiable from that something called rabbit starvation where people were eating rabbits that had almost no fat on them and they couldn't just stop eating they couldn't satisfy their hunger they're eating more and more and more and more more and then eventually they died you know their your body chases nutrients it doesn't Chase calories and so fat is an essential nutrient it has essential fatty acids that you have to have you can't get it from any other source and you don't really make them very well yourself you have to have them and then there are essential um vitamins minerals that only come in the fat as well fat soluble vitamins right so these things only come in animal fat they don't come in you know plant oil certainly and we don't make them and so that's how you have to get them and so your body is looking is chasing nutrients and so sometimes when people gain weight um it can be a problem with with that that um or especially when they're in you know just ravenously hungry um the other thing you know is f ferments that you're eating um Al you're saying you're eating meat and you're eating ferments are you eating anything else any sort of artificial sweeteners any Stevia monk fruit sugar anything like that um dairy dairy can be a big weight loss stall for people or they can put on weight um if you're having fermented yogurt I would most definitely just keep it to like a small Spoonful on one pieza of meat and you chew it up you chew it together you swall hole and that's it you're not eating a whole bucket of yogurt right you're just a little bit every day and in fact I don't do that often it's it only be like if I were you know if I needed antibiotics or something like that you know you know the once or twice that's that's happened or something like that in the last decade you know so I would take I would do that um but once you've established your microbiome you don't need to keep receding it it just maintains because it's it's eating what you're eating and if you're eating the right thing you're going to maintain the right bacteria and so you know you don't need to do that um it may be that you're eating you know a lot of different fermented plants and things like that again if you're going to do that I would keep it to a bare minimum just a little tiny bit with a bite of meat chew it up together and take that down sort of as as a supplement to your microbiome and again you don't have to keep I don't think you have to keep doing that your whole life and um you know for the simple fact that the Inuit don't and they're just eating meat and they have extremely healthy microbiomes so presumably once you have an established microbiome uh that's that's favorable eating meat will just perpetuate that um it may be that you don't have a favorable microbiome and so you need the fermentated um food products animal or vegetable to to get you there but I think once you have it there I I think it's okay um so that's what I would do I would I would make sure you're getting enough fat at least one gram of fat per one gram of protein if not up to two grams of fat to one gram of protein F fat is very satiating as well and and sometimes people gain weight or they don't lose weight properly because they're not eating enough fat you're adding in butter uh which is good but that may not be enough uh see how you go um make sure you're only eating fatty meat and water ferments keep them to a minimum and I I don't think you necessarily need to do it forever and then just cut out absolutely everything else and you know and also remember that um that our body wants to put on a bit of weight possibly you know if we're if our body feels that we're a bit underweight you know saying that you're losing your sort of hourglass figure you know I I understand that is a bit concerning um so it could be that there are some of these other things maybe you know dairy or uh not eating enough fat is actually what's the problem here as opposed to your body just wants you to be a bit more uh have carry a bit more weight so I I would try these sorts of things and and that's that's what we do we just troubleshoot things you just go down the list of probabilities and you just try to refine these things down you know if you're doing anything else except fatty meat and water stop and uh and make sure you're eating enough make sure you're eating enough fat those are all very important and you just go down the list and if there's still a problem then we we take a look at it sometimes people just need to heal and their body takes a bit of an adjustment sort of goes up and goes down it goes up and it goes down and then it stabilizes so see how you go a super chat from Jack Coleman thank you very much uh for that doesn't look like it's a question attached but possibly down the road um cheesy chunky same thing thank you very much for the super chat we'll see see if uh there's something down down the line um as well that's the thing too guys if if your question doesn't get through when you do a super chat please put that in just the normal chat and I'll try to grab it and find it and still answer it um okay so here's here's one from Jack Coleman thank you again for the for the Super Chat you don't need to do a second Super Chat guys just just put that in the comments um I mean obviously it's easier to see if it's a super chat but if it's you but we're going to try to F I have a a friend of M Melissa helping me with with this so you know trying to track those down um so you don't need to you don't need to you know do two super chats so Jack says been on Carnivore for five months um sometimes I go through uh periods of not eating um no for days or for a number of days maybe no appetite sometimes 3 to four days is this normal if so why so so look it's very normal to undereat it's very common to undereat on a carnivore diet because you're just not going to feel as hungry as as you used to so your your your hunger signals change dramatically on a on a carnivore diet or even a ketogenic diet um because you're getting rid of of sugar you're getting rid of carbs and that's going to lower your insulin insulin is a fat storage hormone so first of all that puts you in a fat uh fat storage metabolism as opposed to a fat burning metabolism but it also slows down your metabolism and it also blocks a hormone called leptin which is a satiety hormone so you're blocking your satiety hormone so you don't get satiated as much you overeat and it's more complex than that but I I talk about this in a lot of videos so I won't get get into that here but um suffice it to say that that it uh it changes your satiety signal so normally when you're eating carbohydrates you're eating a bunch of plants it can mimic insulin these different lectins can bind onto the insulin receptors five times more tightly than insulin does also block leptin um this makes it so you don't get satiated your body thinks you're starving all the time and so you're just it's just telling you eat eat eat eat eat and there's way you eat you know 4,000 calories and your pancakes and syrup in the morning and you know by lunchtime you're like oh my God I'm starving why are you starving you're not starving of course you're not starving you have plenty of energy in you um even very slender people have weeks of energy available to them uh even if they didn't need at all um even before they started you know catabolizing their their muscle tissue so we you know that's that you're not starving and so that signal that oh my God I'm starving is wrong okay that's a that's a pathological signal that you're getting because you've deranged your hormones and you've deranged your body's natural signals um so you overeat and so now you get rid of that you get rid of the carbs you get rid of the insulin you lower down the insulin down to normal levels and what do you know you're not hungry anymore because we associate that starvation signal with Hunger that's just how that's normal hunger because that's always been normal for us it's not normal it's it's not it's absolutely not normal so you need to relearn your hunger signals they're going to be much more subtle and so you need to think well I'm a little tired a little this or little that and you're like okay does that mean I'm hungry or I'm getting car you're getting carb Cravings or sugar Cravings you have to think to yourself okay does this mean I'm hungry try eating meat if it tastes good yes you are go by taste so if fatty meat tastes good yes you are hungry keep eating until fatty meat stops tasting good because that's when you know your body doesn't want it anymore because again your body chases nutrients doesn't Chase calories we have receptors in our stomach that track up to our brain that actually look for nutrients and so this is why that that idea that started back in the 80s it said you know if you want to lose weight just eat a whole bunch of vegetables high fiber vegetables because you know they don't have um you know they they don't have any nutrition they don't have very many calories and so but they have bulk and so they'll fill up your stomach they'll release leptin right so it releases from your stretch receptors in your stomach most of it's released from your fat stores but some is released from your stretch receptors and they say oh and your brain will get satiated because of the leptin right well that's not that never worked and so people eating a whole bunch of big salads and vegetables and this thing that and they're just starving all the time they're bloated and miserable and they G pain and they're hungry you know and so it's it's actually not useful because it doesn't the stretch receptor is only one part of a much bigger issue also you you stretch out your stomach you release some leptin but your insulin's up so it's blocking that it's blocking the rest of your leptin as well and your stomach is looking for actual nutrients which are not there and so your brain isn't stupid it's certainly not as stupid as those people that make that recommendation um and so you know you know it's um you know I mean they were saying this at the time you know they was like oh well you know just tricks your body into thinking um that that you've actually eaten and there's actual food there and um you trick your body into thinking that that that there's something there and and you know Silly body you know there there's no actual nutrients there's no actual calories there you didn't trick a thing you know our body's are much smarter than that and so uh that's the thing so you need to relearn your hunger signals uh yeah for is generally too much right I I look it's like the Mongols like gasan the Mongol horde I mean they would you know they would go five days you know ravaging the countryside without eating and and but then they'd eat 10 pounds of horse meat and then they go do it again right so so you know Predators apex predators certainly um big predators they're used to not getting um you know a big meal every single day so we're we're established for that biologically but you know you need to get a you need to get enough when you eat that's why you keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good right and so you know if you're only eating every few days um but you're doing that and you're eating enough fine you know worked for you know the the Mongol Empire which is the largest contiguous Empire that has ever existed on this planet so um you know and they were doing that for hundreds of years right um so it's not uh it's not a big deal to or it's not you know the end of the world if you're not eating more than once every three or four days if you are eating to you know your maximum capacity when you do eat right but most likely What's Happening Here is that you're not doing that and you're not getting enough and you're and you're just going by you're basing on your your hunger signals based on what you used to feel uh when you you would be hungry and uh that's very different so I did this when I first started doing stopped eating all plants and was only eating meat 23 years ago going on 24 years ago Jesus and and I I wasn't EA for three four days at a time and I was like this is weird but I just I'm just not hungry I'm just not hungry but it was affecting me because I got to the point where I just I'd run out of stores and um and the more I worked out the worse I felt it was really strange and so I was it's like okay what the hell is happening it must be I'm just not eating up because I'm not eating enough but I'm just not hungry it's like okay doesn't matter I need to eat you know and so you just eat so try eating once a day try eating fatty meat once a day if it tastes good you are hungry keep eating until it stops tasting good okay if you are going you're like that sounds awful a steak sounds awful a steak should never sound awful steak is amazing and so if a steak doesn't taste good you're not hungry it's okay don't eat even if that means you don't eat that day just wait the next day it's going to taste good okay uh I would I would doubt that you'll get to three four days of just like G I don't want it I don't want it I want it might happen um there's sometimes you get meat aversion food aversion during pregnancy um do my friend Dr kiltz U who's a fertility specialist OBGYN um in New York he um you know he sees this and he thinks that that's just the body telling you you know to fast um Dr f thinks the same thing so you know uh listen to your body but you need to know what your body is saying you need to relearn the signals so right now you don't know your body's signals so you're trying to listen to your body but you may not be getting the message so you need to relearn your hunger signals try eating once a day fatty meat if it tastes good keep eating until it doesn't taste good you'll relearn it'll it'll it'll make sense to your body after a while and um yeah good luck with that but yeah do try eating once a day if it doesn't taste good it doesn't taste good you don't have to eat it's fine put in the fridge it'll be there tomorrow it will taste better the next day trust me hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own questions please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest of the Q&A Ragnar uh odinson sick ass name that's great so um uh thank you for the super chat um any reports of winter green uh zyn nicotine pouches tricking the body into an insulin response been using them uh to get off Vape um I I don't know about an insulin response you know I mean it is generally considered that that nicotine helps suppress hunger signals um I don't know about the insulin response like if there's you know it's a flavored thing right so it's um you know if it's got artificial sweeteners and things like that um it could trigger insulin um there are mix reports on that in the literature but I've I've seen people that take artificial sweet nerves and and drinks and things like that and it absolutely screws with their blood sugar and um and so you know it's you know and in fact there's also you know in the literature um cases of reactive hypoglycemia meaning that you know you take in this artificial sweetener your body thinks you're getting sugar you kick out some insulin but there's no sugar there so blood sugar drops you can do that with sugar as well if your blood sugar goes up your insulin goes up but then insulin stays up and then the blood sugar goes down too low so that's called reactive hypoglycemia um I don't know spefic specifically about that but you know could potentially do that if it has a lot of sweeteners um because you just get that sweet taste in your mouth and then that goes to your brain go oh there's sugar coming down and that can trigger you your body to start making insulin doesn't necessarily always release it there's so much there's so much so much we don't know about the body we sort of glean information you know from various studies but there's a lot of conflicting information main thing is just you know see what happens to your body because that's what matters you know we use studies to make decisions in our own life and to to try to make a decision more confidently but it doesn't matter what the study says if you do that thing and you get a the opposite outcome that you were expecting or that the study told you you were going to get or or that you wanted to get don't do it right like it's just not it doesn't matter what the study says what matters is what happens in real life right I mean just I mean it's just so stupid I mean don't know that's what the study says oh I have a study that says if I shoot myself in the face with a shotgun nothing's going to happen I'll get candy you know okay well that's dumb you're dumb you know like because you can see with your own damn eyes that something else happens that you don't get candy that people are very hurt and die right so you know that's dumb it doesn't obviously there's no study that says that but you know it it we get that to that level of stupidity because you have oh there's a study that says that okay well when you do it in real life the exact opposite things oh but there's a stud who gives a right it's it doesn't matter right um studies are trying to glean information um describing real life but if it disagrees with real life then it's a bad study and there's something wrong with it right and so this is why I used often and and still you know tout the quote from uh the physicist Richard fan who said it doesn't matter how brilliant your theory is and it doesn't matter how smart you are if it doesn't agree with experiment it's wrong right so you know you have all these people that just just just are so beholden on studies and yes studies are great they can give you a lot of good information but they're just oh study study study and then you people go out in the real world they get the exact opposite or spont people say oh there's a study that says eating more meat is bad and yet you have millions of people around the world only eating meat and their health proves so it's dumb it's a dumb study and you're dumb for listening to it so uh it just matters what happens to your body so if you feel that you're getting some sort of insulin response if you feel that that's messing with your blood sugar if you feel that that's screwing with you in some way just cut it out you get nicotine patches they're not going to have any of that problem you'll still get the nicotine um also remember that getting off of nicotine um takes about two weeks generally the the chemical dependency takes about two weeks so it's it's rough at first but it gets a little better and you know every day gets a little better a little better a little better and then after two weeks the chemical dependency should be gone and then it's just the Habit you know you liked doing it you enjoyed that feeling and sensation it was calming it was relaxing you're stressed out and you that's your go-to takes about four to six weeks to retrain your body into new habits so you know there is a light at the end of the tunnel you can just sort of you know keep track of this okay two weeks okay I'm not dependent anymore and I'm well on the way to making new abits right then another couple weeks and then you have new habits so it's not as bad as all that you know it doesn't take 20 years before these Cravings go away it's it's weeks okay so at some point you know you can yeah you can wean yourself down wean yourself down and then wean yourself off you can do that um studies and addiction generally show that um cold turkey works best at some point you have to go to Cold Turkey right at some point you are going to stop right you're going to wean down to a level and then stop the withdrawals aren't as bad at that point fine but the withdrawals go away no matter what you know there are certain things that that are not safe to just come off if you are truly addicted like alcohol like um benzodiazapines you can get seizures you can die most other things don't fall into that category so just remember there is a light at the end of the tunnel you can just stop right now and you will likely have a have a miserable week or two and and then it'll be gone right eating a lot of fatty meat eating a lot of U you know carnivore sort of things actually can help with addiction this has been shown in clinical trials with alcoholism that coming off of alcohol when they were they needed to do this with with you know in a hospital setting because there were but you know there was the potential for them to get seizures and and DTS um that they found that the group that was on a ketogenic diet at the time um felt better it was easier for them to come on off it was either easier for them to stay off and they needed less medications to stop seizures right so that's an objective Improvement right so it's actually changing and improving the brain chemistry and so you know I don't know of any studies to do that with with nicotine but you know you're at least going to be giving yourself proper nutrition and your brain and your body are going to at least be optimized in that sense as well so you know at some point you just you know you can you can come off and that's the timeline there is a light at the end of the tunnel it's not as bad as all that if you can get yourself through that you should be good Single Barrel thank you very much for the Super Chat and just so you know guys I've got probably 45 minutes um left and then I got to go to work and uh but so we'll get through as many of these as we can uh single barrel uh thank you for the Super Chat should I be limiting the amount of bone marrow I eat uh like liver or is it less problematic in terms of frequency and them out I find that I enjoy uh no no I don't I don't think there's I don't know of any reason to limit bone marrow I think you should be fine on that um if someone does like if there's like certain fat soluble vitamins you know I mean the issue with vitamin or with issue with with liver you can get too much vitamin A you get too much copper most people are like deficient in Copper anyway so um it it's it's going to take a while before you you get up to a problem state but it happens um but not that I know I think I think maro's maro's pretty good Aken thank you very much for the Super Chat I've been following carnivore for three months um and lost and lost weight I saw a review that concluded the Inuit did have lower life expectancy and heart disease Canadian Journal Cardiology I'm concerned um it depends on when you look at it right so uh there's two questions there it's life expectancy and heart disease so I mean you look back through the literature of the last 120 years at the beginning of the last century of beginning of the 20th century next to no heart disease if any especially and and you have to differentiate out between the innuit population ethnically and those in the innuit population who are still living a traditional life and only eating meat and not eating junk food most of them are eating junk food now and so this these are very dishonest people doing dishonest work and dishonest people like Simon Hill use these things and that you know that nagra Matt nagra they're very dishonest people and they use these they use these studies dishonestly they look for the most recent studies that that look at the Inu as an ethnic population as an ethnic group as opposed to people eating a cornivore diet right so those are very two different things right I I don't I don't care about the people that are living in cities drinking alcohol and and eating a whole bunch of junk food or the people living out in the wilderness drinking alcohol and eating junk food that's not what we're talking about are we we're talking about people eating only meat and so when you look at the people that only eat meat they're actually much much much more healthy also the Inuit population as a whole start smoking on average at eight years old right smoking is definitely a risk for heart disease okay so when you look at earlier in the century early in the 20th century very low very low heart disease rates as a population not even just the ones eating a prop proper diet the ones eating a proper meat only diet none right you get on and on and on in the 20th century we becoming more and more involved in Western society and eating more and more Western food drinking more and more Western alcohol and they're getting more and more heart disease still lower than the rest of Canada as far as the 1990s uh 1996 there was a study that came out of Canada um or studying studying the Inuits in Canada and even in 1996 the entire body and population of Inuits had much lower rates of heart disease than the general Canadian population okay and they um and so they were thinking well maybe they have special genetic adaptations you know to uh to to weather these this horrible lifestyle that they have of eating a whole bunch of fatty meat and they found they have basically every genetic risk factor and marker um you know for uh for heart disease and so they're like okay well we have no idea what the hell is going on then you know maybe there's something else going on maybe um these genetic markers aren't as cracked up you know as we thought they were um and so you know that was 1996 and so you know wow Canadian Journal Cardiology in 2020 or something like that says that oh heart disease rates are higher yeah no because the thing is is that when eating a western diet they are four times as likely to get heart disease and cancer and all these sorts of things um you know V Homer stefanson is a professor of ethnology at Harvard and he was a a polar Explorer and lived with the innu for 12 years learned their language and their culture and um you know he wrote a book called fat of the land he's like these guys don't just don't get disease I've never been healthier in my life than eating just a muton diet with a lot of fat and uh and he wrote another book called you know is cancer a disease of civilization because these guys just weren't getting cancer but again you look you look at the literature throughout the 20th century and like the cancer rates are very low if not non-existent early on and then just decade by decade it slowly increases and slowly increases and slowly increases that's why because they're eating Western food so there's a lot of um there's a lot of conflation there you know you take a study looking at people who have a higher genetic risk factor for heart disease when eating a western diet which causes heart disease flat out um and and they start smoking when they're eight years old and you're looking at the population and you don't differentiate between the ones that are only eating meat and the ones that are eating a whole bunch of high octane crap and you're saying oh wow look at them oh they get more heart disease no kidding they're genetically susceptible to getting heart disease and I'm arguing that the food is causing the heart disease right so that proves my point because the people that are only eating meat don't get the heart disease the ones eating a western diet get the heart disease right so um so that's first of all second of all life expectancy life expectancy is measured on average from birth now they are it used to be measured more responsibly they used used to measure life expectancy every decade so from zero that was you know people would live on average certain amount of time when you are living out in the wild and you're living out in the country and you're living out with polar bears and things like that and horrible horribly harsh Arctic environments child infant mortality rate is actually pretty high you know child birth death is high you know labor if you're not at a hospital and you have a complication in child birth mom's dead baby's dead that lowers life expectancy significantly as a population that does not tell you anything about how old people are when they die of old age so if you look at the statistics and Bureau of Statistics us have these at least for the US every country will have these it goes by decade so at age zero your average life expectancy from birth is x when you get up to 10 it's X plus whatever you know it goes up so even in 1850s in America the average life expectancy from birth in 1850 was I think 36 36 or 38 right so this is where people get all people were dying in their 30s no they weren't you dumb bastard that is average from birth and the infant mortality rate was like two or three out of five at the time so most kids are dying you know or a lot of kids are dying you know in infancy that brings down that average significantly other people are going to have to live a lot longer to bring that average up even to 36 or 38 right and so you look at the at 10year olds average life expectancy from 10 years old is something like 60 years old so it's a big jump right like that right and every decade you go up you know the average life expectancy goes up and goes up and goes up and goes up and goes up so you make it to 10 years old you're likely to make it another you know 50 years on average and and you know there childhood diseases there are oxcarts that can roll over you there are Wars right right you I mean like you there lots of Wars there's there's um you know the the um there raids by you know different you know uh you know Native American nations things like that those are still very active you're out in the Frontiers and things like that you know life is life is Harsh life is dangerous that says nothing about how long you live until your body just gives up right and there's a lot of smoking back then and drinking so you know it's um it's uh you have to sort of you know pick through these things and and spot the  and and those are definitely  you know there literally a hundred years of studies showing that the inuent population as a whole had much lower rates of chronic disease and heart disease even though they smoke a lot you a lot younger than most people and it's only it's only in the 2000s really that that the in population started eclipsing the Canadian population as far as heart disease is concerned that's not because they're eating meat look at the entire Century that we were studying this before that and it was the opposite so what changed I mean just cherry-picking you know it's it's it's complete ridiculous it's total rubbish and so you know you're only looking at those and you're only looking at the studies that look at anywh as a population as opposed to the ones eating meat so what are you trying to say you can't glean any information off that all you can say is a population has higher rates of heart disease you can't say that meat causes that in fact what you can say from that is not eating meat causes that is that eating other things cause that because when they're eating meat they don't get that they have much lower rates much much much lower rates if not zero right and so when they start eating other crap then they start getting that heart disease rate coming up and now it's even worse what does that tell you it tells you that it's better to eat only meat right and that you'll have lower diseases of heart diseases rates um cheesy chunky I think this is the from the Super Chat uh before so thank you for popping that up um Okay can carnivore raise your PSA my husband has been strict carnivore for three months all numbers are great but his PSA went from 2 to 5 he's 59 and has no symptoms uh it really shouldn't you know I mean PSA sometimes has been uh Associated well prostate enlargement has been associated with uh insulin resistance actually so if you're eating just just meat salt and water not getting any carbs or artificial sweeteners or anything like that no you shouldn't it shouldn't be from that anyway there can be other things that can raise your PSA but it shouldn't be from a carnivore diet um and um I would keep an eye on that obviously you know if um if there is something going on um obviously you know cancer and things like that take decades and decades and decades to uh to to reach a point that your body actually turns into something that that it doesn't want but watch my video with Professor Thomas SE freed on uh cancer and cancer biology and uh and you'll see that that um if that the best thing you can do for prevention as well as uh putting your body into a very favorable metabolic position to fight off cancer is by being in ketosis and by just eating fatty meat and um you know some stuff as well potentially if you want it but you know there are carcinogens and things that are harmful in plants that don't contain carbohydrates as well which is sort of the point I've been trying to make to the medical community um that already knows about the benefits of ketogenic diets and Lifestyles and um improving metabolic health and you know I made that video I did that um talk at a at a medical conference in Australia called plants are trying to kill you I was trying to I was trying to turn some heads and uh and it did you know I was pointing out to a group of doctors that were already very interested in in low carb um diets as a as a lifestyle and metabolic Health modification um and they um and then I was just arguing hey look there's more yes carbs are bad fundamentally derails your metabolism away from what it should be but there are other things too there are other things we need to watch out for as well and I wasn't putting these things relatively anywhere I was just saying look there are other things at play here so um you know and that and so I think that you know for you know for cancer and things like that I think it's probably best to be just flat out just meat and water only I mean this is what we evolved on right so um so you know if he has something Brewing definitely keep an eye on that should should be his doctor should be sort of keeping an eye on that and but if it if it is something weird that's sort of been building up and is there uh I still think that this is the best way to do it and no I it's generally opposite like a lot of people will actually um reduce the size of their prostate by going on a carnivore diet as well so there could be other things going on uh but it shouldn't it shouldn't be the carnivore diet that shouldn't cause that no J d23 thank you very much for the Super Chat hi doctor I'm active duty military well thank you very much for your service I really appreciate that and I know a lot of people here do as well uh got medically disqualified from the job I wanted for a stigmatism minor car uh konus thoughts on Carnivore and ey Health good question there are people that improve their Vision there are people that improve improve uh their eyesight actually people that don't need glasses anymore which I think is crazy uh but it's interesting more and more people are finding that maybe someone in the comment someone you know watching ing now if you've had experience with this please comment with what type of of you know issue you had with your eye if you had a stigmatism and anyone who had minor kattic conus you know did that help you it's it's possible um I I don't know all the different eye conditions that a cornivore can help although I do know that that it helps some because there just I mean there's just dozens and dozens of people that I've seen now that have stopped using glasses and their Visions improved which is crazy I mean that's just amazing that that that can do that you know macular degeneration I mean that's I've talked to several opthalmologists about this such as you know Dr Chris Kenobi um who saying that you can you just reverse um macular degeneration you know with with ketogenic you know cornivore diets you know I mean it's pretty amazing and that's a that's a just a major major major problem in Opthalmology so it it can and will improve eye Health whether or not it improves your specific conditions to the point that you can see better and be qualified for the job that you want I don't know um hopefully someone in the chat has has had experience with your particular eye conditions and maybe they can shed some light on whether or not it helped them but it also help you in so many other ways anyway it's it's definitely worth doing and and if it improves your eyesight great if it doesn't you're going to get a thousand other benefits as well anyway uh it's a question from Dylan Britt um says Dr chaffy hey Doc uh family friend of ours has an eight-year-old daughter she just had a brain tumor removed they were able to remove all of it uh but it ruined her pituitary sorry about that any chance uh proper human diet could help well it's definitely going to help in a in a in a number of ways um certainly with development with child Hood development um brain development body development and and yes it can absolutely help the brain recover um with brain trauma traumatic brain injury I mean this is sort of of a doctor induced traumatic brain injury it has been shown that ketogenic diets improve uh recovery there are studies with concussions that show that being in a state of ketosis when you get a concussion actually protects your brain from the damage that a concussion can cause um unfortunately you know stopping carbs right then yes it can help but you might not be in ketosis and have high enough ketones uh before sort of damage is done from a from a concussion point of view however with traumatic bin brain injury and with surgery obviously it's it's a much longer recovery period and and I've seen people go on a carnivore diet 30 years after a stroke and and recover the hell is that about I mean that's that's insane um Dave Mack I had a had an interview with him on my channel and he has his own channel guys to check him out um very nice guy and dramatic recovery he had a subarachnoid hemorrhage 30 years earlier um had weakness down his right side very unstable very unbalanced very difficult for him to get up and downstairs had done ketogenic diets Akin diets you know for several years early on and didn't improve his neurological symptoms they were stable 30 years later stable neurology all of a sudden he goes on Carnivore two three months later he's walking normally he can run up and downstairs the hell is that that's crazy so it will help her in a lot of ways will it return her pituitary to normal function really no way to tell uh without trying you know it's just going to be a trial and error sort of thing um but quite often if you if you damage Destroyer had to remove the the bouar there's just big nasty thing in there and you just that b uit AR was just a casualty of War um then you need to take the hormones that the pituitary produce lifelong that's okay it it actually is okay um you can get pretty much normal function um as long as you take those medications as long as you keep them at the right level uh it sucks you know it's not nice you know there going to be a combination of pills and injections for the rest of her life if that's the case if her if her pituitary can't recover but if if anything's going to help it recover it would it would be in my estimation a carnivore diet that's the I've never seen anything work better for neurological uh recovery than a carnivore diet so can't say that it's going to help her case it really doesn't matter how how far along the damage is um and if the body can recover at all I think that going on a carnivore diet will put her in the best position to recover if she can and it will also optimize her body um in many many other ways especially she's 8 years old eight she's got a tumor I don't know if it's cancer but you know cancer in general is helped by these sorts of diets uh in clinical trials in humans you know so brain tumors especially I don't know what kind of brain tumor she had um but there are you know there are a number of human trials with like GBM Glo blastoma multiform um and that's sort of the worst um primary brain tumor that you can get it's most aggressive most life-threatening as uh it's a terminal disease you as soon as you get that diagnosis you are considered terminal there is not considered any cure and yet people going on a cornivore diet are still here a decade later and uh and they have no sign of progression of their disease so can't say that's going to happen with her but I can say that if I were in that situation that's what I would do with myself or my kid and especially for an 8-year-old who has their whole life ahead of them and you only get to develop once you obviously want perfect nutrition optimal nutrition for development because then you'll get optimal development guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times

knnn knnn thank you very much for the Super Chat hi doctor I have a deviated septum causing sleep apnea can I get rid of Dev decep with a carnivore diet lost 56 pounds eating carnivore great that's awesome uh deviated septum is not going to fix itself that that would need a surgical intervention however carnivore diet will reduce the inflammation and swelling of the soft tissue inside the nasal cavity and the soft pallet and that can help with snoring that can help with sleep apnea deviated septum but that's the thing that swelling and inflammation and the mild steatosis the fat you know in that because even before people lose the weight they stop snoring and stop sleep apnea quite often even within the first week or two um second of all when that that fat sort of goes away um you know that that can shrink things down quite a lot as well but if you've already lost 56 pounds um and you've been doing carnivore for a while or actually I don't know if you're you're on Carnivore you're asking if this can help if carnivore can help and I'm oh yeah yeah you did sorry it's 56 pounds eating carnivore great so you've been on Carnivore for a while you've lost a whole bunch of weight so the inflammation should be gone the fat in the tissue should be gone if you're still snoring you still have sleep apnea that's the deviated septum you're going to need to get that surgically um fixed basically you're going to have to get that straightened out uh carnivore diet won't straighten that it will only work on the soft tissue and it can reduce that but it it should have done that by now so if you're still having a problem you have a physical obstruction just like me I've broken my nose God I couldn't even tell you how many hundreds of times because I I broke the carage I broke the bone and I just kept playing I didn't stop I didn't stop I kept playing uh another six months before I got surgery I could not breathe out of my nose for six months and because I never even took a week off to let it sort of harden up um actually most practices would get smashed but every weekend on the game my nose would get smashed because it just it's a very violent game and I I was a very violent player and you know when your nose starts bleeding things like that other players see it they start smashing it punching it um they thought that that would and it hurt like hell um but they thought it would just be like pain oh God oh my poor face uh that was my that was my kill switch you know was like you hit my nose you know bodies were going to pile up and that was my Hulk switch you know like you know was just like you know don't make me angry you wouldn't like me when I was angry someone hit me in the nose that happened and so you know that was that was just the biggest mistake anyone could make uh on the Rugby field because I I just I ended up just playing so much harder so much more aggressively and uh and was going for scalps at that point it was just like people people had to die and as as as bad as that sounds I just played I just played very very very very I never played cheap I never hit anyone dirty anything like that I didn't have to because I could just hit you in a tackle and and I could hit people hard enough to take them out of the game so I didn't waste my time with with cheap hits um not that I would have anyway um but uh I could not breathe and I was doing carnivore at the time I could not breathe for six months months I was a I was a mouth breather I breathing at night sleeping my I would wake up four times a night have to drink water because my mouth would get so dry because I could not breathe through my nose and I talk like this for six months this is what my voice sounded like um it was awful um you had to get surgery so I've I've had surgery you know a few times trying to straighten that out and breathe better um it's not going to fix itself unfortunately no even with a carnivore diet that's only going to fix the soft tissue but if you have actual deviated hard tissue like cartilage or bone that just that needs to be surgically surgically uh uh fixed okay so good luck with that um Sam's block thank you very much for the Super Chat hey Anthony big fan what's your opinion on plant compounds in products that aren't food like shampoo deodorant toothpaste Etc I guess this gets into endocrine disruption dermal absorption yeah I mean that's that's a thing you need to think about are you going to get if you're eating a whole bunch of stuff you know you're getting a lot more in your body but of course they can soak through and through your skin and you can get this um endocrine disruption as well and that's not just from plant compounds um but it can be from uh artificial compounds and these microplastics and other sorts of weird chemicals that we've invented in the last 50 years I think there something it's like there been over a million different patents on new chemicals in the past 50 years since the 1970s none of those things existed those things have been been manufactured um artificially by industry these are molecules in our body has never come across um the odds of them being good for you and especially designed to be good for you like medications but they're only going to be good for you in certain context um it's very low it's very very low you know our bodies used to to and adapted to dealing with certain molecules and this is why there these things are called these forever chemicals because your body doesn't know what the hell to do with them they don't exist in nature and so your body has no ability or enzyme or capacity to eliminate these things right and so um you know this is like trans fats trans fats don't exist in nature right and so our body doesn't know how to deal with them so they just get stuffed in all these different crevices and and and cause atherosclerosis and a lot of heart disease cooking with seed oils causes trans fats so I'm going to think about there but um so trans fat you can consider that sort of a forever chemical because our body doesn't know what the hell to do with it and so it just builds up in the body and so yeah you need to be you need to be aware of that it's not just plant products though but like the essential oils and the different uh scents and the lavender scents and the Tea Tree scents and there's there's again there's always mixed uh views on this in the literature but there are studies looking at this and showing this can cause endocrine disruption and block testosterone and and upregulate uh EST Esten even in in pues in boys and interrupt puberty in teenage boys so you know is is this something that you want to do you know what again these studies only help sort of guide us right but at the end of the day it's your body right so for me is it worth the risk not really is we GNA have just sort of nice smelling soap just really couldn't care less this is why I use Tallow soap I use Tallow I use the just just straight up unscented Tallow soap to wash my my body face and hair you know and so um you know that that's why I sort of you know I partnered with um with my friend Asher have done a podcast with um and he has this company um um oh Jesus Christ I'm I'm complet blanket but uh Stone and spear so you know that's that's what um what they do they just make Tallow products and um and they have things that have some you know very minor sort of sents and things like that if you want I don't I get the ones without any sort of sense or anything like that and so you know that that's what I use so uh yeah so that's Stone and spear Tallow sorry and um and so I avoid that stuff um there are a lot of people like Dr Jamie Seaman um who goes by Dr f fabulous who's fantastic you know if if people haven't seen her stuff should definitely go and look at all her stuff she just had a recent Ted Talk um you know talking about sort of women's health issues which is fantastic I would encourage everyone to find that and watch that and um but she talks about this as well and a lot of other people do also um you know Dr Sarah salivar would talk about these sorts of things as well um and if I'm not mistaken and you know and a lot of other people right so it's uh it is something that I think is important I think it is definitely a factor um and so I just try to keep things as clean and and and um as basic as possible and you know and that and that that works for me anyway and it at least eliminates out the possibility you're just stopping the exposure to potentially harmful things maybe they're not maybe they're not as bad as they're cracked up as people are making them out to be maybe but you know what um they are there's a potential there and so you know why mess around you know just you know if you don't need it then you know it's you're not really losing anything by by cutting it out so that's that's sort of my philosophy on that Michael Jackson back from the dead thank you so much for the Super Chat uh just a donation you do great work well thank you very much I really appreciate that and thank you for watching that's uh it's great to have you here Frankie 24K thank you very much for the Super Chat um six months on Carnivore down 75 pounds great job that's awesome I now I'm now having pain in my back on the right side under arm I believe gallbladder area um could that be kidney stone or B sledge so well if it's in your back less likely to be the gallbladder gallbladder is on the front so you have sort of in the right upper quadrant of your abdomen and that's if you eat fat then you should get a squeeze pain because that's squeezing and maybe squeezing on on um you know stones or something like that right um you've been doing this for six months so if you had Stones formed in there probably would have cleared out by now you don't get gall stones from eating fat in fact you get gall stones from not eating fat because Gall your bile your liver makes bile stored in your gallbladder and it sits there and it concentrates up to 20 times more concentrated in the literature in the physiology textbooks it can concentrate up to 20 20 times more maybe some people concentrate even more than that maybe those are the ones are at increased risk of getting um gallbladder disease and Stones what happens to any hyper concentrated solution at rest forms crystals precipitates that's what B bile Sledge is that's what gallstones are and so if you are not eating enough fat or you're not eating any fat which is mostly what the people that get gallstones are I I've eaten no fat in the last three months I can't possibly have gallstones because you're told that not eating that eating fat causes it um that dead wrong it's exactly the opposite so I look at them and say well actually that's why you got gallstones because now you have this this bile sitting there and getting concentrated concentrated concentrated and it just solidifies right if you were eating fatty meat if you're eating fatty food you would release that b SL bile right and so if you're eating enough every day it's physically impossible to form Stones because it takes much longer than one day to form gall stones and so if you're clearing out the bile everying single day you're never going to have enough uh time to form uh gall stones right so it's not that you ate fat it's because you didn't eat fat now you're eating fat as long as you're eating a high fat carnivore diet if you're eating lean carnivore diet okay well maybe if you're not eating enough and it's building up um so I would just stick to high fat but area you're sort of describing your back back here that's more of the the kidney area right sort of the renal area um and so I wouldn't think that's as much with the the bile or the gall stones um but yeah kidney stones or something like that I wouldn't think it would be bile sludge just given that you've been on cornival for six months probably eating a decent amount of fat uh and that's not really the area for for gston goston would be in the front in the back there can be other things if it's sort of in the middle of the back or sort of in the upper abdomen and radiating to the back you know that can be something else entirely so it really matters about the specifics but sort of on the back is uh in that area that you're describing would would more likely be something to do with the kidneys so you can talk to your doctor um kidney stones will show up you'll have blood in your urine and um even if it's just sort of Trace Amounts and then you can sort of get a scan and see what's going on there um you can still get um kidney stones people have been known to get kidney stones from oxalate dumping um and there's still the calcium oxalate Stones um there are um you know some gestions that eating too much organ meat can can uh increase risk of um kidney stones as well um but just take a look you know I mean you need to need to find out I mean if you're drinking enough water and you're just eating a meat only diet um that's that's going to prevent a lot of things and and seriously improve your kidney function and health but uh at the same time you can have oxalate dumping you have other sorts of things in your system as well that can sort of kick off uh kidney stones you can get infections that can actually cause stag horn calcul which are big massive suckers um so you know it's worth checking out um I would think it'd be more something to do with your kidneys so so have have a chat with your doctor and you know pee in a cup and look if see if there's blood in it if you certainly if if you're getting a sort of Ros\u00e9 tint to your urine then then you need to get checked out you know that's that's likely to be something uh something causing a bleed like kidney stones or something like that so uh yeah just I I would talk to your doctor about that uh so that was Frankie I'm just going to take a look and see how many questions we have left I think we've got a number of uh I think we got enough questions to get us through um the next sort of 15 minutes which is about the time that I have so um why don't we just basically uh don't please don't put any more uh super chats just because I I don't want to not be able to get to them and and I do have to get to work so I don't want to keep them waiting either okay question from Joseph thank you very much that's very generous of you um been on striet Carnivore for almost three months also been working out uh for 60 Minutes three times per week I usually work out on an empty stomach because I eat late afternoon early evening should I be taking a supplement to help muscle growth and retention uh generally not I I've never found it easier to put on muscle than when on a carnivore diet just eating carnivore um if you're eating un right so you need to eat enough so you need to get enough fatty meat it sounds like you're eating you know in the afternoon evening which is great um that's what I do I feel best when I do that and always work out on empty stomach I always feel I get better workouts it depends on what kind of workouts you know if you're just doing a whole bunch of cardio that's not really going to stimulate you know muscle growth and and um in the same way that like sprinting and weightlifting will um I it sort of I get the impression you're probably doing weightlifting um but uh but yeah just general in general people uh cardio not really the best thing to do that can actually lower testosterone lower growth hormone raise cortisol and uh and can actually put on visceral fat and and you know it doesn't it sort of can tone but it's not going to it's not going toh build up muscle and so sprinting weightlifting that will improve your hormones in men it will improve testosterone and growth hormone and women will improve growth hormone and lower cortisol for both and uh and it will get rid of visceral fat for both which is very very important that's a very important biomarker that my friend Dr sha Amara has been highlighting over the past couple years which is very important it's is probably one of the most important biomarkers that we can look at if you get an abdominal MRI and you see how much fat is around the organs um that is a very good marker of overall health because that fat is metabolically active it can actually increase your risk of getting cancer and dying from cancer and and a lot of other metabolic issues as well so and and there's actually like evidence for why that is so um that I talk about in other videos so it's very important it's a very important biomarker lifting weight sprinting carnivore diet those are the best things to do to get rid of your visceral fat and improve your metabolic Health um if you want to put on muscle you have to eat enough so you have to stimulate your body you have to lift weights and Sprint and then you have to make sure your body's getting enough so if you're eating enough fatty meat you're eating until it stops tasting T in good and you're trying that twice a day if you're working out a lot like you are then then that should be fine and you you'll find that you put on muscle very very very easily and um uh I you generally don't need supplements you know people like taking creatine tons of creatine and red meat so if you're eating predominantly red meat that should be fine um Vince Gand who's who's the called like the iron Guru he was one of the golden Nero bodybuilders people can look him up even in you know his 50s and 60s the guy was jacked um in his 80s a guy was jacked um he ate basically a carnivore diet and he thought that you needed to eat carbohydrates to replenish your liver glycogen that was incorrect that was the thinking of the time that's not true though uh you you replenish all your glycogen and blood sugar just by just by being in ketosis your body does that for you so he would eat carnivore six days a week and then one day he he'd carb up because that's how he thought would get your G so he was just unfortunately misinformed on that but but that was that was what we thought back then but it's not but we know we know differently now um and and he was saying that you eating like 36 eggs a day you know that was that was uh that could give similar responses to um the like a a low low um dose cycle of steroids right so there's like some serious serious muscle building potential there with just just the food that you're eating and so just keep eating what you're eating eat until fatty meat stops tasting good and work out and and you'll do great and um you know I mean if if you were to check your Bloods and your hormones and things like that you you would probably find that they're great and you know if you checked it before and 3 months 6 months a year after doing carnivore I think you'd find that they improve dramatically your growth horm will go up your testosterone will be going up and and and everything else will be optimizing as well if you have a specific deficiency somewhere sure address it if you're not getting enough B12 or folate because you're you're not methylating them properly um you know because of some sort of genetic issue adding in a bit of lier that generally is the supplement for carnivores is just adding a bit more organs you know if you want more nutrients just have a bit more organs they're extraordinarily nutrient dense but again that's the problem it can be too dense and it can cause a problem so just make sure that you're you're not getting too much but you know if you're not getting enough they they are there for you so no I don't think you need to add anything else I don't I don't take creatine I don't you know certainly don't take steroids and so and I found that I've never put on uh muscle easier than put on Carnivore diet and and just I mean that's that's what everyone's reporting is that you know people in their 70s you know are stacking on muscle and they like this is crazy how do that work you have to put in the work what you're doing um but you also have to you know and and and if you do put in the work and you eat enough you'll you'll you'll put on muscle very very easily uh idola thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm about six weeks into carnivore have leaky gut and have to tuck the end of my anus back in when I use the toilet uh still with skin issues and an anus inflammation so that that's going to probably be there for a while you know if You' have prolapse anus um have prolap prolapse rectum um you know I can't say that that's going to fix itself I mean that's a structural issue that that may need surgery it may be that this has helped because the body can you know sort of heal a lot of a lot of things I don't know if it can heal that I I haven't seen that issue uh as of yet maybe you can you know let us know how you go in the next sort of 6 months to a year to see if that's improved uh one thing that it it can help with just logistically is that by eating a carnivore diet you're not going to need to go to you know defecate as often so you're going to have much lower volume and much less often so hopefully that will help that situation you need enough fat so if you're eating if you're not eating enough fat you're going to get dry hard Rocky stools and that will obviously um not be helpful in this situation so eat enough fat so the stools are very soft and if they're not soft eat more fat that by definition if your stools are hard you're not eating enough fat more fat will make it softer so um I would do that also you can actually go back to the original you know uh Salsbury diet you know the original sort of carnivore diet back in the 1800s with Dr Salsbury who made the Salisbury steak where they ground meat without the gristle which basically take the gristle out I may it may not be possible for you to grind your own meat and take the gristle out but you know that that sort of that connected tissue that that tough sort of chewy stuff usually between the fat and the meat that that's the gristle if you take that out if you sort of cut that out and just eat the soft muscle meat and the soft fat and maybe add some butter to that you will you will absorb nearly 100% of that and you will not need to defecate much at all right and as long as you're getting enough fat it'll still be soft so that's what Dr Salsbury did in the 1800s to rest people's gut and bowels when they had like severe Crohn's and Ultra of colitis and things like that because they had serious serious serious gut issues from eating all these bloody plants and and um and we had no medications that could help them and so that was it you had to really rest the bowel and and that's how you do it so if you get rid of the gristle and all that sort of stuff you'll go much much much less often uh leaky gut will will heal itself as well takes like six months to a year though but the good thing about eating a cornivore diet even when you have leaky gut you're not bringing in things that are going to get through there and cause a problem like all these different lectins and plant toxins so I would be very strict I'd be only red meat and water if you can do it any meat's fine um but red meat is best and try to take out the gristle try to eat a lot of fat and um and you'll minimize the amount that you have to defecate and hopefully that that helps with that issue as well but yeah you may need surgery for that so um but you know may this could potentially help it become more manageable and the skin issues as well a lot of skin issues benefit but again it depends on the C the type of skin issues and what's causing them as well uh Holly Ruth thank you very much for the Super Chat upping the fat I'm not exactly craving uh just Board of meat uh carnivore over six months pairing down to Lion diet for Rus 7 Days of water beef and lab any suggestions well look I think I think you're doing great and I think it's a great idea to do a line diet from to arthritis anybody with autoimmune issues really should be just sticking to red meat and water and uh and and yeah you know the thing is is that lean meat can get very boring very quickly and um as as CHF will tell you fat is flavor and so you add in the fat and it becomes much more interesting but if meat doesn't taste good you're not hungry if lean meates doesn't taste good might be that you're not getting enough fat so eat fatty meat eat fattier meat add butter to it if that helps great keep eating it until it doesn't taste good anymore if you start doing that and you just go I don't really want to do this you're not hungry it's fine as long as there's enough fat there and um your body has will your body knows when it gets enough nutrients as long as you're not eating carbohydrates and lectins and other s plant toxins that can derange and disrupt your body's signals and and absorption and digestion so I would I would just do exactly that I would stick with red meat and water I would increase the fat and I would not eat if meat doesn't taste good it should always taste good it should always be fun steak should always be awesome and sometimes people get just just you know they just get bored you know because they're so used to eating all these other sorts of things you know I don't look at it that way I mean I look at these other things I don't even look at them as food because they're not they're not food to us you know food is species specific and so you know zebra doesn't look at what a giraffe eats and goes like oh God I wish no they just like no thank you um that's not food to a zebra and so um and vice versa you know drafts don't want what what zebras are are picking up right so you know it's um we get used to this and we just get sort of eating for pleasure and eating for entertainment and and so we need to get away from that you know food is food is about nutrition and food is about health and so we can we can still enjoy it you know we get that we get that positive response because you know we need some sort of biological signal that that tells our body yes that's good obviously sugar is a bit of an outlier but Sugar's known to be something that's that's technically safe it doesn't kill you in a day because there aren't things with fructose in it naturally that that are directly toxic to you well now we've you but they were only available for a couple weeks once a year and so and you know you sort of eat those things they're mildly sweet you recognize them as safe often times people didn't eat them you know the Native Americans people would say oh they ate pkin most of the year they would eat pkin they'd eat bison they'd eat pkin from the Bison which is dried meat and fat it was oh well they put berries in it they put  that's what they sold to the Europeans because the Europeans wanted something sweet they wanted something else and we like okay idiots here's put some berries in it uh it's cheaper anyway because you know the meat is more of the commodity and um that's what all these other sort of plant fillers are in all the different processed foods that that we buy um so it it wasn't the Inuit who act or the the Plains Indians who ate the berries they they just ate the meat and um but you know so we recognize that as safe and that's why fructose is is very sweet to us but it was only available very rarely we weren't shipping in mangoes from the equator um it's just we didn't have the capability of doing that for most of the exist of humanity so um you know just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and and think about these things in natural context and and you know if you want to switch up the meat that you're eating you know different sorts of ways of making them different sorts of ways of of of doing it you know that might be a bit more interesting but always just remember that yeah food it tastes good but it it's not it's purpose is not entertainment it purpose is to give you sustenance so try to find other things that are entertaining I I'd love the fact that I only eat once a day and I've got an extra six hours of my day that I'm not thinking about preparing or eating food right I just do things I do things like this I've got times for this I've got time to go out in the sun I've got time to to work a lot more that's basically what I use my time for is it just work constantly but you know I have time for that you know I get a lot more done and it's and so I entertain myself you know with life and I don't need to entertain myself with food so I I much prefer that and and you'll be healthier for doing that and so I think you're doing exactly the right thing you know just eat especially for remov to arthritis you know just eat fatty meat and keep eating it till it stops tasting good and enjoy your life enjoy your rheumato arthritis free life Donna K thank you very much for the super chat um I recently started following you well thank you very much for that trying to get my husband on board C if anyone has improved dur in large prostate with going Carnival yeah absolutely I mean you know like my friend Dr sha omaro who was just talking about he I mean he did that himself um and uh uh Professor Ben bman from BYU who is really one of the world's experts on insulin and metabolic issues he's a biochemist and and a professor of the same at BYU and he does research specifically on insulin and metabolism and and that's and he's written a book called why we get sick and and if I'm not mistaken he talks about um enlarge prostates being sensitive to insulin and so you get insulin resistance and you get high insulin levels from eating a lot of carbohydrates and um and you get enlargement of your prostate so yes it it it can and has helped uh people with en large prostate obviously there's other things that that play a role but yes it can absolutely help Crazy K thank you for the Super Chat can G cornivore cure sleep apnea and apib it certainly imp well it depends on what's causing this both it can certainly um it can certainly uh it certainly has fixed sleep apnea for many many people uh my friend Carrie man of is is um has you know gone carnivore this year and he has a a channel called Homestead how and he absolutely fixed his um his um uh sleep apnea with um with a carnivore diet and um I'm just looking my my computer for some reason my my cable charger isn't working too well so if my my computer dies uh that's what happened um but yeah so he cured his sleep B me within a week uh so it can definitely remove the inflammation apib there can be other sorts of things I have seen isolated uh reports of people improving that generally um I would be skeptical but it's um uh you know potential sleep apnea definitely help if you have deviated septum you know that's not going to help that that might need surgery but it can certainly help with a soft tissue absolutely and it will help you in a lot of other ways as well um Thomas C thank you so much for the Super Chat how about carnivore and adrenal hormones yeah well look it can improve all of those things it can reduce stress reduce cortisol lower your cortisol raise growth hormone raise testosterone raise estrogen depends if you're a man it's going to improve it's going to optimize your testosterone estrogen progesterone for women it's going to do the same thing for a woman and um adrenal hormones every single hormone out of your adrenals like cortisol um are made from cholesterol and you're taking plants you're eating plants they have plant sterols and that stops your body from using that they can't be used as um cholesterol it can't make hormones properly can't make vitamin D properly so it messes it up so yeah absolutely carnivore can help your adrenal hormones and balance your hormones in general low carb low drama thank you so much for the very generous Super Chat that's very kind of you I believe in low zerocarb Health uh with low insulin and stress rcts are hailed as gold standard by keto carnivore Community but two rcts suggesting keto raises corol get rubbish your thoughts really appreciate your work um I don't know those studies that they're they're talking about but um it depends on how the the studies are put together obviously how many people uh are in it how long they followed it I do know that there are studies um looking at people in ketosis for over two years and they show they don't raise cortisol um and um and the thing is too is that you you have to sort of wonder why they're raising cortisol as well something that was put forward by I believe ambro Hearn if I'm not mistaken is that if you are on a cornivore diet or ketogenic diet Um this can improve metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome is known lower cortisol so people have lower cortisol a lot of people have metabolic syndrome 93% of Americans have at least one metabolic disease right so metabolic syndrome is is much more common than it should be and so if you are if you're metabolically unwell your cortisol is going to be too low and then this actually just sort of readjusts and gets into actual normal levels so that's that's a suggestion for that is it too high is it causing um problems with you know from hypercortisolism um no I don't think that it is there's a there we actually use ketogenic diets when people have hypercortisolism for Surgical and Medical reasons to ameliorate the symptoms of hypercortisolism too much cortisol causing damage to the body so we actually use that as as an adjunct to medical and surgical treatment to ameliorate the symptoms and problems of um hypercortisolism you know while we are going towards a definitive surgical or Med medical uh um you know treatment for for that hypercortisolism and then it's continued after that in many cases as well it's not everyone not all the time it is in the literature right um so I did a a video with my friend uh Richard Smith um just called is ketosis bad for you we go through a lot of that literature because that's something that that you know Dr marola and um Georgie dinkov have been sort of making the rounds is sort of the rapat sort of idea that this is a problem I don't think that that stands on the literature and so we went through that um I even did a debate with George dinkov who's this really nice guy it was actually it was what a debate is supposed to be you know we disagreed and we talked about it and um but it was it was actually a very he's a very reasonable person he's he's quite bright and very knowledgeable about it I I disagree with his conclusions I think there's there's other um evidence out there and and certainly my own experience my my you know I don't have raised cortisol or hypercortisolism I've been doing a carnivore with zero carb for six years and you know the been doing this forever and people we've been doing this for you know two million years so I don't I don't see that being a problem if you have to have carbohydrates first of all there is no such thing as a as an essential carbohydrate they entire civilizations that never eat carbohydrates outside of like the glycogen that they' be getting from muscle meat and organs and no problems right so even if you say well but that glycogen is really important fine you get you still get everything you need from eating meat you don't need to add in plant carbs and sugar um so watch that watch that video that I did on you know is ketosis harmful um you can watch the the debate I did with uh Mr Georgie dinkov and and see what you think you know uh I I'm on certainly on the camp of you know being in ketosis you're gonna go in and out of ketosis anyway right I don't care if I'm in ketosis that's not what I'm worried about I'm worried I'm at a baseline level am I eating what I'm supposed to eat am I eating what's biologically appropriate for my species yes I am okay I'm not worried about anything else um there a quick question from Alvin Kim can you eat eggs only people have and they do just fine so uh yeah should be fine if you wanted to just eat eggs um I would I would just get pasture raised eggs so you know because those are I mean they have 20 times the amount of folate you know in pasture R's eggs than than normal Factory eggs because they're feeding chickens crap they're feeding chickens the things that they're not supposed to eat anyway they need to be eating what they're supposed to eat and they're going to be much more nutritious uh but yeah you can and and there are case reports of people doing that and um and literally just eating eggs their whole life you know so um yeah you can just eat only eggs as long as they're sort of pasture raised eggs and um you know keep an eye out for any sort of nutritional deficiency or anything like that um but you it's really just going to depend on the egg really but yeah no you should be fine should uh if you're eating pasture R eggs it should be fine I think meat's better I think red meat's better but that's that should be fine okay all right this will be this will be the last question uh every is it oh God okay um yeah um oh sorry that's just from low carb Dr just well thank you for the Super Chat and thank you so and she's just saying thank you or they are saying uh thank you so much uh for the for the answer you're very welcome and I hope that's helpful and then just the last question of of the day um until next week from Damen Williams thank you so much for the Super Chat hello started keto two years ago eating a huge punch bowl of mixed salad daily uh now Carnival for the last year had a bowl of salad for Thanksgiving it was a bowl of bitterness blah yeah yeah that's um it that bitterness is is a warning your body is telling you don't eat this spit it out um and that's where we have to put dressing and Seasonings and all this sort of stuff over it because it does it just doesn't taste good and that bad taste is your body warning you against something harmful now does that mean that everything that tastes good is necessarily good for you no but it does mean that if it tastes bad you should probably avoid it if a 2-year-old doesn't want to eat it I probably wouldn't eat it um well or you know a six-month-old or a year old that is just starting to eat solid foods they're much more in tune to their genetics and biology than we are just instinctually and so they put a piece of broccoli in their mouth and go oh God I wouldn't eat broccoli um and uh I think it is exactly that simple now those kids are you know can be mesmerized by sugar but again that's that first of all it's a drug and drugs are addictive that's you know give give him cocaine too he's probably going to like that as well um but it you know if it if it tastes bad if they just go oh I don't want this then you know that's a good sign that there's something in there that's bad for you so okay great well thank you very much thank you everyone uh for coming on today I really appreciate it I we did go a bit a bit longer than than um I intended to but um there were a lot of very good questions so I just wanted to make sure I got them all thank you all I will see you again uh next week and we'll do the same thing great thanks everyone we'll see you later oh and um yeah also I have a Premiere coming on uh this Sunday in America Monday morning in uh Australia middle of the the night for uh people in Europe but um you please do make those it's great when we get a lot of people there I'll be chatting live with everyone there as well and um and and you know answering you know questions if I can if people have questions about the video that we're watching and the interview that we're doing and um and it's just you know it's sort of nice to get everyone there talking and it also helps the algorithm more people come out there more people show interest and comment and like and everything like that you know more it tells YouTube that this is something Worth showing to other people and it just helps get the message out so I appreciate it um everyone who's able to come to that as well all right thank you very much everyone we'll see you next time strict carnivore uh you have to look at stress and get out other things in your environment and uh and and cut out the Beef Pork no sorry not the beef the pork chicken and farm fish especially Farm fish is terrible um and just cut out the dairy for good measure um you just just play it as safe as possible and just go red meat and water"
