        "transcript": "'ve got at fixing you know whatever we can fix so um a 've got at fixing you know whatever we can fix so um a Super Chat already let's see here oh John asked how do you know if your fat intake is high enough Dave what do you what do you think about that I I just kind of I measure it just simply by going is it uh is it comfortable when I go to the bathroom you know am I passing things comfortably and uh you know it gets too high when it's you know when it's coming out too easily [Music] [Laughter] um yeah keep the kid for Dr Chavi you got any thoughts on that I would say for me uh for example this is uh TMI but today I had that very issue uh whenever I ate my dinner I put too much beef Tallow in it and I just lathered it up and uh it got me on the way out and it's just like maybe I need to take the fat back down a little bit what about you Dr shavey yeah uh yeah no I agree so if you know your body has a limited capacity to absorb fat and so once you've reached that capacity it has to come out right and so I think of that as being exactly what you want I don't think our bodies you know made a mistake on how much bile that it's made um you know it it doesn't just do those things by accident your body per you know really really tightly regulates so many things in your body that means it's just billions of different things they're just so tightly regulated uh I don't think I don't think they just just you know eyeballed this one and so I think that your body wants a certain amount of fat and that's why it makes that certain amount of bile and and then after that you it's really hard to absorb fat so I think you want to satisfy your body's ability your body's desire to get that fat and so I agree if you have if you are having dry hard stools that means your body's absorbing every ounce of fat that you're that you're putting into it and and nothing else is getting out so maybe you're getting exactly the right amount but you know that's just a guess so if you're if you're getting a bit of overflow and that Fat's getting into your stools that's going to keep your stools soft and then you know your status saturating well you should have a very good impression that you're set saturating your body's ability to absorb fat it's very difficult for your body to absorb fat without bile a little bit but not not much and um the other thing is is the Tallow some people find that that goes through them a bit quicker and so some people find they'll have loose stools even though they're like reducing fat and reducing fat and reducing fat and they're still having that problem and they find that if you if you just eat more you know solid fat like cellular fat that's if that's still in the cellular matrix it takes a while for your body to break that down and release the the oils and um and then your body has more of a chance to absorb that so some people that have problems with loose stools even though they've been reducing fat and get rid of coffee get rid of tea get rid of artificial sweeteners and all other laxatives they find that that helps them too so yeah I agree with that as well awesome awesome well and that's one thing that I've seen too um as far as the the fact even after losing the weight that I've lost I've I've added fat to my diet throughout the last year and a half lost 245 pounds but I've added fat to it all I eat a fatty ribeye as it is and added butter to it because just because I like butter but nevertheless oh my goodness you gotta attack what is that it's a stick it's like it's a hairless cat that uh my girlfriend I got it this is morning time so he's like awake and wanting to attack things and explore that's awesome oh fancy says I'm on my third week of BBB and E now the last three days I'm staying hungry why Dr Chaffey you want to take that one well if you're hungry then your body just wants more you know you're stimulating your body you're giving it a lot of nutrients and nutrition and and you're going to ramp up your metabolism you know when we when we chronically restrict the amount of food and nutrition that we're putting in our bodies it will suppress your metabolism and that's not a good thing and that actually you know if you talk to bariatric surgeons you know they do bypass surgery they will they will tell you and they inform their patients quite often that that um or at least ones I I know will inform their patients that if you eat less than say 1200 calories for a woman you cannot lose weight you will not lose weight so you're eating less less food and you're and you're putting on weight you're not losing weight right so you're suppressing your metabolism and uh and so so that's what's happening now it's you're eating as much as you're eating presumably as much as your body wants and that's stimulating your body to want more and say hey we're not in a famine anymore you don't have to you know trim sales and then whether store you can actually we can actually do something here and you can ramp up your metabolism and use more and so that's that's what you're experiencing now you know your body wants more so give it more and good things will happen absolutely and you know that that's what the caveat that you're you're not on any sort of medications and things like that that could uh change that some people are on different medications that can you know ramp up your your uh you know your hunger signals and things like that but you know this is this is something you've been doing this for a few weeks and now your hunger's gone up you know I'm assuming that you haven't started a new medication during that time awesome awesome to see uh Terry asked uh are you tracking our tracking macros necessary and if so which app is the most basic I'll I'll be honest with you I have not tracked anything and that's what was so attractive to me with the carnivore diet to begin with was you know Dr chafee and Dr Dr Berry and all these all these you know doctors talking about this way of eating and how nutritious it was and at the same time I don't have to count calories I don't have to like when I get hungry I eat uh whenever I'm not hungry I don't eat and it really has been that simple the only thing I tracked was my weight loss down and down and down as it happened over the time or my my lab value so um I don't try if it makes you feel better you can I mean there's I don't know that I hear people in the community talking about those uh the apps where they track carb uh car metrics or something like that um that they track with but honestly if you don't put carbs in you just stick the you know the ruminant animals and uh meat you don't have to you really don't have to worry about that so well I don't you know so uh what do you think about that you trapped man well I have Native American Heritage so uh my ancestors they track their macros they did it one Buffalo at a time that's the only macros that I'm worried about what about you Dave yeah um like you guys um yeah I I don't I don't do any tracking it's just entirely intuitive um if I'm hungry I eat if I'm not hungry I donate and I don't worry about it as long as I'm not adding carbohydrate in there um yeah yeah I've you know I like I like that idea of tracking macros you know through the bush and uh than eating them that's great um yeah well you know I mean I use the same app that uh you know most Lions use and koalas and uh and uh and the Inuit right so you know I mean you shouldn't have to use an app you know I mean we didn't have apps up until you know a few years ago right so you know how were people figuring out how to eat how you know you know I've never seen a koala pull out a calculator to figure out his macros right so you know if if they are eating what they're naturally supposed to eat they have just natural signals we should be able to do the same and so if you're eating if you're not able to do that if you have to have an app if you have to use a calculator that tells you you're eating the wrong thing it should be intuitive it should be you should be able to do it intuitively and so if you're not doing it intuitively then you're eating something wrong that's messing with your signals so if you just eat meat you eat it until it stops tasting good and that's pretty much it and and you live your life and enjoy your time well it and just like in the group that I'm part of and have been part of what I've seen them do a lot of times is people get distracted by the the food of versions whenever they're switching to this way of eating and really honestly I know in my case I feel like that was my body saying you've had enough to eat stop trying to eat schedule your meals three times a day and and whatnot so you know listening to your grilling and your leptin and getting those hunger signals working correctly you know is important and giving it the proper human nutrition is going to be the best way to do that oh Texas Donna can initial weight gain be from the body trying to get re-nourished I have put on some weight put some weight on and but feel okay I'm short and would like to drop 30th Dave what you think um I I I'm as as not a doctor I'm go I'm gonna I'm gonna put it out there that I think probably when you're you're getting started um your body is probably prioritizing nourishment and what it needs to do as you're eating um healthier food and like putting weight on might be a thing your body needs to do before you know before the weight comes off before you get back to some homeostatic level um yeah keep your thoughts um I can only speak from my experience and in my experience I never dealt with that so I'll have to go with what Dr Anthony chafee says because me as soon as I started I started dropping weight like I looked at the scale and I was down like seven pounds the first week probably so I'm not the guy what do you think Dr chafee yeah well you know most people you know do well you know when people have a weight to lose they usually they find that they do lose it pretty quickly that's the majority of people I mean I'm well over 90 of I mean probably 99 it's it is rare that someone would put on weight but it does happen and generally it's it's because people have been doing yo-yo dieting and sort of restrictive eating and you know which which a lot of people do some people it affects a bit more differently their hormones get a bit out of whack and the ones that I've seen uh clinically that I've had I've had in my practice I've I've noticed that they all had extraordinarily highly elevated leptins leptin is a satiety uh hormone but it's all also you get leptin resistance and you and you have a very very difficult time losing weight and it's also a sort of a keystone Cornerstone hormone for all your other hormones as well it sets off a lot of Cascades and and do different uh hormones and things like that so it's very very important it's very important to have it in in proper balance as well and I've found that when that some people will have very very high elevated leptins and they find it difficult at first to lose weight also you need to think about are you losing weight or do you want to actually lose fat that's what we're talking about we're losing fat and and the weight on the scale doesn't necessarily equate to fat you're losing because you're also going to put on muscle you're going to put on bone density and you know that so that's going to offset that so I I was like Kip I lost weight pretty quickly early on just by dropping vegetables you know I mean I hadn't I wasn't even eating carbohydrates just dropping vegetables I lost 23 pounds in 10 days right so but after that I lost no weed wait none I stayed exactly the same way for months and months and months and that's because I was I was working out a lot and I was replacing fat with muscles so my body was changing dramatically but my weight stayed the same um that's probably you know in in some cases that's that's not necessarily going to happen but a lot of you know um people will see a stall they'll say well I'm not losing weight what's going on and and you know usually those are the ones that are like working out a lot well you're gonna be you're going to be building muscle it's far easier to build muscle on a carnivore diet than any other diet I've ever been on and so you're going to be putting on muscle so if you're not losing weight you're definitely losing fat because you have to be putting on muscle if you're working out like that um but there are some people that that really don't lose fat and Kelly Hogan was one of these people for six months she didn't lose any fat and she might have even put on fat and then something happened and uh you know her hormones probably normalize and regulated and all of a sudden she just it just started shedding off and that but it took her about six months but she just focused on her health and just she was feeling so much better and her um you know her health was improved in so many ways that she was just like why I have to keep doing this because it's just it's really important and she just sort of trusted it and eventually you know she started losing weight she's been very slender ever since um there are some people that have very high leptins that lose weight just fine I so there's something else going on I don't know exactly what it is yet but I'm still figuring it out but it but I have seen you know elevated leptin so in any case it just comes down the fact that you probably have hormonal imbalance and something else is going on and it's just going to take time it's just going to take time for that to heal you know some people if they've been restricting their eating for a long time they're they're they're um their metabolism is going to be very very low and suppressed like like we said earlier and um and so you know you're going to you're going to notice that you know like those yo-yo diets when you restrict and you fast and you limit yourself for so long you suppress your metabolism then you start eating exactly the same thing that you were eating before and you slam on much more weight than you had lost right and so that that's why because you're suppressing your metabolism so just do what you know our previous uh you know question was which was you know wait why is my my appetite going up well your metabolism is going up so give that a chance so keep eating keep giving yourself everything that your body everything needs let it know that you're not in a famine that there isn't a shortage of food and your metabolism will come up your hormones will regulate and eventually you will start losing fat for sure it may take a while you may be that one percent of people that it takes six months or even a year but your health will improve the whole time you'll feel better you'll have better energy you'll be able to exercise you'll be able to be more active Jesus Christ and um and uh and you know and eventually you know the weight will come you know and uh so just be patient and but first and foremost focus on your health because that's really what's the most important thing here yo u want to give a shout out to Angelo thank you for the"

        "transcript": "u want to give a shout out to Angelo thank you for the u want to give a shout out to Angelo thank you for the Super Chat uh appreciate you guys man you know I I tell people all the time the generosity of you guys is important to us it does help it you know wherever you're you're donating we sure do appreciate that when you guys do that as well um everybody you know all the people that we I like to work with and I try to get on and do stuff with the most you know they they have a heart for this stuff it's not just about um you know trying to have a business and those kinds of things and um I think that's clearly evident in the lives of these guys man what they're doing and the work they do and um it's awesome and so you guys investing in into all of us that's incredible and I appreciate it every time um John asked Dr chafee I love my coffee and can never see giving it up why is it not good to consume coffee and is it really that bad uh oh brace yourselves boys and girls uh well look I mean Everything's Relative right you know is it is it the worst thing in the world you know no and if it brings you pleasure and you like it then you know that's great I mean it does have you know different sorts of Defense chemicals you know the different lectins and tannins and oxalates and all these you know phytates and all these sorts of things so it has these things in them that's that's that's an objective reality and um you know and so you know and I mean even even caffeine is a neurotoxin it was developed as a as a uh you know insecticide millions and millions of years ago to like you know kill insects that are trying to eat it right so um it has these defense chemicals and that can affect you in in negative ways if you enjoy the positive aspects you enjoy that little bit of energy boost in the morning or whenever and and you just enjoy the ritual of it the social aspect of it these are all things that that are are positive uh in people's lives then you know by all means go for it I think that it's it's probably good policy to stop it for 30 days see how you feel and then maybe trial it back in and see see how see what the actual effects are what the actual differences are so you you know objectively what that's doing to you for me I feel much better much better when I don't drink coffee I you know I have one cup of coffee I don't get sore after a workout doesn't matter how hard I work out doesn't matter how long it's been in between workouts I do not get sore 4 then I have one cup of coffee I'm sure for two days so to me that was like no absolutely not I'm not dealing with that nonsense you know I'm very very very thrilled to not be sore all the time I was sore for 35 years of my life playing sports and working out and things like that like I'm very happy to not be doing that anymore so you know for me it's not worth it and my energy levels I find that they're far better when I don't have the coffee so I have some caffeine and you know that's the thing too if I if I were to have caffeine very rarely that I do that I mean like once a year I maybe I it has been probably been a couple years since I've done that but it's like if I'm on call I'm working overnight and I've just been up for 36 hours and I've got to go you know in the clinic or you know see patients or something like that I'm like okay I need something you know I've done that and I've regretted it every single time because you know I have a few hours of good energy I feel good and then the crash comes down and I just feel wretched the rest of the day so overall my energy level are much much much better overall you know and not like a quick burst and a slam it's just that the whole time it's it's even it's mellow it's good and I can function and so I prefer that but you know it is a preference you know you take the good with the bad so you know some people you know want to have something like that but I would just suggest you know taking a month off see how you feel and uh you know you're gonna get some coffee headaches and withdrawal headaches presumably if you're a heavy caffeine Drinker those will go away in a few days and then after a couple weeks you'll you'll probably feel a lot better and you'll probably have more consistent energy and then you can just see is that something that you want is that something you like or do you prefer having uh you know whatever benefits the coffee give you so it's always up to the individual I can assure you man I quit I quit drinking coffee for five months when I first started eating like this and then I added it back and I I can assure you for me personally that's exactly what I found I you know I it's not that I had any more energy when I added it back in there's something about it I think it and honestly the more you talk about it the more I think about it and second guess the the answer at least I I'm giving more thought than cutting it back out I think I was talking to Dave this past week about that you know I was like man I got to get rid of coffee again because it's not that it helps I think it's just creating that addiction again to something that I don't need as well since you had since someone asked about coffee I wanted to ask Dr chafee what about like black pepper would you put it kind of similar or would you say that black pepper is worse than coffee because I don't have a problem with coffee but I do with black pepper I love black pepper Yeah well black pepper is uh is quite pro-inflammatory you know and just like coffee coffees being a bean is a seed black Peppers or you know kernels those are seeds as well this is generally where you'll find the the highest concentration of plant defense chemicals is in the seeds um black pepper I'm forgetting all the specifics but yeah it's actually it's actually you know more bad than other things you know is is it more bad than coffee you know hard to say it's probably going to be pretty individual some people are going to be react more to it than others even just white pepper you know it's just not it's not it doesn't have as much uh you know toxins and things like that as black pepper you know and um you know just by the way it's grown and what it's picked and how it's how it's you know um manufactured which is the wrong word but um you know it just it just has a bit slightly less so you know black pepper you know especially if you react badly to it then yeah definitely you know get rid of that but you know even teas you know people people think well you know tea is better than coffee maybe it can it has less caffeine but doesn't necessarily have you know less defense chemicals I mean it's a leaf Leafs are pretty well defended um but you know seeds are really well defended so it's hard to say you know which which one's better or worse just sort of see see how people uh respond individually to them I just like going by Clean Slate I just like I like nothing you know when I have a bit of pepper on something does it change my life no not really I mean it's just it's just it's a bit off my nose gets stuffy I get a bit of you know brain fog and it's just like and it goes away in like 40 minutes or something like that but it's just like yeah that was 40 minutes my life I'll never get back like I don't want that you know that's it for some people like I just I just don't care enough about pepper to make that worth it I agree oh and the Pepper's the one thing that gave me the uh it's got 20 times the oxalates is white pepper and it caused my joints to hurt like crazy and I had I had eaten it I kept it in when I started carnivore up to five months it's the same time I added coffee back in I had to take black pepper out because my joints started hurting well around the same time my joints started hurting again and once I took the black pepper out first it just went away like a no big deal but what about the coffee Dave do you do you drink coffee right yeah I drink way too much coffee um I'm you know I I I've given up coffee before and I know I would do much better if I gave it up but the thing that actually stops me is I know how bad the withdrawal is going to be oh oh because like I just can't keep myself awake when uh when I give it up so it's more reason I should give it up but yeah it's uh I'm stuck with it for the moment absolutely Barb says Dr chafee have you worked with any ladies with lipidemia lymphedema I said edema sorry I am I am doing pretty well but I still struggle with my legs of course yeah it's um it's it's common enough unfortunately um I've had a few patients that have just you know that have sort of had those those sorts of problems and and talk to me about you know is this going to help and this and the other I mean and we don't I don't have any I don't know of any studies and things like that like there's a lot of studies um for keto tons of studies for keto there are few studies for actual carnivore which is a keto diet so you know when I talk about carnivore I'm meaning the ketogenic version of carnivore I'm not talking about you know eating fruit and honey and things like that I'm assuming that that's out of the equation so we can glean a lot of information from these keto uh from these keto studies because you know carnivores keto but um the fact of the matter is I don't I don't know of any studies for keto or carnivore that they will say one way or the other but I anecdotally I have absolutely seen people improve that but it's one of those ones that take longer like actually like all autoimmune issues I've seen improve on on a carnivore diet Hashimoto's is one that that improves but it takes a lot longer for to get resolution like over a year sometimes and Liberty is one of those things that it can it can take quite a long time before it uh before it starts improving and so but you know just a hopeful message is that yes I've seen a lot of people improve uh on that so it's just something to uh you know to give a try and see how it makes you feel and you're going to improve in a lot of other ways and I would expect that to improve down the track as well absolutely uh Hey Elia good to see you friend uh question Dr Chaffee freak accident the carnivore handled the last symptoms of my endometriosis painful menstrual cycles didn't come to carnivore for that how could this be well you know so it's going to regulate your hormones your hormones are going to improve your estrogen and progesterone are going to uh you know go into balance which is very very important for your cycles and you know generally estrogen levels increase and testosterone levels decrease in women especially when you get rid of carbohydrates because carbohydrates raise insulin insulin blocks the conversion of testosterone into estrogen in your ovaries right so you're going to get too high testosterone too low estrogen that's going to be out of balance with your progesterone and that's going to play Mary hell with your cycle right and so um that's great that you notice that I you know I've sort of seen a mixed bag with endometriosis I've certainly seen people you know improve certainly symptomatically because it's going to reduce a lot of inflammation as well which reduces pain it just reduces your your experience of of pain if something is you know if you have an injury or you have arthritis or something like that you're just going to experience less pain because there's less inflammation there and so you know endometriosis is very much hormonally driven and so this is going to improve your hormones going to optimize your hormones and so that can that can definitely improve that and also reduce your inflammation that will also improve your symptomatic expression of things like endometriosis so that's that's really great that you've improved on that let's see here Dr Chaffey thank you you have been a huge help to me on the new carnivore Journey six weeks I'll be 62 in a few days getting in shape but I have really hard time getting up sleep averaging six hours advice uh yeah well first of all that's that's awesome I'm glad that you're doing so well and um you know sleep is uh you know most people do better honestly maybe you know you guys can share your experiences as well I my sleep certainly has improved dramatically but there are other things that that do help them these are just the Classic things that we know about that we've sort of figured out uh before this which is go to bed at the same time every night turn off lights an hour before you go to sleep um you know you can get those blue blocking sung you know sunglasses and things like that that can help uh you know drown out that that stimulus uh to wake the hell up you get that blue light in your eyes your eyes are just telling you it's just telling your brain wake up you know the sun's out and um you know and so doing that consistently and then wearing a sleep mask even a little bit of light even just the light on your phone charging will will disturb your sleep and there's been plenty of studies showing that that it disturbs sleep and it and it disrupts the sleep cycles and things like that you don't get down into like you know the Deep Sleep States you know just a little bit of light in the room so you can get the same amount of sleep and you know you won't you won't be nearly as rested so I've found that the sleep mask that just changed my life I just love that thing now and it's also really good too because it's just a you know somatic signal to your body that's just like it's time to go to sleep you put that sleep mask on your body's just like right it's Lights Out it's time to go to bed so those are those are the things you can do and um and that's what I would do I just I would just make it consistent I'd make it you know this routine just the same thing with Clockwork every time and optimize your your your sort of Perry sleep State and and that should that should help then there are other things you know if that's not quite enough you know taking a small dose of Melatonin or something at the same time every single night one before you want to be asleep with the lights off melatonin doesn't work if the lights are on and so that's another thing people have all these lights on which is blaring you know light all over the place you know this unnatural light and then we we try to turn off the lights and go to bed and go huh why can't I go to sleep because you just destroyed all melatonin you can't even you can't even secrete it uh until those lights are off and gone and so uh that's that's what I would do kill wake up man are you you over there tracking dude no yeah I'm tracking the Buffalo still yeah so a lot of people might not know s now because he started in January of this year I know it's past 82 because it was it was there so where you at now buddy right well I was 400 at my house I was 492 but January I was 486 and today I weighed and I was 401 so I'm about to be in the 300 club and I'm really excited about it so I'm down to 85 pounds what's one of the biggest things that you've seen uh that you weren't expecting when you came to carnivore Kip uh my the pain that was in my right shoulder it went away within like two weeks time and I had it used to want to lock up on me and I didn't have any strength in it and um I had went to physical therapists and I went to Orthopedic Specialists and they had said all kind of stuff like I had um arthritis in it and I was kind of bone on bone and eventually I'd need a replacement and they said I had bone spurs and then suddenly two weeks after I started carnivore it just stopped hurting and I knew then I was like even if I don't lose a lot of weight I knew I needed to lose a ton of weight but even if I didn't lose a bunch of weight that alone the pain in my shoulder being gone was worth it to me to just keep going you what about you Dave man what's what's the one thing that you've noticed and I mean I know you guys talk about it but since we got everybody from every channel whatever coming together and you know whatever um biggest thing for me was probably the arthritis clearing up in my knee um and you know that's just changed everything you know because you don't have the pain when you're walking when you kneel down you don't have that pain anymore like that's one one of the memories that stays with me uh that's kind of subconscious things is um when I go to kneel down now I still kind of jerk back going this is gonna hurt but then you know I have to keep going no it's not going to hurt it's it's okay you know so kneeling down crossing my legs that kind of thing all that's just like when I was a teenager now it's awesome yeah right that's you daughter Chaffey what's one of the best things that you well I mean you know as far as that you've seen and uh eating this way well yeah well for me you know I mean I mean just right away I mean I just just you know it's hard to sort of say exactly what it was but I just felt so much better I just you know two weeks into it I just felt like a different breed of human I just my body worked differently I had tons of energy I just felt so good whereas normally I just sort of had this just just Baseline level of garbage that I felt I didn't really feel great and you know I was I was 38 so I'm like oh gosh I'm getting into middle age like all this sort of stuff and you know just within two weeks it was just gone it's just everything gone I just I felt like I was 22 again doing carnivore I felt better at 38 than I did 28 playing professional rugby and working out all the time and I just I just felt amazing and my body worked great I had my back pain was gone I didn't have joint pain it was just like I just felt like a kid again and I you know and I was just like right it's time to go to play some rugby and uh and I just went right back out so it was just just physically how I felt mentally how I felt my you know brain fog gone you know when I was studying for the mcats I um for some damn reason that was probably the one time in my life that I wasn't like just eating just tons and tons of meat it was just it was just I found it was just very easy and quick just to cook some like pasta was like oh yeah whole grains this thing I'm like all right I'll get some like whole grain pasta and and it was just really easy you know I was just like boil up the whole thing of noodles you know put some you know lame ass sauce on it and uh and I just I just eat that and I just studied I was just studying at 14 hours a day and so that that's what I would do and I remember I'd wake up fine and wake up fresh I'd have all this sleep and it'd be great and be studying studying studying then at some point I just have all this brain fog I'm like what is going on like why doesn't my brain work and I remember thinking about it the whole time I was just like I've got enough sleep I'm not sick you know I don't know what's going on I woke up refreshed now I'm just like tired and foggy I'd take a nap in the middle of the day and it just I never understood it gone all gone you know and I thought at the time I was like well maybe it's just allergies well maybe it's you know it's a food so so you know once I got once I got rid of all that all of it went away my asthma went away my eyes been you know like like bloodshot red forever and I was like oh yeah you're smoking me like no [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm not thank you and uh you know it just really bugged the hell out of me and so uh you know now you know I might get I might get you know some redness but it's not like just just you know beat red all the time which was really annoying and most of the time you know my eyes are my eyes are aren't red at all so you know if I get really tired or something like that or first thing in the morning whatever but you know all these things they just improve dramatically and you know I just you know I have you know a limitless energy I was back to when I was you know when I was 22 you know just playing you know just sprinting for eight hours a day and just feeling amazing doing it and um you know just having that you know just that feeling that physically again was just amazing and I still feel it you know so it's just it's just I don't know it's just incredible like I just I can't even put my finger on like one thing to say like this is what it is it's just overall my entire life and and the feeling of my body change it I mean on a superficial note it's never been easier in my life to maintain a low uh body fat percentage in a muscular physique ever you know I I have no I don't work out I don't have time to work out and so you know I go to the gym once every few weeks maybe and I haven't consistently gone to the gym in over a year and yet you know I look like I'm in better shape than than most people who go to the gym regularly why well it's because my body's working properly I'm feeding but it's supposed to be fed and you know I've worked out for decades you know so I have a I have a base there that now I'm just sort of you know like Michelangelo like you know there's there's something under all this Stone it just had to Chisel away that extra bits you know so all my extra bits are gone and they're not coming back because of how I'm meaning so I I think all of those reasons are you know uh yeah those have been the most most um noticeable for me I mean I didn't have any uh very serious medical issues thankfully uh but that you know is what I'm most impressed by you know seeing my patients and you know reversing things that are not supposed to be reversed you know seeing a woman uh who I'll have on my my podcast I'll be you know uh putting that video out in the next few weeks um who was in a wheelchair because of her Ms you know she was crippled she was actually crippled she was in her 30s she's you know uh and she's a PhD and and um uh you know in science-based field and she does a lot of high-level research and you know very very bright lady and she was crippled I mean her life was basically you know being curtail because of this disease she's not only walking again and out of the wheelchair she's back doing play one year right so that's and and then on MRI her lesions her Ms lesions the result so this is not just her subjective like oh she just you know you know drank a cup of concrete and just toughened up he's just like you know she's objectively improving right and and lesions are healing and she's healing and so that that to me is is the most amazing thing and that that's the that's the part that I get most excited for is when people are reversing things like that I just don't know like I got a book my helpful and stuff and I talk about it at nauseating with with everybody on the channel but like and I'm not gonna go into all of it because most of most people have heard it and some people haven't and I promise you I'll cover it later but like whenever I hear stuff like that it always makes me wonder like what more do people need than these experiences that they're seeing you know what I'm saying and I know that it's not going out to everybody I know that there's a lot of people and that's what drives me is to get the message out to other folks who have not heard about this because I was one of those people a year ago and that drives me and you know and it's a passion of mine you know it's exciting to me to be able to do this from where I started to where I am you know and um you know we could go on and on and on but like to have the testimony of someone who couldn't walk now a year later doing ballet to have someone who you know was having in that dark deep depression come out of it I lost 245 pounds you know to have Dave you know be able to do the things that he's done and killed you know I mean it's amazing to hear these testimonies and I'll I'll say it time blue in the face but I'm gonna say it quickly because we got a lot of super chats and I'm getting really far behind but it's okay I'll get you I'll get you um you know the testimonies are amazing and I urge everybody no matter where you're watching this from right after you hit the like button go down in the description and tell us what car what carnivore keto Kita bore has done for you that you weren't expecting put that into put that in the uh the comment section for us we'd love to hear what you have to say about it definitely just uh thank you for all you do thank you Allison I appreciate that and I appreciate you uh as well my friend thank you for watching and hanging out with us tonight stank ass cat my favorite dog tearing it up again yeah absolutely he's got to be talking about you I I'm not the dog tonight he's always teared up man this guy's brilliant and I enjoy learning from him and hanging out

        "transcript": "what it needs and let it do the rest thank you for the what it needs and let it do the rest thank you for the Super Chat my friend you'll get there hanging stay strong and keep pushing forward I will say that you'll get there John would you gentlemen agree that you must be in a calorie deficit to lose fat foreign no I I think we need to I think we need to establish sort of definition and terms here as well so you know what what is the calorie calorie is a unit of of heat energy released when you burn something in a lab so that's not how we run we're not we're not combustion engines right so a calorie is a unit of energy it's not a unit of mass so you know this is not something that weighs anything so calories don't weigh anything and you can't eat calories you're not going to swallow electricity right so these is this chemical energy that's released when you split a bond you know when you're burning things and it's releasing all this energy right so that's not that does not translate directly into you know fat gain and loss or anything like that so you know we are not combustion engines we are we are chemical um chemical energy factories and so you know all of these nutrients are chemicals they're complex organic chemicals and they have complex chemical interactions in your body there are dozens of different carbohydrates they all have completely different chemical interactions in your body about chemical interactions there are dozens of different amino acids they all have very different and complex biochemical interactions there are hundreds of fatty acids they all have different and complex biochemical interactions in your body so you cannot boil these things down to just how much energy is released when you burn them it's it doesn't work like that um you know so you know but the way that you're describing this is like basically if you eat too much do you need to eat less than your body requires for it to normal running in order to tap into your fat stores that's a different question right so uh and and you know so I know what you're asking but you know it is important I think to make those distinctions because a calorie is not a calorie is not a calorie and so it is important what you're eating not just how much you're eating and so um yes you I mean you you eat more than your body demands it's going to store things right but when you're on a carnivore diet when you're eating what you're supposed to eat and you're getting those biological signals to stop eating it's very very very difficult to overeat and so your body will perfectly regulate that your body will regulate and tell you how much how much food it wants to come in and and it's going to use your own body fat unless you're one of those one percent of people that have very deranged metabolism and uh and hormones that just need time to heal and get normal and then you'll then you'll start burning that stuff off but a lot of people will their body will naturally tell them hey this is how much we want in and this is how much we're going to use in our savings right and you'll start losing weight um and so in in that sense like yeah you know you're gonna you're eating less than your body demands and it's going to use some of the fat as well but if you eat too much too low and you eat less than your body is demanding you won't lose weight faster necessarily you'll actually lower your metabolism and you can actually stall your weight loss and um you know so that's that's a problem too so you want to give your body as much as it needs and then it will figure out the rest um and so that's so this is really the only thing that way that you can you don't have to count macros and all that sort of stuff like we said because your body will do that for you it will just say this is how much this is how much we need and so this is how much you're going to get so you can overeat on a carnivore diet but it is really really difficult like you will just really not do it like you'll start eating meat and you'll get to a point where like I hate this I don't want to eat this anymore and some people run into that they think that well this is how much I'm supposed to eat that's how much I need to eat and they don't like it and they're like I get halfway through and it takes me two hours depends I'm just struggling to finish it well you were done two hours ago then because your body was screaming at you to stop eating like you don't need this stop eating don't put in your damn mouth you know like animals in the wild I mean they're not going to do that they're not just gonna be like you know uh you know just like just ragey I'm gonna finish this you know it's just they just stop you know and so you should do that too and uh you know and then you know again it is is very difficult for your body to absorb fat when you run out of bile it's very difficult you can absorb some of it like especially like MCT so the the medium chain triglycerides are more easily absorbed without bile but it's still I'm a very small percentage of these things get in so yes you can overeat fat but it's you will get torrential diarrhea for doing that because so much of it will be coming out that you're going to get very very loose stools and you can overeat other things uh if you're if you're willing to force feed yourself for for two hours to finish a meal it's difficult though and so you know you will you know yes if you want to get technical you're eating less than you technically demand for your your your biological activities that day but you're not you don't you you are not restricting your eating your body is restricting your eating by giving you negative feedback when you eat too much so I would still just listen to that I would still just only eat meat if you're not eating carbohydrates that is because if you're eating carbohydrates you are going to derange that you're going to raise your insulin you're going to block your leptin and you're going to increase your hunger signals and so that's not what you want to do so this is just and again so when I say carnivore I mean not eating fruit not eating honey no carbohydrates just meat just water if you do that you can listen to your body hunger signals anybody will take care of everything for you 100 percent good stuff we got 608 people in in here if you guys have just joined it put a q by your question we're gonna try to get to it I'm far behind so you know honestly uh like the video share it subscribe whatever Channel you're on if you're not already subscribed Where Have You Been check these guys out um Dave you guys doing all right man doing good um I'm just stepping a bit of a giggle to myself I love that description of the torrential diarrhea I think that's quite apps yeah yeah so it's like yeah Dr chafee's answer was above my pay grade so uh I'm glad you didn't ask me what I thought about that because I was gonna uh just refer y'all back to his comments mentioned it I was getting ready it definitely goes back you can try to overeat you can try to overeat that but you'll do you'll have some good stories to tell about it probably oh man I'm telling you it's something oh yeah do it now sorry yeah don't do that don't don't try that experiment at work anyway you know you have any special advice for uh uh I almost said wrong Elders danielos yeah others downloads yeah so that's a connective tissue disorder they don't make uh collagen you know that's that's tight and strong as other people and so they get uh hyper mobile joints and they get sort of you know stretchy skin and things like that um and it can cause a lot of injuries you can get early arthritis and things like that just just joint pain dislocations and things like that and um you know um so you know it's uh it's beneficial for some things you know it's uh you know a lot of like ballet dancers and things like that because it would be very very stretchy as one of the kids so they do well early on but then they have really bad joint issues in their early 20s and their careers don't last too long uh those people uh don't uh yeah so special advice for others downloads eat a lot of meat and um you know because the thing is is that we don't know exactly why but what I have noticed is that when people with Elders downloads go carnivore or just eat a lot more meat in general uh their symptoms improve and they stop getting as many joint dislocations and joint pain and what I suspect is happening there is that they you know if they were left to their own devices making their own collagen that it wouldn't it you know they they aren't able to do that as well but if you're just eating a whole bunch of collagen and all the precursors for it you don't need to make your own because you have all the building blocks right there and you and you just make a good strong collagen and then after a few months you're going to start replacing out this connective tissue with stronger better more healthy collagen and you're going to see see yourself improving symptomatically so I I've seen a number of people online that have told me that they've improved but I have I have three patients myself that I see in person that with ehlers downloads um and and I have a few other patients that I that I see you know as online consultations with ehlers-danlos you know they are all improving on a carnivore diet the three that I have um you know with me in person I've had them longer and they've all said that they don't have any joint dislocations any longer right and so they've improved dramatically on this um you know one gentleman uh had a pretty pretty rough case he was saying that every morning that he woke up one of his joints was was dislocated you know his shoulder could be like wrapped around the back of his head or you know his fingers are all sideways or his toe or his ankle or his knee just hit you know like major major joints being dislocated every single morning and um that's not fun you know after a few months none he hasn't had a single one and then he got sick he had like a bit of a flu and so he felt sorry for himself and he's you know he's a farm boy and so he was just like grew up on porridge and and things like that and so he was just like well I'm just gonna have I'm just gonna have some of that and uh so we had some some porch for a week all of a sudden he started getting joint pain and a few dislocations like whoop okay gotta get rid of that and um and went back onto the meat and then he just threw all of the all of that stuff out and went to his mom was like you just got to throw this stuff out this stuff is this is this stuff is toxic this is what happened to me just get it out and um so that's what I've seen so yeah so just just eating a lot more meat I've spoken to Dr Baker Dr Sean Baker and he was saying that that uh he had some patience with ehlers downloads that just by eating a lot more meat that seemed to improve things as well so it didn't even need to be full carnivore I think that uh probably best if you do go full carnivore but uh he found that that some of his patients were improving just by eating more meat and I've seen people that go full carnivore actually get complete resolution and aren't symptomatic with other stainless anymore so yeah I just keep going uh keto is great just make sure it's very high meat based keto and vegetables are fine as compared to you know carbohydrates you're going to be in ketosis that's great but you know just remember these things have defense chemicals especially spinach tons of oxalates and things like that and so you know just because it doesn't have carbohydrates doesn't mean that it's uh safe but and it's certainly not good for you um it's I I do think that it's best to get rid of all of those things and just eat meat but you know but keto is definitely a step in the right direction very strong step in the right direction and as long as it's very heavily meat based then I I would expect her to keep improving he absolutely I beg my mom to do Keto I mean as far as you know versus a standard American diet that's why I try to urge people man no matter what you do you know if if keto can you can sustain keto do that you know um get on it do something you're moving in the right direction get that ketogenic diet in oh I don't I don't know what your hard cut off is for today man I didn't even ask but we got I got so far behind why'd you guys let me get so far behind what's happening it's great whoops struggling for years to stay sober from alcohol by day forward eating just beef all cravings and desire for alcohol are gone that's awesome on why meat diet can cause relief from addiction by the way down 24 pounds in 14 days been sober since starting carnivore man that's awesome I just want to say congratulations to you first of all to tell you that that is amazing Being Sober like I mean Dave man you you that's I'll let you take that one man because I mean that was something that you were doing as well when you came to and you got a lot better experience than I have with it yeah so look I mean I would just say to that I think that well first congratulations [Music] um awesome achievement but uh I think the thing with a ketogenic diet is it just seems to give you more self-control and I'm not sure if it's something that happens you know um with with your mind or something or it's just the fact that you're satiated most of the time whatever it is it just seems to give you a better a better feeling of self-control um Dr Chaffey can you speak to that at all do you do you have any uh knowledge of that kind of thing yeah no so there actually have been studies with with ketogenic diets and of course carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet so we can sort of gain a lot of information from these studies um that uh have shown with specifically alcohol addiction showing that the people that we're going through alcohol withdrawals and uh and and struggling with addiction with you know controlled trial right so you had you had you know two groups and they found that very interestingly that the group that was doing Keto that they um subjectively you know felt that it was their Cravings were far reduced and their desire for alcohol was bought was greatly reduced um and just on their self-reporting and they found that it was easier to come off and to you know abstain and most importantly because when you're when you're coming off alcohol if you're heavily addicted it can it can actually be dangerous um you know as scary as heroin is it's actually not dangerous to come off you just feel like garbage and uh but it's not actually dangerous it's not going to kill you coming off benzodiazepines or alcohol if you're heavily heavily addicted you can actually get you know go into delirium tremens you start hallucinating you start getting seizures and you can actually die from those seizures so it actually is dangerous to come off if uh if if you're heavily heavily addicted and you need medications and so when so these people were in patients and they were coming off and they were heavily addicted uh so that's a very good example it's not just someone who just has a couple drinks on the weekend I should probably stop you know these are these are people that had you know serious dependency issues um and so they were in the hospital and they were they were requiring medication for their detox you know detoxification um and uh to stay out of the DTs and the group in the keto group needed less medications right so it wasn't just their subjective experience like oh I actually I feel okay medically chemically they needed less you know help they needed less medication so there is something going on there uh with with our our brain energy and our brain health and things like that that um uh that ketogenic diet brain running on ketones just seems to help and uh you know these sorts of addictions and things like that you know uh Professor Chris Palmer from Harvard uh has you know did his book uh brain energy talking about the mitochondria in the neurons in your brain cells and how that seriously affects psychiatric disorders but also addiction you know substance addiction and eating addictions and how you know when you are on a ketogenic diet this improves the function and number of your mitochondria and that improves all of these different sorts of issues that people have and so yeah there is actually objective proof that being on a ketogenic diet which a carnivore diet is the best kind I think that this will improve your your ability to come off in a way from these addictive substances and stay off them and and not need them in the first place and so that's that's absolutely fantastic and you know it is amazing to see uh that you know in just that short period of time you know you've lost a ton of weight and you know you've come off alcohol you don't have any cravings and that's and that's amazing so that's really exciting and I'm really happy uh to hear that you've had that experience and keep it up honestly believe with the overall addiction stuff outside of the you know what you just covered like our body's ability the way that we we get to control it when and what we put in our mouths what we don't get to control is how our body reacts to it and by that being subconsciously effective in our bodies and taking place you know I so much in society we people have the desire to never be satisfied with anything they you could never have too much money you can never have too much power you can never have too much of all these different issues but when it comes to your diet when you put the right stuff in eventually your body starts making the decisions that you've had enough and it's really hard to you know subvert that system and so it's really effective at dealing with addictions because you can't overdo that to a certain degree you may be able to do it short term for a while but you're not going to continue on and on doing it forever your body's gonna start you know giving you that feedback on it so um I'd like to add some of my personal experiences yeah I just like to share like for me personally so I quit alcohol well it during my youth you know I kind of got a little wild and uh I picked up some bad habits and like drinking and smoking and doing some drugs and all that stuff and and of course eating junk food because I've done that my whole life I mean you're not 300 pounds in Middle School unless you eat terrible so um so I I've done all those things as well with the drugs and alcohol and the nicotine and everything so I actually was that I can't speak from it from quitting everything at the same time but I'll say that I quit everything else even before I came to carnivore so um that just shows me that how much of an addiction the carbs and the sugar really are because I was able to quit alcohol different drugs I was able to quit cigarettes and the last things that I was holding on to was my popcorn and my chips and my cookies and my ice cream and all that stuff and I kept hanging on to that for years and years and years and now that I've let that go it's been the best decision ever so honestly I feel like for most people if you can do give carnivore a try and you can do this any other addiction that you might have most likely you'll be able to take care of it if you can do this you can do a lot of things absolutely good stuff I agree brother well said very good and a lot of it too man is realizing that it so many people don't understand that food is not just a necessity but it is an addiction if it's almost like the light bulb goes off at some point they realize oh my gosh this is an addiction to the sugar and the carb side of it yes well you need food you do not need sugar and carbs it's just a fact you just don't our bodies can run perfectly fine without them anytime our body needs glucose or you know you have gluconeogenesis that can make that happen out of whatever other materials you're gonna give it so there's always that I think we got just a few more and we're going to wrap this thing up I do want to cover all this and I know there's a lot we didn't get to and I apologize we will be doing it again I promise you know so Christina says I managed to decrease my blood pressure with carnivore been off meds for two weeks now however I started having bad orthostatic hypotension any idea why uh you usually that's just just well it could be a couple reasons but um uh it can be that you're still on to many medications right so if you're if you're on blood pressure medications and and your your blood pressure is naturally going to start coming down if you're still taking those medications or you're you haven't reduced those medications enough you're going to get the other problem which is too low and that's usually the orthostatic hypotension is when you stand up and then your blood pressure will drop it will just just change when you go from sitting to standing and normally your body can sort of adjust pretty quickly so your brain doesn't lose perfusion but if there's a bit of a delay and it takes a few seconds longer uh then then your brain doesn't get enough blood and you get you know dizzy and lightheaded so I mean people can get that normally you just stand up too fast and going oh gosh you know my head it uh this happens to them much more regularly often that's because your your blood pressure medications are too high um if you are off all your blood pressure medications then it's dehydration it'll be a combination of both so I would I would definitely take a look at your blood pressure medications um first so been off meds for two weeks now that's great so now address the other thing which is dehydration so um so I would uh yeah just up the water and uh you know just just take it a bit easy your body's been on these meds for a long time you know just take a little bit of time to to readjust to to normal life good job getting getting off the blood pressure medicine I come off one of mine I got two more that I want to come off of uh that I'm working towards and my blood pressure is pretty low now but I remember going on the blood I had the same problem whenever I went on the blood pressure medication a couple of number of years back I was still working EMS and getting on the ambulance and every once in a while I would bend down to do something you know job related even and I would get light-headed standing back up felt like I was going to pass out so you know there's always that let's see oh did I I thought I hit did I did I already read that one I'll read it again I thought I did but I I think I passed it Dr Chase for consults with with you if I did my labs and show it to you can you come up with a meal plan based on how I should do carnivore daily and address health issues I have such as fiber and cost of uh yeah well you know I certainly certainly happy to take a little blood to give give um you know some advice on that you know it's difficult to give you know very specific uh medical uh advice on those consultations because of just licensing issues you know if you're in a different country or somewhere else that you know like you know it's uh and I you know I don't have all the information available you know it's it's more difficult to do that and uh and I'm not too sure how the legalities work if I'm doing a consultation with someone in a different country and all that sort of stuff so um but you know at the end of the day um regardless of what your labs are and regardless of what your uh your specific medical issues are I can give you a meal plan right now and fatty meat until it stops tasting good um and don't eat anything else and that that's the meal plan that's going to be the meal plan for everybody in every situation but if you you know add some some questions about your labs and things like that you know would be happy to sort of go through that uh but that would be my advice at the end of the day is that you know because that's what I think everyone will benefit by I you know I've said this before but I've you won't find an example in nature of two members of the same species with different optimal diets if they have different optimal diets they are different species and that's just a biological fact and so we are not different species we're all humans and Homo sapiens sapiens who are very very closely related in fact and so we are all going to have the same optimal diet and that's what I would I would suggest for everybody to be on 100 good stuff also forgot to mention that the reason I am on Carnivore are Dr chapey and Dr Berry thank you that's great well glad to hear that that's awesome let me swing back over here and I'll see I got so far behind on the regular stuff man y'all were supposed to keep me in line better you guys we'll have we'll have to discuss it no I know there was a lot we didn't get to I hope you guys enjoyed the show I hope you guys uh um got something that you can use something practical that you can apply to every day you know that's what while we get on here that's why we share our experiences uh we share uh the knowledge that we do and and we love it man so um Kip you got anything you want to add for we say goodnight to everybody now I just want to say uh stick with it if you're already on the journey and uh if you haven't started carnivore diet you should try it maybe this video might encourage you to give it a try there's so many health benefits I've had like I recently found out that I'm not diabetic anymore I'm not you know I'm not having to take certain medicines things are getting better I don't have to take Tums all the time so uh it's working for me and it can work for you if you haven't tried it give it a shot [Music] they will write you boy um look yeah just take uh kids comments just stick with it um you'll find if you just keep testing what you're eating within like a carnivore reading style you'll eventually find what's working for you and um it is going to do wonders for your health and also you know just like to thank everybody including Dr Chaffey for joining us and everyone for tuning in 100 yeah doctor you you got anything you want to add for we before before we call it a night no uh you know it's great to you know to just just be here with you guys and hear all your your stories as well and it's always great to to have everyone's you know Insight on on these sorts of questions because everyone has a bit of a different input um you know on these things and uh and can speak from their own experiences which is which is also great um I I did I did just want to say one thing I actually tried to answer this in the chats but uh there was there was a question from uh a"

        "title": "Live Chat with Dr Anthony Chaffee, Shawn White, Dave Mac, and Kipp BBQ!",
        "transcript": "chats but uh there was there was a question from uh a chats but uh there was there was a question from uh a super chat from Taco Phillips or fillings uh he said that um any info on kidneys electrolyte insulin signaling from a fruit based carbohydrate so I'm assuming that he means that you know if you're doing carnivore and and you have some fruit and carbohydrates what's that going to do to your insulin and your your electrolyte signaling um it'll yeah it can it can sort of yeah there you go and so yeah I can mess it up right because you know insulin is is involved in um in uh sort of recouping electrolytes uh from the the microtubules in your in your kidneys right so it's very complex but you can find diagrams on where electrolytes go in and out all the way down these little microtubules in the kidneys and we had to study these for the mcats and then in medical school but um they're they're horribly complex and I tend to just ignore them because I don't care but um uh but you know insulin is involved in that and but there's so many different areas that these electrolytes go in and out and things like that and they're not all uh regulated by insulins just parts of them are regulated with insulin and so if you are going to start messing around with car with carbohydrates so fruit based carbohydrates are still carbohydrates you may not absorb as many of them because you're getting uh some Fiber with that if you're eating the whole fruit as you're not going to absorb as much fructose and glucose um as you would otherwise but if you're drinking fruit juice that's a fruit based carbohydrate you're gonna you're gonna just Mainline all of that stuff as well and so your insulin will go up and then insulin will you know tell you to store or you know pull back more electrolytes so there there's going to be a transition period and some people notice that there's a noticeable transition period when they're you know going keto or going carnivore and their insulin starts going back to normal levels and actually start losing too many electrolytes and this is why people sometimes recommend that you should take electrolytes early on in in the keto adaption phase practically from my standpoint you know as um from what I've seen I haven't actually seen that really happen I just tell people like hey look if you're having a problem you can take electrolytes but most people don't have a problem your body can regulate these things because you you get different signals your insulin starts coming down it's not just down you haven't just sucked it all out of your body you know it's uh it it comes down gradually and your body sort of adjusts as you go you know people fast all the time and their insulin goes down to a normal level in 24 hours and they don't all just get horrible electrolyte disturbances and end up in the hospital which is what will happen if you get a serious electrolyte disturbance and so I don't see it practically happening all that much our body is pretty damn good at regulating these sorts of things in both directions so if you're not eating carbohydrates for a long time or as soon as when you start your insulin is going to come down there may be a bit of a of a hiccup in your electrolytes maybe for some people and then most other people's won't have that problem but you can always just take a bit more electrolytes easy and then if you you start adding in you know fruit and honey and those sorts of things if that's your desire um your insulin is going to go up and you're going to start pulling these things back in again that doesn't necessarily mean your potassium is going to go too high and you're going to have a cardiac arrest which is you know this is what where lethal injection is right you we anesthetize people and we give them a big dose of potassium chloride and it stops their heart right so if your potassium is too high it kills you right potassium's too low it kills you and so you know this is a very serious thing uh and that's you know people are not dropping dead when they fast or go keto and then come back from keto right or come back from fasting so it's very rare your body will regulate this stuff pretty damn well and um because it has to because you die if it doesn't and you know and we go from you know Feast to famine all the time that's that's just the that's just the story of nature is that sometimes you have access to food and other times you don't and so your body has to be very very good at regulating that stuff and it is and so by and large your body will will uh regulate your electrolytes uh very well even if you're eating fruit and especially if you're not eating fruit I hope that answers that question especially if you're not eating fruit I'll put the emphasis I'll tell you what you know that's one thing that me and my brother disagree on was is the fruit he does he does uh carnivore but he still keeps the fruit in but he's healthy otherwise he you know he works out every single day he was like I said I made a video about him earlier um Special Forces he's retired special for you know he's in great shape and has been you know most of his life um however I keep telling man watch that fruit Frugal sneaky man well you know if if you're only eating meat and you're only eating fruit outside of meat like you're doing better than almost everyone else and probably feeling better than he's ever felt in his whole life too so he's like how can this be wrong I feel so much better and you know I get that um you might be interesting you know sort of you know see if he'll he'll accept like juices maybe hey take a month off see how you feel and see if that makes a difference you want to add back in some you know some honeydew melon after that you know fine but you know it's uh you know at least you know take a look and see what happens well absolutely I agree and I gotta have something to get on him about I mean he can't do everything right right yeah [Laughter] off really is that something you can lower it over and look well you know it's good about that that's right oh man this has been awesome guys I enjoyed it I
