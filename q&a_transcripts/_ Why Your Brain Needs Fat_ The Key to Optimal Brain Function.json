    "transcript": "[Music] Sr says my two and a half-year-old son is nonverbal recently diagnosed with autism now follows a strict diet of fatty meat and eggs cooked in butter and ghee and fruits one is butter and ghee uh with the casan okay and two do sugars in coconut water and fruits impact his development thanks so um answer the second one first just the sugars in anything is are going to uh kick him out of ketosis and they're going to change his brain from running on ketones which are op which are the most optimal uh for his brain to running on glucose which is the secondary energy source and his suboptimal is not as good and will actually slow down his mitochondria not being in ketosis will uh curtail his U mitochondrial development and neural development as well you want those ketones especially in uh growing brains have to have it so ketones are the primary energy source of the cortex and two-thirds of the brain and even when there's enough uh glucose um even when there's enough glucose there is uh your brain will exclude or those parts of the brain will exclusively run on ketones still and so you want to you want those ketones in the brain and also ketones cross the blood brain barrier reconstitute into fatty acids which then make up the physical Matrix of the brain so you know 60 70% % of the brain is made out of ketones or or out of fat I mean and so it's uh it's very important to get that so any sugars from anything so sugar is sugar is sugar is sugar is sugar you know the glucose and fructose in h fruit and coconut water is exactly the same as the fructose and glucose in high fructose corn syrup and table sugar and honey so uh and the glucose in uh starches is the same glucose as in fruits and everything else so it is the same there are some other vitamins and and good things that come with those fruits and the coconut water but the the sugar is the same and so I would I would definitely avoid that um as far as the butter and ghee is generally great yeah I mean if he the the casan is just going to be in the butter it's going to be out of the ghee so that's the idea of of ghee is that it's um it takes out the milk solid it takes out those proteins and so it won't have that casin in there there's not too much in butter but there is there there are a little bit of the proteins and the milk solids in there most people do fine on that most even with autoimmune issues people do do really well on that um you can try it you can do trial and error you can just try uh cooking in ghee or cooking in um Tallow grass-fed Tallow and uh and see if he does better you know try it you know few weeks on few weeks off but by and large for most people uh butter and ghee are fine uh the fruits um you know I would I would avoid you know especially the sweet fruits because the the key here is is a you want to be just providing just the the optimal nutrition for him um which is meat but you also he wants to be in ketosis as well and so it's really important to do that for his developing brain and and the longer you're in ketosis the more you turn over your um mitochondria and the organel inside and switch them out for better faster stronger versions of themselves that uh will work better and will help the brain develop better and uh some people like Professor Chris Palmer from Harvard uh argues that a major issue with autism and the mdev of these neurons is a mitochondrial disorder and so you really need to be in ketosis long term after several months on ketosis in ketosis um you will have four times the number of mitochondria and they'll be four times as effective there's a very very big uh benefit to being in ketosis so I would avoid the the sweet fruits definitely and um and and hopefully that uh really helps them a lot it certainly does help most people who do it and so good luck with that um I did also want to to to give a shout out before get going to Alex from uh uh carnivore for Life channel uh it's it's coming up on his two-year car aniversary which is really uh fantastic that's a great milestone and accomplishment um and so congratulations to Alex and um you he's got a he's got a really great story um and so if people want to go and check his channel out over on YouTube um they can it's um but he's a really nice guy and he's doing really great uh stuff and he's doing just really well himself so it's his two-year anniversary so everyone please say congratulations to him in the in the chat and um and uh yeah hopefully he's feeling feeling as good as uh as uh as he can at two years which I mean after two years on Carnivore basically feel pretty damn amazing and um so congratulations to Alex hey everyone really happy to announce a new sponsor for the show and for everybody down in Australia Stockman Stakes who are delivering highquality grass fed and finished pasture raised beef and other meats flash frozen and vacuum sealed tood door something that I've been enjoying a lot

today for free order of beef mints or another specialty gift along with your order at Stockman steak.com Au and I'll see you over there thanks guys if the keto diet effectively treats drug resistant epilepsy would it work on those who take anti-seizure medications my colleague has been on anti-seizure drugs for 25 years and has never heard of a keto diet thank you for your time and passion yeah that that is something that really bugs the hell out of me um they just basically just said you know drugs are easier just just go down that route they work the the the treatment for epilepsy was ketogenic diet and then they started getting drugs and the drug company started pushing that and and just saying oh no no just just use the drugs just use the drugs and so we started teaching people differently in residencies and uh and and and directing research away from ketogenic diets helping epilepsy uh Professor Thomas CED when he was doing his post-doctoral uh work over at uh Yale he was in the neurology department there and and he was doing research on ketogenic diets and epilepsy and the and the head of the department just said oh now we we've got good drugs for that now you know it's deadend research don't worry about it you know it's easy just you know give them drugs drugs work you know don't don't worry about that um so you know I mean that's uh you know maybe he could have been well-meaning but I I I just I think that that's almost certainly due to his the influence of the drug companies you know having him sort of push research away from uh any any alternatives um but you know Johns Hopkins um at least last time I checked I found a paper that they published it was a while ago is an older paper but um you know that at least at the time they were saying hey you know this is this is still a really good treatment modality this is still something that we use uh it's not just for treatment resistant um epilepsy it was for all epilepsy um it's just that now it's just like well you treatment resistant and if somebody knows about it and thinks about it they say oh well you could try this not everybody does a lot of people just don't even think about it don't even know about it which is crazy to me um or they don't suggest it because oh but if you stop doing ketogenic diet then you get seizures again you stop taking your freaking anti-seizure medication you'll get seizures again so I mean what the what's your point it really bugs me um so sorry for swearing but like it bugs me because I've I've seen neurologists um argue with parents who want to put their kids on a ketogenic diet they're no no no just keep taking drugs just keep taking drugs it's like what the hell is wrong with you they're having seizures on the drugs and they're and they're desperate to help their child and you're telling them that they're going to hurt their kid and kill their kid by doing something that you admit will work or should work and can help oh but if they if they stop then they're going to get massive seizures first of all no the longer you go without a seizure the less likely you are to have a seizure first of all second of all um you know just just getting out of ketosis it's not like it's just like this rebound effect you oh my god worse seizure ever no it's it it gets better and also don't come off the the diet then that's easy right you know it's just like not coming off the drugs no you have to take the drugs you're going to have a seizure again all right well then don't come off the drugs oh but don't go on a ketogenic diet because if you come off a ketogenic diet then then you'll have a you you have a seizure like the same argument like you're telling people to stay on the drugs for the exact same reason okay well then stay on the diet you know so it's um you know it's it's just a bit of a weird weird thing but uh no it's not just treatment resistant it works for every well it it will work for a lot of people there are going to be people that are keto resistant you know that that aren't going to do as well um you know for memory things like uh the if you have like an actual epicenter like a a temporal L epilepsy would have this part of the brain that's just actively firing it doesn't work as well for those those types but um no it it works for you not just treatment resistant it just works and I A lot of people are coming off their seizure medication uh at an appropriate time with appropriate uh care from their doctors uh or or help from their doctors to wean off these things because you have to wean off these things it's not safe to just come off uh for most of these and um and uh so you know it's um people are people are coming off of these things all the time uh without an issue uh well not without an issue but they're able to wean off you know a lot of people with with brain tumors like um like um uh Andrew Scarboro he um he you know he would um um what's going on here and also he uh you know he he got off all his his seizure medications as well and um so you know and he had a had a brain tumor so he had a reason for that um but yeah no you can you can definitely uh do a ketogenic diet and and it should uh help you know raise his seizure threshold even with the medication to make it less likely he'll get a seizure and um improve his his uh his case so yeah so good luck to him I do think it would help yes and it helped but it wasn't until she just went fullon strict that's when all these things went away and um her restless leg syndrome went away her psoriasis went away psoriasis in sort of the backhead in her hair and um and her her period paint went away so she you know"
