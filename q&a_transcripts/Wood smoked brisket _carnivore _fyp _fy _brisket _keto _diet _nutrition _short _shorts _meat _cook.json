    "transcript": "so today we're making a wood-fired brisket so we're getting the coals up with this little chimney flue and then throwing a packet of wetted chips for smoke this is sort of halfway through when i restarted the coals and you see the temp is usually around 220 degrees fahrenheit with a lot of smoke when you get up to about 160 degrees internal temperature you want to triple wrap it in foil with a bit of bone broth or beef broth in the bottom so that will keep it moist and tender and then put it back on until you get an internal temperature of 203 degrees fahrenheit or about 95 degrees celsius then you let it rest in the foil usually in a cooler wrapped in a towel and enjoy"
