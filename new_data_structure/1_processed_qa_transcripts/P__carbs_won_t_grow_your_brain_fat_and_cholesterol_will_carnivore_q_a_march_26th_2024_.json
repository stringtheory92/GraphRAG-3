    "body": "hi doctor female carnivore for two months blood results are LDL um 571 HDL 74 triglycerides 108 High sensitivity CR P 3.9 and vitamin d25 is 59 nogs per milliliter alt 15 a23 and I'm concerned with the high sensitive CRP uh what do you think should I repeat it soon well look it's not it's it's a bit up but it's not all that far up you know you want it sort of below two below one is ideal for high sensitivity CRP um but you don't you don't know what the trend is it's it's very important to understand what the trend is if you're going to if you're going up or you're going down or staying the same and all these other sorts of things so it um yeah is something you should check again keep going carnivore keep uh reducing stress improve sleep and uh do all these other sort of healthy things and if you do that and you're eating properly and you're not drinking alcohol or having sugar or any of these other sorts of things that should come down and that should continue to come down and then you just check that again you know in a month or two you know maybe six to eight weeks you check it again see what going on I don't really uh I don't really think that that checking cholesterol and all that sort of stuff is is a worthwhile Endeavor I think it's a waste of time and money because it's not doesn't tell us what we've been told it tells us um you can look at it for you know improvements in metabolic syndrome or metabolic issues such as you know your HDL and triglycerides and that ratio uh and if your LDL is high and your total cholesterol is high statistically you're going to live longer that's basically what that's all that's going to tell you I don't think it's really necessary to get a cholesterol test to learn that you can you can uh find those sorts of things out in other ways but it's certainly not an indication of heart disease you know we know that that's a that was a scapegoat by the sugar companies so that's not uh that's not anything that I I tend to to to order for myself or my patients unless they specifically ask for it um your vitamin D is a bit low I'd actually say uh so you actually want that higher than that usually you want that um you know over 100 maybe even over 140 to 180 is is a better range for that so A lot of people are pretty low on vitamin D and so it's uh it's very common especially when getting into a carnivore diet you know you haven't been getting you know the right nutrients for a long time so two months is still early days that was probably lower than that before and so I would I would think about you know adding in uh vitamin D3 because you know you'll get a lot of vitamin D3 from fatty meat and grass-fed butter and things like that uh fish wild caught fish all those sorts of things uh but that's very low that's actually quite low vitamin D is a hormone you know it is important you know as you want to get out in the sun vitamin D is made on the surface of your skin on epithelium and and in the epithelium but also on the epithelium and it gets into the seone and it can take hours and hours and hours to absorb back into your skin so sometimes as long as 48 hours to get all of it in through your skin and uh but at least you want to leave it there for like six to8 hours you go out in the sun you get hot and sweaty and you go back in you wash uh you wash yourself in the shower and you're just going to wash off all that vitamin D with your seum if you use soap if you just sort of rinse off just to cool down and get the sweat off you probably going to retain a lot of that but um just just remember that there was a study back in 1927 we've known this where they rped off sebum off the skin and gave it to rats that had rickets which is a vitamin D deficiency and it cured their rickets so like obviously there's vitamin D in your sebum on your skin and it can take a long time for that to absorb so just remember that it might be a good idea just to add in a bit of vitamin D for a couple months just to bolster yourself up and get back into normal levels and uh yeah and then just check your check your levels again sort of six to eight weeks you need to get multiple data points your blood tests are just a snapshot in time it's not a it's not a graph you want to see the graph is it going up is it going down what is it doing and so just check it again in in six weeks keep doing what you're doing and um I'm sure it'll be fine you're eating the right way you know you improve other things in the right way get better sleep uh reduce stress and all these things and you'll you'll you'll do great"

    "body": "member says my father has early Parkinson's and is severely addicted to show any tips or studies that might help um help open him to carnivore he is very very stubborn well there are studies with ketogenic diets show Improvement in uh Parkinson's and so that's obviously getting rid of sugar and getting rid of carbohydrates in general and so that would be very beneficial to him to do that also studies showing that people with higher LDL cholesterol actually have lower rates of Parkinson's Alzheimer's dementia they're protected from these also autism and um and what else there's another one too um well I think those are the main ones anyway you know you know ketogenic diet those sorts of approaches and having more meat more fat these are very good for the brain the brain especially the cortex primarily runs on ketones and so if you have ketones and you have blood sugar available your brain the cortex anyway only runs on ketones even if there's glucose available it says no we want the ketones right so that's a preference that's your primary energy source or ketones for your cortex and that's the thinky thinky part of the brain right um when it's only when ketones start going down that you start adding in some glucose for that part of the brain because you have to you need energy for your brain but that's a secondary energy source and so if you have Parkinson's or any other sort of uh you know neurocognitive issue you need to you need to give your brain the appropriate energy source also ketones cross the blood brain barrier and reconstitute into fatty acids and so these can be used as the building blocks and physical M materials to rebuild and reconstruct the brain and keep it healthy healthy and active which is very important especially in cases of Parkinson's also there are studies in Parkinson's where people um well they've actually found that lectins these different plant toxins that are just absolutely destructive in your body they can actually track up the Vegas nerve and go up into the brain from the gut into the brain and damage the substanti  and potentially be a contributing factor in the development of Parkinson's and so I think it was in the Netherlands they did a study looking at 20 25 years of people they got a votomy which is severed the Vegas nerve they used to do this uh because they thought it helped stop um the development of ulcers you're missing out on a lot I mean that's your your gut brain connection is the Vegas nerve and so you you've really done yourself a disservice by by cutting that but this is something they did for a while so you had thousands of people that did this and they found that people that had the Vegas nerve cut so that there was no physical conduit for lectin to get up into the brain they those people had 66% lower rates of of um Parkinson's compared to the rest of the population so it suggests that there you know that that the lectins and plant toxins are contributory anyway and um at least by that mechanism and possibly others as well so eating the right thing is going to help clearly um there are a lot of people that have been helping their Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and Dementia by going on to a high-fat meat-based ketogenic diet and always remember that ketogenic diets when we talk about that it just it means low carb D no carb D that's really what it is a ketogenic metabolism when you have no carbohydrates your insulin is low that's the whole idea you want to get your insulin down to a normal level then Your Body Works in very important ways um in in its optimal way because insulin affects blood sugar but it also affects over a 100 different mechanisms in your body and so if your blood sugar goes up and your insulin goes up to try to combat the blood sugar it's going up and it's affecting everything else at that elevated level if it's down here at around a five most most of the time then it's affecting everything at a five if you eat a bunch of sugar and carbs it pops up to a 35 now it's affecting everything at a 35 as well and now everything's really out of balance and then you can get uh fasting insulin uh elevation it's called insulin resistance it starts going up to 12 14 15 20 I had a gentleman that came into my office a couple weeks ago and his fasting insulin was 72 which is the highest I've ever seen in my in my career um uh be it you know mic is not as long as other people's but it's uh it's definitely massively elevated and so that's affecting everything at a 72 and then he eats carbohydrates it jumps up to what 104 like who knows it's just it's G to be massively elevated so that's obviously going to derange a lot of these things so you want to keep your insulin at a normal level because without that it's it's affecting everything else one of the thing people talk about they need to fast for a long period of time like at least 72 hours because then you get real good aut and all that's really important to turn over these different internal organel in the cell and that and that's really good for health and that is good for health but it's not the lack of food that's causing that it's the lack of carbohydrates it's the lack of insulin that is triggering that because elevated insulin decreases autophagy it stops autophagy right look it up you know it's all that's one of the mechanisms uh that insulin affects is it it decreases higher ins insulin decreases autophagy right and so it's not fasting that's do so you know Dr David Sinclair and Dr ptia you know they're saying oh you need to fast for several days every every three months and this is really important to get this autophagy if you just don't eat carbs you're always you're always uh able to go through autophagy your body's always turning over these uh these these uh organel and things like that in your C it's always doing that it's not because you're starving yourself and your body's looking for pieces of nutrients that's not what it's doing it's just a normal process it's normal housekeeping for your cells to turn over these these organel and make them run better and more efficiently so all these things are are uh you know studied in the ketogenic diet and fasting they find a lot of you know benefits and improvements with fasting and and being in a ketogenic State and so those ketogenic diets ketogenic diet is the most rigorously studied diet on Earth has the mo it's really the only rigorously studied diet on Earth you know these plant-based diets are all survey studies and they're all garbage you know they're comparing processed foods diet to eating more fruits and vegetables it doesn't say anything about the inherent healthiness of those fruits and vegetables just that people that eat more fruits and vegetables instead of process food and they also work out more and eat less sugar and drink less alcohol and higher socioeconomic status and less diabetes and all these other sorts of things that are confounding factors part of this healthy user bias they smoke class all these sorts of things um all that's saying is that you know people that that are trying to be healthy eat more vegetables because they're told to right and they do other things that they're told are healthy as well and you're comparing this to a processed food diet so that's not real that's not a real study that's not real science you know that's a survey and they're manipulating the data and they're using it to intentionally manipulate the data but the ketogenic diet is actually rigorously studied you have randomized control trials Interventional trials with specific endpoints that they find that the ketogenic diet is a very beneficial and healthy diet and one head-to-head against the dash diet for instance and uh other diets as well so very beneficial but what is it it just means lack of carbohydrates right well but what kind so you could do that with a vegetarian diet but you'd have to eat a lot of plant oils possibly in the form of you know seed oils and just drinking canola oil I mean you'd have to take a ton of of um uh supps right because it's just nutritionally devoid right so they don't do that so those ketogen the ketogenic diet is not just any ketogenic diet the ones that are in these studies are animal diets it's an animal-based diet it's a high fat High animal fat High animal protein High meat ketogenic diet they replace carbohydrates with animal fat and animal protein so that's the most rigorously studied diet on Earth is a high fat meat-based ketogenic diet and that's been shown to be the most efficacious diet in the world so that's a carnivore diet with a side salad that's the most rigorously studied diet on Earth so when people say oh there's no big studies or high level studies on the carnivore diet you know because a carnivore diet is a subset of the ketogenic diet because it is a ketogenic diet and that's what you replace this stuff with you replace the carbs and the plant you know nutrients with meat and then you might have some of asparagus if you hate yourself and you want to ruin your your day um so you know you can do that but the main part of that meal there is the meat and the animal fat right and so that's what's that's what's been studied the most and so that's the thing with Parkinson uh diet and Alzheimer's and autism and mental health issues is that these ketogenic diets have been shown to be the most efficacious diets and help in these in these um treat in the treatment of these issues and that's a meat-based diet that's an animal based diet with no carbs and no sugars so a long-winded answer but I think it's really important to start framing it that way to start framing things like know actually the most heavily studied diet on Earth is a ketogenic diet and the ketogenic diet is an animal-based diet it's a high fat meat-based diet it's a whole food meat-based diet and the vegetarian diet has never won against a ketogenic diet and it never will because it's because well it's that specific ketogenic diet anyway high fat animal-based diet that is the most rigorously studied diet on Earth and has been found to be the best diet on Earth and I so it's just carnivore diet with a side salad and I I think if you get rid of that side salad and you do those studies again I think you'll find even better improvements as a result good luck to your to your dad"

    "body": "Irene asks do you think cacc score is significant my brother 60 years old has normal test results uh across all tests with a CAC score of 1,200 says carnivore help reduce the CAC score uh yes I do think that that's significant it's um it's a calcification of of arterial plaques um and so that's uh not something you want to be elevated anything over a 100 is is significant and increases your risk of of uh you know heart attack and things like that so he's got a CAC score of 1,200 I don't know if he's carnivore um but he should be uh one thing that that you'll hear doctors say is that you oh my gosh your your CAC score is elevated you need to go in a Statin and you know if you have a a bacterial infection you say oh my goodness you have this bacterial infection you need to go and an antibiotic you have high blood pressure you need to go on this anti-hypertensive you have high blood sugar you need to go on this diabetes medication what does that mean you think you're treating that thing right you're so give this medication it's going to get rid of the bacteria you're going to give this medication it's going to lower your blood pressure you're going to give this medication it's going to lower your blood sugar right and so oh my gosh you have a high CAC score you need to go on a Statin the assumption is that's going to reduce the CAC score but it doesn't it actually makes it go up so it's actually exactly the opposite you know it's it's like if you're giv oh my gosh your blood pressure is high here's this medication and Jacks your your blood pressure up another 50 points well what is that oh no it's okay now because we did it and then the medication makes you strong your heart strong that's that's um the the the insanity of what they're saying with uh with statins and CAC score they're saying that a CAC score is dangerous there for you need to be on a Statin which raises your CAC score hold on a second but I thought that was bad yeah it is bad you do it but if we do it then it's stabilizing the plaques and it makes it less likely to rupture like okay but isn't my body doing that anyway isn't that uh isn't that good then that my CAC score is going up because it's stabilizing like oh no no no it's really it's really bad when your body does it but it's but it's really good when our drugs do it makes no damn sense I mean these people are just talking out of their ass really and um so uh yes it is significant that your C score is up uh Canon cornivore diet help reduced that uh we don't have proof of that yet we have better um uh we have things like Dave felman's uh lean mass hyperresponders studies where he has a high fat ketogenic diet animal-based diet carnivore diet with a side salad um study where people have you know uh these these cholesterol and LDL scores that are traditionally thought of as elevated for an average of 4.7 years and the actual trend is to actually reduce atherosclerosis not increase so they did not increase atherosclerosis the trend was to reduce atherosclerosis so U and that's looking at actual total plaque burden not just CAC score right so the CAC score just looks at the calcified plaque but that doesn't say anything about soft plaque the soft plaque doesn't show up on a CAC score you need an angiogram to look at that and see how much actual blockages how how much occlusion you have so that's probably the next step for him and um the the you know we still are still waiting on data but you know there are individuals who are yes reducing their CAC score and yes reducing their arterial plaque and yes we have things like the the lean mass hyperresponders showing that that is the trend when people go keto carnivore and and go to a more animal-based approach with ketogenic uh metabolism being in the mix that that does seem to be the trend so it's definitely what I would do um but remember that you know different things can raise the CAC score so if he's going to be um if he's going to be um checking a CAC score again you know it could go up or down independent of the amount of total plaque burden because the soft plaque can can come or go independent of the CAC score right so it's really an angram that he needs to sort of actually quantify the amount of plaque that's there and um but yeah you want that to go away the the there's a there is an Interventional trial an experimental trial that was shown to reverse atherosclerosis and that was meditation so 40 minutes of meditation a day um ongoing you reduce stress you reduce cortisol and that that was actually shown to reverse um atherosclerosis so that's what I would do and I would do that mindful meditation I would chill out I would relax I would um not take medications that increased my CAC score I would get onto a healthy human diet and I would um start exercising appropriately for his uh Fitness and cardiovascular uh level you know what whatever he's capable of doing but you do a little bit more a little bit more you'll be able to do a lot uh a lot a lot more after that and good luck to them then you get tests down the road and just remember these are always snapshots in time so you need to get these things sort of every couple years to sort of see what direction it's going and the CAC score isn't indicative of total plaque burden so just keep that in mind"

    "body": "member says I start carnivore uh beef eggs butter water 34 days ago and haven't lost a pound um I've had diarrhea since day one I'm pre-diabetic my glucose has dropped uh my glucose from 172 to 98 that's amazing uh I have fatty liver essential throm oyos and hyperlipidemia uh yeah look don't worry about the about the weight loss like I said earlier you know it takes time A lot of people are in different positions with different hormonal uh health and all these sorts of things so just um just don't don't worry too much about that um just give it time your your health is improving that's the important thing your diabetes is reversing that's what's important um if your blood sugar was 172 I'd say you're probably fullon diabetic not not a pre-diabetic uh but either way you're not anymore right because that's that's come right down and so that's fantastic so diarrhea is since day one you know it could be that you're eating more fat than your body needs but it's more likely that you're still having something else in your diet diet such as coffee tea caffeine artificial sweeteners like Stevia or reol monk fruit sugar um even magnesium metformin you're a diabetic and you probably are taking metformin which can cause loose stools especially when you get rid of all the fiber that used to be blocking up your vowels and now things are going to be moving too quickly and uh and you'll get that so just just remember that get rid of all these other things um if you have to keep taking metformin then do but just remember that it can cause loose stools uh now that you're not eating fiber and to get rid of everything else that could be um sort of you know affecting that as well and good luck with it and you're doing fantastic the fatty liver will go away the the diabetes is already going away and uh your health will continue to improve and um I I wouldn't worry about the the D lipidemia because it's um it's not the cause of heart disease you know uh sugar processed food seed oils alcohol smoking those are the ones that are stress those are the things that that are really contributory but you know what four out of five men smoked in the early 1900s and 1800s and we did not have the heart disease rates we have now more people drank as well and um did not have the these heart disease problems um and uh you know lot of stress very stressful you working the bottom of a coal mine and all these sorts of things and life was hell and there's Wars and famines and all these sorts of things there's a lot of stress back then too and yet heart disease didn't start taking off until we started adding in all these seed oil sugars and processed grains so you know uh I think I know where my money is on that one anyway"

    "body": "member says every mainstream Source says Omega 6 fats are essential you may mention omega-3 EPA and DHA often what's your take on the types of Omega 6es yeah good question there are Omega sixes that you need such as arachadonic acid but you get arachadonic acid from meat an animal fat uh then there's linolic acid which is Omega 6 that comes from plants that you can convert into arachadonic acid um but it's not essential because you get arachadonic acid from meat so as long as you're getting enough arachadonic acid from meat then you don't need it from uh linolic acid you don't need to convert linol acid into a radonic acid and linolic acid is it's quite pro-inflammation Professor George Eid from Harvard uh um psychiatrist from Harvard wrote a book called uh change your diet change your mind she says you can go keto carnivore and this is the best treatment for uh mental health issues such as major depression schizophrenia all these other sorts of things autism uh ADHD all these sorts of things helps a lot and um and better than conventional treatment far better than conventional treatments and she is very opposed to linolic acid she say this stuff is is not essential it's the radonic acid you want you get that for meat you don't need any of this stuff and and the linolic acid is expressly toxic to the brain uh your brain tries to use as energy it can't use as a building block and a structural component um like it does with DHA and EPA and it tries to break it down for energy and turns in very uh highly oxidative free radical ridden nastiness and that can really damage your brain um Dr Chris uh Kenobi is very much against the Omega 6es yes you need some of these things but it's a very small amount of arachadonic acid and after that it's it's it's bad and then you get a lot a lot of lenic acid which you just don't need in the first place and that can cause a lot of harm and he's looks at different populations around the world native populations and others that have different levels of linolic acid and and Omega sixes and basically if you keep it below 1 2% of your Chlor intake of the lenic acid omega-6 is uh those are the healthiest people even if they're eating a carnivore diet or high saturated fat diet or even even a carbohy or even more carbohydrates such as you know people eating like yams and POA Guinea and things like that and eating eating some meat but eating uh you know more yams because that's what they have access to because they're poor um but they're they're lean and they're healthy and they um you they do have you know some chronic disease issues but they don't have this they're not plagued with the the issues that we have in in the Western World so you know he's he's a very big uh proponent of of keeping those the hell out of your diet past one to two% so you need arachadonic acid you don't need lenic acid is the is the take-home from there and then too much of either is harmful"

    "body": "member says having stance and four years later a stroke is carnivore diet for those um that had these problems my doctor wants to of course go to Staten route well you know the advice your doctor's been giving you has gotten you into the position that you are now and so that's not his fault he's just doing what his overlords have told him and taught him to do which my overlords do at one point until I you know sort of shuck the shackles of um living inside the box of contained human knowledge and actually started thinking for myself and started seeing that um you know what was spoonfed to us in medical school and residency from the sugar from the the the Food and Drug companies is not the uh not the the the way to the road to proper Health um I absolutely think that it's a great idea to go on a cornivore die for everyone you know all human beings should be eating an optimal diet for human beings and I think that all the best evidence shows that that's a high fat carnivore diet as far as cardiovascular disease uh the journal American College of card Cardiology published in 2020 a massive meta analysis and and U statistical review looking uh or systematic review looking at all the best levels of evidence all the best rcts and met analyses of rcts rcts and things like that looking at the connection between um saturated fat and cardiovascular disease and they found no connection whatsoever no association at all between uh increased saturated fat intake and uh the development of cardiovascular disease none and in fact they found an inverse relationship between saturated fat and stroke so they found that the more saturated fat people were eating the less Strokes they were having and the less saturated fat they were eating the more Strokes they were having so um we have just been lied to the first heart attack in America death from heart attack diagnosed on autopsy in America was in 1912 I'll say that again 1912 there was not a single death from heart attack recorded in the literature in America or the colonies preceding it at all none it was 1912 was the first one they didn't believe him they thought he was he got it wrong he just said look we've all we've all been doing autopsies our whole life in our career we're not seeing these things we've never seen these thrw by you know in in the coronary vessels we have all these other pathologies and problems going on in the heart and we've never seen that no one ever sees that you you got it wrong 10 years later more of these are starting to show up and they like oh okay looks it looks like there's something new on the horizon 10 years later it's the number one killer in America right so it went from one single case that no one thought was accurate to 20 years later it's the number one killer in America during that time the 1920s and 30s we're eating the least amount of meat in 200 years in America right we're eating far more meat in the 1800s than we were in the 1920s and 30s right so why wasn't there a single reported case of a heart attack in 130 years before that actually more than that you know in in hundreds and hundreds of years before that when we're eating more meat than in the 1920s right doesn't make sense um there are a few scattered case reports and I mean a few like less than 10 scattered case reports around all of Europe throughout the entire Century the 1800s of people dying from uh heart attack my cardial infarction and I've I've heard of liter one case report presented at a conference in the 1700s of this thrombus in the coronary B Going H isn't that interesting that's weird no one's seen that before isn't that strange right so we could see this people were seeing it when it came up it just didn't come up because it wasn't happening so if this was the number one killer in the world and this was just just dropping like flies you know people had I mean you read the textbook medical textbook from the 1800s very detailed you know I have I have Dr William osler's textbook from the 1800s it was my my great uh my great-grandfather and who was a doctor he's the to date the youngest still to date the youngest ever graduate from Columbia Medical School he's 20 years old when he graduated and he wasn't even able to practice medicine he was like the original Doogie Hower he had to go home and and sit at home for a year uh before he was 21 because in New York you weren't allowed to start your residency until you 21 then he did his surgical residency at Belleview hospital and and was a you know was a a very you know wellth thought of surgeon uh since then and um he I have his textbook from William Osler and it is very detailed doesn't say a single thing about about um heart disease and um and thrombus in the hearts they have all these detailed dissections and these are all the things that go wrong wrong with the heart and this is what it looks like on on dissection nothing about you know things going WR in the coronary vessels and nothing describing the symptoms that you get that someone would get when they Dro dead of a heart attack you we do have 4,000 years ago in the EBR papyrus in ancient Egypt when they were eating a bunch of grain like lots of grains and pressed seed oils and a lot of alcohol beer um they actually described the symptoms that you would get before someone would drop dead of a heart attack they described diabetes they described Alzheimer's Alzheimer's was first described and presented at a case as a case report a single case report of an old lady who had neurocognitive decline presented by Dr Alzheimer's at a at a neurology um conference in 1906 six right so verse one there isn't a single case report before 1906 of anybody having a similar symptoms of dementia none not not until you go back to the EBR Papyrus right that's nuts oh people just weren't living long and the  you know you had the average life expectancy from birth was low that's because three out of five kids were dying in infancy of course the average life expectancy was low but you look at this the the Census Data from the 1800s In America which which I have and it goes by decade because they weren't stupid like the people trying to make that argument from birth the average life expectancy from from birth in 1850s uh was uh like 38 years but if you made it to 10 it was 56 years if you made it to 20 it was longer than that and longer than that and longer than that right so if you got to adulthood you actually lived to be a great age and um and then you know you started get to the point where you got rid of these infant mortality rates you started getting more portable water we understood about microbes and infections and all these sorts of things and that's what dramatically jumped up the um the life expectancy was because we got rid of these these major causes of childhood disease and death and then that made people survive those those um sort of you know watershed moments and got past that and then you you just live a normal life unless you're killed in a war or something like that so people have died of old age actually live very very long time they did not get Alzheimer's they did not get dementia they did not get heart disease so yes this is a very good diet for you uh especially for you because um you know you don't have you don't have room to play around you know and um so you know I've seen some some absolute idiots uh who call themselves cardiologists who say that oh when statins came and we started treating um cholesterol um the life expectancy humans went up by 50 years like these people are just Flatout Liars they're absolute Flatout Liars that did not happen the life expectancy from the 70s to today is pretty damn similar from birth and otherwise right and um it was in the early 20th century and late 1800s early 20th century that you started seeing this massive increase in life expectancy from birth because of those infant mortality rates and getting portable water and not getting sick from all that sort of stuff so you know uh don't don't listen to to idiot they don't ever have anything good to say"

    "body": "Ruth Johnson says or asks diagnosed with brain tumor on the right side 11th or 21st of November um 23 I'm very sorry to hear that um went full on Carnivore loving it so four months in now great um had a follow-up MRI a week ago tumor is shrinking but a lesion is showing up in left Rin well first of all amazing that's absolutely fantastic that the tumor is shrinking but depending depending on the type of tumor you have you know if it's something like a GBM which is the most common cause or the most common um type of primary brain tumor and it's also the most aggressive uh just just understand this like even when we you know it's not it's not like like a melanoma where you you sort of have this thing right here or and you you take it all out if it hasn't spread that's it it's complete cure it's done right GBM seems to be a bit more of a disease process that's going on throughout your brain or it may spread very quickly and and be all over the place but we've we've seen where we've had you know sort of like right frontal lobe you can just take that whole lobe out right if you're a melanoma you can take a big long wide chunk out right you you just cut off your arm if you need to and you just okay that's there's no more of that anywhere else you're just not going to spread or anything like that if you get it early enough right that's a complete cure those cancer cells are gone right you can get another one but those ones are gone doesn't seem to be the case with with GBM so you know you can't and you can't really do that you know if you have like a different part of the brain you can't you can just sort of you know get what you know to be tumor and you just and you and you're GNA have to take brain with that but you you try not to take any healthy brain without GBM in it but you're G to leave some of these things which is why they then do chemo and radiation that's the idea but if you're like in the right frontal lobe you just take that whole thing out you do a l ectomy you just take cut the whole thing out now you got big margins you got this you know this tumor in here and you've got this big wide margin around that and it still comes back they've done hemispherectomies an entire hemisphere just take out all that stuff and it just shows up on the other side right so there's some sort of disease process going on right or this stuff is just sort of has tendrils everywhere and you know it's going to show up so that's uh I'm you know I'm sorry to hear that um but it is it is not uncommon you know that is that is that is sort of what happens with GBM but you're doing what I would do you know which is which is just going full carnivore I would look up the PKD the the the Sophia Clemens I had her on my podcast she is from paleo medicina who's um uh is a is a treatment group in Hungary and they do basically restricted eating you're not eating until fatty meat stops tasting good you're eating less than that and you're adding in organs because you're not eating as much food so you need more nutrient density and they don't they don't fast much but they do limit the amount of food that you take in it is very limited amount because you're trying to starve out this cancer you're trying to keep your gki low you keep your blood sugar low and your ketones high and that's been shown to uh get uh better results with cancer there are you know over a dozen studies with GBM specifically in humans and hundreds and and well dozens anyway way in animals and hundreds and hundreds in in other cancers in in both human and animal trials showing the efficacy and benefit of ketogenic metabolic therapy for cancer but specifically GBM there're smaller studies but they do show benefit and certainly in animal studies they show benefit GBM runs um primarily on glutamine though and so you're going to get that no matter what you do because the glutamine in meat there's glutamine in plants and there's Al you also make it right you make gluc too it's just that you're trying to keep these levels down so you make make some of it but you're not spiking It Up by eating a whole bunch on top of that that's the idea um so I I think there might be an advantage to periods of fasting with a GBM specifically because you are now not taking in any more glutamine um you know talking to Professor SE freed you know he who's who's the main researcher on GBM and and ketogenic metabolic therapy um he is um uh I've well I've sort of heard through the gra FS I've spoken to people that he has spoken to and they've said that he's said so I haven't heard it directed from him so I want people to understand that that I don't I don't want this to be a game of telephone that that gets misunderstood but at a period of time of fasting it actually does uh help with your body's regulation of glutamine and uh what what they were saying was that um between an eight and 14-day fast was a good period to affect glutamine and and to limit the amount of glutamine that um is available for the cancer to make energy and then there's things that can interrupt glutamine metabolism such is Dawn um and I can't quite remember the um chemical name for that at the moment but if I if I remember it I'll say it but it's certainly I mean you can watch it in our interview my interview with Professor Thomas C freed s y f r i d and the substance is d n it stands for you know deoxy something um and um but you can you can take a look at that but either way it's not it's not really it's not really um it's not really something that uh you can get access to um it is something that uh some cancers are licensed for like leukemias and um so you may get lucky you may get an on call ol ologist that would would give it to you there's other other things that have been used in some of these trials um that that are used for other things like antiparasitics such as Fen bendol and mebendazol and this is something that sea freed is is publishing on these things can interrupt glutamine metabolism um and so they they have been used um I think they've been used in animal models but I'm not sure but anyway they interrupt glutamine metabolism it's something that that Dr CED has has um it's publishing on there's a there's a big paper coming out with protocols talking about how to use these sorts of things and discusses then bendol mendol in there that's something that is off label you'd have to talk to your doctor about that see if that's appropriate for you that's something that's going to interfere with medications that you're on or um or if uh you know that you know if your particular uh circumstance would benefit from that or not um but a big thing is keeping that blood sugar down picking that gki down glucose Ketone index down below two that's a therapeutic level below two below one if possible through a combination of a high fat restricted uh carnivore diet like they do hiali medicina you're eating less than you maybe want to and um and periods of fasting potentially as well you need to be careful with fasting and restrictive eating because you don't want to lose too much weight if you start getting too skinny and you start you know getting you know uh too low of body fat percentage you need refeeding days so you need to have a period of time where you sort of refeed and you and you bulk back up so that you're not you're not hurting yourself with that too so good luck with that keep an eye on it it's not the end of the world that little spot showed up on the other side you know it's um good news is it's starting to shrink on that side too I would be very aggressive with um with this and I would sort of throw the kitchen sink at it if it were me and um those are some of the things you do but watch my interview with Professor Thomas caed and wait for that publication it should be coming out um in the next few months anyway we we've sort of sent it for submission we they have I'm I'm like 37th author something on there so um you my contribution is is uh really insignificant but uh you know professor caed and his and his team have done an excellent job it's it's a fantastic paper and uh very long and detail and so hopefully that will be picked up by uh um by one of the major groups and and uh publish soon and people can take a look at that as well good luck with that I I really hope you do well um really be aggressive with this you know it's there's no room for error with this one um there are no cheat days you know you're only cheating yourself and any anytime you eat anything off plan you are feeding that tumor and I would just be like that's just poison to me I'm not I'm not touching any of it you know you need to be really dialed in and there are people that are doing very very well 10 years after their diagnosis and uh with with shrunken or no sign of disease and so um that can be you hopefully too so good luck with that and be very very switched on and dial on to this and um you'll do better when you do good luck um also there's a there's a group out of um I don't know where you're located but um there's a do Hugh U who is doing a a trial on GBM with ketogenic metabolic therapy out of Cedar Cai Hospital metal C Center uh in America so you might be able to get on on board with them and get as part of that trial and that could not only help you but it could help um you know bring this uh information to more people they're trying like a a phase two trial where they're getting like 120 plus people so if you're able to do that um you know please do and um that could be mutually beneficial to both of you"

    "body": "hi doctor I'm a track athlete and I've seen your videos with Ryan talit how much worse is keto diet than carnivore diet uh what benefits wouldn't you find oh gosh so it well it depends on the kind of ketogenic diet you do if you're doing like those sort of like processed food keto diet we're using artificial sweeteners it's garbage it's complete crap I wouldn't do that at all it's not going to be very good at all the only good thing about it is you're going to be eating more meat right you can still get an insulin response and and screw up your energy levels and things like that depends on how much plants you're eating too you know a lot of people they do keto they're just eating tons of plants and veggies because that's where all the nutrients are no that's where all the poison is all the nutrients are in the meat and in the fat and so it it depends it depends on the kind of key diet you you do but I'll tell you this I'll tell you my own experience with this which is I was already doing a ketogenic diet I was I was back from Bangladesh doing uh humanitarian work there and I was you know fat and out of shape and I mean I wasn't like obese or anything well technically was because of my BMI but um you know just I've always been I'm right now I'm I'm obese according to the BMI so um you know then I was I had you know excess fat I wasn't you know extremely big I can still you can still sort of see the the the hints of my six-pack but uh I was very out of shape you know especially for me because I'm I've normally been in very good shape my whole life just because of how active I've been and so I was already doing keto I just gravitated away from carbohydrates because anything containing carbs uh made my back hurt for days and just like my lower back I had really bad lower back pain I was like okay well I don't want that and so I just stayed away from it and then my lower back pain was gone great so I was just eating greens like um and clean real clean I wasn't doing keto I was just not eating carbs and I always ate clean I never ate processed carbs never had artificial sweeteners I just thought they tasted gross and I was never convinced that they were anything but harmful and um just eating spinach kale and broccoli and then lean meat and not all that much of it right because I was trying to slim down get healthy and get back to playing rugby and I felt like garbage I had terrible energy I wasn't losing weight I was lifting weights every day but you know wasn't wasn't feeling great doing it um was just sort of tired all the time hungry all the time and um you know I was just like o not ready not ready to go back and start playing rugby I'm going to need to you know try to get into a bit better shape and then and then see if I can do it obviously the thing to do to get in shape would be to go back to play rugby but that's you know another story um but you know mentally I wasn't there I was like I didn't think that I could do it yet and then I just dropped the spinach kale and broccoli because I was like right I you know plant are toxic we're carnivores we're not supposed to eat this crap got rid of them and um and then I just started eating a lot more meat and it was night and day my my life changed overnight within two weeks I lost 23 pounds and I started shredding fat and stacking on muscle and I felt like a superhero I could work out for hours and hours and hours and hours and never run out of energy and I never got sore and I put that to the test I did 32 sets of heavy legs and I couldn't get I didn't even wear myself out I just had to stop because I've been there for four hours I'm like I got I've got things to do I got to stop this this is non this is I could just keep doing this all night and I wasn't sore the next day or the day after that and then I had one cup of black coffee and I was sore for two days right so I was just like right plants are toxic I'm not touching any of these damn things and um and that was that was it after I did that 32 sets of of legs and I didn't wasn't sore the next day I'm like yep time to go back to play some rugby and I was back and I was at a dead Sprint the whole time I was just like well what should I do you know should I ease into this I was like no screw that you know when I was in between 20 and 25 I felt like a like a superhero I was just I just felt like a like Invincible I never ran out of energy I could just push myself at a dead Sprint the whole time and I never never worn myself out so I'm just going to do that now I was doing carnivore then I'm doing carnivore now let's just do it I was a dead Sprint the whole time keeping it was halfway through the season and I kept up with everybody um that were professional athletes this is you know my my team in Seattle had gone professional was the uh it was already the top team in North one of the top teams in North America we played in the top leagues in in Canada uh the Canadian Premiership and in America in the super league and in uh the you know division one and things like that and um you know uh now we're in the mlr and won the first two years of the mlr right so again top team in North America and I'm in a dead Sprint keeping up with everybody right halfway through the season I haven't done anything in months I hadn't played a full season in three years two weeks later kept doing training I'm still you know fat and out of shape um but I felt like a a million bucks I felt at 38 I felt like I was 22 again I just felt amazing and then two weeks later after you know sort of four training sessions we did a a um fitness test called the modified bleep test and people have played rugby and soccer probably been had to suffer through this thing it was a breeze I finished like in the top five out of 92 people midseason and I've been training for two weeks but I've been carnivore for four weeks and that was the difference it was all diet it was 100% diet and it was dropping damn vegetables that's what did it I was already not eating carbs it was just vegetables and meat and now I'm eating more meat and more fat specifically and I just Dro those damn toxic vegetables and it absolutely changed my life so that is the difference between keto and carnivore it makes a big difference and you'll see a lot of people uh look keto is great but carnivore is better you know you're getting you're getting into the right metabolic State when you're on ketogen on a ketogenic diet you're eating more meat you're eating more fat that those are all really good things right but these plant toxins are are no joke you know oh well dose makes the poison yeah and the dose is really damn small you know uh you can kill yourself you can die from ingesting 50 to uh 300 milligrams of uh cyanide right 0.5 milligrams per kilograms to like 1.5 milligram per kilogram of body weight right so 100 kilo person can die from 50 milligrams of um of cyanide flax seed one serving a flax seed can have as much as six milligrams of cyanide right and we're saying this is a good thing for people to eat a lot of a lot of vegetarians and vegans eat eat flax seed because it has Omega-3s the wrong Omega-3s it has ala not dat or EPA so that's useless for your brain it doesn't convert into DHA and EPA to any significant degree if at all and some have actually shown that you increase ala and actually DHA goes down so good job good job vegans and uh um but uh you know it's not their fault they've just been conned it's it's really the the vegan influencers that are pushing this crap and pushing his information more directing that at but um you know it's um they eat a lot of flax seed because it has is high in ALA right so they say oh you need those Omega-3s so eat that so they eat a lot of flax seed right okay so so 10 servings of flax seed a day which you know it's a lot that can kill you right right so yeah the dose is bloody ass small and that's a lethal dose right long before you get to be a lethal dose you get to um uh you get you know sub sublethal doses that are that are clinically significant that can cause harm and exposure to uh cyan can cause thyroid dysfunction goiters and neurological damage the CDC and the who say there is no safe amount of cyanide to eat right you just don't eat any right why isn't that warning label on on packs of almonds and flax seed and cassava and apples right because the seeds have cyanide so you get there's a study actually that went to smoothie shops around the US and just checked the the cyanide content in the smoothies that they were selling and they were like super high anything that had flax seed almond milk and whole Apples because it gets the seed in they didn't core the apples they didn't take the seed out oh it's easier just to do it oh who cares not that it's not that bad do makes the poison if dose makes the poison then you had better damn well know what that dose is and if anybody ever tells you well dose makes some poison say okay great and what is the dose if they can't say it then you tell them shut up you know they just that's such a stupid statement dose makes the poison then what yeah what's the dose I know the dose do you you know so yeah it's really damn small so um people get a lot of benefit from this you see people doing a ketogenic diet for years maybe and and they're doing really well and they're really healthy and then they go full carnivore and it's just like whoa I had no idea I had no idea that I could feel this much better so it makes a massive difference it will make a massive difference in your athletic uh career as well and uh I absolutely no doubt of that and um uh good luck with you good luck to you also these these hormonal disruptors a lot of these things disrupt your hormones and um they going to screw up your testosterone like Ryan jumped his testosterone from 760 to 1150 you know and I think you tested it a year later right I mean that I mean how much of an how much of a of a benefit is that as as a as a top tier athlete and you just you know nearly double your testosterone levels I me what the hell is that going to do to your performance I me it's going to go it's just going to go crazy right and so you know and uh and it has and you have all these anti-nutrients in Plants as well so you're not going to be able to absorb all the things properly out of your out of your food you're eating a salad with a steak you're that salad is going to make it so you don't absorb all the nutrients properly from the steak and it's going to come with a bunch of of um of oxalates and toxins and lectins and hormonal disruptors so actually makes a big difference between keto and carnivore so uh you know good you know good luck with that I think you'll be very very very uh pleasantly surprised at how much better you feel from going to keto to carnivore especially as an athlete"

    "body": "member says B12 low somewhat anemic until I'm further into eating right with my carnivore diet should I supplement if so with what um well it depends on howow your B12 is I mean there there are levels that you know if you're below a certain level you can actually get demin of your axons you can actually get nerve damage and um since your brain is made out of nerves you get brain damage right so that's not uh that's not what you want so if your B12 levels are or below sort of a critical point I would absolutely advocate for you know taking supplements under the tongue supplements or even getting an injection um so I don't know where you are um but I can give you some some readings that I would consider critically low so for pea moles per liter anything under 400 you can get demyelination of your axons anything under 500 I probably would still start with an injection and um and then just start adding in liver and and red meat and things like that to get your B12 levels up could be that you have a a a you know something like pernicious anemia which is an autoimmune disease which makes it so it's very difficult for you to absorb um uh B12 through your digestive tract and you may need it under the tongue or you may need it injections and so if you eating if you get an injection and you're getting your levels up and then you're eating you know meat and liver and your levels are still coming down down down down down then you need to be checked for your ab absorption issues as well and you may need under the tongue sublingual B12 ongoing uh and then or maybe even injections um and then in uh so those are the numbers for that so peo per liter is the the units generally found in uh commonwealth countries so like England and Australia New Zealand and probably can Canada as well um I believe but maybe not um if not then there they'll be the same as the US numbers us numbers are P grams per milliliters that's pgml and uh under 540 that's the equivalent to under 400 of of of pea moles per liter so that's that's a critical critically low you know really under anything under 6006 50 you should probably entertain uh getting an injection from that that's that's I would consider that critically low even though that's going to be like right in the center or even in the upper half of what the reference ranges are and that's just because everybody's low on B12 you know so everybody's deficient and um so that's what I would do so yeah if you're if you're way too low on some of these things then I would definitely recommend um then I would definitely recommend uh starting with that starting with a supplement to catch you up out of get you out of that critical State and then just eat meat a bit of liver kidney heart to sort of get you up that is a supplement uh in in for carnivores because it's very nutrient dense and so that's what I would do as well so it depends on how low your B12 is if you're low on the their scale you are freaking low and you need to get an injection right away it's not safe to go around with that because you're actually getting brain damage while you're doing that so um don't do that uh there's a study out of Oxford in 2008 2008 they looked at as part of the study they looked at vegans after five years and they found that their brains actually shrank by over 5% so you know oh this is so healthy you can just do this and it's it's perfectly good for you no it really isn't and it's uh it's really bad for you and it's bad for your brain and so they thought now there's going to be a lot of things they're not getting DHA EPA all these sorts of things probably eating a ton of flax seed and getting cyanide poisoning and damaging their their body and their brains for that reason stew but they also have very low B12 they said critically low B12 they thought that that was the main reason because you get demolin of your axons and that can actually shrink the the body of your of your brain and your and your U nerves you actually see this in neurosurgery people are vegans vegetarians their spinal cord thins out because of that demolation from the lack of B12 and um and I've spoken to other neurosurgeons about this is as well you know um that it's not just uh that hasn't just been you know just one or two people that have observed that that's like a common observation in neurosurgery and um so they thought it was because it critically low B12 and the critically low B12 and this was in the UK so those UK numbers was uh you know anywhere from 180 to 190 which is well below that 400 level but in the UK the range is like 130 to 540 right so they're like oh yeah oh that's that's in that range that's in that normal range in Australia it goes down to like 130 so 130 is normal but these people had such critically low B12 that their brain strength by 5% right so that's that's a big deal so if you're low for their scale then you are even lower than that and that can that can cause serious damage to your brain and to your to your nervous system and so I would 100% % uh take supplements and get an injection if that were the case absolutely 100% so um yeah sounds like a good idea all right and then continue on with carnivore diet with liver and uh and if you if and you may need a couple successive shots you may need a shot every couple weeks for a bit to get your your numbers up um you know in Australia and UK you want to be between sort of 800 and 1200 and um and [Music] uh and um you want to be between sort of uh 12 800 and 1200 in um in American numbers you want to be between sort of 1100 and 1600 that's ideal okay so that's GNA be way above their level and your doctor's GNA look at that go oh your b12's way too high this is dangerous no actually it's not it's dangerous that you actually listen to those those reference ranges that are just averages for the community as opposed to uh have reference range for actual health and unfortunately most doctors don't even know that which is scary uh because you imagine that imagine how much like that was revolutionized medicine just that not not even any of the diet stuff or anything like that just you use reference ranges that actually denoted good ranges for health right and just everyone comes back in their bloods just everything's red like oh my God oh God you know like you'd have to do dramatically different things as a doctor to try to correct all these things you know everything was going to be out everything is going to be out and so uh it would be uh that would be a big big shake up to the medical establishment if we just use reference ranges that equated to good ranges for health so yeah if your B12 is in the normal range it's too low basically uh for for um the standard uh average for the community it's just way too low"

    "body": "member says hard to build muscle along carnivore question mark was told exertion decoupling uh from not having enough carbs was the reason now they're full of crap no you you just need to eat enough and you need to work out so if you're if you're uh exertion decoupling dear God no um absolutely not so you just eat as much fatty meat as you're hungry for you're going to you're going to put on muscle easier than you ever have in your entire life you need to eat enough though so you have to find different ways different times of getting food in that isn't going to interfere with your workouts you need to have a good five hours between a meal and your workout or you're not going to have as good of a workout if you're eating during the day you can't eat a big large meal that that stuffs you right like you do at night um but you need to eat enough right so you stuff yourself at night after your workouts and after you go home and then in the morning you might have may be hungry again you may need a little bit more maybe a little more in the afternoon then you have your big workout then you eat again after that right so you you at least eat twice a day and you make sure at least your evening meal you eat until fatty meat stops tasting good that's very important if you're not eating enough you won't have building blocks material to put on muscle um can you bulk faster eating carbs sure but that's not muscle say oh you have to put on fat in order to put on muscle total you're putting on fat not putting on muscle you you get intramuscular fat you get intramuscular glycogen that pulls in two molecules of water with each one molecule of glycogen right so you're getting water logged muscles full of glycogen and water and you're getting fat it's called myosteatosis is something that Lane Norton does not understand I I did a post about this Y what is this about basic as biology Lane I mean figure it out I mean this guy I think he's he must be lying about his credentials because no one with a with a degree in Biochemistry should should lack this basic understanding or at least be dumb enough to argue with a doctor who looks at MRIs on a daily basis and says hey we see myosteatosis there's even a name for it uh which is human marbling you get this fat deposition in the muscles and this is why for the same reason that cows get human that cows get marbling myosis because we give them a bunch of grains and sugar and alcohol same thing happens with us and we see this on M so that's what's happening you're bulking with a bunch of carbohydrates and so sure your your muscles are swelling up you're getting fat but your muscles look bigger but then you go and you lean down and oh all your muscles shrink down so they say oh you have to put on fat to put on muscle and then you're going to lose muscle if you're going to lose fat total  you're not losing muscle and you're not putting on muscle you're putting on fat water weight and glycogen and you're losing fat water weight and glycogen that's all there is to it the muscle was never there in the first place it just looked like it was there looked bigger but that wasn't that wasn't muscle that was garbage and so if you're just eating meat you're only putting on lean body mass you're not going to put on 30 pounds and then cut down 20 pounds to get 10 pounds of lean body mass that's not how it works um that's how it works with carbs and so you might it might look like you're gaining more but it's it's Fool's Gold it's gone in the morning right so it's um you know no that's toal total garbage just make sure you're eating enough and working out and you'll get you'll build more muscle than you ever have in your life uh Ryan talbat was running into that he was he sort of losing too much weight and we were just like look you got to eat more you got to figure out when you can stack in your meals because you're just training your ass off you know and you have to do this then you got to the point where he was eating enough and he said he had to actually pull back on his workouts because he was putting on too much muscle right which is pretty good problem to have for a scholarship athlete in college right so you know he's uh and he's he's gotten invited to to uh train try out try out for the Olympics for the Olympic track and field team so this is this is a worldclass athlete and that's what he that's what he found that's what I found and I I've played at the highest levels of rugby as well and those are my experiences this is everyone's experiences and that's the biochemistry and physiology of it you just need to eat enough so you do the workout and you and you push yourself and you just need to eat enough and so Ryan was actually pulling back on his workouts because he was getting too muscular he was getting too big too bulking he's like he had to keep his musculature down so that his his strength to weight ratio was higher so he could go faster and and be more explosive right he didn't just want to be a you know wasn't going for a bodybuilding competition you know um so uh no the Jim B ros are dead wrong on this one"

    "body": "member says I want to lean up and lose body fat I do 5 days of resistance training one hour fasted walks and walks throughout the day how low to reduce fat intake and kilo calories don't don't reduce your fat intake you'll actually stall your weight loss because you actually reduce your metabolism right so if you starve yourself if you chronically limit the amount of food coming in your body just says oh look we're in a famine your body doesn't know you're trying to lose weight or lose body fat it just knows your inputs and no animal is not going to eat its requisite food it's it's a primary food if it's available and it's hungry so your body's telling you to eat and you're not eating so what does that tell your body it tells your body that you don't have access to food that you're in a famine and you can't eat so what does your body do it lowers down your your output you know calories in calories out yeah well depending on what you do and how much you eat you're going to reduce the calories out right so you know people that uh don't understand biochemistry like you know Mr bio you know didn't study bio Lane um uh don't get that you know but you you'll actually reduce your metabolism and you'll suppress your body's ability to um to burn fat and to uh to lose it so you look at the Biggest Loser trials they uh they had the people on The Biggest Loser on the show classic example of you know eat less move more they had a piece of asparagus and a lima bean a day and they're just cranking out cardio all day and yeah you lost weight and people in aitz lost weight too you know it's like yeah fine you know that doesn't mean it's healthy you can chop off your leg you're going to lose weight also like what's your point you know it's not that doesn't mean that that's a good idea and so they they measured their metabolism after this and it completely destroyed their metabolism it was just it was just bottomed out but then they checked in six years later and they found their metabolisms had never recovered and they had all regained weight mostly and some of them like I think some of them retained um the exercise habits and just basically eating you know uh you know grass clippings and and exercising all the time and they may have have kept some of the weight off but most of them regained the weight um and none of them um regain their met metabolic State they all kept their depressed metabolic state so that's exactly the opposite of what you want to do you want to encourage your metabolism you want to show your body you're not in a famine you want to eat until fatty meat stops tasting good you want to lift weights you want to Sprint you want to go you don't jog you go from walking to sprinting and um when you can if you can or you do bike sprints on a on an exercise bike like a stationary bike things like that but just lift weights and um and eat fatty meat until it stops tasting go do not limit it you need fat it's a it's an essential nutrient has essential fatty acids you have to have or you can get sick and die they're essential fat soluble nutrients and vitamins um that you have to have or you can get sick and die so these are very important things I mean vitamin D is a hormone you know you need this stuff and that comes from fatty meat so if you're doing resistance training 5 days a week you're going to put on muscle and so the weight on the scale may not change all that much you oh my God I'm on a weight stall no unless your weight's going up you are losing fat right because if you're if you're lifting weights to that degree and you're eating enough you are putting on muscle on a carnivore diet 100% I'm assuming you're on a carnivore diet because that's why else would you be here but you didn't say it specific specifically so I'm assuming you are um but if you're on a Carnival diet and you're working out 5 days a week you are putting on muscle and so if your weight's not budging much that's because you're losing fat and you're offsetting it with muscle I didn't lose I I lost 23 pounds in the first two weeks just from dropping greens and eating more meat and eating a lot more meat I didn't limit I was already limiting fat and I couldn't lose weight then I ate a lot more meat a lot more fat and that's when I dropped 23 lbs and 10 days really right and then I didn't lose anything for six months right because the scale is useless I was shredding fat and stacking on muscle and I could visibly see that week in and week out I was getting in better and better shape and feeling better and better too and I never really cared about my what I weighed in fact I want to weigh more so I could you know smash people right have more mass to nail people right but um you know I didn't lose any weight and I knew why because I was offsetting the fat I was losing with the muscle I was gaining right it was again just does away with that whole idea you you're either gaining fat and muscle or losing fat and muscle you can't gain muscle and lose fat all you have to do is just eat meat and work out and you'll do it uh straight away um but yeah you don't need to do that and don't do that um you want to be healthy and uh just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good work out and you'll get good results just be patient just focus on your health and um you'll do great don't worry about it uh do you have any n equals 1 success stories on stopping chronic kidney disease progression or even some regaining function U I've got like n equals 97,000 I mean just look up any sort of uh Facebook carnivore group like zeroing in on health or zero carb health and you you'll see literally tens of thousands of people that have done that um and yes i' i' I've personally seen hundreds of people if not thousands of people that have met messaged me but you know so I mean I don't even know how many of my patients that I've personally tested that have improve their kidney they all they all improve kidney function and but also this is in the published literature higher protein diets improve kidney function that's all there is to it that's in the published l iterature so yes

    "body": "member says training for OCS to become a uh marine officer very cool currently 140 pounds what's the best way to bulk on the carnivore diet drinking heavy whippy cream and Ice shakes now uh you don't need do that if you want to gain fat sure you know but that's not what you want to do what you want to do is you want to put on lean body mass you want to put on muscle and so that's that's it it's just you you stimulate your body uh to put on lean body mass and healthy lean body mass and then you uh you work out you just push yourself in the gym which you're already going to be doing you're going to you know obviously in um officers um training but um you know hit the you know do some extra gym sessions you know get you know more resistance training lifting weights things like that don't do those stupid heavy weight low rep sort of things go for the 10 to 15 rep range that's actually better for hypertrophy it's definitely better for your joints and uh and um you know the health of your joints long term so you just lift the weights and you got to eat enough right you're going to be doing a lot you're going to be doing a lot of work you need to eat enough you need to eat enough um meat and a lot of fat and if you're in the military I don't know what your access is but maybe you hopefully you got a bit uh bit better access but you just got to eat you just got to eat a lot of meat a lot of eggs uh if you can handle eggs um eggs are great for for putting on good uh bulk and and lean body MK but it's only if you don't react to it and respond to it negatively so eat as much fatty meat as you're able to every single day at least TW at least twice a day do that you're going to have to do this after like if you have morning training or Fitness PT and things like that you eat straight after that you give yourself good five hours before you're doing any sort of big workouts later on you eat again after that and so you just have to eat enough and that's how you you put on on lean body mass it's it's actually very easy you're going to put on a lot of a lot of healthy weight very quickly and um it won't be a problem don't go for the heavy whipping cream and the ice shakes you don't need any of that just eat meat you you'll put on the wrong kind of weight with those other things just eat meat and um and fatty meat and eat until you're done and work out and you just put on a bunch of muscle and uh good luck with it and thank you for the service"

    "body": "Sally says I have no problem quitting carbs at any given time uh I also uh I also still want to eat carbs on anniversary and holidays how can I limit the side effects uh well you really can't limit the side effects of um of eating carbs you just going to you're going to eat the carbs you're going to have the side effects you're going to kick yourself out of ketosis you're going to get sore you're going to depending on the carbs that you're eating you might get you know muscle soreness and other sorts of issues and not feel great and have other sorts of symptoms you know that come along with the you know those grains and seeds and all that sort of stuff that that's come along with it you're not going to feel their best it's probably going to be you know you know four days or so maybe up to a week or two that you're not going to feel your best and um and then it's going to take a while for that garbage to get out of your system going to be four or five days before you're in back in ketosis and proper ketosis and um you know that's just that's just the uh the name of the game you know if you drink alcohol it's going to affect you for a while actually I I find that just drinking clear Spirits one you know one day not even getting you know you know crazy and drunk or anything like that I'm not hung over the next day I'm just tired and I don't have great energy and it affects me negatively for the next three weeks so you know there's no real way to mitigate the carbs you just have to wait for your body to get out of it and get over that shock to your system and that's pretty much it and so you have to sort of decide if that is is worth it to you if that's you know it's not worth it to me like I have no interest in having birthday cakes or anything like that you know it's nice I'm fine to watch other people do it um but I I just don't want to put that stuff in my body I mean it's like saying you know when people ask me it's like well do you have any cheap days or anything like that it's like no even on your birthday even on Christmas and it's just it's a weird thought to me because these are these are things that are really harmful to the body and it makes me feel like garbage and I have no interest in having them and there are things that people have that same feeling towards and they they would just never consider having it and so I put that into perspective and I say okay well do you do you smoke meth and they're like no God no I was like well well even on your birthday even on a special occasion well what about Christmas you know and it's just like you know if this is something you have no interest in doing then no you don't want to you don't want to do it on your birthday either so this these aren't things that I'm just like oh gosh I just wish I oh God I wish I could just have it and I and I just hold myself from doing it like I have no interest in eating this stuff because I know how bad they are for me and I have and I feel very different when I have them and I just like no I don't I don't want to eat them I don't want to have them in my body um and so that's the thing so that's but if you know you haven't gotten there yet and you haven't sort of seen that you know you have something on your birthday or something like that and you feel like trash and you just go like yeah maybe you know I don't want to do this next year you know and uh and you might get there as well but you know if you want to if you do that occasionally that's to completely up to you and uh and some people do um but uh you're just going to have to wait it out you know it's just it's going to be a little while before it works out of your system and then you get back to where you want to go and that's you know that's that's it so it's just that you got to take it on the chin and um you know and that that's what it is it's just you're going to have these negative effects it's going to take a while for your body to work it out it will work it out eventually but you won't feel your best during that time and there's no real way of mitigating that it's just the way of mitigating it is to to not do it or to eat less of it and not do it again that's the main thing your body will get rid of it but it just takes time and um it's you have to ask yourself if it's worth it to me it's not worth it and people say well you're so you know you're so uh dedicated and and um and have so much self-control and I say no actually I I don't doesn't take any dedication or self-control to do exactly what you want to do it takes no self-control for me to not shoot heroin like it's just like I'm not going to do that you know it's just well what what what if someone's there and they just offer it to you yeah no I no I don't want to do that so that doesn't take any self-control to not do something that I have no interest in doing and that's exactly what it is for for the way I eat this is this is what I found to be the healthiest way that I can eat and I feel the best on it as well so I have just no interest you know if other people want to do that then that's fine me personally I have no interest and um you know so it's it's very easy for me to to not want to do that in those in those situations"
