    "body": "How likely is it that antibiotics could stall carnivore adaptation one month in and I have periodically um stomach bloating diarrhea as well as a keto rash any advice greatly appreciated well it just depends um you know it's it's not it's not necess going to going to stop your adaptation to a ketogenic ketogenic uh energy metabolism necessarily shouldn't really um but it can certainly mess up your gut and make it so that you're not you're not really feeling your best or having a bit of disbiosis you can kill off a lot of the bacteria that are healthy and are supposed to be there and uh doing good things for you in your body and um and if that happens you can get these sorts of issues uh like you're describing bloating and diarrhea keto rash that well a it could be from you know if you're taking antibiotics and you're getting a rash you you need to ask is it is it a rash from the antibiotics and so you know that that you shouldn't discount that isn't necessarily A keto rash if you're on medication medications can cause rashes especially antibiotics if you're having a negative reaction to that if that rash spreads or you certainly get anything on your lips you're getting tic carrier sort of like like hives and you know big sort of breakouts and that could be like an allergic reaction it could be dangerous you need to go go go see your doctor right away probably go to the emergency room if it's really going crazy certainly it gets on your lips or in your tongue you just call the ambulance right then because that can get down the throat that can close off your windpipe even if you're driving to the hospital it could close off while you're driving you know not safe so anytime you get big swelling on your lips or your tongue or in your mouth you just call you just call the ambulance and you tell them what's going on and they get down there and they give you a shot of a adrenaline right then and there you don't you don't waste time with that so um but as far as bloating and diarrhea yeah that can absolutely come from uh from antibiotics and so if you're if you think you're having gut disbiosis you think you're having a a microbiome issue that's causing these problems because of the antibiotics you can always try to have a bit of fermented dairy so some live culture yogurt Greek yogurt that has very little carbohydrates putting that on meat you chew it up together in the meat so you're sort of burying those bacteria into that bolish of food you swallow that together it protects it from the stomach acid that sort of gets through your stomach acid in first part of your small intestine so you can get that bacteria down to the colon and you know do that for a week or two after that you hopefully things settle down your body can just get you normal and you'll support your microbiome as it's um as it's going to be fed on the things that you eat and what if you're eating what you know it's healthy for you you're going to have you're going to support the bacteria they're also healthy for you to have so um that's what I would do Colin wheeler uh thank you for the super chat again hey Dr chaum 44 started carnivore one month ago was prescribed um sulfam metho whatever the hell that is um for prostatitis a week into carnivore uh 30-day course one week left Jesus 30-day course wow uh worried that prescription is affecting adaptation well yeah so so I think this is sort of a continuation from the the last question may or may not be doing adaptation but a 30-day course is definitely going to trash your microbiome so I would recommend having like the fermented dairy and um and trying and just starting that now really and mixing that in with the meat that you're eating and eating that uh it's going to get killed pretty quickly because have all these antibiotics in your body but you at least you're trying to keep that seated and um and then when you're you're done with the antibiotics you just keep going with it for a couple weeks after that to sort of keep those bacteria in there because the the one one of the major risks is that you can get different sorts of bacteria in your gut that are more resistant to these antibiotics and now they they don't have any competition because you just you just scorched the field and you've laid waste to all their competition and these are a jungle down there and they're they're fighting for resources and now all of a sudden they don't have to fight for resources and they just go crazy and you get you get an overblown um bacterial colony of just one specific thing like Clum dis the seal so C is is a very dangerous consequence of long-term antibiotics uh and and so something you want to think about um is uh is receding your gut microbiome and if you're having too many problems or issues or you're getting sick and you think that there's you're getting bloody diarrhea and all that sort of stuff and you're getting and you're getting more unwell you need to think about you know is are you getting a sort of an opportunistic over bacterial overgrowth in your in your intestine and getting you know something like like a C diff sort of infection as a result of those long-term antibiotics and see your doctor but that's what I would do now anyway is start with with some yogurt it doesn't have to be much just a little dollop on some meat you chew it up together little dollop little dollop little dollop on each bite of meat you know it doesn't have to be a huge amount um and um you just do that for the rest of your antibiotics and then for a couple weeks after and hopefully that settles things down so a question from an Bei who says at a comfortable weight do not want to reduce anymore how do I know that my body knows this sure others have been in a similar boat yeah well you know how that it is an assumption but is an assumption based on on the this phenomenon being the case in all aspects of life in existence so all life knows how to eat in the wild you know they don't have a they don't have a coach telling them well you need these macros and those microbes you have to weigh your food and do all this crap they just eat they eat when they're hungry hry and when food is available and they eat as much as their body tells them to eat and it seems to work out and why wouldn't it right life is supposed to just work all on its own you don't need anyone to tell you what to do if you're doing something that's that's uh is is part of your biology and so it doesn't make sense that we would have to would have required these sort of macros and micros and you have to calculate this and do that because we weren't you people weren't doing this for most of the human existence people just ate until they felt I don't need to eat anymore koalas do the same Lions do the same whales do the same it's just that's how it is and so if your body can't figure that out you know you're gonna die that's it you know you're not going to make it in the wild and so if you have a species of animal that can't do that or you have an individual that has some sort of mutation that makes it so they can't can't do that they can't r regulate the amount of nutrition they can they their body needs they're going to die they're not going to make it Forward they're not going to you know they're not going to procreate and you're not going to have that as a species doing that because it's going to be so inefficient those individuals are just going to die off it's going to weed itself out and we came from other forms of life that were already established that were already there that had already won the game",

    "body": "what did you use what do you use for toothpaste also I don't have a gallbladder and sometimes struggle with digestion do you think chewing a mastic gum before meals will help Prime the stomach of for the meal thank you I don't really know what mastic gum is unfortunately but I also don't think you do need to um because you you're still going to make bile it's just not going to be stored in your gallbladder so it's just going to drip out constantly out of your liver and so if that's the case you just may not be able to eat a huge amount of of fatty you know fat at one time uh because it'll just won't get digested won't get absorbed really it'll get digested just won't be absorbed uh because you need bile to mul emulsify and put these into little my cells and those get taken into your lymphatics in in the form of chylomicrons and so if you're doing that uh with a with without a gallbladder you're just sort of constantly dripping out bile from your liver and so you just sort of need to eat smaller amounts of fat throughout the day and that will sort of catch that bile as it's coming out and before it gets reabsorbed so that's what you do a lot of people actually form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is a an outpouching of the common bile duct and and it basically acts the same as a as a gallbladder and so those people can actually eat just like one meal a day or two meals a day if that's what they're you know the tickles are fancy andh and they don't have any problems with diarrhea so if you eat eat like a big steak with a lot of fat on it and you just eat to your body's desire and you just have to you know run to the bathroom after that you're probably not absorbing all that all that fat and so that could be what's going on there and so you just split up you split up those meals you still have the same amount you just sort of have a you know quarter of it now quarter of it in a couple hours quarter of it in a couple hours after that you just sort of split that up throughout the day as to oh as to toothpaste um I I sort of go back and forth sometimes I'll use baking soda um that's just you just wet the brush and dip it in some baking soda you brush your teeth with that just a bit of an abrasive you could just use a toothbrush a toothbrush is an abrasive but I don't I don't find that that's as good as baking soda I also now that I've been working with stone and spear Tallow um with my friend Asher they make it sort of a tooth powder and um it doesn't have all the weird you know micro Nano particles and weird you know sort of titanium white sort of stuff that's all and all these other sort of toothpastes as a as a coloring sort of thing uh it's just sort of like can bit them an abrasive and has some like sort of some of it has like a peppermint sort of flavor so I've been sort of using that too I tend to like things that don't have uh any any scents or flavors or anything like that so um baking soda is actually quite a good option baking soda actually is a bit abrasive so when you're that you sort of feel a bit you feel a bit raw in your mouth uh but it actually works really well and um so that's what I tend to use baking soda is great and then there's the these tooth powders and things like that that stone and spear make um that I've been using as well I tend to not use toothpaste just because of all the crap that they put in it not least of which is fluoride which I have no interest in and um and yeah and these these Nano particles that he's getting more and more uh weird information on that you know whether or not they do something bad to you it's like why why risk it like who cares you know it's not something you need you know you don't need it so why run the risk that it's you know that it's something that you don't need um or don't want so that's sort of my My Philosophy on that as well you know just avoid this crap you know there's all these oh well no there's this study and that study and this St who gives a you don't need it you know you don't need it so the potential for harm so why mess around you know you know in 50 years we get more robust data and be like yeah no we got long-term data this is totally safe fine you know but like right now we don't have that so you know why mess around",

    "body": "Dr C can you give thoughts about sunscreen uh what do we need protection uh and do we need protection if going into the Sun for several hours thanks well I think that sunscreen is probably not beneficial for people on a carnivore diet namely because we make our own defenses against the sun because surprise surprise you know we grew up biologically in the sun we're not trogloditas we're not deep sea dwelling creatures that just can't deal with the sun we're supposed to be in the Sun what what damages us is we're eating a whole bunch of plants that are very prone inflammatory it causes a lot of oxidative stress and damage so when we get some sudden damage our body can't heal from it appropriately uh also we're eating plant toxins that are cause direct damage when in the sun they they're UV they make a sensitive to UV light um there's a whole class of these called ferano cumerin they're in all citrus parsnips celery these sorts of things and and a lot of other things as well and they will make you light sensitive UV light hits it and it binds irreversibly to proteins and DNA and permanently damage to them so you get this on your skin got your squeezing limes and that lime juice and oils get down on your skin uh and you're in the sun you will Scorch your hands you you actually get chemical burns uh my little brother actually did that we had lime tree when we were kids in uh growing up in California and uh you know a couple citrus trees and yeah actually we had a pretty awesome Garden actually little strawberry patch and kiwi Vines and and um and uh a lot of vegetables limes lemons oranges and uh tangerines and um yeah it was great it was a really cool little little garden and backyard so it um plums all sorts of stuff but um anyway so he went up and he was sort of picking limes and doing all the sort of stuff he came back and just covered in welts and we're like oh my God you know he's allergic to these keep him away from the from the lime tree and in college I remember I was up visiting him when he was at doing his university and he was like drinking a Corona had alignment I'm like isn't that is that going to kill you he's like I don't know you know maybe the maybe the corona like you know like neutralizes it or something I'm like probably not but all right at least they not dead and um you know so that's what I think may may have happened was that he was actually responding to these rumin and he just got light sensor got on his skin he just got this you know the sun damage the skin damage and that's something can happen it's in the literature it's called phyt photo dermatitis um and called celery dermatitis I spoke with um and I said you know people eating celery in the sun and the kids that are chewing on it and they're drooling and those juices go down their face they get just scorched in the sun um celery Pickers I spoke to a celery farmer who said that was like oh yeah no that's that's well known in the industry you have to wear gloves and long sleeve shirts and you really cover yourself up because if you get if you're picking Celler you get that sap on your skin you'll you'll blister and get horribly skin damaged and get very bad uh burns from that like oh my God and you're feeding this to people you know and they're eating it um so that's that's a major thing so if you're not putting in all these these damaging things in your body Suns fine I just put on Tallow Tallow or emu oil um you know I have a lot of the Tallow um sunkin sort of things that I have from um Stone and spear because I'm I'm partnered with with them and they make very good products they don't have and I I you know they have a whole bunch of things that don't have any sense or anything like that which is what I want and you know I also just get the Tallow that they have and just use that doesn't even need anything else some of them have like Tallow and like a bit of beeswax to give it a bit more form and structure but um or or a better consistency but you know it's um uh you can just use normal Tallow and or emu oil and um you know that's those are things you can do but yeah tall works great tall is the single best moisturizer and um you know it's just the best thing for skin Health that i' I've ever used anyway and um it works absolutely fantastic as far as sunscreen is concerned uh I don't think it's necessar required I personally haven't used sunscreen at all in Australia oh my God there's no ozone layer there is an ozone layer that that's another Mythic came around in the 80s they said there was an ozone layer hole in the ozone layer um over Antarctica and they said o if we don't stop these cfc's in America it's going to make that grow bigger and it could Co you know open up all over Australia well they knew actually at the time that this was seasonal it sort of open up for three months and then Clos and open for three months and then Clos like that so it's like a liquid it's like a liquid sort of ozone layer sort of moves around it's not just static and why would cfc's in America pop open a hole in Antarctica even if it were static doesn't make any damn sense so you know they they they got their wish they banned these things and maybe they are damaging I don't know but you know it's under false pretenses anyway um but that was a that was it it was a press conference oh look this this could go and it could cover open up over Australia and so then became oh there's no ozone layer over Australia that's where that came from there is an ozone layer um maybe it's thinner who knows um who cares you know it's just uh it's if if you're if if you're you know not in in you know you know exposing yourself to these sorts of things then you really don't need it the thing with sunscreen is that they have a lot of things like Benzene that are known carcinogens in the sunscreen that's supposed to be stopping you from getting skin cancer uh and yet as um I saw a graph years ago as hours of sun exposure went down over the 20th century skin cancers went up there it's it's inverse it's an inverse graph so the less sun exposure people have the higher when we were having less sun exposure we had higher skin cancers now that's not necessarily related that's correlation it's an inverse correlation it's not necessarily causation but it certainly doesn't show a correlation with sun exposure and skin cancer in fact it shows the opposite so okay is it just completely unrelated or is the sun actually good for you and protection your skin who knows uh am I saying that you can't get sun damage and that can't be a bad thing of course not of course you can get sun damage I'm saying that if you are on a carnivore diet you're not eating in this garbage and you're having enough cholesterol you're not eating plant steroids which mimic cholesterol so we don't make enough cholesterol vitamin D is made from cholesterol our hormones are made from cholesterol vitamin D is made on the surface of your skin mostly also in the epithelium and that actually is a natural sunblock as well and so you're making vitamin D from cholesterol if you if you have enough cholesterol if you're not eating plant steril and then you get vitamin D and it protects you if you're not if you're wearing sunglasses and with UV blocker your brain doesn't see that you're in the sun in the first place you don't make enough vitamin C you don't make melanin and you burn so if you don't do these stupid  things and you don't eat a bunch of stupid plants you know it's a different story it's completely different game and so um you're just not going to get as damaged like you really have to try to damage your skin uh when you're on a carnivore diet and you're doing it in that way especially if you're putting you know Tallow moisturizer on because it you know helps keep your skin protected and healthy and moist and um sunscreen as well that's something I learned in medical school from our professor of Dermatology she said that um spf15 is basic Bally they actually want to go and that's actually what I I was told by my parents when I was a kid that's what they said that after that it doesn't really do you much good and there's more chemicals and things like that and so that was confirmed by my professor of Dermatology who said that SPF 15 blocks 98.5% of UV raise pretty damn good you go up to U you know SPF 30 it now you're getting 99% blockage and you're using three four times the amount of chemicals to do it SPF 50 SPF 70 you're getting 99.3 99.5 99.7 you're using five six seven times the amount of benzene and other horrible uh chemicals um on your skin that soaks into your body you know there another another phrase I heard from a doctor was never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat because within 20 minutes it's G to be in your bloodstream so you know it's interesting probably not everything but you know it's it's it's it's a good thing to keep keep in mind as well that we do soak in things and absorb things through our skin and so you don't want to do that and um you know so you're you're adding in a whole bunch of chemicals and stuff like that that I I just don't think you need um keep your skin moisturized keep your body protected don't e a bunch of plants that are going to harm you and uh should be fine hey everyone if you need a little extra help getting started on a carnivore diet and my online resources that I have for free aren't enough for you you can go to www.how carnivore docomo challenge where you'll have online Resources Group support weekly Zoom meetings as well as the ability to chat live with myself Simon Lewis and the others in the challenge who can help you and support you and give you extra advice and help you along the way so if that sounds like something that would be beneficial to you then please go to how carnivore we'll see you there",

    "body": "when starting pure carnivore how long should one expect to expect a temporary worsening of autoimmune symptoms to last and when to expect significant relief oh it's it it really just depends I mean most people when they're going on a a cornivore diet with autoimmune issue actually just get better just get better I mean some things with like psoriasis or something like that that seems to some people will have a bit you get a bit worse and then they'll get better um some people have a bit stubborn case with psoriasis especially and um and it can it can sort of last for months most of the time it clears up before that but some I've seen some people last months and then one gentleman he had psoriasis that lasted like six months it really wasn't shifting and he started using Tallow moisturizer and cleared it up and so that was that was sort of the missing link for him so if you have any sort of skin conditions or rashes I would I would recommend using Tallow as a moisturizer uh for the skin health and um most other autoimmune issues actually do just get better depends on what you eat though if you're having an autoimmune condition you really need to be strict just red meat and water so the lion diet sort of approach that Michaela Peterson talks about for her autoimmune condition where she's just like look I really can't you know she has a pork chop and it just sets her off um really badly she'll have a bad rheumatoid flare up so um you sort of need to be in that category you know maybe down the road you can sort of open it up a bit to other meats but you know at at first it's uh best to just do red meat and water and um and reduce stress improve sleep stress and poor sleep can can also exacerbate autoimmunity so um you know get all those sorts of things you need it's you need to sort of get a holistic approach it's yes diet is I think a number one most important but the other things are nearly as important as well or just as important because there are things that you're doing every single day as well it affects your body and your health and so you know you need to get those things right too um so if you do that and you're just eating red meat and water and you're eating high fat and not taking in anything else you should expect to see autoimmune issues start to get better but skin conditions like psorasis sometimes they're a bit more stubborn you just have to sort of wait and let them go through and uh use moisturizer uh the uh Tallow moisturizer that seems to help with skin conditions so good luck with that",

    "body": "I buy the carnivore arguments but there are so many real life counter examples for example many top athletes in the NBA and NFL eat nothing but carbs and junk food please give a rational explanation yeah it's it's pretty simple you know like you can you can do all sorts of crap it doesn't mean it's the best for you doesn't mean that that's the optimal diet for you you know there was there were you know top marathon runners back in the 80s and 90s who said yeah it doesn't matter what you eat as long as you work out and they drop dead of a heart attack at 40 so you know it's um you know is that is that is it an example of that's exactly the same and it's just as good or is it an example of you know they're working their asses off and they're fantastic athletes and um you know they're able to compete at that level because of all the hard work and natural ability that they have that says nothing about what is optimal for them would they be better on a carnivore Deb 100% I have no doubt of that in my mind and why do I say that because I'm seeing top pro athletes go from a standard diet or even a pretty good diet pretty clean diet or plant-based diet and then they go to a carnivore diet and they have massive improvements in their performance in game you have a lot of you know these GameChanger guys who uh got got fooled into that sort of thinking and you know Cam Newton injured himself out that year he was MVP of the league like two years in a row and just absolutely you know just crushing at every single game and then he was his performance was going down his performance he was getting injured he not recovering from injuries getting worse and worse and he injures himself out on the season and then he's you know had had a difficult time recovering since then I actually don't even know if he ever made a an established comeback but that was right when he went plant-based bad idea so you know you can you can eat crap and uh and still perform it doesn't mean that you're performing at your best it doesn't mean that you're per you're doing the best your body can do um it's not just diet diet is a major factor and it can give you a huge Advantage but you know working your ass off and having the right you know mentality to play these sorts of games is the most important you can have a perfect diet and not have that that instinct for the game and that that sort of killer mentality to go and smash somebody and really relish smashing somebody um and uh you know you're not you're not going to be playing the same as other people you know like your desire and drive and your will to go is uh is is much more important than that so um you can you can absolutely succeed at a lot of things and a lot of Endeavors eating different ways but that doesn't mean that it's that you will feel the best that you can and that you'll perform the best that you can I've seen the difference in myself eating a very clean diet but with meat carbs and veggies almost no sugar ever but sometimes and hardly ever alcohol uh well actually drank usually about once a week or something like that sometimes once or twice a week college and then I decided I'm not going to drink during the rugby season because I just feel so much better they're athletes that drink too they're athletes that do drugs does that mean that that's going to be the best for them of course not if they stop drinking during the season they're gonna they're have way more uh way better performance and they're going to feel much better too so that's be really the main thing you can do it you can get away with a lot but you're hurting yourself and you're not going to be a able to form to the level that that you would otherwise so that's the thing and so it's just a matter of of uh you know people trying that and you know more and more athletes are coming to this and more and more athletes are saying this has completely revolutionized my game and my athletic ability and my and my you know and how much work I've put in you know Ryan Talbot who um who went carnivore and then you know first of all like doubled nearly doubled his testosterone in a year to the point that the NCAA started testing him for for substances and you know came back completely clean and is FSH and LH you know which are the the hormones from your brain that would get suppressed by exogenous testosterone and steroids they're all normal levels they're like oh yeah your body's just making this stuff that's amazing good job and um you know so he he I mean think about that think about that as as already being a top athlete like the guys you're mentioning going to a carnivore diet and doubling your testosterone what's that going to do for your performance right it's going to it's going to absolutely just it's going to be unfair is what it is but um you know that's the thing and also you know everybody else they're competing again is eating this crap they're they're all you know and I mean that's a different Sho because people that have you know like a like a celebrity chef and a PT and all these sorts of people that are that are carefully organizing their meal plans and they're this and they're that and all that sort of stuff and there's the ones that sort of eat more laxidasical well why are why is that one able to compete when this is using all this other stuff it's just about you know just optimizing things and so you know with with Ryan like he said that his game just went crazy and when he got the the balance right on how much he needed to eat he was able to eat enough you know he losing weight at first and we talked about and say you need you need to find meals that you can stick in at different places and that's not going to be too close to your training that you you end up um slowing down your training and so he was able to do that and then he was saying yeah well now a problem I'm putting on too much muscle I'm getting too big I'm too athletic and that's a problem you know and so he want he wanted to keep his weight down a bit so he actually was working out less and getting more that's a good problem to have you know you have all these these athletes that are just desperately trying to put on muscle put on strength and uh and he's having a problem because he's putting on too much muscle right so you know that's that's what this can do for you and that and that's coming from him as a scholar ship D1 athlete at Michigan State right so he went from that level of an athlete to allamerican that year winning the Big 10 setting a School record in the decathlon that year then the next year you know uh getting second in the Big 10 earning All-American honors again and earning a spot on the USA team for the PanAm games and coming in and getting bronze right that was this year and now he's been invited to try out for the Olympics amazing that's what that's what switching your diet to something optimal can do it can turn you to a fantastic athlete to an exceptional Elite top tier athlete and so if you're already in that category um you know being in the NFL being the NBA or something like that and you ratchet up again it's just gonna it's G to turn you into a superhero you know like it does with all of us we all feel like superheroes compared to ourselves and so you know if they're already a top athlete and you Ranch it up from there my God it would just be uh be pretty awesome to watch and we're seeing this now we're seeing this in the Rugby World there's a ton of pro rugby players switching to cornor completely revitalizing their careers and just killing it so you know that's that's what you see is it uh can you do it sure is it the best thing you can do absolutely not would you get better if you went to carore 100%",

    "body": "thank you for the super chat um you say eat till full or food stops tasting good I eat lots of beef and lamb uh to where my uh kilo calorie is around 4,000 plus I've gained uh kgs but always hungry having some self-doubt so it does depend on other factors so if you're on medications if you are um taking any sorts of supplements or anything like that that could offset that then that that can be an issue also it's usually just until food stops tasting good um you don't have to physically fill pack your body but if you get to a point where meat just doesn't really taste very good that's your body telling you to stop you can overeat you can eat more than your body wants but it's it's difficult because it get it becomes unpleasant to do that if you are taking medications though that can cause you to increase your your uh hunger um a lot of psychiatric medicines will do this a lot of um um pain medications that also active psychiatric medications can do this as well and uh obviously corticosteroids like prazone cortisol hydrocortisone those things will absolutely raise your your hunger signals the other side of it is that depending on where you're starting from your hormones can be completely out of balance people get what's called leptin is a is a hormone that is a ctiy hormone released from your fat cells goes to your brain tells you how much energy you have and Insulin blocks that so we're eating a whole bunch of carbs our whole life and that sort of blocks leptin blocks leptin lectins those plant toxins all plants some of them can bind to insulin receptors five times more tightly than insulin and they also bind to leptin and all the other things that insulin uh in is involved in so it shuts down a lot of processes in your body when you eat these lectins or when you eat carbohydrates and your and your insulin goes up one of those things is leptin which is your satiety hormone um and so you can block that out you can get leptin resistance and uh then you don't actually know when you're satisfied when you're satiated and so you could potentially overeat even though you're listening to your body but the thing is is that if you don't check that you don't know um and your body is still telling you to sort of eat and um eventually that leptin will come down it doesn't actually take all that time long but it can take months uh depending on how high it is and how how strict you're being and so that can take some time there are people that do put on weight uh Kelly Hogan is a classic example of this she's done a a video with um Charles Washington who's been like a 20y year carnivore and um you know they talk about this sort of thing but she she put on weight but her health was improving she was improving she was talking to all these long-term carnivores who done this and seen all this stuff before and they were saying look don't worry about your weight don't don't measure just you know eat what's right for your body let your body heal there's a lot of hormones and things that your body needs to deal with and if your body needs a bit more than a bit more you can also try eating a bit more nutrient dense food which is like things like the organs adding a bit of those in because your body is chasing nutrients it's not chasing calories and if it if it will bring in more calories to get those nutrients as well because it needs them so if you're eating sort of less nutrient dense foods and meats it could be that your body's telling you to eat a lot more because of that add in a bit of organs little liver kidney and heart and more red meats especially more fat as well um that can help and so um you know beef and lamb Lamb's great but there are lean parts of lamb leg of lamb uh there's a lot of lean beef so try to get fattier cuts and and try to get some more um nutrient dense Parts like like the organs and just be patient your body's healing there's a lot of things going on if you're on any of these medications or any supplements or anything like that then yeah you may need to Li limit what you're eating because you you won't be able to listen to your body if you're eating dairy stop immediately because that can that can also make you eat more than your body actually wants and um artificial sweeteners as well so anything anything Stevia monk fruit sugar you know Xylitol sorbitol any of those things just get rid of them so just whole meat a lot of fat plenty of water nothing else bit of salt to taste your body will heal it'll get better if you're curious about it you can always check your leptin and if that's elevated you know you have leptin resistance and it's going to it's just going to be a bit more stubborn for you and um you know but it'll happen that will come down uh with any ketogenic diet especially carnivore diet because you get rid of the lectins on a K on a carnivore diet uh as well which you don't necessarily do on a on a just a ketogenic diet that still includes vegetables so yeah that's that's another thing ",

    "body": "people say like well there's no there's no um you know people say well there's no high level evidence to show that a carnivore Diet Works well first of all there's a lot of very good evidence such as your anthropological evidence of fossil record biology physiology um and Anatomy that actually shows yeah well we actually are carnivores and that that is what we're supposed to eat however there are are tons of high level studies that show that a whole food animal-based diet that is high in animal fat is one of the most efficacious and beneficial diets that has ever been studied the ketogenic diet is the most robustly studied diet on Earth in history is the only study that has the multitude of randomized control trials Interventional trials looking at specific Health outcomes and markers to show benefit or harm and it shows benefit and it's gone head-to-head with the DASH diet and you know beat that soundly and and shown again and again and again to be very very healthy now there are fraudulent studies where they look at oh well we look at low carb diets and low carb is not no carb and also you okay what do you look at as low carb they're like eting the same amount of carbs as as the other group so it's like yeah you really didn't actually control for carbs you didn't actually any carbs they're eating like 100 grams of carbs what the hell is that about you know that's not the same thing so they're using the name and they're casting aspersions but it's inaccurate so zero carbohydrate diet those have been shown to be extremely beneficial extremely healthy and while a ketogenic diet just means that you're not eating carbohydrates or sugar alcohol and you're going to be in a ketogenic metabolism you're going to be producing ketones you're going to be making your own blood sugar glycogen but what do they do that with you could technically do that with a vegetarian diet with a plant-based diet it'd be almost next to Impossible though to getting all the energy required from uh plant fats and things like that uh you could do it uh you'd be extremely nutritionally deficient so you'd have to supplement copiously um and but at the end of the day that's not what those studies did those studies did not look at vegetarian plant-based ketogenic diets they looked at animal-based diets they looked at the carnivore diet with salad so the most robustly studied diet on Earth the one that has been shown to be most effective most healthy is a whole food animal-based diet with some veggies and no carbs so carnivore diet with a salad that's the most rigorously studied diet on Earth so the next time somebody tells you says oh there's no there's no highle studies on Carnivore  you know all the best studies all the highest levels of evidence are on a carnivore diet with a salad that's what it that's what it shows so these are the same people that say oh meat's bad for you well no it's not because these studies look at animal-based diets with high animal fat and they all show benefit when done actually in a ketogenic fashion and and um and not you know these these these uh you know these these intentionally false studies so that's what they show so whole food animal-based diets have been shown to be the best diets on Earth they're not damaging to your health they're beneficial to your health and so the next time someone says well there's no high level evidence showing that that meat and carnal DS are good for you you call on that we need to reframe this argument we need to point this out to people that a ketogenic diet that has been studied is an animal based ketogenic diet carnivore light it's carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet so the only difference between these things is just the amount of veggies they eat the meat is the consistency there right so you know you're eating a carnivore diet carnivore light so carnivore with a bit of veggies and things like that we need to reframe this so we need to start you know showing that no an animal-based diet is the best diet it's the most rigorously studied diet plant-based diets they don't have any rigor to them they have no highle study showing that they're better it's only epidemiology these surveys they say oh once a year they say hey what did you eat last year like the nurses study it's nonsense they do that specifically so they can manipulate the data and say whatever the hell they want they call meat pizza and fast food just any fast food so you you buy a large fries fast food y That's meat no it damn well isn't and you know the drink and all that sort of stuff I mean this is this is just nonsense these are people trying to manipulate people for their own gain and benefit either ideologically or financially and uh and it's not the case so they don't do high level studies you have Dr Gardner from from Stanford saying oh it wouldn't be ethical to do a carnivore versus vegan diet oh because I mean you don't even get all these essential nutrients like fiber oh my God how can you get fiber you don't break down fiber you don't get any nutrition from fiber so it's not a nutrient in the first place if it's not a nutrient then it can't be an essential nutrient this is a simple definition in terms so this is this is him trying to escape the inevitability of of his ideology being shown to be completely backwards and wrong um where's the B12 in a in a vegan diet I mean how you oh it doesn't even have oh it doesn't even have fiber your diet doesn't even have B12 or DHA or EPA or retinol or D3 or K2 or thousands of other micronutrients that haven't even been named yet that only exist in meat and don't exist in plants so that's a a copout you know they they know exactly what that would show and that's why they don't do robust studies with plant-based di they don't do experimental data they don't look at fasting and they say oh you get these benefits from fasting do you get the same benefits from eating a plant-based D no no you don't um and so you know they're not doing those studies because you know they they don't want to see the results they want to put out week studies epidemiology surveys that data they can manipulate so they can push their own agenda and their own bank accounts and uh so we need to start reframing this we need to start talking about how the most the most rigorously studied diet on Earth is an animal-based diet is a meat and high a high fat meat-based diet high animal fat High saturated fat diet that's the diet that has been most rigorously studied there are thousands of highle studies on ketogenic diets that show significant Improvement and benefits to health and specific medical outcomes not just looking at correlations saying oh hey we sort of see this and we can sort of extrapolate whatever no we're doing an experiment saying hey this is the health outcome we're looking for let's see what happens right that's high level data that's good experimental data and the most rigorously studied diet on Earth is the animal-based diet the meat high fat meat-based ketogenic diet with a side salad carnivore light that's what it is and when we do carnivore full I think we'll find even more uh more benefits when you get rid of all of that sort of stuff as well but we'll we'll see but at least now the best diet on Earth is an animal-based diet a high fat animal-based diet so that's something that we need to reframe and when you start going into this um when you go into this uh these arguments and discussions with people you make that note we get that arguments out there and we have to shut down uh that sort of side of things where they say oh we don't have any High Lev yes we do there are thousands in fact it's the only diet that has these high LEL studies the plant-based di does not and there's a reason for that because they damn well know that it's ",

    "body": "what is your opinion on adding fermented vegetables some say gut diversity is beneficial you know we were talking about our our friend earlier in the in the session where they were on antibiotics for 30 days probably need some some help re restocking your gut bacteria I think you can do that just fine with fermented dairy like yogurt and live Culture Yogurt with low carbs low to no carbs hopefully and um but you put that on the meat you chew it up together in the same bite you swallow it together if you have an issue with dairy and you can't you can't really tolerate it I think fermented vegetables is uh is a you know you know is is an option that's available to you not because it's vegetables but because of the the bacteria that's in that and so you can use that as a supplement for the for the bacteria you could do that it's going to be an isolated incidence though I don't think you just I don't think just you just normally need to do this um you know we do see this people going from standard diets or ketogenic diets and they switch to carnivore diets and they check their microbiome before and then three to six months after they get massive improvements in their microbiome when they just go to carnivore so your your microbiome will change and adjust depending on what you eat and so we see in the and it does this actually quite quickly because the the replication rate of bacteria is about once every 20 minutes so they double every 20 minutes so a generation every 20 minutes right so just in this conversation that we've been having today you know me this one-sided conversation me you know listening to me yam on um it's been you know it's been 120 minutes and so you know we've had you know six generations of um of uh of bacteria in our gut right then right so you know they're fighting for resources they're living they're dying they're doing all that sort of stuff so it's very quick very quick turnover and so depending on what you eat that day or the next day and the next day you're going to affect that and you're going to send down different sorts of things down to your gut and your gut bacteria are going to are going to be promoted or or discouraged depending on those resources that are available the Inuit when they're eating just a natural diet they've had very very beneficial and very healthy microbiome when they're when they've been studied and uh and that's what we can expect when we're eating a carnivore diet so if you are you have very bad disbiosis or you're having long-term antibiotics that really destroyed your your microbiome um sure you have some fermented um foods but I would start with the fermented animal foods and you know keep it you know keep it in house and uh and try that but then again you're only doing this for for a week or two and then you should have an established microbiome and then it's just going to be perpetuated because of the things that you're eating I don't think you need to keep doing this for the rest of your life anyway so even if you did decide that fermented vegetables was the right thing for you you don't need to do this more than a couple weeks Max and then because of what you're eating you're going to perpetuate and support the correct bacteria that you want you not the fermented vegetables may not have all the correct ve bacteria you want going to have some you want some you don't want but the food that you're eating the animal food the meat that you're eating that's going to support the ones that you want it's not going to support the ones that you don't want so that's what you do so if you really if you really do feel that that's the right thing to do for you and fermented dairy doesn't work and you've had long-term antibiotics and all these sorts of things and you're having trouble you know sure that's a that is an option but again it's like a medicine you don't take antibiotics unless you have to you don't take you know biological agents if you don't have to you don't take chemo if you don't have to you don't take blood pressure medication if you don't have to and um and so you don't so use these as a medicine that's a medicine so you use it in specific circumstances to get a specific effect and then you stop there's a course to your medical treatment and then you stop and that's how I would approach that with this as well",
