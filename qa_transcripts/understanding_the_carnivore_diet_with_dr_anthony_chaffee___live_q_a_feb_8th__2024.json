    "transcript": "okay hello everyone uh good morning I'm just in um Hotel actually I'm over in Bali so ell and I just decided to dip up here for the weekend so just decided to pop up so thank you everyone for joining it's good to see everyone again just going to go live here on Instagram so hello Instagram and yoube and Facebook wherever you guys are joining if you guys are joining in from remember you know where you're join in from um so yeah so great to see you all um I'll have about an hour and 15 minutes and you U got some plans to me some friends here so uh yeah not just but no one likes BR Sprouts shirt just to just because no one does they're disgusting but um yeah oh darv nice to see you thanks for joining hello hope you're doing well hope you're doing well thank you so much Terry says love the shirt and I do too I think this is it's funny I really like the one with like the killer broccoli as well like are trying to kill you that one just cracks me why that's that that shirt was probably more for me than anybody else I don't you know some some people have gotten it and um and uh you I'm sure you know that hopefully they like it but I just love it I I made that for me I thought it was just hilarious I made that because I wanted to have it it's just so funny yeah okay let's see here just love people J food food okay um a couple things here I R um had a question would like to know if carore diet will help my broken right humorist that happened last year in May did four months of therapy 95% recovery movement but still feels heavy and can't lay on my right side um it's it's not going to you know undo a bad break it's not going to sort of you know reset your bon once you once you heal in a certain way it's going to when the bones are fixed they're fixed but um you know what it what it can do is reduce inflammation so that you're not in as much pain and it could be more tolerable it could be that your rehab goes better it does improve people's immune system and people do heal effect but this a year old you know that's a that's pretty well healed at that point it's really going to be about your your pain level and the sort of The Chronic chronicity of that pain so it would I would expect it to reduce the inflammation not hurt as much are you ever going to be able to sleep on your on that side I don't know but um it can certainly help with a pain it can help you recover from other injuries as well can help you with your you know build muscle and strength in that arm that can also help with pain as well and include ameliorate some of your Sy can SW but it it depends on what you're sort of looking for as far as um help with your broken right humorous you know it's it's it sort of depends on what your expectations are if it's if it's pain reduction then yeah it will probably reduce pain because bringing in less inflammatory factors from these you know nasty plants and carbs especially alcohol in particular and then when your ketones are up that the ketones are going to directly suppress your your paining levels as well so that can certainly help so it just depends on what your expectations are and what you mean by help fix fix your arm but if it's if you're talking about pain yes certainly help Sunshine kiss says Dear doctor on Carnivore 6 months LDL 370 triglycerides 112 HDL 92 ll22 Bak eggs uh be fish blood pressure up to 180 over 95 I do wants me to quit be get statins and bpms thank you well look if your if your blood pressure is uh is is high and i' say that's high you know you should consider taking medication from that um I don't consider the cholesterol High because that's that's that's someone sort of made a decision they made a value judgment and say this is high this is not high I would agree with that for for LDL um your HDL is great your triglycerides are really good and they're probably going in the right direction if you check this again six months your triglycerides probably keep it and you're still just eating meat and water and reducing stress and improving sleep because those are very important for your overall health and your triglyceride levels and your metabolic Health that triglycerides will keep going down H will keep going up who knows cares about what happens to the LL because that was never a cause of heart disease is and so the blood pressure you know that that's that's a bit of an issue I would get a home blood pressure monitor sometimes there there some white coat hypertension you're sort of nervous talking to your doctor especially if they've been pressuring you to stop doing exactly what you're doing and every time you to the doctor it gives you a hard time about what you're eating um e your sheep let say yeah so he or she it gives you a hard time about what you're eating you know it could be that you're there and you're just a bit nervous and you get this Spike of blood pressure so if you get a blood pressure monitor at home and just check it a couple times make sure you're calm make sure you relax if you get stressed out cortisol is going to go up your blood pressure is going to go up and blood sugar is going to go up actually and and that could actually cause your triglycerides to go up too which is not what you want so I would just check that at home and if you're when you're calm and relaxed at home and your blood pressure is normal then you know that's what that is it's called white coat hypertension that you go into a doctor and you just get nervous about seeing the doctor and so your blood pressure goes up and so you just need to make sure you know it's h it's not that but if you are having sustained high blood pressure around 180 then I would say yes it would be a good idea to go on a blood pressure medication is meat going to cause it absolutely not um a lot of blood pressure high blood pressure issues uh are caused by by insulin resistance resistence in that and so getting away from from sugars and carbs and alcohol you're not going to have that problem so a lot of times people's blood pressure actually improves they come off their medications there are other causes of high blood pressure you could have one of those issues and uh but it's not meat meat does not cause high blood pressure just does not and in fact if you only eat meat this often this often improves blood pressure so check your blood pressure at home get more data points be calm and relaxed make sure you're reducing stress improving sleep and see and if your blood pressure is still up then you probably a good idea to go on blood pressure medication because that can cause serious problems you put too much pressure on the pipes and they pipes conversed and that's not what you want you don't want to have like hypertensive stroke right where you just have super high blood pressure it just blows out one of these vessels in your brain and you have have serious injury um or death from that that's very serious so um I don't I don't personally think that that LDL is high you know um it's it was just never a problem it just never a cause of heart disease and in fact higher LDL has been associated in very large studies 60,000 65,000 300,000 11 million participants to actually show that that it was related to longer life lower all cause mortality higher life expectancy and and many of these studies actually showed that there's an inverse relationship between LDL and cardiovascular disas like the Framingham study which was misreported by the AHA to say that higher cholesterol equal higher cardiovascular mortality rate point in fact they found the opposite as you lower as you tell people have lower total cholesterol higher rates of card mortality right so we can lie to I wouldn't worry about that I would worry about the blood pressure I take care of that as you can Lena thank you very much for the Super Chat what if you eat a lot of beef but it never stops tasting good so you overeat calories uh some carnivore women told me to portion meals I have excess fat I I if you're only eating meat and you're not eating carbohydrates you're not eating non sugar sweetness and you're not spiking your insulin and you're not on medications that can increase your hunger such as prisone Prisa then it's I I really haven't come across anyone who would fall into that category there may be there may be someone things you know especially if someone has inappropriately High cortisol for some reason that might increase their appetite or throw a medication that increases their appetite that might be um it'll stop tasting good trust me and the thing is is that is that if you have excess fat you know you want to make sure your body's getting what it want and if you're chronically undereating then you're actually going to tell your body that you're in fam and that you don't have enough access to food and it's actually going to lower your metabolism and yeah sure you you can starve yourself into a smaller dress size but it's going to Plateau it's going to level off and then you're starving yourself starving yourself starving yourself you're really not shifting any way and then you start eating a little bit more actually put on weight you put on weight oh the hell I'm eating less than I was two months ago but I'm putting on weight now whereas I was losing weight before what the hell's going on it's not calories in calories out anybody who says that is fundamentally does not understand biology and biochemistry even if they have you know a degree or Advanced degree in something they don't know what they're talking about and so what you want to do is you want to encourage your metabolism you want to make sure your body knows that you have ample Foods the right food if you're eating carbs you're eating sugar drinking alcohol have been non sugar sweeteners that can all mask your your hunger cravings and or or your your satiety signals and it makes your hunger cravings go up and so then you can certainly but um you also let me think about it like you have a limited capacity to absorb fat when you run out of bow you cannot absorb fat more than a very small percentage like single digit percentage so the rest of it just goes out so how do you over eat fat you can eat all the fat you want you're not going to absorb it so the idea oh you don't want to eat too much fat no such thing your body just won't absorb it that's just physiology 10one so um I still think that you can do that um you can definitely starve yourself into a smaller dress size some people if their metabolism is already suppressed because they've been limiting food and starving themselves and doing starvation diets which is what the diet is uh uh generally then then their metabolism going to be very low and and their body saying like Okay we're getting nutrients now we need to store it we need to store it we need to store it and so you put on weight but when your body understands that you're not in a fine and your metabolism starts going up then you'll start losing fat and you'll start losing a lot more fat and you'll keep losing fat down to a more stable low body fat percentage and your hormones are going to be healing as well you're Le you're going to lein resistance you're going to reverse insulin um you're going to have have lower insulin total insulin fasting insulin and this going to affect you in a lot of other ways so beef will stop tasting good trust me on that it will just keep going until it stops tasting good it's probably not that much further past where you're at as long as you're not on any medications you have some sort of corol excessive disease like Cushings or something like that I don't think you need to portion out your meal every animal on earth knows when to stop eating just naturally I've never seen AAL on a calculator to figure out it's macros you don't need to either if you're eating the right thing so if you're eating the right thing you should get the right signals from your body and I've discovered that that's taste so keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you're only eating that and you don't have any these other caveats that then that should be the right amount for your body good luck with that but you know some people do gain a bit of weight at first because their metabolism is screwed their their hormones are are off you need you need to give your body a chance to heal and so you look at these um carnivore Facebook groups like zerocarb health and zering in on health I mean this things been around for 15 years you know these people been doing this for 20 years plus that's what they always say it's like don't worry about the scale don't worry about if you're losing weight don't worry about if you're gaining weight body's healing this is what we design e supposed to have let your body heal it takes time some sometimes most people will lose weight pretty quickly some people won't and there to do with the metabolism and their BL and so you just have to give your body a chance to heal metabolism to start you need to bolster your metabolism and encourage your metabolism and you need to give your body a chance to let your normales heal and it will happen focus on your health focus on how you feel and um wait weight will happen on in its own time Jeremiah Solomon thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat that's very kind of you hi Anthony 22-year-old male three-month lion diet severe bloating after eating it lasts at least 24 hours exercising pain started Carnival because six months ago I tried to clean bulk and ran into this issue I stopped the bulk with the problem persist thought that's well that's very interesting um especially with fly and diet if you're only eating bread I mean that's usually the def it could be that that you are maybe eating past what your body's telling you to eat if if you're really trying to get a lot of food in sounds like you trying to stop the bulking side of things but if you're eating past enjoyment if eating past where it tastes good and you're just sort of forcing yourself to finish that can make you feel pretty unwell that's um you know it's very easy to undereat on a cornor die it's very difficult to overeat on caror die because it can make you feel pretty un well and it make you just it just doesn't taste um so that would be my first thought the second thought would be um have you tried other meats you know could be that there's something to do with meat that you're eating very rare with red meat but maybe there's just something in it uh that you react to negatively that you uh maybe just way it's prepared or possibly where you're getting it from maybe they're putting something in it that's that's not supposed to be there so try different mats as well I don't think you ever need add in place plants or or anything like that um but you can just make sure you're eating until comfortably full it didn't it you know it tastes good up until the point that you take a bite go like doesn't really taste all that good that's when you stop right it doesn't need to taste bad but you want to get to the point where it doesn't taste good then other people you may have you know smaller stomachs if had surgery or just it's just their anatomy and so you just see that so maybe for you you need to sort of have a couple smaller meals throughout the day but at some point you need to get to the point that doesn't taste good anymore just to make sure that your body's getting in um at least in your in your last meal if you do that so that's what I would try try uh different Meats see if that makes the difference make sure you're not eating to obsess you're not eating to the point that it's uncomfortable to eat eating to the point that it's um you know beyond the point that it tastes good and really important get rid of everything else you say you're on Lion diet and I believe you but some people say that they're they're doing carnivore lion and they're still they still have fruit sugar or they still have Stevia or they still have you know raw dairy or they have these other sorts of things as well so really make sure you are just doing fatty meat and water and absolutely nothing else and um and yeah and then then hopefully that that will clear up but um yeah I can't take of anything else those those would be the main things to to address to try and hopefully that helps um you know like I said just could be that you're just eating a bit too much for your your body at that that given time and maybe you just just split up these as well give give those a try and uh let me know hopefully that that works hope that helps and if not then we'll try to come up with another game plan that's the thing with medicine is that you just have to sometimes you just have to go through differential you say well this is what it most likely is you try you go down stepwise progression and uh and sometimes you just just just come up goose eggs you get no hits that happens and then you just you just have to sort of figure out okay well if all these things didn't work what else can we what else can we do here and then you try experimenting okay what if you fast for you know 24 hours or 48 Hours how does that make you feel when you eat what happens I mean something is reacting to you right you're either having more than your body can handle or you're having something that's agree with your body those are really two main options there and so um you know those that's sort of how to troubleshoot it try different Meats see if that helps and you try to eat a bit less and see how thats you just fall Cameron Hicks thank you for the Super Chat red meat and candida diet they say it is inflammatory and to eat fish and chicken instead I I don't know who they are but uh they're wrong whoever they are bread meat's not inflammatory uh in fact fish has actually been shown to be Pro inflammatory especially farmed fish that's that's not much more and chicken depending on how it's raised could be inflammatory as well because has a very high level of lanic acid which is in itself pro-inflammatory because they're giving a bunch of soy and corn that's pro-inflammatory and uh that's going to get higher L like acid into their body say Farm fish and that's going to get into your body you're going to get a lot more lumic acid which is not good for you toxin so red meat doesn't do that and especially grass finish red meat it's not going to have more than you know a percentage or two of its um of its fast going to be U the Omega six is and not all of those Omega sixes are going to be L AIC acid be things like a radonic acid which actually is useful lolic acid is not un you don't have any eronic acid you can make conver some of that into into gas but yeah you basically don't need L gas whatsoever and you don't want it it's very pro-inflammatory it's very unstable it breaks down into oxidated particles shoots off all these free radicals that cause inflammation so I would say exact opposite of what they're saying Nick Johnson think in Super Chat uh can you get optimal EPA DH eating only be yes you can especially grass finished if you're eating if you're eating grain finished like high intense grain finished maybe not but maybe it depends on how long they've been grain finished depends on how intensively they grain finish it's like when these 90 95% you know grain feeds and that's going to and for oh three months or more then there have been at least some studies that have uh suggested that at at that point they have very little in the way of those essential Omega-3s like DPA DHA so excuse me and um so it depends on the beef you're getting but um if it's if it's been really intensively Rin finished then it's it's going to have a lot less of the of the essential so just just something to keep in mind Vin said thank you for the Super Chat hi doc embarrass to say I weigh 640 pounds not going to be embarrassed about man like you've got you ConEd you know like we've all been ConEd you know I we've been we've been tripped into eating High Octan garbage and we've been told it's good for us and we're not told that it was highly addicted and so you just got to kind in a circle you know back in the day when when people said that smoking is good for you you need to smoke and like okay I guess I'll smoke like you know same same thing people got got sucked in something was bad for them and um so case vinent goes on clearly my my decision making is busted regarding portions and junk sugar how much should I eat if not using calories I really need I needed help um you will this with this uh thanks so Vincent as long as you're not the reason that you have problem portion control is because of the joke with the sugar because it's it's highly addicted we have these just armies of food scientists that make food extremely imp palatable they they find these chemicals that are very addictive and attractive to us and and then we just go oh oh that's good I got to eat that tastes good it's wonderful and you just eat more and then the taste goes away quickly because they design these chemicals go away to have big strong flavor and it goes away so you have to another one and another one and another one and another you just keep eating you keep eating and sugar itself is addicted carbohydrates are addicted um fructose itself is just addictive it gives a dopamine signal to the reward centers of your brain addiction centers of your brain and fructose and all the other carbohydrates will raise insulin and Insulin will go up your BL will down you'll feel like garbage you'll need to eat more carbs right and they just make you feel better and better and better so you associate that with good energy and feeling good it's a drug you know if you do cocaine you feel great you start coming down you want to do more cocaine want to get back up to where you are very similar experience with carbohydrates and particularly fructose because fructose actually gives a dopamine response just like cocaine does obviously it's not the say it's cocaine but it is a drug Just Like Cocaine so that's that's why you've been overeating and so um you know this is called an evolutionary trap there's the you know if a if a bird or something is is designed to see certain colors certain pattern and then something you know that we made artificially looks similar to that they might go and think that that's a flower like hummingbird goes in like there's an example of a red breasted Hummy bird or something like that probably not but anyway that's a good chest and it goes after these like sort of little red things it sort of sticks his little nose in there and tries to get nectar but they had for a while they had these these red sort of connectors on the electrical fences uh in on farms and branches things like that that's a little HB come in think oh this little flowers face in there hit the electric bar zap them and they die so that's called an evolution AR trap their their body is telling them to do something their instincts are telling them to do something but this is something new that hasn't actually been in the environment has been in their nature and it's just you get this this trap where you just keep doing this thing that's bad for you even though your body's telling you it's good for and that's what this junk is it's designed to act on our natural evolutionary signals in order to be hyper power you know and that's why you know when I say that like hey if something tastes bad and it's bitter than it's that it's bad for you your brain is telling you hey look there's something in here like that and some oh well I guess you know Candy and you know all this sort of crap that kids eat I guess that's all good for you no idiot that's not what I said I said if it tastes bad then it's bad for you you have these evolutionary traps you have these these these purposefully design chemicals that will taste good and be addictive and cause people to overeat that is is causing that sort of Behavior now things that are good for you will taste good but we've also designed things to taste good that are not good for us so that's that's not a one to one but if something tastes bad then there is something in there that your body's trying to warn you about so I don't think that anything changes for you as long as you are only eating meat if you just eating meat and you're just eating fatty meat it's very satiating it's very satisfying there is a limit on how much you can eat trust me and the is is that you're going to be used to having bigger portions and so you're going to find it's like okay well this is how much I think I'm going to want your body's not going to want that it's just going to want on half of that or less depending what you do and you start eating that it's going to taste great at first you get to a point it does not taste good anymore but because you might be us see larger portions you're like well I I just have to I have to clear my plate you don't have to PL in fact you want to have leftovers you want to get to a point that it stops tasting good and then you stop you put that in the fridge you come back to it the next day it will taste good again and so um that's what you do and you can still do it it's not it's not that you have a problem with portion control it's that the food that you've been eating and been told to eat causes you to have problems with portion control that's how it's designed and so these very smart really doing absolutely very impressive work figuring out all these different chemicals how they work and react in your body and things like that but the problem is that just you know they've been you know they've been their their genius has been uh co-opted by these absolutely evil corporations that are trying to adct us and I mean this is It's just drug dealers they're just drug dealers but you know it's the same idea you want to get people addicted and get them addicted young and you have a customer your whole life their whole lot and um it's the same thing it's the same thing as with Heroin it's the same thing with cocaine it's just it's not illegal to do this so like they're so they're trying to make things as addictive as possible the be the reason people sell cocaine is because it's already really addictive but you know what there are other things they're pretty damn addictive too Sugar's one of them and they they've shown animal studies where get like a food pellet or cocaine the you know the rats will just pick cocaine until they die they won't ever go for the because they get one or the other I they keep going for the cocaine every time they get hit after hit after hit they want more they want more they want more well they've added a third button in uh in some of these experiments with sugar and so they got food cocaine and sugar and they actually ignore the food and the cocaine in favor of the sugar and they keep eating sugar sugar sugar sugar sugar sugar sugar until they die the stuff is is a drug it is addictive it is toxic it's a drug you don't want this in your body when you get rid of it everything changes and you'll see there are other people that that have been your weight there other people have been heavier and they are losing weight and they're improving their health and they're just eating intuitively if you're on medications if you have a have some sort of cortisol uh problem where you're just pping out more cortisol than you should maybe um but otherwise just the until fatty meat stops tasting good but do stop when it stops tasting good it should always be enjoyable here the point it stops being enjoyable that's when you stop okay so just keep that in mind and you should be fine uh Vibes 714 thank you for the Super Chat something attached but possibly here we go um well thank you for the super chat again any suggestions on Willpower to avoid carbs Etc uh just try to eat enough try to eat enough fatty meat so that you don't get as as many uh hunger CRA you sugar Cravings bar Cravings um that can really help that can really help suppress those Cravings uh takes about two weeks two weeks people generally don't miss carbs that so as long as as long as you can stay away from the carbs keep eating fatty meat if you get carb Cravings sugar Cravings bread just smells amazing eat fatty meat you do that if it tastes good you keep eating that's your hunger signal sometimes our bodies give us a carb signal because it's just hungry and and it's like that's a source of energy that it knows it can get and so it might just tell you that and so especially going on if you're getting carb gravs three months on two years on you're hungry you know your brain's just telling you you need to eat and you're not eating them and so um that's that's a very good thing to remember is that you shouldn't get carb Cravings later on in this uh if you're if you're eating enough if you're undereating you're chronically undereating you're you're going to get car gravings again because your body is just saying hey you need to get some food you need to get some energy the brain needs energy so um so that's what it is so usually about two weeks is gone and then you should be fine after that and if you get Cravings just eat more meat and get through those two weeks it's generally generally good after that so good luck with that then daily thing you very much for the Super Chat I've been back to carnivore for six weeks from failing myself through Christmas I have Tor miniscus and hoping this way of eating can um helpless heal I haven't lost eat one pound I've I've actually gained two Serv just like just like I was saying earlier everyone's at a different state metabolically everyone's at a different state um hormonally you know go to these cariv uh Jack groups like the zero zero carb health and zero in on health those are two the the longest standing and I think best ones because they're very strict and U you need to be strict if you're not strict then you can slip off and you will not get results that you want you just won't um you'll get better you'll improve just eating more meat is going to be good eating less garbage you be good for but you won't get all the results you certainly won't get as good results as you uh probably not going to deal with t meniscus those generally don't deal on their own depending on the area of meniscus closer to the gr has more blood supply so those can heal sort towards the edge probably not U but look you you slip up Christmas big deal you're back on track that's the important thing if you ever slip off just get right back on just hop right back on the wagon right fall off a horse you have get right back on the horse as soon as possible that's the whole idea so um so good job for doing that um as far as gaining weight just remember what I said before like need to encourage your metabolism so you need to eat enough you eat fat until it stops tasting good that will support bolster your metabolism you need to um eliminate everything else and make sure that that it stays gone to just be water no Dairy you know if you're trying to lose weight I don't think dairy's a good idea even just like a bit of cheese on meat it's not a great idea they can stall weight loss milk will definitely stall weight loss but is really the only thing that's that's uh going to be helpful for most people and then you just need to get the time there's probably about 2% of people mostly women uh unfortunately for some reason um it doesn't seem as applicable to men but it does happen where they just don't lose weight as fast and they actually put on weight in the early stages and so they they um they it can be very frustrating you know like um you know Ellie Hogan found that she actually put on WE for six months right a huge amount but she put on weight and that's the opposite of what she wanted to do but she was doing more for health reasons and she was trying to she was trying to improve her health and after about six months you know it um it finally kicked in and there hormones were healing your body was healing it's generally letin you can always check your letin L your serum left level l p TI n if that's elevated you're going to have you're going to have a more difficult time losing weight that's our satiety hormone and that's that just gets all Stu by insulin and fructose and alcohol and and you get end up getting left resistance until that left level comes down and your left resistance goes away you're going to find it much more difficult to lose weight and it does come down though on a cornivore diet without absolutely no carbohydrates whatsoever that's really important and no non- sugar treatment those are very big weight stalls people oh but there's a study this couldn't give a rat ass with any study shows I it just don't care what only thing that matters is what happens in real life and people in real life when they're using these artificial sweeteners these non sugar sweeteners they stall their weight loss not everybody but it happens enough that is it's something that you should should cut out and that was actually Kelly Hogan still using diet drinks because it w diet right and that's okay it's still keto no it's not good for if you're putting chemicals in your body that don't belong there and they're going to have chemical interactions that aren't supposed to happen so you just cut all these things out and then you just give your body time and you'll be fine it'll happen you know just just focus on your health focus on how you feel focus on being the healthiest version of yourself to can't be the weight will happen the weight will come watch my interview Kelly watch some of her videos on gaining weight early on or not losing weight because she talks about this stuff and she went through it herself um she has a a a great video with Charles Washington who you know runs the um zeroing in on health Facebook group he's been doing this for like 20 years you know like they have a lot of experience and they and and he and she have worked with thousands of people he I mean his zing in on health has tens of thousands of people in been very active in that group talking to people about all this stuff for for well over a decade so you know a lot of good information there a lot of good support there and a lot of a lot of people that have had similar experiences to you and guess what you also see them saying hey after this period of time things got better got better things got better things got better just stick with it so I would give the same advice you just stick with it good things will happen as long as you are being you know true to yourself and just having meat and water and eating enough and eating enough fatty meat and enough fat and po uh I'm sure you'll do fine it may take a little time but it will happen Jay thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr Anthony I went carnivore to get rid of PCOS uh or how can I get rid of PCOS if I went carnivore can I get rid of PC or not going to get rid of PC uh so yes I think that that is that is a major cause of pcus I've heard um OBGYN refer to PCOS as type four Diabetes Type three diabetes being Alzheimer's and type four diabetes B PC so it's basically diabetes of the ovaries so you get insulin resistance High just overloaded with insulin throughout your body and this this disrupts your normal noral workings in your over it can it can raise the testosterone levels production in your ovaries um and it can block the it will block the conversion of that testosterone into estrogen so women and men make estrogen or sorry make testosterone first and then that's turned into estrogen afterwards right so it if your insulin is up in a woman that's going to make too much testosterone and that's going to block that from going to estrogen so get get too much testosterone not enough estrogen and that's a Hallmark of PCOS you can get weight gain you can get hair growth and infertility that's the leading cause of infertility in women especially in at least in the Western World anyway and so that uh that can be reversed there there can be other causes of PC but that's a major one that is probably the major one and so if you go carnivore no carbs no sugar no non-sugar sweets no artificial sweets nothing like that and no alcohol either yes that will lower your insulin it will take time but in in the course of of a couple of months that will come down and your hormones will start improving dramatically I mean really even in a cple weeks it's going to start improving but give your body time to heal you know it's not it's not the same just taking a pill on oh I'm gonna fix this you know if uh you know when people are trying to you know get pregnant they have PCOS they get given that form which a diabetes medication which will lower their blood sugar which will lower their their uh insulin resistance and then you start seeing the body start to work properly same principle you just stop eating carbohydrates and it just it just goes but then your body needs a chance to heal its hormones so yes you can absolutely do that I actually have a video on PCOS um and fertility not that anyone watched it my least watched videos um but uh I I mean the thumbnail sucks you know so that's going to be part of it but um maybe I'll try to change that and see what happen but you know it's it's not necessarily something that everyone's interested in so uh but it it does exist so if you look up on my channel PCOS fertility you will see that there but yes it can absolutely uh Zack W thank you so much for the Super Chat 32 32 years old 9 months hor boance since uh 2024 finally off cannabis and other uh addictions IE adult content however it seems like my liido in general has also disappeared so potentially unhealthy um W dyt what do you think um what do I what do I think about wdyt I think what you think so uh well first of all that's awesome that's really great you did a great job coming off cannabis anyway and other addictions like your porn addiction the thing is is with porn addiction the reason that it is so bad is because you stop being interested in s of noral sex you have to go to uh the content in order to get sexually aroused you just sort of trained your body and brain to be aroused by that That explicit content online and so that can that can disrupt things so uh you know if you if you're just doing a lot of meat and you're and you're getting enough of it you're getting enough uh you know fat and everything like that your hormones are going to be fine hormones are going to be better than people were before right now it's a psychological issue that you know you've gotten away from this stuff that's how you got into it mentally and uh you know arousal is very mental thing it's not just a hormonal thing um and so that can actually be so that that will just fix you just just you know put yourself in healthy uh sort of scenarios where that's a thing you know I it's if you have a you know girlfriend or partner you know just just keep putting yourselves in in favorable healthy sort of positions that that you don't rely on that sort of stuff it'll come back you know that like normal normal sort of uh you know inperson sex will start being becoming very appealing again you know it's you know this is this is one of those evolutionary traps again you know we we normally we need to we need to be aroused and have a high liido because we need to reproduce it we need to perpetuate the species that's how life works and yet you fall into this evolutionary trap of porn just like whoa just like sexual overload all the time and then just noral sex doesn't doesn't seem that that interesting anymore so you know it's important just sort of back to so you've already done the biggest step which is getting rid of the alar cont content and you know now you just now it's just you know retuning your brain to see how that works it'll happen and so you know just make sure you're eating enough make sure you're exercising anerobic exercise your lifting weights doing sprints especially the best full body workouts you can ever do Sprints and you just feel amazing after you do something like that if you're if you're sprinting and you're fast you're building up your speed you're building up your Dynamic movement you know you just feel much more healthy much more viral you know like at any at any point you know something happened you just break off Sprint Chase someone down and Tackle them get someone's purse back or something like that and um that LE to a Healy sexual experience you know you never know so you know you just do these things uh like very healthy pck so working out but not like cronic cardio and things like that that that can actually suppress your testosterone and your growth hormone but if you're doing sprints do Anor robic high intensity interval training if you're do weightlifting to failure this is going to support and and encourage your testosterone levels to grow as well as your growth when winter grow and then you just live a healthy life you know these things are going to happen put yourself in good positive uh relationships and experiences and you know this will this will start becoming very rousing to you as well and you be will absolutely go ahead um not getting enough sleep you know having problems with stress depression these sorts of things you know you need to get you need to there are other psychological uh and physiological reasons that you could have a suppressed libido so don't don't forget about those things as Ashley Winter thank you for the Super Chat I've been dirty parore for eight months now uh I noted I know noticed is that what I noticed is that I can't think of certain words during conversation could have be lacking something that's making me forget things and things uh well potentially the thing is what do you mean by Dirty barnivore is that a bit of carbs a bit of plants I mean something that you're eating could be messing with you but if you're eating small amount of carbs for instance then that can raise your insulin enough that you won't be able to make blood sugar plagen properly you won't be able to make ketones properly so your brain is not going to be running on ketones which is optimal Fuel and you know you're not going to uh brain's not going to work properly and and and then on top of that you're going to be you're going to have some carbohydrates but it's going to be actually low level so you now you're you're going to have sort of on hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia you're going to have sort of low blow it's too low and now your brain doesn't have ketones so it needs to run on that glucose it's not enough glucose so just you know you're not going to have the same mental acuity that you normally would so eating properly obviously it's important not eating those things that can interrupt your normal physiological processes it is most low carb I think is worse than no carb because low carb can be enough carbohydrates to raise your insulin so that you're not properly making your own blood sugar black CH and so you end up having less energy less it you it works oh I have all these cars you even all the carb I start low carb and it made me feel worse like right did you go low carb or did you go no carb you go no carb then you'll make FL you'll be fine but if you go low carb you may not it may suppress that it may not be low enough that um it can actually function Norm so that's what I would say uh there a lot of things that are really good for brain your brain I mean things like I mean just U pregnenolone is a hormone that that is suppressed when you're eating crab food carbohydrates and sugar and things like that you know you're not going to be you know be at your best you know if you're not if you're not making all your proper hormones and uh and pregal can be very good for memory memory is chure memory can't find word it's not that that's definitely what it is but things can contribute and uh Coline very important for the brain and just ketones I mean if you're if you're just eating a bit of carbs that's going to make your brain not be able to function properly because you're not getting the correct type and volume of energy that you brain so I just think about that also linolic acid so the seed oils that can be in meat because they could they just feed the chickens and pigs crap now too fish especially if it's farmed fish and it can have very high levels of mtic acid that's really toxic for your brain it gets to your brain and your brain can't really use it as a structural component like it does for the Omega-3s the DHA and EPA but it's um so it triy to get broken down for energy it's not supposed to uh do that it wants the smaller uh energy particles like ketones like glucose which a rough brain and the Omega 6es break down very very toxic free radicals and cause a lot of oxidated stress inflammatory reactions and that make brain out so yeah just give it a try try going from dirty car board to just flat out me water and see how you go L thanks for the Super Chat love your shirt thank you very much um what if I'm on Carnivore but I'm still sore the day after I've worked out also someone told me that carbs are essential for woman's thyroid okay well if they're essential for a woman's thyroid aren't they essential for a man's thyroid and have these people ever wondered why it is that we make carbohydrates in the first place maybe it's for our thyroid maybe it's for these other things that that require carboh hydrids but you only need four grams of glucose in your whole bloodstream to run all the physiological processes in your body including your thyroid and brain so you make all the carbohydrates you need there's no such thing as essential carbohydrates meaning that you don't need to eat it what carbohydrates you need what inial carbohydrates you need what four grams of carbohy is you need your body mates and replenishes and continue continually replenishes as you go so um no you don't need that and you make it and whatever you need as far as cars are concern uh if you're if you're getting sore the day after carore that means there's still inflammation in your body and so quite often that's from the things that we eat but it's not necessarily the case there's something else in your environment that you're having you know just think about that I mean I to be honest I've yet to see someone who's strictly only eating meat and water and really nothing else workouts you know soft drinks or energy drinks or diet drinks or you even you know electrolytes with the stevia you know I mean all these things can contribute to that um coffee you oh no I'm only eating meat only eating meat do you drink coffee yeah I drink coffee okay no you're not doing that um it really does it does really just have to be just meat and water and then of course Dairy is is going to be pro-inflammatory as well um but even the things like I said like the things are high in ltic acid but the meats and eggs that are high in ltic acid um so you know just Factory raised eggs Factory raised chickens pork and farmed fish they're going to be pro-inflammatory too and so if you really are just eating meat and water think about what kind of meat you're eating think about where the eggs are coming from are you having Dairy you know that's going to be pro-inflammatory as well so just think about that most often it's it's someone still has something in their diet something they're eating or drinking or taking as a supplement that is not meat and um or water and so you just just get rid of them almost always will get rid of get rid of the soreness and and if that's not if that's not enough then you think about what needs that you're eating that's well and uh your thyroid has plenty of carbohydrates if it needs it which I'm not even convinc up but you know why would the female of our species need something different than the male of our species it's still the same species but not actually all that different um in a biological sense certainly not from from a nutritional standpoint we all need the same nutrients some of us need more or less at certain periods of time like when we're more active or like when we're pregnant and uh nursing but that doesn't change the nutrition required it just change changes the volume of nutrition required um female lines equal male lines female Peng equal nail py and then you know when when a u when a mother in the wild is feeding their their kid they're feeding their kid down milk and then they we them off on to whatever they're eating the male and female children of that species they eat exactly what the parents are eating and the parents are eating exactly what the males are eating and the females are eating exactly males eating the males eating exactly what the females are eating the idea that our that our species is just just does not adhere to these these biological law that apply to every other form of life on Earth and apply to ourselves going back two million years makes absolutely no sense I mean how do how do female Inuits deal with thing we their carbs you know they if they have to have carbs if they need that or thyroid just craps out well that's it for the species you know because you need thyroid and your kids need thyroid because you get congenital hypothyroidism it's called cretinism and you have severe mental and physical deform deformities and deficiencies and disabilities it's not going to last too long you know you can't you can't exist in an ice AG with cretinism with the whole clan of cretinism right just can't it doesn't work right so and it doesn't happen so no you don't need to eat carbs you never need to eat carbs your body makes all the carbs and if you don't need any carbs carbs stay here exact level that you need at the perfect blood sugar level all the time so whether or not you need carbohydrates for a certain physiological process you certainly don't need to eat them in order to get them they are not essential you make carbohydrates and uh no female ever needs to eat differently than the male it's optimal it's optimal for the species not the G Annabella the happy carnivore thank you very much for the Super Chat I told my carnivore doctor I'm going to eat Oreos yeah well want to you want to lower your your um cholesterol your LDL cholesterol went on a a ketogenic diet you know that is that is one way to do it it sort of demonstrates that principle of this energy Dynamic that you know you just you're you're running on fats your body needs to transport fat around the body it's pretty simple and um you know I'm glad glad that uh you know that Nick norwitz Dave Felman and others are you know just trying to make that that more aware of that get that into literature I mean it's it's pretty much straightforward biochemistry to me so you know I was I was um that was just what I you know thought was happening anyway you when people ask why does the LDL go up when you when you eat this way why does it go up when you fast same reason you're you're running on that you need Mo that around your body and LDL does that and so now they're actually quantifying that showing that in in experimental data which is great but um you know I I I thought that was just something we all knew already but um apparently some people are are slower Learners so they they need more and more and more of this stuff in their face before they go like oh God okay maybe I should open chemistry book think about for a second so yeah we'll get there you know the truth well out eventually this GNA have have to happen unless they really suppress this down but you know the information's out there and so hopefully you know more and more people will come across it and uh Lena thank you again for the Super Chat best time to do one meal a day if food is the first thing you think of when you wake up if I eat earlier in the day would it mess up my sleep uh have fun on your vacation thank you very much for that um no it shouldn't mess up your sleep the thing is it's going to make you sleepy during the day and if you eat a lot of meat during the especially if youat just one meal a day you could feel very tired and lethargic afterwards which would be very inconvenient for the rest of your day um if your body's telling you to eat more often then you should eat more often I don't think you have to do one meal a day quite often people default into doing one meal a day just because that's that's how much the body needs but that doesn't mean that you have have to do one meal a day if you're if you eat a big meal until you're full and until a food stops tasting good until meat stops tastes good only meat is the only thing I consider food um then quite often people are not they're not hungry right for the next day they will be hungry but if you're active and your body needs more more food and you and you have a big deal you eat until it stops tasting good you wake up the morning go like I need to eat should probably eat you know it is okay to do that when I'm working when I'm sedentary and I'm just going around the hospital it's just doing work citar for work I I eat once a day and that's perfectly fine for me as long as I'm eating fatty meat till I'm full if I am working out I'm being more active I will do that same thing I'll eat till I'm full at night and be like wow that's that's enough that's all I want I'll wake up the morning go I want to do that again so I do it again I cook a steak cut up into chunks put it into a container bring it to work with me um usually I'll eat most with a fork in the car it's car state and um and uh and that's fine I just won't I won't get stuffed you know I won't I won't eat till it just completely stop tasting I try to try to limit it you don't have to do one a day it does not have to be one it needs to be enough food for you body sell think that that's problem I think that's fine as long as you're eating the right things okay just take a look at the chats here everybody just to make sure that I get to all these this probably cut off the super chats just don't don't do any more Super chats I don't want to I don't want to miss out on anybody um and um but I have to go in 24 minutes that's that's a hard stop so um I'll try to get through all of these um and and we will come at it again next time Josh voice song Thank you very much for the Super Chat Dr chy little over one week carore but I'm I've been experiencing swelling in my lower legs shins to feet this is common or a concern it can happen you can get fluid shifts especially early on when your insulin starts to go down your body starts getting rid of electrolytes have to sort of balance out how much electrolytes getting in you start getting sort of food shifts between different tissues uh just drink enough water eat salt to taste um sometimes people need a bit more salt than that mostly they don't um and usually after a couple weeks that goes away so just make sure you're get up water make sure you're eating enough salt if you need it and uh yeah it should it should settle down and go away you get these weird food shifts think you can try and there can be other reasons for for for swelling in your legs these are just the ones that that can come from a dietary change like this um you know so don't don't discount that know sometimes people make a dramatic change in their diet the way that they eat um they attribute absolutely everything to that change in way they eat when of course that's not necessarily the case that's um um that is just one of the reasons and of course that's the first thing you think about but it should not be the only thing you think about and so just remember that um it should go away you use compressing compression stocks to sort of keep that swelling down to keep that F moving walk move your body keep those legs pumping and keep those uh juices flowing and it should settle down it should settle down in the next couple weeks and hopefully it does but if it doesn't you know you need to consider other sorts of things and uh if that sort of persists then you might just check with your doctor you don't have to tell them you went cornal G but just say hey I'm having these these we sort of puffy puffiness and swelling you know spend less time on your feet put your feet up let drain wear compression stockings things like that but there could be other sorts of things you know other sorts of conditions that could contribute to that that could just be presenting at a similar time when you change the way you're eating but if it is from the way you're eating and it's just these fluid shifts just electrolytes sort of uh your body sort of trying to normalize your electrolytes and your and your fluid deposition in certain tissues it'll it'll fix in time okay so DLo Jason thank you for the Super Chat 45y old male currently a heavy alcoholic about 20 to 25 light beers per day want to reduce and quit while also starting carnivore is there danger in doing both at the same time and any other advice thank you no actually in fact there's probably a benefit to do both because there in studies with ketogenic diets and car diet is a ketogenic diet as long as you're actually just eating meat and Bar uh which is what else is carnivore diet that is the carnivore diet um then that actually been shown to improve detoxing from from alcohol so um uh just so sort of gotta think here is does my sound still bad the problem is I didn't I didn't use a didn't bring my mic mic so I only have my headphone um is itam okay might move in from outside because I think there's a lot of outside noise like the um from the beach that might be interfering with everything so I'll just come in here and close the door okay how's that is that any better for for people yes well I should have done that an hour ago thank you I didn't know it at the time um all right okay all right okay so hopefully that's better hopefully hopefully people can actually hear me now uh great just going to change this okay little better all right so excuse me okay so um asked your a question so so should you quit at a different time no I think I think is a perfect time to go carnivores when you're trying to come off alcohol because there are studies with ketogenic diet showing that this actually improves outcomes from from withdrawing and detoxing from alcohol coming off of them even in in the hospital settings so people going through you know if you've been drinking you know uh to that extent for a number of years you know you do run the risk of going into the DTs delirium tremin and that can actually be uh dangerous you know people can actually get seizures from that so you probably need to work with your doctor doctor to come off and you might need some medications to help with that so sometimes you give um U benzor daab beans uh like Librium is if I'm not mistaken on the name it's been a while since I had to put someone through that but um you you sort of you sort of given that if they're getting sort of like shaky and and and starting to look like they're going to to start going through withdrawal symptoms or or you know get withdraw seizures um but people on ketogenic diets actually found that they they they reported themselves they felt it was an easier time coming off of alcohol than the people that weren't on it and objectively they didn't need as much medication to come off and withdraw so I think it's the perfect time to do both I think that that that one will help the other obviously getting rid of alcohol will help your overall health which is the whole point of a carnivore diet and is optimizing your health and that going on a carnivore diet and getting rid of all this other crap is going to help you do exactly that come off the alcohol as well so I think this this is a really really good good idea that you've had and to do this at the same time I think is a great idea it may be that you need to uh work with your doctor I think you probably should work with your doctor to to U make sure that you get the best out of get get the most out of this and that uh you do safely you know that's the most important thing you need to do this safely um I think it's fantastic that you're that you're looking to come off alcohol um and I I I hope that it goes really well for you and um but you know your doctor can help you uh do that safely so please do that and good luck with it let us know how it goes okay Kate thank you very much for the Super Chat nine years ago I got a bad case of Bell's pausy that affected my forehead down to my neck I have um synkinesis now can gnore help correct that thank you well it certainly depends on what caused the bell's posy we don't really always know what causes Bell's posy apart from the fact that it's affecting the facial nerve so Bell's py is facial nerve py affects that facial nerve on that side of your face and so forehead down to the platisa which is the sort of the muscles in the neck that help you Flex that that's all the lower Branch lowest branch of the of the facial nerve so it depends on what's causing that depends on how how severe and significant and extensive the damage to the facial nerve was if it's completely severed it's not GNA come back most likely however I've seen some pretty remarkable recoveries with people going carnivore on top of going keto and ketogenic D dieset have been clinically shown to improve outcomes on both concussions and traumatic brain injures and this is going to improve stroke outcomes as well you get damage to the brain then you're putting in a lot of ketones which your brain runs on and uses as building blocks the ketones go into your brain and cross the blood brain barrier and actually reconstitute into fat fatty acids and those are used as a physical structures and building material of your brain and your nervous system so you can actually rebuild things better if you're on in ketosis and having a lot of ketones in the body and if you're bringing a lot of fat and essential fatty acids and and things like DHA and EPA which your brain is made of choline and carnitine and all these other wonderful things that are very good and important for your brain and your brain health and Recovery then you're going to improve whereas otherwise you wouldn't and I've seen people recover from dramatic things years after they've had had the injury uh people you should go people should go watch my video with Dave Mack it's freaking amazing like he had a stroke 30 years ago did keto did Atkins stable neurology weakness on right side to the point that it affected him physically 30 years later he goes on a cornivore die in two months he's walking normally the hell is that that's not supposed to happen you know we teach that if you have an injury you know to your nerves or your brain that you'll heal up to a certain point but after a year or two with the outside whatever your whatever your neurology is that point that's where it's going to stay it's never going to change and yet and yet there are people around the world World getting recoveries decades after they've had this very major insult to their brain and their body wild absolutely wild so I I don't I don't discount anything it's just a sort of a wait and see sort of thing I can't say that it's going to help at all the likelihood is that it it it it won't that's what that's what we normally see is that it doesn't get better but depending on what it is we are seeing some people improve and so I think that it's it's certainly worth a try and U you know it's going to improve your life and a thousand other ways anyway and it may improve this and there are a lot of people finding that their their old neurological injuries are getting better wild absolutely wild we don't know we don't have all the answers yet we don't know why it's able to do this now and it wasn't able to do this 30 years ago but for whatever reason it it does seem to be happening so just give it a try you know it's going to improve your life in other ways any a lot of other ways anyway so it's going to be well worth the effort and you know if it if it doesn't help you're in the exact same position you were last last point with Bell's policy but you won't have but you'll have all these other improvements as well so it's it's only going to make things better regardless of whether it helps with the bells policy but I'd be interested to see if it does help you please please do let me know let us know and um you know maybe down the line you can sort of you put it in the chat or you'll put it in chats of other videos just to let people know because it's it's always good to gather more information and see what what people are healing from Adam M thank you very much for the Super Chat fom urine no protein in urine egfr is 111 only thing that was off was bu and bu creatinine by one point each on the high side being carnivore any idea why F urine is not a big deal you know it could be that you have protein in your pee but it doesn't mean that you do it doesn't mean that you have any sort of kidney dis function It's just sometimes people say that um but you know sometimes I've got foam EP and sometimes I don't you know just pee down the side of the bowl if if you don't want don't want it to foam up um it's it's it's not that big a deal it it you the thing is there's a lot of signs in medicine that that sometimes they mean something and sometimes they don't and sometimes they could they could mean one of a dozen things and so the point is is that you check right so you had some om p worried about it you got it checked you don't have protein in it your kidneys are working perfectly B1 and creatinine your Ur Ura is going to go up because you're eating more protein and that's a breakdown product of protein but it's also a really good anti-inflammatory so uh so was uric acid by the way people oh my God uric acid we don't want that because it'll cause gout no it doesn't people have high uric acid serum levels they don't have any Gap presentation or they have low serum uric acid and they do get Gap so it's it's it's not NE necessarily even associated with each other it's just that you can get uric acid crystals in your joints but there are other causes of gout besides uric acid Crystal now termed pseudo gout but they used we just call gout we just had five different causes of gout but now the gout is uric acid crystals and pseudo gout is the other ones but even gout gout with ID crystals in your joints don't necessarily have a relationship between the serum uric acid level so that's just a bit of an aside but it I mean really this is more about our metabolism of uric acid crystals and why is it getting into the joint um in the first place is that you know when it shouldn't be there so there's obviously something else going on there but anyway your Ura going up is normal that just means that you're you know you're just metabolizing a bit more protein for energy and that's a breakdown product of that behavior so or that process and so but your your your kidney function is perfect right so that that's not a problem your creatinine is low that means your kidneys are working they're eliminating out all the stuff that it should be so I wouldn't worry about it get some foamy PE sometime you don't have protein in your your PE your kidneys are working great I wouldn't worry about it Andrew applebe thank you very much for the Super Chat uh my diet is ruminant animal meat eggs bone broth and raw milk at night what's your opinion on raw milk I feel amazing by the way and love your work well thank you very much I appreciate that well look if you feel great then that's great I do think there's a problem with with raw milk in that context you know if people were eating sort of mixed diet they probably were nutritionally deficient raw milk is probably their best friend because it has so much nutrients that are just so beneficial to us but at the same time it has carbohydrates it has a lot of carbohydrates has enough carbohydrates it will spike your insulin and and sort of run counter to what you're trying to do it's also delicious and so you end up wanting to eat eat more so I mean I I you're saying raw milk you didn't say one glass of raw milk and for me one glass of raw milk is not happening it's like however much raw milk is available is that's how much I'm drinking and it's addictive they're minor they're mild opiates in milk and this is probably just just get the the kid eating a lot you know and uh and that sweetness is very addictive remember those evolutionary traps sort of a theme this time is the evolution trap theme but that's one of them we get these carbs and that's get these carbs and it's little mild opiate and it's like oh I need this you know and you know you end up overeating that you know as a as a kid as a baby you want to grow you want to make sure that you're eating enough you want to have that healthy appetite but you know once we once we get weaned on to eating what we're supposed to eat meat then then that that's a bit of evolutionary trap but normally you wouldn't you wouldn't run into that in the wild you're not not accessing milk I mean if you took down an animal and it was and it was nursing and it had milk like you they an animal might eat the milk drink the milk but that's not going to be a daily thing you know all the time you know that's just a oneof and a bit at that so um I I would bet that you're doing that you would do better uh without the raw milk even though it's bloody delicious you know if you're just eating the ruminal rum ah ruminant meat you're I think you're going to do better especially because you're going to get rid of of the carbohydrates raw milk is great but it's not the best you know and if you want if you want the best if you want optimal if you want the best that you can possibly be then that would just be the ruminant meat um but you know I don't I don't think raw milk is bad for most people most people do great on it except for the carbohydrates so I don't think that there's anything besides the carbohydrates that are really all that bad for you um so and it has tons of nutrients it is very nutritious but it is not a steak you know it's not going to be perfect nutrition like a steak is and it will have the carbohydrates that can be enough of a problem to uh be a problem so maybe just give that a shot and see how you go just try just try the you know the the ruminant animals eggs and bone broth for a month without the raw milk and just see how you go and you you know that that bit of raw milk that you have is uh is benefiting you and you don't see too much of a detriment fine uh don't have too much I I so I ran the experiment so what my Bloods did I drank a gallon because I don't stop start eating this stuff a gallon of raw milk a day for three days and um it's bloody delicious and I ate meat and things like that too but then I test I tested My fasting insulin I wanted to see what that was going to do my metabolism normally was like 3.5 very nice and low right went to 19 after 3 days of of drinking a gallon now it's a gallon of milk that's like I know two 300 grams of carbs uh it's a lot lot you know but it get it it sneaks up on you there's a lot of carbs in there we don't realize that and so my fasting insulant went went up you know quite a lot and they came right back down again but that's what it's doing to you it is going to give you an inappropriate insulin response and blood sugar response so for me that's not that's not optimal so I avoid it rajaram g Shankar thank you so much for the extremely generous uh Super Chat it's very very kind of you greetings from India uh when I'm off carbs I get dizzy when I get up Suddenly or work out a lot bending up and down I feel as if I'm going to lose balance and fall down for one uh to Max 5 seconds I will hold on to something or sit down to get stable I never have this when I'm eating carbs that's a blood pressure issue it's called postural hypotension or orthostatic hypotension so as you stand up you change your position and your blood sugar will transiently drop anyway and then your body kicks in and starts increasing your blood pressure a little bit so you can get per usion to the brain so that is what that's from the reason that you're getting this when you come off carbs is because it's early days on carbs and so you know like I said before some people can actually get a bit of electrolyte disturbance and if you are getting a bit of electr disturbance and you have I mean you may not be low as in like your sodium is down at like 130 125 which you'll get serious cognitive uh symptoms at that point you'll get very tired lethargic confused and very hard to Rouse and um and then you go into a coma and then you die you know so that's very low I I've never seen anybody do that but if you have you know sort of a a uh a drop from where you were that can affect your blood sugar even even if it's not down you know out down and out it still can go down and that can take take take a while it can take a couple weeks to normalize and so your body can start normalizing your your electrolyte loss you can get sort of insensible electrolyte loss when your in insulin comes down your blood sugar comes down your insulin comes down you can start losing more uh sodium uh and other electrolytes early on but normally this this corrects in a couple weeks so that sounds like what that's what's happening to you is that you're having a bit of insensible uh electrolyte loss and you're dehydrated and because you're dehydrated and your body can't maintain your blood pressure you're getting that dizziness so uh first of all give it more time you know after a couple weeks that usually goes away you need to get rid of all carbohydrates and so again zero carb is better than some carb is better than low carb so you do that make sure you're adding salt if you're still getting this dizziness you need to up your salt you need to up your water you need a lot more water and then you need to need to have more salt as well and maybe add in some of the other electrolytes as well such as potassium and magnesium um usually salt will get it done but you know there are cases where you you have to eat more salt than just salting to taste we'll we'll cover for in those first couple weeks it is rare but you sound like one of the lucky few that that's going to apply to at least to make sure you get more water so drink more water use more salt if you're still getting this drink even more water use even more salt if should normalize it should settle down and then just be careful you know I mean you're not being dizzy and and um troubled all the time it's just sort of when you go from sitting to standing or when you're bending over and then standing up that's a blood pressure issue and so you just need to be slower need to be be more careful and just understand it'll go away it will go away you'll be fine but um you know it's uh it's just something that you have to have to be aware of and uh and that's how you deal with it looks like there's another question from our friend Roger M thank you very much again for the Super Chat I suffer from solar orticaria to missed uh to mention that earlier um so quite often people's uh skin issues of all descriptions will improve when you're on just a just a straight up cornivore diet where you're just eating meat uh generally Dairy is a bit more inflammatory and so ghee is fine a eggs are can be fine you know especially if they're pasture Ray see how they they affect you um cheeses and cream maybe maybe not so it just depends on how how you react to it so just see how try try to get down to as close to just just meat and water as you can and um and that should help there's a lot of people with solar ticaria that uh that improve dramatically with that um by going on a carnivore diet but just make sure that that the more inflamatory things like Dairy like eggs farmed fish things like that are not are not getting in and causing a problem or if you just sort of cut out everything and especially the carbohydrates and everything else that you just get down to just meat eggs and water and if that's not enough then you need to cut down to sort of more ruminant Meats like you know goat or or sheep or something like that if you're in India and and beef isn't an option which it isn't always but it is in some places so just do it that way you know just cut out everything except meat eggs and water that's not enough just go to the the ruminant meat and water and uh that should help most people people do find that they improve on that okay I think this is going to be the last one everyone uh very sorry for those that um uh that didn't get well I'll do I'll do I'll do a couple actually um I'll do this one this one's quick EAS I just sort of saw this this is from the riy guy is it worth becoming an MD today if carnivore I think it's most important to become first of all if if that's your calling if that's what you want to do if that's what's going to make you happy and fulfill your life then yes it's definitely worth doing a carnivore regard or doing MD regardless of uh you know your eating habits but um but if you do know the truth about this and and you're you're in a position to actually help your patients properly and do real medicine where you're actually treating problems that can't be fixed with just simple ass lifestyle adjustments you know then it's it's important that you become an MD and get in there and start turning the tide of opinion on this and actually start treating patients properly and and getting rid of the 90 freaking three% of issues that we treat nowadays which are chronic diseases that are direct consequence of eating the wrong thing you get a rid of that and your Pat you help your patients that way you're going to be a very good doctor and so yes I think it's very uh still a great idea to do that and important too okay Sharon Burns uh lucky last um thank you very much for the for the Super Chat Sharon thank you very much for for everybody for your super chats again I'm very sorry I couldn't get through all of them there's just wasn't much but there was a couple a couple that I wasn't able to get to so I'm very sorry um and um Okay so so Sharon says been on Carnivore for several months now been feeling great then started experiencing hormone swings acne mood swings brain fog headaches tiredness what the heck happened 30-year-old female 123 pounds uh very good question several months and then started so your body can can shift and rearrange your hormones quite dramatically especially in the first few months generally after generally people get those experiences though in the earlier months and then after four or five months they go away um due to that hormonal uh changes so that does sound like there's some sort of hormonal changes so maybe think about what you're eating is that different from what you were eating before is that maybe as good as it could be is it very pure pure pure meat and water and really nothing else or really pure pure red meat and water and nothing else maybe just see if there's something in there that you can optimize and uh remember all your Baseline is always just red meat and water that's always the Baseline grass-fed and finish red water for you know the true Bedrock of a situation that's where you just go down down to the bottom that's where it is of just just the best you could ever do is just grass-fed uh beef and water or lamb and water or mutton in water goat and water venison in water those sorts of things the the naturally raised red meats and water ruminant animals that are eating what they're designed to eat as well um make sure you're getting enough make sure you're eating enough fat make sure you're getting enough water um and then make sure none of these other little things have slipped in Stevia can disrupt your hormones potentially uh there are studies in mice that show that even just one diet soda worth of stevia can disrupt your hormones and actually reduce the fertility rate of mice by 55 5% pretty crazy and so what the hell is that doing to you what is that doing to your hormones it's it's very likely to be a hormone disruptor there are other hormone disruptors in your environment that don't have anything to do with your food like the BPA in plastic so different Plastics putting never heat anything in a plastic container ever never put hot liquid into a plastic container or things that have a plastic lining a lot of the paper cups that are used in coffee shops um have like this weird little plasticky sort of lining so it doesn't like soak through into the paper and and soak the paper out and you have like dripping coffee and stuff like that that stuff is toxic in in in so far as it can uh Cause A disruption in your hormones and your physiology not that it will kill you that day but that it's not good for you you know there's varying degrees of toxicity I just consider anything that's not supposed to be there and causes some sort of disruption and harm a toxin more or less you know there's different things that are that are more or less toxic but it's still toxic if it's causing even minor problems and a lot of these things can cause problems with your hormones and so getting rid of all those things also Beauty Supplies there's so we've we've patented a million different chemicals since the 1970s that have never existed that don't exist in nature what the hell is that doing to us you know we're exposing ourselves to to these chemicals that we're chemical factors our body makes chemic reactions with other chemicals you put chemicals on your skin put chemicals in your body that's going to cause chemical Rea in your body some of it contend with some of it has no idea what the hell to do with it and some of it disrupts your physiology and your hormones and so there are a lot of a lot of endocrine disrup disruptors especially in female uh beauty products skin products lotions scents especially like those air fresheners horrible for your hormones apparently um and uh you know and there's always going to be mixed views on this but you know there are there are studies showing that this can be these can be endocrine disruptors same with essential oils same with tea tree oil and and lavender things like that and then there's other St oh no no definitely doesn't do anything okay I I don't know who paid for that one was it someone who had a vested interest in you know the the beauty industry or anything like that maybe maybe not but at the end of the day these are chemicals that don't belong in or on your body and they could be doing something so why why put them there so just be very cautious about that um you know I heard I heard someone say a doctor say well never put anything on your skin uh that you wouldn't eat because it's um in 20 minutes that's in your that's in your bloodstream and that's true a lot of the stuff soaks in especially things that are are fat soluble like the lotions things like that they will just get right in your bloodstream you know this is why some people put on like sun screen lotion or some little whatever DMSO for painkiller something like that and they taste it there's like a weird taste that they get in their mouth you know within 20 30 seconds that's getting in your body that's getting in your bloodstream of course that's going to have an effect on your body so there are all these things that can that can cause issue um I put Tallow and emu oil on my skin that's it I wash with Tallow soap unless I'm traveling and I didn't bring a bar with me but um you know at home I I I wash with Tallow soap and I have a Tallow uh hair wash sort of thing and I I'll use a conditioner and things like that but I try to get things that don't have a whole bunch of sense and things um and uh you know you just do the best you can you know you just try to limit the different amounts of chemicals that are getting into your body you try to put and that goes for the food I mean that's why we're doing this you that food is chemical and you're putting those chemicals in your body some of those chemicals you want some of them you don't want specifically plant chemicals they make a point to make uh chemicals that you don't want so in any case that's what I would try to do just get down just straight down to meat and water try to get rid of all these other sort of things make sure you're sleeping well make sure you're lowering your stress because that can be an endocrine disruptor as well the cortisol goes up it's going to it's going to screw with your your other hormones and uh and be very strict just meat and water red meat and water if you can if it if that's not enough and hopefully this just is a phase and um you're able to just sort of work through it most people do so just stick with it focus on the other wins focus on the other aspects of posit health and then just try to optimize this from there and hopefully that will that will sort you out okay all right thank you so much everybody it's been an absolute pleasure uh great to see you all thank you everyone for joining on Facebook and on uh Instagram as well um I think I'm going to have to maybe do some just straight up you know YouTube well yeah um Instagram lives as well I'll probably try to do some of those as well um because I can't I can't bring up the questions on the screen here unfortunately so I can get Instagram questions but they don't I can't pop them up on the screen unfortunately which is a bit annoying um but there is just one question here on from camshaft on Instagram it says you mentioned in one of your videos If stools are loose maybe sign up too much fat and the diet is that right and uh it can be but there could be other things as well such as um if you're drinking coffee or tea or using any non- sugar sweeteners like arrol or Stevia or Xylitol or or sorbitol all of those things can are laxatives um magnesium supplements can cause can can become a laxative and uh medications there's different medications you could do this as well um uh like metform met forming can cause loose stools and other sorts of things uh other sorts of issues as well so as long as you're not having any of those and you're just having fatty meat and water if you are getting loose stools then it could be that you're having more fat than your body can absorb and it's just going out but it could be you're so constipated you're getting a pseudo obstruction and you get overflow diarrhea where just the liquid pushes around that and you get liquid diarrhea that's called spous diarrhea or overflow diarrhea and so that would look like most of the time you're getting water diarrhea and every now and then you just get this Boulder that comes out uh that's you know difficult to do and then it goes back to liquid if that's the case then you need a lot more fat because you're very constipated as opposed to too much fat uh but I do have a video called fiber constipation and diet where I go into more detail about all that that people would take a look at okay I did about four more questions that I that I thought I was going to thank you everyone I really appreciate it um I will be back next week I'll be back in uh back home next week and to continue the lives there thank you everyone very much for joining uh I will have a Premiere as usual this weekend Sunday in America Monday morning in Australia in this part of the world and uh hopefully I will see you all then to chat in the in the the live text chat as we as we watch that video um and it really is a help when people come out to watch the premiere because it uh it just helps drive that algorithm and people say oh more people are watching this more people are interested in this maybe other people will be interested as well and it really helps get the message out there and um and they're they're interesting and hopefully people like them so hope you can see hope you can make it for that and uh I will see you then thanks everyone"
