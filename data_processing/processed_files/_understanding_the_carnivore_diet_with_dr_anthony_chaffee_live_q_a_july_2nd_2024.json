        "body": "is from Emma backland thank you very much Emma for the is from Emma backland thank you very much Emma for the Super Chat Emma says hi Dr chaffy a friend said when I started carnivore that if you don't eat carbs you need to work out otherwise your body will start eating your muscles because there is nothing else to uh take energy from is this true no that is absolutely not true uh no that definitely not true so I mean you get energy from the food that you eat like you know meat and fat so fat is is is our actual preferred and most abundant energy source and so that's what your body uses predominantly um and you can convert protein into energy but you know this would be a from the protein that you're eating and you can convert that over into energy but if you're having enough fat you won't really do this you'll largely use the the fat that you're eating so no that doesn't happen and um it's uh it's it's strange that that sort of rumor goes around but there's absolutely no basis in reality for it um in fact when you're in ketosis and you you have ketones available and you're you're you fat available you will not catabolize your muscles you won't uh you won't use your muscles as energy until you run out of fat and that's that's an accusation that i' I've heard some people that are you know trying to you know um disparage the ketogenic diet or an animal-based diet oh no you have to eat plants oh my God because you're G to lose muscle first like no you don't um one thing that can look like that if you if you're all bulked up on carbs you put on fat and you store fat and um you store fat in your subcutaneous tissue you also store muscles fat in your muscles and you store glycogen in your muscles and then glycogen pulls in water and so they get puffy and Bloated and so then you stop eating carbohydrates all of a sudden your muscles shrink oh my God your body's you know eating your muscles no it's not it's getting rid of the water weight the glycogen and the intramuscular fat it was never muscle in the first place it's called myosteatosis this is a medical term and definition for intramuscular fat it's like marbling on a cow on a steak and um it's something we see commonly in medicine you look at MRIs and you see people with mosis in in their muscles it's a it's a pathological sign it's not normal it's not supposed to be there but it's getting more and more common and that's uh it's becoming the norm but it's not normal it is pathological and so that comes from eating carbohydrates for alcohol or you know those similar sorts of things and um so you know this is where you see like bodybuilders they're just bulked up and fat and puffy because they're eating so many carbs oh this is how you get bulky no that's how you get fat and then they do cutting phase where they just cut out all the carbs and just eating you know lean protein things like that and they're not eating fat which is you know more of the pity because they you know screws up their hormones they feel wretched and and um but uh they're not eating carbs and so they're eating a lot of lean meat lean protein and they're and all of a sudden they're they're losing all this muscle no they're not losing muscle they're losing the fat the glycogen and the and the water that that they stored in their muscles because they're toxifying their body with all these carbohydrates and so uh that's good it's good good riddens to to Bad Company you know and um and uh so that's not muscle so no that is that is definitely not the case uh you don't you don't eat your muscles if you don't eat carbs I have not eaten carbs in the better part of the decade you know I'm I'm more muscular now than when I started so it's U definitely not the case uh 70% of all animal species are carnivores they just eat meat they're not just lift yeah yeah lions are really emaciated you know um but herbivores that just eat fibrous plants or predominantly eat fibrous plants you know they they don't turn that fiber into its constituent glucose molecules the bacteria in their gut eat the fiber and as a byproduct they release fat and protein and actually they they release fat and then they die off and then they're absorb the pro the dead bacteria are absorbed as protein and so a gorilla may eat a whole bunch of leaves but what he absorbs is fat and protein not carbohydrates and gorillas have muscles strange but true you know so no that's that's completely false it doesn't even it doesn't even hold up to even the basic uh basic scrutiny [Music] um so Nancy had a question uh why do I experience cramping in my ankle yet my husband has cramping in his thigh why the different locations uh that's a good question I don't I don't have a good answer for that but it's always typically um uh dehydration it's almost always could be electrolytes could be almost always it's it's um it's dehydration so start with that first start upping your water first see how that affects you if that's not doing the trick then you can start adding in uh you know more electrolytes and things like that but always make sure that you that you use electrolytes that don't have added sweeteners or or flavorings because those are those are not good for you you don't want those uh Ellie thank you very much for the"

        "body": "ng butter carnivore Zealot thank you very much for the ng butter carnivore Zealot thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm now competing in the wheel wad W or wheel W CrossFit uh very cool thank you I thought it was over for me nice very good I'm glad that you're able to get into it um you and Sean do great work I can't uh close climb a mountain fast but I can climb a mountain uh well that's good I'm I'm really glad that you're you're able to compete again and and feeling good hopefully just keeps getting better and better and better you know as as you know the longer you go on a on a ketogenic diet in General on a carnivore diet specifically the more adapted you get to it the more keto adapted you get to it the more access or or the more uh efficient you get at using your ketones in in your body and making you know blood sugar and things like that and your mitochondria get healthier and stronger and you're just producing more and more energy much readily and it just makes you a better and better athlete and feel better and better as you go and you know something that that people don't realized is that um is that uh even even like a top a very slim athlete at 65 kilos um at 6% body fat so very lean very lean they have 150,000 kilo calories of energy stored in there in their uh fat tissue just 6% body fat for a 65 kilo uh athlete massive amounts of energy you're never going to store that much in glycogen never and uh and so if you want to carry around 100,000 150,000 calories worth of sugar drinks and things like that you know be my guess but it's it's not it's not nearly as efficient and effective and in fact they um Dr VC 2016 I think was the fast study showed that um glycogen um stores in the muscle were regenerated faster in ketogenic athletes than in the carb fueled athletes who are sucking down you know sugar gels and things like that so you know this is this is a a and you have ketones and your blood sugar is Rock Solid you're not having ups and downs like you do when you're when you're eating a bunch of carbs so makes a big difference for athletes and uh I'm glad to hear that you're you're doing so much better and you're reducing all the inflammation your body feels better and much better recovery much less soreness if any soreness most people don't get soreness if they're 100% meat and water so uh yeah so it's great to hear glad that you're you're back competing um I did want to mention as well sorry I forgot to say this at the beginning uh but you know again I just want to announce a special uh sponsor uh uh Mr Chris brandlin who goes by the carnivore lawyer um he provides free uh legal advice and help for the carnivore Community which is amazing uh that he's willing to do that for people he's been helping me uh copyright protect my uh my podcast and which is a tedious process and so I'm really appreciative of him and his help and um and so he's he's a special sponsor of uh of the show and uh if you want to uh get in touch with him or see more about what he does they can go to brandlin law.com and that's spelled b n d l i n law.com and that's in the description in the show notes as well so people can can take a look at that and yeah so very uh very big thank you uh to Chris uh for all his help for me and the carnivore Community he's helped he's helped other people as well um with different sorts of things so uh really appreciate all the help Chris and uh thank you for for all you do so a question from Ellie again thank you very much Ellie uh sorry for all the butter related questions I know you're okay with eggs and butter but in your opinion is just meat and water the ideal thank you so much yes I do think that that uh red meat and water like beef fatty beef and water are the are the ideal 100% And um you know some people will will do just as well with like pasture raised eggs if they don't have a sensitivity to it uh some people may not even do as well with with pasture raised eggs you know and then some people will have autoimmune issues and just can't handle eggs at all especially the egg whites but it's um yeah I I do think that uh ruminant meat you know uh is and water is the best and then obviously the best quality ruminant meat you know grass-fed finished and regeneratively r bed or wild caught Etc with a lot of fat and even older animals is they're going to have a higher nutrient density they've had longer to build up a store of nutrients and um and be more nutritious so uh yeah I think that's the ideal but you know anything on the carnivore spectrum is still fantastic and a hell of a lot better than than the any of the Alternatives uh any plants and uh certainly any processed garbage so from Dage one of our lovely moderators uh says could you repeat the information and explain for chat why over four grams of carbohydrate sugar is too much for us and becomes toxy out yeah that's that's a very good question so um you normal blood sugar we have like you know blood sugar of you know 90 80 90 something like that right or up to 100 for an average person that's about four gram of glucose and so that's only four grams the entire circulatory system and that provides all of the uh that that's responsible and appropriate for running all the physiological processes of all our tissues in our body and brain just four grams at any given time a but those glucose molecules are actually they can they can cause damage right so the up to four grams the benefit outweigh the harm but those glucose molecules can physically fuse to other molecules it's called glycation so it's a non-enzymatic fusion between the any carbohydrate molecule including glucose or fructose which is actually stronger glycolytic action um and um and so they have they they fuse the things more aggressively fructose does but all the carbohydrate molecules will went out in their free form and so we measure this with hba1c that's the the uh the advanced glycation end product AG of um of glucose in hemoglobin and so but that's a marker of how much damage is happening to the rest of your body because this is happening at all stages I mean if your if your glucose is one you're still causing in damage it's obviously just a very small amount your body can contend with this um but it it is causing damage this is what kills diabetics over time is this is this U chronically elevated blood sugar that is fusing and damaging other molecules and tissues and cells and they they shut down and they can't work and this is why you lose your toes and then your feet and then your legs and then your kidneys and then your heart and then you get Alzheimer's and Dementia and then you go blind and you die you know this affects every single system and organ in your and tissue in your body it's very harmful um but at what level right I mean so when people have glucose of 120 140 150 like on average all the time they start getting these problems over years so this is this is actually toxic at that level so four grams is what we can contend with but it's all we need and in the first place but it's all we can contend with and and safely deal with you get up one extra gram up to five grams in your in your circulatory system at at any given time chronically over time or on average this is a toxic dose this is toxic to your body and your body responds to it as a toxin by trying to detoxify it by elevating your insulin to get that down it wants to get that below four grams because it's toxic above four grams and so you're doing this constantly and then you need more you get insulin resistance you're getting needing requiring more and more insulin to get the same effect and keep that below four but it's so important to keep your blood sugar below four that you're you're pumping out more and more insulin and more and more insulin as you go and that's harmful in and of itself because insulin doesn't just affect energy they say like oh well your blood sugar goes up and your insulin goes up and then that puts energy into the cells so this is a normal process yeah it's normal down here at physiological levels but then when you start going into Super physiological levels that's abnormal and if it would be one thing if it would not be fine but it would be one thing if your insulin only affected blood sugar and so you have these spikes in blood sugar and then you bring those down with insulin you'd still have something under those spikes you still have the area under the curb that was causing damage to your body from the glucose but insulin doesn't only affect blood sugar insulin affects over 100 different mechanisms in your body and so when you raise your insulin to account for to try to detoxify the amount of GL glucose in your body you are now out of balance with everything else and now you're and now you're causing physiological stress and metabolic dysfunction in your body because of that then you get insulin resistance now you have chronically elevated so now it's not just when you have these spikes that you're causing problems now it's always causing problems always out of balance right your your insulin should be under 10 all the time and now you're fasting insulin not even with a spike is at 35 then it spikes up to 75 when you eat something that that's caused in huge disruption of your of your um biochemistry and your metabolism and your physiology it affects all your hormones it affects uh you know how your body processes hormones how your body processes energy obviously affects your blood pressure it affects your vascular system it affects so many different things in your body over 100 different things and so you know look it up yeah I mean even on um I mean even Wikipedia you know the article on on insulin you know it's not best source but it does have a list of all the different things that that insulin affects you you go down and you just look and you see all and you just look at all the different things that insulin affects you're like I had no idea and so when you spike your insulin up you're you're you're knocking all of those things out of balance so um then eventually that's not even enough you know you overwhelm your system remember you have four grams that you need and five grams is too much and people are dumping in 400 500 grams a day and your body's trying to keep that below four grams and it's just like what the hell's going on here uh so that's very difficult and eventually your body can't contend with that anymore and so even though your insulin is 75 fasting your blood sugar is high too and you're diabetic and they're oh now it's pre-diabetic and now you're diabetic oh there was a problem you know 10 15 years before that you know your body was starting to get insulin resistance and building up and building up it was just compensating for it but it did not come without cost that compensation and then eventually you couldn't compensate anymore now your blood sugar is getting high and that's when people start seeing the ramifications of of of diabetes the ravages of diabetes you know you get diabetic retinopathy that blood sugar damages the retina have all these AES that destroy the retina now you can't see it destroys your kidneys and microtubules and now you can't uh now you can't um you know filter urine properly uh it starts destroying the vasculature uh and the nervous system in your in your limbs and you start getting uh peripheral neuropathies and your hands go numb and your feet go numb and tingly and painful and then all of a sudden you're not getting you're not getting uh you know adequate blood supply to your toes you start getting infections and ulcers that don't heal and because you have so much blood sugar this like bacteria just teeming U you know and then when normally they wouldn't um be as successful because you're just giving them more glucose to as substrate now you have these infections that you can't fight off parts of your toes die off and get gangrenous you have to cut your toes off and they have to you have to sort of cut half the foot off then we have to cut above the ankle and oh my God we're gonna have to cut up to the knee now like Jesus now we're GNA have to cut above the knee and that's that's a much bigger disability when you don't have that hinge in the knee it's it's much more difficult to walk and even with a prosthetic and um and then and then that keeps going up and up and up and up and you start getting more and more damage damage and then your your cardiovascular system diabetes is one of the biggest risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease and and dementia you know Alzheimer's is now being called type three diabetes and when we do a pet scan so a PET CT when you're looking for cancer what do you do you give them an injection of radiol labeled glucose and you see where that glucose goes right so you see cancer cancer cancer right potentially but also the brain will take up a lot of that glucose but not Alzheimer's patients there's there's a marked decrease in glucose uptake in the brain on pet C right so we know that there's insulin resistance and and and an inability for sugar and energy to get in the brain uh in Alzheimer's patients right and then you switch them to a ketogenic diet and that's been shown and when your ketones go up those can cross the brain blood brain barrier freely get into the brain reconstitute into fatty acids which then get then regrow the brain and also provide energy for the brain uh without insulin you don't need insulin for that and so when you do that it's um uh these people's brains just sort of turn on and they start working a lot better right away and so high-fat meat-based ketogenic diet have been shown to be a better treatment for Alzheimer's than every medication ever trial so it's uh it's actually very important it's very important to keep your blood sugar at normal levels it's very important to keep all of your levels at physiological normal levels and allow your body to just get on with things and not screw it up in ways that you think are are good but uh you know you really have no idea you know it's it's like whenever you whenever you screw with a complicated system you will get unintended consequences that are generally uh very bad and that you don't want so a law of unintended consequences so you screw with a complex system you will get very very strange outcomes so you just leave it alone you let the system work the way it's designed to work we are we are meant to work a certain way you know how do people survive how do animals survive without micromanaging their biochemistry oh you need to do this and that no you don't you don't need to do any of that stuff you just need to eat what is biologically appropriate and and let your body get on with it so that's what you do and carbohydrates are not biologically appropriate for humans by any stretch of the imagination so I hope that was helpful Maybe we can clip that and put that in a as a as a little short video or clip or something like that because why not it's good to have that sort of stuff out there um yeah I don't know if Melissa heard me but yeah if we could clip that that would be great [Music] um maybe Katherine Kramer [Music] um thank you for the"

        "body": "um maybe Katherine Kramer [Music] um thank you for the um maybe Katherine Kramer [Music] um thank you for the Super Chat there's not anything attached but it looks like there's a question down below so question is my kidney function has worsened um my hp1 I'm think that's hba1c went up in two months from 5.1 to 5.4 My fasting insulin is still 9 after 11 months uh kery I'm assuming that's carnivore uh for a period egfr below 60 um and still terrible insomnia egfr is below 60 I'm assuming so it's um there are a few things with uh kidney function you have to look first of all Are You full on Carnivore are you only eating fatty meat are you only drinking water are you eating enough fat to the point that you know you're not having hard stools or anything like that without the help of coffee tea magnesium artificial sweeteners metformin things like that all of those things can cause lose stools and mask uh uh the fact that you may be undereating fat you want go to between one and two grams of fat per one gram of protein so that's what you want to aim for and then adjust to what your body needs um as far as kidney function is concerned if you're not drinking enough water your creatinine can go up it typically won't go up if you're drinking enough water however creatinine can go up if you're eating you know a lot of protein which you know you're got to be eating more protein now than you were before and if you're not eating enough fat that can also be an issue um and also again dehydration not drinking enough enough water uh the egfr so again more water more fat first of all uh second of all um the if you check your cystatin c um Cy St a t i n then the letter c that is a marker of kidney function that is not really affected by how much protein you're taking in because your creatinine can go up just because you're eating more more protein that's not actually a filtration issue so if you check your cystatin C that will give a a more accurate marker of your actual um uh filtration rate so the egfr is the estimated filtration rate so you check your catin C that's less of an estimate that's more like okay that's actually what it is right so it's um it's uh it's more accurate in this case but also more water more fat first and foremost check your cyat and see and see if there's a disparity if there is it's it's from the protein right and so it may be that you have perfectly normal kidney function um and and it's just being sort of masked by the the protein that you're eating but most people on a carnivore diet even when just checking their creatinine and uh their egfr that way uh will actually improve their kidney function as long as they're drinking enough water you have to drink enough water that's um it's not just from carnivore that's from everything you just have to drink enough water your Ura might go up again that's from protein typically if your Ura goes up independent of your creatinine is because you're eating um you know more protein than uh fat or maybe you're not eating enough fat and so you're having to convert protein into energy and so that's where Ura comes from because you're cleaving off a nitrogen molecule and you're turning that into Ura to clear it and so don't do that eat more fat eat more fat drink more water again um as far as your hba1c you know I I wouldn't worry too much about that again if you're eating way too much protein you're converting that into glucose you know then potentially that can go up but the thing is too is that when people switch to a cornivore diet they're they're doing a lot of things differently they cut out seed oils they cut out plant fats and plant oils and those all have plant steriles which mimic our cholesterol and um and don't really aren't really as useful as our cholesterol but they can be used in the cell membranes of of our cells which are cholesterol and red blood cells especially they have a lot of cholesterol and a big floppy foldy membranes and um and you put in plant sterols instead of actual you know endogenous cholesterol or animal cholesterol then it it's a bit more stiff it's bit more stiff and rigid and blood cells don't live as long and so you can have an artificially low hba1c if you're eating uh plant fats and plant stero and then all of a you get rid of those things and um and now your your red blits are not more floppy and foldy and they live longer right because when they get too stiff and rigid they can't go around these little tight corners and your Spen just takes them out kills them eats them and so they don't last as long so the hb1c is is really it's a blunt tool it's it's really I don't I don't think it's it's very useful in um when you're getting into the the finer points of things it's it's you know it's a good broad you know sort of measure but it's you know it's it it assumes that your red blood cells are living three months and that's the average and they say okay if you're red blood cells are living red blood cells typically live about three months and so this is what we typically see for a three month average okay but if you're eating a lot of plant stero and things like that it's going to be shorter than that right if you stop eating them is going to live longer than that right and so you know there are so many people reporting and I I know I know people that treat diabetes and they have their patients come in on a carnivore diet a kenic carnivore diet and they have a have a constant uh continuous glucose monitor and they check you know spot tests and the fingerprick tests daily and they're saying like yeah this is accurate and their average is 70 75 you know and but their hba1c is indicating that their average is like 110 120 and they're like well that doesn't match up what the hell's going on it's like well this is happening again and again and again and again and again and it's likely because you know the red blood cells are living longer and so now you're comparing a four-month average to a three-month average and obviously that's going to look artificially high so I wouldn't worry about that um but uh you know another thing you do eat more fat eat less you know eat more fat drink more water and uh stretch is a big thing and so is is sleep if you're not getting proper sleep if you're not getting 7 to eight hours of sleep at night you can actually give yourself pre-diabetes is something that Dr Tony Hampton talks about that if you average around four to five hours of sleep at night for just seven days in a row you'll give yourself pre-diabetes because of the cortisol Spike and so your cortisol goes up and your blood sugar goes up even on a ketogenic diet and so yeah your your hba1c can go up because of that if you're really stressed all the time and and you're having um you know isues in your life that are that are difficult to deal with and you're very and you're in a high stress state that will also raise your insulin or sorry will raise your cortisol and raise your blood sugar as a result of that as well so don't you know don't forget about that as well and the other side of things is that is that there are other things that can influence all of this stuff as well medications and and other sorts of influences you know if you're if you're drinking if you start drinking more water and eating more fat and you check your cyat and see and your kidneys are still on the decline it's not from carnivore it's not from what you're eating it's something else there's something else going on and you need to find out what the hell's going on and so you know you talk to your doctor about that you have autoimmune issue and then maybe you need to go lion die just pure red meat and water and then sort of Tamp that town it could be some sort of other inflammatory process or some sort of issue or something in your in your environment or life that's affecting you negatively but I would I would but that those sorts of things are very very rare and so the vast majority people when eating enough fat drinking enough water your kidney function will improve and so that's what I would recommend you do I won't worry too much about your hb1c it's still in a perfectly uh normal level anyway and it can it can change and Vary because of that stress sleep and also amount of protein that you're eating be way too much um but really what it can come down to is red blood cells are living longer so that that is something that um uh can happen as well so I wouldn't worry too much about that but uh more fat more protein and uh get rid of everything except fatty meat and water and see how you go check your cattin C and then check your other levels in a couple months see how you going and good luck I'm and then focus on how you feel are you healthy are you feeling well or do you have you know good energy like the sleep is a problem um you know hopefully that that resolves you know try eating something you know big meal before you want to go to bed often times if you eat until it stops tasting good you'll um you'll get uh pretty lethargic and naturally go to sleep as well so try that you can also try a bit of melatonin to help sort of Kickstart you turn off lights these lights are are poison you know for your brain and your your uh circadian rhythm and so you know get out in the morning light in the morning and uh you know get sunlight in your eyes and um and expose yourself to the sun it's really important we're we're designed to be in the sun we grew up in the sun we're terrestrial beings we're not trogloditas and so or deep sea dwelling you know amias right so you want to be out in the sun you want to get that sunlight light in your eyes in the morning and then uh you know you want to turn off the lights later in the day when the Sun goes down you don't want a whole bunch of light lights glaring in your eyes you even getting those blue blocking glasses and that can significantly help with sleep put on a sleep mask and um you know that just shuts off the lights you know and then you're in a deep dark cave and and you can actually sleep properly and you take some melatonin as well you know that can that can help sort of Kickstart these sorts of things so you know it um most people sleep better on a carnivore diet some people have these issues with insomnia but you know you there are absolutely things you can do to optimize your sleep routine that can that can help so giv e those a try as well uh knum Knight thank you for the"

        "body": "e those a try as well uh knum Knight thank you for the e those a try as well uh knum Knight thank you for the Super Chat chat hey Doc can you please explain uh how red meat is digested and nutrients absorbed in the body versus carbs vegetables and junk food thank you well it's it's just you know it it's um your your body is completely geared up to uh break down and absorb meat so you have the enzymes and and um and Machinery necessary to break down liquefy and absorb meat very easily and so you do you absorb that in you know a couple hours it just and it's all gets absorbed in the small intine you know so it doesn't even get down to the large intestine you can't really absorb anything in the large intestine anyway so that's good and so all those nutrients come in they're very bioavailable I mean that's what that word means that means that that we're able to break them down and absorb them very easily and they're very accessible to us plants are not and so they they have a much lower degree of bioavailability because we are not designed to eat them uh we can extract some things but a lot of them we don't have the enzymes to break them down this is why traditionally um when we grew crops we would do things to them you know slow cook them boil them heat them uh soak them in lie and other sorts of chemical processes mix them with different Clays and this is and that there's a process called nich talization is a seven I think seven-step process of chemical engineering that you can break down these different chemical bonds and reduce the toxic load and increase the bioavailability and um you we don't have the the enzymes to to break these bonds uh normally and so you can ferment things and all these sorts of things all these all these techniques were use in order to digest things before we ate them because we couldn't digest them and so you know that's just another way that plants defend themselves is by is by making their nutrients unavailable for other people to eat or for for other people to access or other animals to access right so it's um it's just just one of those um one of the defense mechanisms that they have and you know we don't have the enzymes requisite to to break down and um and absorb these things very easily also there's there's Digestive disruptors and anti-nutrients things that stop your body from breaking things down even bioavailable things so you you eat something with different plants like wheat and soy and other sorts of things that have these proteas Inhibitors that blocks protas or enzyme that breaks down different proteins and so even if you're eating that with meat you eat a sandwich that has you know bread with uh meat in it you're not going to um absorb as much of the meat protein even and certainly not the the plant proteins uh plant proteins are typically not bioavailable anyway like gluten is not is a protein it's not bioavailable you we don't we don't break that down and absorb that as protein or use that as Protein that's the the majority of protein in wheat is glut is gluten and it's just not available say oh look at all this protein and wheat it's no good to you you know so um it's uh you know it's about that bioavailability and and then they make meat even less bioavailable when you eat that together so it blocks proteases from breaking down your proteins and um and absorbing amino acids Etc and and then there's you know fiic acid and oxalates and tannins and all these other sorts of things that that stop you from you know bind onto different nutrients and and uh and stop you from being able to absorb them or break them down and I I heard one guy try to say like oh well you have this bacteria and your G we may have bacteria in your gut in your lower intestine that breaks down these bonds so oh what are you talking about you know you don't have the enzymes but these bacteria do right but you don't absorb things in your large intestine you absorb things in your small intestine before it gets to the bacteria and so unless you want to eat your feces to get that now bioavailable uh you know nutrient that was blocked up by fiic acid previously you're not getting it you know it's going out in your waste and so no that doesn't work so uh junk food you know um depends on what you consider junk food you know make processed Meats actually uh can actually be more bioavailable that increase the bioavailability of the nutrients like in you know you know ham and baloney and these sorts of things oh it's horrible depends on what's what's added to it obviously say there sugar and spices and Seasonings and and artificial ingredients like yeah that's not good but the meat itself becomes actually more bioavailable it's amazing and so you know that's actually that's actually pretty good um you know junk food in general is is is largely plant-based right so the meat's fine but it's coming with a whole bunch of garbage plants that have a whole bunch of you know garbage anti-nutrients is going to stop you from absorbing things you know one of one of the the actually redeem factors about junk Foods they typically don't have fiber oh you need fiber do you because fiber is actually an anti-nutrient as well and blocks it can block up to 30% absorption of different nutrients now you're eating it with junk food and and a whole bunch of carbs and other garbage and plant toxins sure yeah you know um blocking the absorption of 30% probably a net benefit right but when you're just eating good healthy nutritious food you don't actually want to block out what you're absorbing you want to absorb all of that right so in that negative in that in that regard so um yeah it's uh yeah just basically comes down to what are you designed to eat you know we're designed to eat meat that's why it's more bioavailable end of story and so that's what you should eat and that's where all the nutrients are you don't you don't lack anything you could eat you know riye steak every single day for the rest of your life and be healthier than everybody else on Earth pretty much except for the other people doing it as well so um yeah and obviously organs have even more nutrient density as well and too much of of a nutrient can be harmful as well so you want to keep this in Balance you know so uh just just a bit of organs compared to the amount of muscle meat and fat but you know still good anyway it's very nutrient dense and when you're starting out on a carnivore diet coming from a you know a trash diet or even a healthy omnivorous diet that's you know it's very clean Whole Food you're going to be low on nutrients and so adding in some organs is actually you know probably pretty helpful early on as well and Dr No thank you very much for the"

        "body": "initely uh no exception Cosmo Kramer thank you for the initely uh no exception Cosmo Kramer thank you for the Super Chat uh Doc and aites question aites is fluid builtup in the abdomen are you aware of any cases uh where switch to carnivore improved portal hypertension caused by uh serotic scar or is this um or is that what you sometimes refer to as Damage Done uh I have actually seen people reverse uh uh portal Venus hypertension which is you know it's it's isolated cases you know it's not all that common but it's uh it does happen and I yeah I have actually seen people reverse that but you know it's in the anecdotal phase I've seen just individuals that have improved that and certainly um the the part of your liver that's not serotic Can it can seriously improve its function and hopefully there's enough non-erotic tissue you know serotic tissue is just scarred up tissue that um that that can be enough to just you know carry out all your you know all your your needs from your liver and um and often it is now I have I have heard of one case I was talking to Dr Shan Baker uh just last month and he was saying that he had a patient that that came to him and on a carnivore diet after however long I don't know exactly how long he was on it um he actually reversed his curosis which I I did think was you know damage done that I I didn't think that was going to come back I didn't I've never heard of scarring really coming back but you know the liver you know it's I mean he's going back to you know um Prometheus and the know Eagle coming down there punishment from Zeus for giving humans fire was was used chained to a rock in Hades and um and an eagle came down every single day and and ripped out his liver in hads liver and his liver would grow back and the liver Eagle would come down and eat it again it's quite interesting how that that um story came about but you know it it it it um is interesting and is likely discussing that regenerative capacity of the liver I don't know how they figured that out or if they was just guessing or if that was just a story that happens to be coincidentally uh you know linked to to a an actual function of the liver but for whatever reason they U you know that's the story uh the liver can actually regenerate uh to such a significant degree that it's um that it's shocking and so uh at least one person has um done that and that was on uh on Imaging I think MRI c i don't or ultrasound or whatever you got they basically they could find no sign of curosis anymore and he had normal liver function test and so he's actually going for a liver biopsy because they're like that that that can't happen there has to be something wrong here and so we'll see we'll see if this liver biopsy you know shows anything or if it's you know still serotic it was just the the Imaging was wrong but um it probably wasn't you know I mean those images it's pretty it's pretty clear when you see sorosis on a scan it's um you know it's pretty it's uh pretty evident and when you have that that therosis on a scan and then you don't have it on the scan like well you saw it before why are you not seeing it now you know so it's it's likely that he actually did did improve it so does that mean that everyone can do it no not necessarily but uh maybe you know we'll see we're still we're still learning all the different things that that people can reverse uh by eating a proper diet because just not enough people have been doing it for so long and and switching we have you know the Inuit doing it for a long time they just don't get get these problems in the first place but then when you do get these problems what can you reverse that's the question that we need to answer and uh and we're just seeing more and more of these things it's absolutely amazing it's just so I I keep a very open mind on what this can do um but there are there are people that I've spoken to that that are reversing portal hypertension portal Venus hypertension and um and at least one one person that seems to have reversed their curosis something that I wouldn't have thought possible but the liver is a pretty magic organ and it can do quite a lot and maybe even more than we thought previously so you know give it a shot you know red meat and water that's your fatty red meat and water that's the main one and uh see how you go and please do let us know um hopefully it's h at least heals your liver enough to uh fix the the hyper the portal hypertension and and let your liver work well enough that if there are parts that are not going to come back that that at least there's enough there that that does the job and uh good luck with that you have to cut out everything everything besides red meat and water and clearly alcohol sugar and carbs just they're they're never in your life again after this so um you know get on that and uh do the best you can and good luck with that and let us know let us know how you go I'm very interested to see how you do I'm sure you'll do very well and uh good luck with that koret uh thank you for the"

        "body": "and uh good luck with that koret uh thank you for the and uh good luck with that koret uh thank you for the Super Chat why is a 52-year-old non-c carnivore hubby lean at 6'2 175 pound 170ish pounds um fasting insulin 3.6 blood sugar 80s as alt under 25 most days under 200 grams of carbs per day drinks beer active job you you know you have you know people um have a different ability to you know metabolize these things and um you know if he's otherwise eating fairly clean if he's if he's destroying himself with beer eventually that's going to catch up to him um but uh you know a lot of people a lot of people are in that that category and um and they don't you know they don't uh you know see these these signs until later you know not everybody develops diabetes it is becoming more and more common uh right now you know N9 10% of Americans are diabetic but 40% are pre-diabetic right well that also means that 50% aren't pre-diabetic or diabetic right so it it affects people uh more or less quickly right and so um you know if he if he keeps doing that it it may be that he you know is just fine and and and doesn't overwhelm his system to the degree that he'll develop diabetes or or fulminant liver failure or anything like that um you know if he if he depends on how much alcohol he drinks you know and drinking of alcohol you will get diabetes you will get liver damage that's a that's a uh that's not optional you know to to to uh drink massive amounts of alcohol and and not have ramifications from that but if he's keeping it fairly low you know he's active he's exercising and he's and he's not doing all that much then you know it's pretty normal you know there are people that that meet those those criteria and um and uh you know and feel well hey look I feel fine I'm doing all right and you know they fairly Clean Diet they're not eating a whole bunch of junk food under 200 grams of carb that's better than most people I mean there's studies that say yeah we studied low carb diets versus whatever and there's this like and and a lot of the guys were having you know uh around 200 grams of carbs and you're like that's not a low carb diet but you know they um you know different definitions of these things like to them that was low carb because these other groups were like 400 500 grams of carbs a day it's like okay that's that's way more and so you know it just it just depends on the other factors as well but you know it's um uh a lot of people can handle this stuff you know I mean you look at before the 1980s when we really started doing the whole processed garbage food um you people ate carbs you know and um and people about diseases but they were way less prevalent than they are now you know so the sugar the seed oils those sorts of things I think play a big role in this and so you know when you in the 1800s I mean you still got some of these diseases they were just massively lower rates at this people ate carbs they ate grains and especially the poorer people they ate more grains because that was what they could afford and uh they were the ones getting more of the diseases and more of the problems and you know even Dr J Salsbury real recognized that you know the people that were eating more plants and more you know grains and vegetables and things like that they were getting the diseases other people you know simply weren't and if you just gave them red meat and water they would all go away but a large portion of people you know weren't getting to that point of of getting serious diseases so you know there's more than one way to skin a cat you can be very healthy off a carnivore diet but you're not going to be as healthy as you would be and um and if you're more sensitive to these sorts of things then then it's something that you need to be on top of you know and so you know it's it's good that he's looks like he's you know metabolically healthy that's that's great um it may not last you know it it depends you know and I I know very skinny people that had high metabolic rate and they're bouncing around all these sorts of things and they get into their 60s uh and they're but there're you know there's carb addict sort of things to the point that he's just um a patient of mine that he was saying that he had to you know he'd be in bed and he just be like I have to eat I have to eat I have to eat and You' go out and he' get some toast and you just cover it in honey and just eat a couple pieces of of toast with honey and that's when you could go to bed very skinny he not an ounce of fat on the guy and yet he had you know uh pronounced diabetes right and so you know it just it just catches up with you even if if you look healthy and fit he wasn't your husband obvious viously is uh you know still metabolically healthy but you know he may not he's not eating all that many carbs um more GS than I eat more carbs than I think are useful and helpful and and warranted but you know if he's you know he he's still eating a lot less than other people and if he's not eating a whole bunch of junk food and all that sort of stuff you know drinks beer how much though you know and eventually that that will catch up you know so you know if you're if doing this at a at a low degree you know maybe this is something your body can compensate for for a long time and maybe you know he never gets diabetes and that that's that would be great um if he drinks enough and eats enough carbs and he eats junk food then it's going to happen but you know you can you can still be okay eating an omnivorous diet even having alcohol every now and then um and still not get you know fulminant diseases uh if you're lucky not everybody can um but if you continue doing that and you do that more and more it will build up over time and he'll have problems and so hopefully he never does but um he's still not going to do as well blood numbers aside he's just not going to be as healthy physically and feel as good as he can be if he eats that way and if he tries a carnivore diet he'll he will almost certainly feel a lot better and and be a lot healthier long term but uh yeah you know you can you know you there there's still healthy people out there that eat an omnivorous diet or even eat some junk food every now and then you know it depend know it's dose dependent sort of EXP exposure relationship and it also depends on the individual and and how much defenses they have you we have like native populations native inue populations they really can't handle this stuff much at all they they'll get these diseases and issues and autoimmune is issues and diabetes much faster than uh Caucasian uh races so um it's uh you know diabetes rates in Native Americans and Native Canadians way higher way higher than the rest of the population same with uh uh the you know Aboriginal Australians way higher way higher rates because they they've only been exposed to this sort of stuff in the last 100 200 years to any significant degree anyway and so you know it's uh depends on the individual depends on how much they're doing but you know eventually it it can it can overwhelm your system so hopefully he doesn't get to that point hopefully what he's doing now is is enough that his body can can maintain but you know it's it's not going to come without a cost I I think it will shorten his life and and affect his health and um you know maybe not massively but you know couple decades yeah you know instead of living to 120 130 you might only make it to 90 100 which would be great compared to now but right now we're all sick and fat and un well so it's not really good to compare yourself it's pretty low bar you know to set for yourself so just being better than a massively sick population not not really a great great uh standard to set for yourself so you know just do you know do what's right you know do the best that he can do for himself would be you know eating optimally but you know either way you know you can you can still be uh healthy in a respect eating other ways it's just how are you the healthiest you can possibly be that's the question and that's what you know that's why I didn't have diseases I had I would have had probably very similar numbers to that um and uh and yet you know that's not what I'm about I'm I'm I'm about optimal I'm about what is the best thing for me how can I be the healthiest I can ever be and so that's what I I worry about uh and if other people aren't worried about that they don't have to be worried about that that's just something that I'm worried about and something that I worry about for my patients as well so that's that's just me all righty I seem to have gone crazy on time and we have a lot of um questions built up so um maybe we'll yeah maybe we'll cap the the the super chats for now um and just try to get through these and and see where we're at um okay so from Lord uh 1775 uh Dr C my sister is going through Ms Flair does carnivore help thank you for all you do yeah it can you know there are a lot of people that have improved their multiple sclerosis with carnivore diet again red meat water that's it you know so you have to be very very strict line diet for any autoimmune issue especially something as devastating as as Ms and so just beef lamb water that's it you know salt whatever U but don't have any electrolytes with artificial sweetening or flavors or anything like that you know just just red meat water salt if you need it and that is it and yeah can help um I have um uh videos i' I've I've interviewed um a few people that have reversed their Ms uh without medication by by doing a lion diet U one was the Dr Sarah and she has an amazing story where she was in a wheelchair and and in her early 30s and you know basically dying and you you know Ms can kill you and it um and she uh took high dose vitamin D and then went on a strict line diet and within 6 months she was not only out of her wheelchair but she was back doing ballet which is which is amazing and on MRI her her lesions were shrinking and and were just actually actually healing So Not only was she subjectively feeling better symptomatically she was objectively improving as well and so massive Improvement and um and I I've I've interviewed other people like that as well and I've had patients that have done that and you know one patient uh actually fired her neurologist because she said that um they were so unsupportive and so aggressive with her that um she needed to take these medications that made her feel awful and didn't didn't seem to help and um Wanted her off you know a carnivore diet and was saying she was being Reckless and she was going to kill herself and all these sorts of things and she was very upset by this a very very poor bedside manner that's not how you treat patients and and so she didn't listen to him and she decided to continue on with the carnivore diet she improved dramatically and then on MRI her lesions improved and actually were reduced by 50% and and her neurologist I I I don't I can't explain this I I don't know why this is happening this shouldn't have happened this should be getting worse and she said um well do you think it could be the diet absolutely not not possible like okay and so she she just she sto stop going to him um because it's very close-minded and very you know aggressive and and now she's completely symptom free and her lesions are resolving amazing so yes that can absolutely help and I hope it does uh have to be very strict very strict uh red meat and water uh beef and lamb and water fatty lots of fat um check the B12 make sure B12 is on the higher end of the scale if not over the reference range because the reference ranges are just far too low because averages for the community as opposed to um as opposed to being optimal and doctors treat them as optimal but every single reference range at every single uh uh testing facility will have a different reference range obviously that's not optimal it's an average and it's an average of their population not even the average of the whole community so um in Australia UK uh Europe you want to be between for B12 uh ranges that I found to be uh optimal from various studies would be 800 to 1200 and then in America it's 1100 to 1600 and so depending on your units and where you are that's where you want to aim for but it's typically on the upper end of the scale like in the UK like the scale goes up to 540 right but under 500 you can actually get nerve damage and demolation of your axon so especially for something like Ms where you uh it's a demolina disease this autoimmunity Auto antibodies attack the the m and sheath around the the nerves and actually you know that's uh that's exactly what you need to heal and repair and you need be2 for that and so if you have less than than 400 you're not going to do that you're not going to be able to repair your axons properly so you know it's it's a two-part uh disease uh process you know you have damage to your axons so you need to get those antibodies down and then you need to heal the damage that have been caused okay so carnivore die is going to reduce the the antibodies okay so that's going to get that away because your body's not reacting to these different plant toxins and other sorts of things that get into your body so your antibodies are going to come down but then your body needs to heal from that damage and you need things like cholesterol Omega um DHA and EPA which are animal-based um Omega-3s the plant-based omega-3 ala it's no good it's useless so you need the animal Omega-3s DHA and EPA uh so your cholesterol um those Omega-3s you need B12 folate those sorts of things and you get that from meat yes but you you might be low and so you want to add in some liver things like that if you're really low under 400 you get it you get like a shot an injection or some sublingual some people have autoimmune issues that uh don't allow them to absorb B12 anymore so you got to check that and you got to make sure that you're able to maintain blood sugar or sorry um B12 levels at optimal levels and and if vitamin D is low as well you know that's that's important you know for the nervous system as well so um you know you can watch that interview with Dr Sarah and see the protocol she went on but she went on you know a you know high level vitamin D U supplementation I don't recall exactly at the moment but she had like how much she was taking a day but um but she did that in the carnivore and just make sure your b12's up as well and have some liver for the B12 and folate and that that helps as well so good luck to your sister I hope she does d oes really well um carnivore clarity thank you for the"

        "body": "thank you for that Ryan Marco aosta thank you for the thank you for that Ryan Marco aosta thank you for the Super Chat how do athletes do explosive movements using uh carnivore and ketos such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu wrestling in MMA um same way as everybody else your body your muscles actually preferentially burn fat and so you have um um fat oxidation and and U and burning and you actually see um studies from you know Inhumans crossover randomized control crossover trials and athletes and you know moderate athletes and Elite athletes with uh Professor um Tim noes in South Africa um Dr vck as well uh they've actually shown that you get far more um U uh usage of ketones and fat and energy at higher levels of V2 Max than ever ever thought before and so they they used to say that you know after above 85% V2 Max you could only run on carb total nonsense um you actually you're an ketogenic athletes you're you're you're just running on fat after that and it's actually you're trying to burn through the glycogen so you can get to the fat that's what profess or noes things and um and then you're just running on fat and so if you're if you're in a ketogenic diet you're only you're only running on your fat and your carbs your blood sugar is always going to be maintained and your ketones are going to be maintained your muscles actually run on ketones as well and um and so you oh it has to have glycogen no it doesn't uh you you actually you just fine actually probably better on ketones and your glycogen gets replenished faster on a ketogenic diet than on a carb diet even sucking down uh Sugar Sugar drinks and things like that so you'll have and and they've shown this in high performance you know like doing um a series of 800 meter you know Sprints just a hard run people running hard with keto and uh and carbs okay we're just going to run out of all the gagen just get all out and so they just kept they just kept going and uh and the keto adapted athletes they did they did much better and they can tap into again 150,000 200,000 calories in their body even at low body fat percentage right 6% body fat percentage for a 65 kilo person is 150,000 kilo calories right it's a massive amount like you just you're not going to run out of that in any training session or any match or anything like that in five days of matches of you know three weeks of matches no it's not going to it's not going to you can fast the whole time and you eventually you run out but you know if you're going 2,000 five if you're if you're working on 5,000 calories a day because you're working out a lot right and you've got 150,000 uh calories in kilo calories in your fat stores you got 30 days 30 days with no food done 6% body fat before you even start breaking down your muscle to to burn for energy so you have a a ton of Expos and that has been tested and studied in human athletes um by by um volck and uh Tim NOS I just I just posted interview with Tim noes and we talk about that as well so it uh you absolutely have no drop off in athletic performance explosive or long-term endurance uh VC did did studies with uh you know high performance you fast breakthrough Peak Performance sort of uh uh levels and also in ultramarathoners they're doing like 100 miles and things like that and they they're finding that you don't have any any uh loss in fact you found improvements on uh the zero carb group or the ketogenic group and you have this access to energy all the time you never run out right um so those Studies have been done and so you know you make all the carbs you need you make all the glycogen you need and now you have ketones as well which what your is what your body actually wants to run on and so yeah you do great there actually are a number of MMA people that do this now you know there's the you know the Gracie family Holland Gracie who I've add on my podcast he he's been doing this and he's um you know he's the the head trainer at Gracie Jiu-Jitsu in San Francisco and he said this just an absolute Game Changer is just has unlimited energy feels great you know instant recovery that just feels fantastic um one of the top wrestlers in the world um was on my podcast as well and you know he was um you know he he wrestled for Cornell he's an All-American he represented America in the world and um and um you know and he switched to carnivore he say he's never felt better in his life you know and um and so you know you can check those things out as well and um and um trying to um think of what else yeah well then there's and there's a couple other uh MMA fighters that are doing that I've actually spoken to a few other MMA fighters that are considering uh doing or actually starting it now and um you know and I can't really say who they are but there there are other ones that are open about it about what um they're doing one's actually sponsored by the carnivore bar and so obviously he's he's talking about it as well um if I can think of his name let me just look it up real quick actually um I think I have it here where is it [Music] um where is it where is it where is it oh there it is um Wilton Ziggler so he's a he's a MMA fighter and uh and he does carnivore right and so uh you know this is something that uh you know is very common and you know back in the ancient Greek Olympics you know they uh they commonly um they commonly would just eat a lot more meat a lot more meat uh when they um when they were getting ready for the Olympic Games and things like that that was just it was just well known this is what you this is what you do you eat a hell of a lot of meat um and uh so it's um it's uh now this is annoying I'm trying to I'm trying to find the name of um I have a I have a um and uh I have a an interview with again that the the you know the the All-American wrestler uh John Chavez as as well and um know he tells his story and um I'm trying to see the name of it it's just um yeah it's just Team USA wrestler John Chavez dramatically improves his health and performance by going cornivore terrible name I'll have to probably fix that so it actually works better in the algorithm uh but it's a great interview and he's he's he's a great young man and and a fantastic athlete you know but he's you know he's the Olympic caliber sort of athlete and so he's um you know he's representing the US and the worlds and it's all American all that sort of stuff and so um that's hard to do that is hard to do when you're you're at that level you are you are one of the best in the world and and he says never felt better on Carnivore so yeah I would I would more and more professional athletes are doing this I did a whole presentation on this at U at a conference in in Switzerland actually and there's tons tons of ketogenic but also carnivore athletes and more and more you know I'm I'm having more and more discussions with professional athletes that are that are doing this and giving a try and having amazing results and so you know it's uh it's absolutely great to see and see more and more people um catching on to this as well I mean even even say like oh well you never see anyone in the Tour of France doing this [\u00a0__\u00a0] that's uh that's actually not true one of the best um uh cyclists in the world um is you know won several tour to France titles um let me look him up here um Chris FR he's a four-time tour to France winner he's keto right you know some of the some of the top Iron Man athletes ever um like absolute Legends like you know Dave Scott um he's an actual Legend in Iron Man he's he was like plant-based for a long time and now he's keto and he's just said he's like I would never recommend and you he was able to compete at 40 in an Iron Man after you know coming out of retirement and U by going keto and he said all his inflammation was gone he just felt so much better had so much more energy and and he came in second you know not not in an age grade sort of thing but overall he came in second and and he said I would never uh recommend anybody do an Iron Man on carbs it's just it's just so much harder so much worse and uh and uh Pete Jacobs is a world champion Iron Man and he's carnivore right so you know uh you you'll get plenty of energy and explosive energy um and sustained explosive energy which is what I experienced on uh as a rugby player and what a lot of other rugby players are experiencing now you're sort of an endurance Sprinter you have to just Sprint sprints Sprint it's it's all high intensity and you don't stop for an hour and a half and so you have to just be as hard as you can and smash somebody get up hard as you can smash somebody and you just have to keep doing that it's just you just this is what you do and you just keep doing that for just you know an hour and a half and um and and I could I've never I've never been better um at that than when I was on ketogenic carnivore diet never so yeah check it out you'll see the same thing it can take a few months to get fully keto adapted as an athlete so keep that in mind um but as you go as the weeks go by you'll just feel better and better and better A lot of people feel much better and have much better energy after a couple weeks um but you you're not going to get the full keto adaption for for a few months actually so just keep that in mind uh and don't get discouraged if if you don't see the big improvements right away like other people do I I felt two weeks I was I felt I was flying um but I kept getting better after that but I was already performing a lot better than I was uh after about two three weeks so yeah give it a shot so here you go uh sgan 90 thank you for the"

        "body": "it a shot so here you go uh sgan 90 thank you for the it a shot so here you go uh sgan 90 thank you for the Super Chat what are your thoughts on Paul saladino saying his heart palpitations went away after adding back in carbs um I don't doubt it I don't have any reason to doubt it um I don't think it was because of lack of carbohydrates though because I I guarantee you if he checked his blood sugar it would have been perfect um he thinks it's because you want your insulin up a bit that will draw in more electrolytes and keep your electrolytes in okay so one thing that that Dr Eric Westman pointed out is that add more electrolytes you don't need the carbohydrates to do that you just need the electrolytes and so uh Professor Steve finny uh who's been studying ketogenic diets and Metabolism for 30 plus years or so you know he's shown that it's like hey you know especially for people their athletes and working out a lot you need like five to seven grams of salt a day and need some you know potassium and magnesium on top of that so um if you're not getting that from the meat that you're eating you know we're not eating Wild game and drinking brackish water that has these minerals in it and all that sort of stuff then then you you might have to add this stuff in and so uh I don't think everyone will and I think there's a difference between keto and carnivore but as far as as far as electrolytes are concerned and like I don't use any salt anymore and I haven't for well over a year still feel great still have tons of energy uh don't have any cramps don't have any heart palpitations anything like that so my body is able to regulate my my um electrolytes but you know that that's what he attributed to he didn't have enough uh insulin and so he he was losing electrolytes okay fair enough you can just take electrolytes you you don't have to do the carbs in order to do that it means you get problems with the carbs so if you're going to add something back in why not add the electrolytes as opposed to adding in the carb that are going to come with another other host of issues um we start off with low insulin right so we're born with low insulin levels we we're born in a state of ketosis when we're breastfeeding kids are in a state of ketosis it's much easier for them to be in ketosis because they have to be in ketosis because that's how your brain grows and develops and we need that so when when you're um when you're young you have very low insulin and you don't get these big insulin spikes and you start giving people car then you start getting insulin spikes and when insulin goes up yes insulin affects how much your body uh stores or releases electrolytes that's true and so if you're having all these electrolytes then your body's going to have to like compensate for higher and higher insulin because your insulin levels are going up and so people's insulin they get insulin resistance and you're Higher and Higher and Higher and Higher and Higher you know instead of like a like an insulin like we saw here like 3.8 or 3.6 you know I have patients that have a fasting insulin of 72 okay so why aren't they turning into a block of salt right by just not expressing any of their salt in their kidneys right because the insulin will affect that right obviously their body is compensated and is and is releasing more you know is working harder against that insulin gradient to release the correct amount of salt right and and have a balance in uh their their blood electrolytes right or else you die right so if your body can rebalance in One Direction it can rebalance in the other direction and so if your insulin's coming down yeah first you know maybe you need more salt maybe for a while you need more salt and maybe You' just broken the broken the toy and just you're just going to need more salt Al together and there may be people like that there are people like that you know uh Dave Felman you know I've become friendly with at these different conferences um he has to take a lot of salt I mean he has to be religious about it you know he takes you salt tablets and you know salts his food and things like that because he has to because he he doesn't feel very well without without all the salt and that that plays right into the research done by uh Professor finny so some people are going to need to do that and and I think that that Paul was in that category um but you know he could have he could have gotten the same result by just adding in salt I think you know and um you know know and you know one thing that that um that uh you know I pointed out before is that you know he eats a lot of organs which is great but if you eat too much you can get too much of a good thing especially things like vitamin A and vitamin A is no when it's when it's a little bit too high not so high that you die but just a little bit too high hypervitaminosis a is known to suppress thyroid stimulating hormone TSH and he was saying that he was having problems with his thyroid okay well you know that might be an explanation for it he he mentioned in a in a video that it's like well some people say that I maybe was eating too many organs but I'm eating the same amount of organs now as I was before I added carbs right but the whole point is is that when you eat carbohydrates your your um demand for nutrients and vitamins actually increases that's not something that everybody knows but that's some that is that is true and so you look at you know Ben bman you Professor Ben bman he's biochemistry professor at BYU you know I mean this is what he studies studies you know metabolism and insulin for 15 20 years now and you know that's something that that is the case and you you you'll see this elsewhere that that if you if you have are eating carbohydrates it actually increases your demand for different vitamins you know like vitamin C for instance you don't absorb as much vitamin C so you're not getting that in and just your body's requisite when you have higher blood sugar and higher insulin that actually increases your body's demand for different vitamins so it could very well be that yes he was eating uh the same amount or is eating the same amount of of organs uh that he was before but because he's added in carbohydrates it made it so he offset that so he had a relative normal normalization of the amount of nutrients that he's getting in as opposed to being a little bit too much you I don't think he was floridly uh hurting himself or anything like that but if it was even a little bit too much you would have start seeing these things go a little bit off and we have studies in ketogenic for ketogenic people going up to you know 24 months which is longer than than um than uh you know Dr saladino was was doing a ketogenic diet he was like a year and a half I think 24 months or two years they didn't find any problem with their uh thyroid or their cortisol or anything else they didn't have any problems you know in fact things improved and they got better and so you know I have been doing ketogenic diets for seven years now you know ketogenic carnivore diet nothing else you know know milk once every year or two you know that's it and um you know don't have any of these problems you know so I think there's something else going on there right so maybe he's just one of these people that that needed more electrolytes sounds like he was you know maybe the the amount of organs he was uh consuming was just maybe a bit too much and then carbohydrate sort of brought down um you know raised the threshold for how much you know vitamins minerals he needed but those are sort of my thoughts but either way I think I think there's was there was something that he could have done um to to you know alleviate those issues without uh without going to carbs but you know whatever works for him you know it's um you got to remember too that you know he still Advocates strongly for high fat meat-based diet and to avoid plants because plants are toxic and they have these plant defenses and you know those are all those are all good things to talk about and so you know he wants to have a bit of fruit and he says specifically in those videos hey if you're doing well on a carnivore diet and a ketogenic diet this is this is not for you just keep doing what you're doing and and I I agree with that and you know if you're having problems okay look for you know something that can help you know but maybe try these other things uh first because I I think that there's um I don't think for a second you need carbohydrates because you don't you know and so um you know I think there's I think there's other other things that you can address that uh will will fix the issue so yeah those a re my thoughts uh tamson K thank you very much for the"

        "body": "Derek Johnson thank you so much for the very generous Derek Johnson thank you so much for the very generous Super Chat it's very kind of you uh hi Anthony last week a CT scan revealed a tumor on my thyroid in liph no I'm very sorry to hear that thyroid one is highly likely to be cancerous biopsy is scheduled aside from 100% and water any words of wisdom thanks and go KS oh well from uh Lake Washington there you go uh almost no one is is a kangaroo and like like Lake Washington uh High School is is kangaroos that's up in Kirkland where I grew up and uh cool I wonder like maybe put in the chat like when when uhh when were you when were you there um and uh yeah that's uh that's pretty badass so um as far as meat and water yeah I mean that I mean that's the main thing right you is you want to be ketogenic and you want to and you want to track your gki so it's glucose Ketone index so you watch my interview with Professor Thomas seed SEF r i d um go into details on why this matters I have a another lecture that I gave at a medical conference in San Diego last year um on cancer on on ketogenic metabolic therapy as a as an adjunct to as a novel adjunct to standard of care in cancer a bit of a mouthful but that's the that was the name of it and that's on available on YouTube as well and basically if you keep your gki in a therapeutic level which is considered under two and there's formulas for that if you look up C freed and gki there's there's formulas on how to figure that out depending on you know the units that you're using for glucose or ketones and things like that uh basically lower glucose higher ketones is better that'll keep your gki down and so if you keep that below two then you're going to uh that's sort of considered as therapeutic level and that that will starve out the cancer cells that require much more glucose than your other cells um and uh and so it's just not quite enough it's not quite enough uh uh glucose to get uh get the job done for their metabolic rate and uh you'll starve these things out out and they'll just sort of start slowing down they won't be able to build and replicate and reproduce and and they'll just sort of start dying off and and your body will be able to to fight them off more easily as well so that's the main thing so you want to keep your gki under two under one if possible and you do that through a combination of a key to genic carnivore diet just meat and water high fat so two to one grams of fat to protein um you may even need to limit the amount you eat don't eat until fatty meat stops tasting good eat slightly less and add in some organs because if you're not eating it much you need more nutrient density so you're going to need to include organs on a daily basis maybe eating slightly less than you want or maybe significantly less than you want for periods of time if that is what you need to do to keep your gki under too um if you need to go through periods of fasting if just you know just eating that way and restricting how much you're eating isn't enough to to get your gki down then you may need to fast then you may need to have periods of days you don't eat at all that would your glucose even lower and your Ketone even higher and you will get your gki lower and if you're doing that or you're having you know lower amounts of food that you're taking in just remember that you need to have refeeding days you don't want to lose too much um you can't start losing too much weight you know because that obviously that's not safe either and so you have most of the time you're keeping your GK under two and then every now and then you say okay I'm just for the next couple days I'm just going to I'm going to eat to my my fill and that my body sort of rebuild um a bit and um and yeah and so that that's what you do so watch watch those videos I have a whole um uh YouTube playist on cancer you know so just check that out as well and um and there's a lot of you know testimonies and people that are that are that are doing this and and and having uh you know a lot of success and doing a lot better than they than they were before I mean there's a guy Jeff prosperous really nice guy stage four uh metastic colon cancer you know was just throughout his body and I mean they gave they said this is terminal we this will not be cured you're going to die you have a couple months basically and you just said I can't accept that I've got kids I've got a family I'm going to sort this out he started doing this and uh and he's um you know been it's like I think nearly two years now a year and a half two years and he's not cancer free but he is he is doing significantly better and he obviously significantly better than the than his prognosis and um he said that he's like the healthiest he's ever been the fittest he's ever been he just feels great and and he's got stage four cancer and he's healthier than he's ever been which is is pretty remarkable statement and um on top of that it's uh he's doing so well that now he's getting like people his work that are saying does he really have cancer is he just saying that to try to get sympathy or something he pretty pretty wild um but I think that that's a probably a good sign you know that he's doing so well that people are like do you really have cancer um so it's uh you know it's it's very reassuring anyway cancer is a really nasty disease and so it uh sometimes again this can be a bit of damage done and and it may not be something you can ever cure and get rid of completely but it is something that can be significantly helped according to the data by uh keeping your gki under two and doing ketogenic cornivore diets um can be significantly benefited by this and so why the hell not you know this is something you just you throw the kitchen sink at it's not going to hurt you it's not going to cause any untour damage to your body certainly not going to make it worse and um because of all the reasons that that Dr um CPR goes through you know it can it could very well potentially help and in fact there are studies showing that um being in a state of ketosis or a ketogenic diet or fasting for a number of days prior to Chone radiation actually improve Chone radiation outcomes it sensitizes the cancer cells makes it more uh able to be killed by the Chone radiation and it also and it also [Music] um uh um protects your native cells your healthy cells from the radiation as well so that's actually you really helpful and so you know uh good luck with that I hope that it comes back negative negative biopsy but you know they have to pluck that sucker out and um you know get rid of it sometimes that's a complete cure and and hopefully you don't have to go through chemo and radiation but if you're just doing the meat and water you know any little cells have sort of you know uh moved elsewhere they can very uh they can hopefully be suppressed and and and hopefully killed uh by doing this and by the the treatments that you go with your doctor I do think that you still go through all your your regular treatments and things like that but this is something that can just help as an adjunct so uh good l uck with that King in hiding thank you so much for the"

        "body": "dical supervision 100% Lynette Giles thank you for the dical supervision 100% Lynette Giles thank you for the Super Chat looks like your question is down here so Lynette says uh dear Dr chaffy I've been carnivore for a month uh but putting on weight um three kilos only eating limited cheese but mostly beef and some lamb extra butter any suggestions please um some people do gain weight at first and that that's generally metabolic issue and especially when people have been doing sort of starvation diets and things like that for a long period of time um and these yo-yo diets where they're sort of you know eating you two you know two lima beans and a Celery Stock and they just you know and they're trying to starve themselves and exercise and lose weight and they do for a while but then it sort of peers off and and they don't um and they don't uh uh feel very good and they're not getting very good results because their in their metabolism is just shutting down and they stop and their body adjusts to the amount of energy that's coming in and so they're not losing too much weight so they don't die you know so as your body thinks it's happening you're in a famine and your oh we gota we gotta we got to make sure we don't die and um so it's um uh you know when people are in that state you know and then they go into a cornivore diet and they're actually eating enough and their body goes like oh thank God but they're still worried about it's still worried about like this this um famine that you may be right back into again so you know you have to encourage your metabolism to to speed up again and basically show your body that you're not in a famine anymore that everything's fine now and and eventually it will um come down again so you just eat enough eat enough you know again focus on your health how you feel that's the most important thing and then very secondarily way down the list is your body composition again if you put on lean body mass and you lose fat you can still say the same weight or even gain weight so nowhere on that is is where your weight is body composition is a you know it can be a consideration but really what's important is your health eventually when your health improves your hormones improve your metabolism improves you will lose fat and so you will you will improve in those ways you have to be very strict you know you want to be just just fatty red meat and water or just fatty meat and water butter usually fine um but you know if you feel that that maybe holding you back maybe cut out the butter just have have more uh of the actual fat in the meat and see how that affects you um so you know if you go to these like longer term Facebook groups like zeroing it on health or zero carb Health been doing this for like 15 20 years and uh and and this happens it's not the majority of people that gain weight but um it is very common when people do these sort of starvation diets and destroy their metabolism that they put on weight early or have difficult time losing weight and eventually when their metabolism settles down and heals then they they start losing weight quite rapidly I see this in my clinic all the time um you know so I treat patients for weight loss and I this is this is basic basically all I do is is diet and lifestyle but it's it's actual diet and lifestyle that actually works and is sustainable lifelong and as opposed to just starving yourself and just oh just eat less calories and you put have so such a stupid uh suggestion um but uh it uh you know it doesn't work for most people and it doesn't work long term and um and it's just it's just the wrong way of doing it but if you you you're doing it this way you can do it forever and it works for everyone it just takes some time and so for some people so and I noticed I look at this I look at their uh you know metabolic markers they're leap in their insulin all these sorts of things and when those come down they start losing more weight you know it gets better and better easier and easier for them to lose body fat and so you know just be just be mindful you've been on this for a month it's you know that that's fantastic I I I at that point people start feeling a lot better and they start seeing some improvements in their health and their body composition large you know quite often but U so I hope that you've been feeling great but you know just remember it's still very early days it's it's you're just right at the beginning of this so just be patient just eat enough make sure you're feeling good and you're getting enough eat till fatty meat till it stops tasting good need to tell your body we're not in a famine we do have food around and you do that and eventually your body will heal your metabolism will heal and you will lose weight and you will gain health and that's the most important thing so go to some of these Facebook groups you know they're free and um and look at other people's stories and and get some inspiration from that go and watch um uh Kelly Hogan you know she has a YouTube channel I did an interview with her she was one of these people she actually gained weight for the first six months but her health was improving all these other things were improving s and people telling you like don't worry about it like it'll happen your body needs to heal and get into the right place and then you'll start losing weight and and it did after six months or some sort of you know hit some switch and then all of a sudden you just started losing weight but then it took a couple years before she got now she's very slender and she's maintained that for you know 14 years or so had three kids while uh while carnivore and um you know maintain a slim physique so uh just just you know you know just uh don't be discouraged it's okay it just takes longer for some people just keep going with it you'll get there eventually your body just needs to heal and your metabolism needs to heal and but you know you're going to be improving your health all the time anyway so just focus on that and uh and look at Kelly Hogan and other sorts of things for encouragement that that this does happen and it's okay and it it will come right ev entually okay good luck John Wallace thank you for the"

        "body": "entually okay good luck John Wallace thank you for the entually okay good luck John Wallace thank you for the Super Chat I'm mildly pre-diabetic um I can get my A1C down really low if I only eat breakfast and nothing else all day any advice well you know doing sort of omad is um you know that can be helpful you know that that can potentially keep your average you know blood sugar and insulin down even more sort of it's like intermittent fasting sometimes people call it a lot of people on a carnivore diet typically only need to eat once a day and so like I I I find that I'm I'm usually just eating once a day and that that's how I feel fine that's how I feel the best and so um it's uh it's you know sometimes I need to eat more if I need to eat more I will you know and that's that's fine but um if you find that just once a day is good for you and you feel great with that and your and your blood sugar comes down is more controllable great if your body needs a bit more eat a bit more you know but if you're eating once a day fatty meat until it stops tasting good typically uh a lot of people only need to eat once a day so see how you go with that and uh just adjust as needed if if you need a little more great that's fine um if you feel better doing that at night because if you eat just to full capacity and breakfast like you're probably going to be lethargic and tired throughout the day so that might not be as fun but U so maybe you think about eating dinner instead once a day and um you know see how you go anyway but yeah you know just just you know that's um that that's that's pretty common that if you eat once a day that you'll help regulate your insulin and blood sugar better even on on a ketogenic carnivore diet yeah you know that that's like when we talking about cancer and things like that keeping gki down that's that's part of that too you know so we were talking earlier about cancer with Derek um it's um it's uh you know sometimes people do just eating once a day that that can be uh very good to uh keep your keep your blood sugar down as well and just keep that gki down also so there something to think about there plant sparing carnor thank you very much for the for the extremely generous uh super ja very very kind of you thank you for that um I have traveler's diarrhea stool test for balantidium coli GI panel PCR for uh intro um aggregative and and Jesus Christ and I can't speak and then inro toxic E coli on metronid is on now it worsens diarrhea can carnivore uh change needed for faster recovery or do other things thank you so any cornivore changes needed for fast recovery no um if you're doing carnivore and keep doing carnivore sometimes you know these these sorts of situations you maybe like fermented you know food like for you know fermented yogurt right so yogurt is fermented um but like zero Cal zero carb uh yogurt like you know Greek yogurt and things like that that have really no carbs and um just plain yogurt no sweeteners flavorings anything like that you put that on meat you chew it up together in the same mouthful and swallow way together and that hopefully can sort of trojen horse some of the bacteria pass through your your your um fire pit of a stomach that you know tears things up and um and uh you know hopefully get that that down you sort of Reed some of these bacteria metronidazol will then kill it shortly afterwards but it's um you know you just sort of try to do that to try to Reed uh some good healthy bacteria in there when you have this over uh you know this overgrowth of uh bad bacteria that's that's causing a problem so you're just trying to kill it with a bacteria and then just replace it with other bacteria that's not going to cause disease and that's pretty much it but you know just trying to eat you know just very good uh carnivore diet um you know high fat if it's too high fat That Could That Could exacerbate the diarrhea um but you know things are going to be sort of having higher motility anyway so you know you really just really want to stick to a carnivore diet because it's more bioavailable you're going to absorb more of it um as you go so things are like moving too quickly so you're going to have you need to be able to absorb things you know very very easily and so yeah so give that a try and um you know otherwise you know just continue on mean the Metron nidol you know it's just yeah that's um you know stuff that that can knock out those nasty bugs um but they sort of scorch the Earth they sort of sort of take out all the all the bugs and um so you know that that's a that's a time that you know might be a good idea to Reed things with with your uh with ferments you know things like that uh so like the the uh yogurts and things like that plain yogurt you're you know as long as you're not using mouthwash you know you're going to have a healthy oral biome if you're only eating uh carnivore and so just you know that's going to Reed some of these these bacteria as well there a very different oral Flora when you're on Carnivore than than when you're um when you're just eating an omnivorous especially with carbohydrates carbohydrates will will breed very different bugs in your mouth and your digestive tract um and ones that you don't want and so uh but just having you know a healthier oral biome will help seed that if you're using mouthwashes and you're just killing all these things and disinfecting your mouth I mean no animal just infects their mouth and they never lose their teeth right it's just when you're having the bad bacteria that from carbohydrates and other sorts of crap that you're not supposed to eat that's when you get tooth decay that's because you have the wrong bacteria when you're not eating that when you're eating uh meat then you have good bacteria much different very different bacteria in your mouth and so it's it's fine you know and you don't you don't need to kill the bacteria in your mouth and so you just you just leave it alone and then when you're eating some of that bacteria will get into your food and that will get out down into your intestine as well so I think you're probably automatically receding this stuff but you can use a bit of ferments as well early on and um uh yeah I don't think there's anything else different that you need to do just you know obviously this you know this is a nasty you know situation to be in I'm very sorry to hear that um but uh you know just work with your doctor and hopefully this clears the infection you can come off the medications in reasonable time and just sort of get back to normal and get your gut health back to normal so good luck with that sorry that you're sorry t hat you're unwell okay so that's the uh the end of the"
