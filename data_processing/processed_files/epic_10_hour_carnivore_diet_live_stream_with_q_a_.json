        "body": "that's a great thing about carnivore actually we're not very much like a cult if you want to have an avocado you're not going to be sacked by the carnivore police but we will be talking mainly carnivore but we will be talking low carbon keto if you want to talk about it um it's 3 P.M in Australia in Perth where uh Dr Anthony chafee is and I'm going to give him a little introduction unless he wants to do it himself oh whatever whatever you prefer happy happy for whatever ah you see this is why you're great and sleep because you're so laid back um but for people that don't know him firstly you really should and secondly he's a medical doctor formal professional rugby player and he's giving a fresh Leaf lease of life to thousands of people around the world by professionally helping them shed weight and optimize Health without any medication and helping to revitalize their life's an activity so yeah an MD medical science uh right so I've written this long introduction but I think if you don't know him I'll be very surprised and it will come out former professional rugby player lots of good things um to say about Dr Chaffee so far away Rich have you got any questions for him um I think we've got lots lined up over here um have you got the list there okay yeah yeah surely you've got something you want to ask to kick us off um do you want to kick off with one of the questions well yeah let's do a very basic question I've got some very detailed ones but um so Dr chafee why why do you think carnivore is the optimal way to eat oh well I just think that's it's because that's our biologically appropriate species-specific diet like any animal in the wild uh they have very very we have very specific dietary requirements just like a zebra giraffe or any other animal would have and when you don't meet those requirements you can get very sick or when you're eating things that you don't have the specific [Music] um you know bioengineering to detoxify and eliminate different sorts of indwelling toxins you can get very sick from that so animals in the wild that you very very specific diets human is included and we've been eating a very specific diet throughout uh you know our Origins as humans and we have diverged from that especially in the last you know 50 to 100 years and we have seen a marked decline in our health during that time now people may say well our our average life expectancy is actually going up this means everyone's getting healthier that's not true we're actually getting much much worse the prevalence of these diseases is getting far more worse far far worse and um in fact the life expectancy was an issue before because of infant mortality that's the issue and these these you know sort of more uh primitive cultures if you want to call them that that eat a more hunter-gatherer lifestyle really to the hunter gather a hunter lifestyle um you know they say well you know their life expectancy is really 60 years like with the Inuit well no actually that's that's because their mortality rate is actually very very high and when you're out in the in the Arctic Circle uh thousands of miles away from a major university hospital um or or any sort of uh uh you know uh maternity care center you're you're not going to be able to get the care that you need if your child is is sick or hurt and has all these other sorts of issues that they can run into in those extreme circumstances and so kids die unfortunately and that's one of the ways that we've increased our life expectancy but those people in those situations when dying of old age actually go way longer than we do in a lot of cases and so you know in some uh cases far longer to the point that people don't believe them you have some you know a 102 year old lady uh and then the net uh tribe they're still hurting caribou and out there you know working 14-hour days in the snow and the tundra and she's like yeah I'm 102 and they're like [\u00a0__\u00a0] that can't be true she looks like she's 60. well she looks like she's 60 because metabolically she is and she's as healthy or more healthy than 60 year old people in America or the UK and that's simply because she's more metabolically healthy but we know geneticists we're supposed to live 120 years on average meaning that if you just stay out of your own way and don't mess up you should make it to 120 years without doing anything special so why are we dying in our 60s and 70s why is a life expectancy of 78 oh that's really good that's good no that's horrible that's middle-aged right and so these people are actually living that long and um and if you eat the way you're supposed to eat you know you can you can do that as well and be healthy as you're doing it yeah that's brilliant see what a great answer so um we do have some questions from people uh this one is from uh Joe so I'm going to put the question hopefully up on the screen it can take a lot of time paleo with a lot of meat 10 years plus Carnival one month uh 38 years um this is one month but anyway he's 38 years six foot three 195 pounds I did this for auto immune issues not weight loss I've always been leaning tips for gaining mass on Carnival um yeah well you just need to eat you need to eat more meat and you need to work out so if you're if you're lifting weights if you're um you know sprinting doing anaerobic workouts you're going to be stimulating your your muscle growth you're also going to be stimulating the production of testosterone and growth hormone and suppressing cortisol whereas if you're doing a lot of cardio it goes the other way around so growth hormone testosterone gets suppressed in men and of course all levels go up so that's the antithesis of laying down healthy lean body mass um and that's pretty much it you know you you need to stimulate your body you need to stimulate your muscles to grow and then you need to provide the the energy and nutrients that are required a lot of people under eat on a carnivore diet it's very easy to do that you just feel very satiated and very satisfied so you have to keep eating until meat stops tasting good if you're still getting that positive feedback in your body saying hey we want some more of that listen to it keep keep giving it more you might have to eat twice a day don't force yourself but just definitely give your body what it needs you know see if Richard agrees with that or has anything to add yeah I was just gonna add in that uh you and I have recently recorded um a podcast on athletic performance which I think included building lean mass um yeah 100 uh I'm a firm believer in around sort of one gram uh of protein per pound of lean body mass and it's the activation of Endor uh we need to uh to elicit this um muscle protein sensor so we need stimulation uh as Dr Chaffey says we need to be training uh but we need adequate adequate protein the M tour reset is also very important so um what we can do being kidor carnivore is we can tap into this inventory research so typically what people from a carbohydrate High uh background tend to do is consume carbohydrates all day long this will elicit an M2 activation which is continuous throughout the day because these these guys are eating every two hours but where we benefit from is the inventor reset uh which typically takes about four hours so if we were to train fasted for example now this is a dream situation which doesn't fall in or fit to everyone's lifestyle but if we were to train for example uh weight train at 8am we elicit an Mentor activation um so this is one Spike we could eat four hours later uh this is another M2 activation before I was following that and four I was following that now we need three three grams of leucine in order to activate M talk which works at anywhere between 30 to 50 grams of meat depending on the source um I'd be I'd preference towards 50 to to make sure but doing this and consuming your last meal around 8 PM would allow you to fast technically for 16 hours and elicit 4M to activations which is um four times more than a typical bodybuilder who's consuming food every two hours and this is what I've put down to my body's ability to gain Mass so quickly early on in my career when I began bodybuilding uh but quality nutrients red meat referenced people tend to preference chicken we need protein and fat protein and fat that elicits higher protein muscle protein synthesis protein alone can do this with the three grams of leucine but studies as Dr Chaffee and I highlighted in this podcast um we'll elicit the response but to further elicit muscle protein synthesis we need protein with fat we need to consume the protein as nature intended carbohydrates do not further elicit muscle protein synthesis but protein and factors protein fat is essential so if you want to build muscle protein and fat particularly from red meat yeah oh sorry go on yeah I was going to say for those that don't really understand why maybe adding fat there is an added bonus to fat and that's production of bile if you keep your bile production up believe it or not that's not just helping absorb fat that is definitely helping to absorb amino acids so some people are a little little um unsure about why we're saying fatty meat sometimes because it's so ingrained that you've got to avoid fat and all you're going to do is you're not going to gain muscle you're just going to get fatter and that's that's not the case um unless you eat way too much fat and you go beyond your satiety which is which is really tough that's the other thing it's very tough to overeat when it comes to Fat it's not like carbohydrates I think the Minnesota prison study which uh which pretty much proved that you can overeat by carbohydrates that was an experiment with humans you know a captive audience you know no pun intended where they could eat half of the prison could eat as much as they like with carbohydrates and the other the other half could eat fats and proteins and I think the fats and proteins group they they over ate over ate these sort of estimated calorie intake for a day by about 800 but the carbohydrate group it was about 10 times as much so it's much easier to overeat uncarb so don't Don't Fear the fat that's what I was gonna say yeah it's also very difficult to absorb it as well you know if you eat a lot more you do need that bile to absorb the fat you can you can still absorb some but it's it's not as much it's very small percentage you know we're from like 10 to 15 of the fat past the bile um that you can absorb so you can absorb that you can absorb if your body doesn't it runs out of bile I mean that's how much fat your body wants right so that's how much bile it's made for it and then after that you can still absorb some usually like medium chain fatty acids are a bit easier for your body to absorb without bile but it's not that much and so you really have to overdo it and first of all it's not going to taste good you're going to be sort of fighting yourself and then you're also going to get you know 85 to 90 percent of that fat being excreted which is going to give you explosive diarrhea and that's not going to be fun and so you're going to want to like just naturally pull back on that you can do it but it's difficult it's easier to to eat more protein things like that the lean sort of stuff but you actually you sort of have a limit on the amount of fat you can absorb as well but you can certainly overeat on on pretty much anything it's just more difficult much more difficult to do on a carnivore diet because first and foremost it just starts tasting bad and it just start you start stop enjoying it and so you want to stop words with carbs you get in that carb cycle where oh my God I'm hungry I'll have to eat I have to eat I have to eat you eat and you're hungry an hour later because now your blood sugar is dropped and you know you can't stimulate um lipolysis or pergolysis because your insulin's help right so that's very easy to overeat as well I was going to ask uh Richard you know we're talking about those two spikes in mtor so you work out and you get that mtor hit and then you want to wait four hours and then eat a big meal so you know you know there's always the the um the idea that you want to eat directly after you know a big workout and hit that you know anabolic window uh what are your thoughts on that yeah yeah it's a myth again my opinion in regards to the research that I've carried out um I'm sure you've come to the same conclusion um so this is in regards to research and uh personal experience as long as we are consuming adequate amounts of protein throughout the day that anabolic window is is a myth um it certainly didn't hinder me and it allowed me in order to build lean mass at an incredible rate so to put this into perspective um you know somebody who is supplementing with performance enhancing drugs which is rampant within within the bodybuilding community and and this is the reason that I came away from it I'm not against it I'm not again is anyone who does so I work with people who who supplement uh you know this is personal preference but this is something that I didn't want to do um but typically they can gain lean mass around uh 0.8 pounds per month which is around 10 10 pounds of lean body mass per year yet when you listen to people on these YouTube channels they'll say they've they've they've gained 90k of lean mass in a month which is just ridiculous yes you may have gained 30k of weight but you certainly haven't gained 30 kilograms of lean mass it's just absolutely ridiculous even Ronnie Coleman towards the end of his career was saying that he used to gain maybe between four to five pounds and heavily supplemented so if you can gain 10 pounds of lean mass a year you you are right at the top end um I gained on average for the first four years around eight pound of lean mass um some some years you could argue it was 10 which is right at the top end and I put this down to the Gaia that I was living not just because I'm eating highly nutrient dense foods as in red meats which contain fats as nature intended Superior Amino profile high levels of leucine which is the anabolic amino acid but also you know we're devoid of things like grains uh and other so quite early on I was predominantly keto I was eating um lots of greens um I used to do my spinach smoothies with my turmeric um which um yeah you know we now know that you know that this is is far from optimal and and probably quite damaging but that's where I began my journey but I was abstaining heavily from grains which are high in phytic acid and lectins which block the absorption of these nutrients amongst other things um and further down my career and education you know I learned that a lot of these vegetables also contain you know phytohemoglutinin and another phytic acids another toxin things which prevent the body from absorbing nutrients these foods are anti-nutrients so the more that I gravitate into um an animal-based lifestyle a meat-based lifestyle the easier that it seemed for me to build muscle which goes against everything that the typical bodybuilder will do because bodybuild diet is like pasta and chicken so you've got the lean chicken without the fat and then you've got the lectins and phytic acid from the pasta um which is absolutely counterintuitive and it just makes you wonder um how somebody who is genetically predispositioned to pack on muscle uh you know would do on a Carnival lifestyle I'm not a big person I'm five foot nine um you know I'm quite short I I think I'm not big in regards to frame um and I used to win on condition so it was my um almost an illusion on stage in regards to body composition and uh and and body fat percentage um and that that's what allowed me to to achieve the things that I could but my myostatin levels are naturally high within my body which myostatin is a protein in the body that prevents you from building muscle it's almost your body's safety mechanism tells you that whoa now you need to stop building muscle um a lot of these muscle you know beasts on stage these days where heavily supplemented have low myostatin um and perhaps even take myostatic Inhibitors uh but it would be interesting to find somebody who is early on in their career who is genetically predispositioned to pack on muscle to live the carnival life so they'll actually see if we can achieve you know these fits of um of uh these Mass monsters that do you know supplemented and I believe that we can um you know the things that we can achieve on this lifestyle go far beyond any expectation that you can possibly imagine unless you've lived the lifestyle another three of us know the benefit from from doing so on from living this lifestyle and again that's why we're here today is to spread this word isn't it um you know we've gone off track I think with with the bodybuilding thing again this comes back down to health and well-being isn't it um which brings me back to to a question for you know for for Dr Chaffey um I'm guessing there are lots of people on you know on the show now who are already living the lifestyle but what would your tips be for adopting the lifestyle if you were starting from scratch um would you recommend somebody to begin go in full Carnival would you increment it um is is it okay to do both or depend on the type of person you are and what would you what would you implement uh you know in order to to make this progression at least into becoming Carnival well I'm I'm I my my sort of frame of of mind is is more of one of uh you know just go after it you know if you've made a decision strike while the Iron's hot just do it and and so that's what works for me that when I decided that that you know plants were toxic and my professor said you know plants are trying to kill you I'm like right I'm out and I'm just not gonna eat any plants after that uh that works for me and that works for a lot of people I find that that a lot of people when they get that idea in their head and they want to they want to do it like okay yeah I'm going to do this it's really really beneficial if they just do it right then you know as sales people will tell you you know like a car salesman someone comes on the lot and they're looking at a car and they're sort of interested in something if they say well I'll think about it and I'll come back 95 of the time they do not come back and so you really need to get on board when your mind is like oh do I want to do this you need to do it because most often that's when you'll have success now there are some people that are just they're not like oh I want to do this they're like oh God I don't know I mean I want to but you know obviously that's someone coming at a different place so like okay why won't we ratchet things down and and sort of you know and and sort of ease our way into this um you know um Maria Emrick said that herself when she sort of came around this um you know she came to keto first uh it was cute for a very long time and is really mostly carnivore now but she you know um you know has some sort of plant stuff here and there but predominantly animal based she was saying that the type of person she was if she's just said yeah you can only eat meat she'd be like absolutely not you know that doesn't give me the options I'm not gonna be able to cook I'm not gonna be able to use any ingredients like not going to do it um and so you'll meet people like that you know I meet people in a special circumstance people come to me when they want to do this and they and they want some more help and advice to get on this or they're sick and they have a lot of health issues those are highly motivated people because you know they are in a tight spot and I can say look this I think this will help you they go okay look whatever you suggest I'm just going to do it you know and so I find that those people have a really good success of really just going you know hammering at home going full on you see this also in um smoking cessation and and other source of drugs and alcohol people do have a better time going cold turkey and not using off you know you have those people that I've been cutting down smoking I'm trying to quit and they're trying to quit for 20 years you know and then they're and they're smoking more than they were before and people go on methadone to help them try and quit heroin and 20 years later they're on a higher dose of methadone and still doing heroin so it's like you know if you if you just go cold at some point if even if you wean down eventually you will have to stop right and so why can't that just be today right um so I find that that works well and I and if someone does decide that that's what they want to do then um I think you I think you go all in you know you toss out all the food in your house if you can you know if you're if you're have that luxury you know sometimes people are living with people that have no interest in following their footsteps but you know if you're in a position that you know you're on your own or your family is behind you and willing to do this with you just throw it all out you know you know throw the food out of the pantry throw the stuff out of the fridge give it to someone that you don't like and want to eat or whatever you want to do you know you can give it to them and get rid of it and you don't need it in the house you know if you're if you're going to try to quit smoking or quit drinking you don't just leave a bunch of cigarettes and booze around the house you know for two reasons one you you want that out of there you don't want the Temptation out of sight out of mind uh and also number two you know if you're keeping well I spent money on that I don't want to throw it away and the next part of that sentence that you don't say is when I decide to go back to smoking or drinking right so you've already decided that you're going to go back to this you've already set yourself up for failure so you get rid of it throw all that crap out when the people go well I've just bought a whole bunch of groceries and you know and I'll use those up and then I'll do it they never do it they never do it again that's that's that five percent of people that actually come back to the the car dealership so um it's it it's much better to strike while the iron iron is hot no you know if you've said okay this is what I want to do you're never going to be more committed to that and then that moment right then so you need to put yourself into a position that you can have as much success as possible if you are going to say okay well I'm going to ease my way into this that's what's going to work better for me fine but you need to have that in a graduated manner you need to put you need to get a calendar and Mark a date today I'm cutting out all carbs grains sugars alcohol all of them you know the next week you put in X I'm cutting out all seeds legumes and oxalate you know High oxalate Foods the next week you're cutting out something else and by you know week three week four it's like absolutely no plants nothing but meat after this day all right and you need you need those hard checkpoints oh sometime next week I'll stop you know the diet starts tomorrow the diet starts Monday that's the you know it's the cliche sort of thing it's always tomorrow you know all you know tomorrow tomorrow I'll love you tomorrow right it's only a day away but it never comes you know it's you know it's only today so you need to mark on your calendar when that's going to happen and you need to action it and uh and you know you're only you're only hurting yourself you know it's it's it's yourself that you have to hold yourself you hold yourself accountable to yourself sometimes it's easier to be held accountable by other people but well I don't want to let you know this person down sometimes that's easier so sometimes you can do it with you know your spouse or you know a boyfriend girlfriend your kids just be like hey why don't we why don't we do this together and then you keep each other strong hey you know let's not eat that oh let's do this so let's how we instead of doing that let's go to the gym together let's go on go on a walk or let you know get a steak or something like that so you can you can have that support as well but I I personally like the cold turkey just get after method yeah I think there's um there's two kinds of people isn't it the step change and incremental change um I've always seen myself as a step change which is basically All or Nothing um but I must admit that I did gravitate into this slowly because uh I wasn't familiar with Carnival per se um you know keito came up to me in regards uh into the early stages of my journey um and I almost gravitated into it thinking that I was doing things correctly and I learned extra things as I went along even even until recently um so I've been keto for 10 11 years which Carnival is a ketogenic state by the way so people tend to different differentiate between the two if you're in if you can't avoid ketogenic um but there's different variations isn't it um no I I'd I became carnivore or what I regarded as Carnival maybe four five years ago but even then I was still consuming things um that contained plants I mean I've been a lover of coffee for example until recently um so I mean it's only in recent times if I take that but it's so education because you even though it sounds very simple coffee comes from a plant you don't actually think about it until because it's not something you read in it it's a drink so again it's these education pieces but I think it's an important point that you made there in regards to family members because um a lot of clients that I work with find an incredibly difficult when they do this alone because their partner is consuming uh a takeaway or some fast food or some junk they will buy this food and it's in the cupboard um and this food calls to you in the night it screams too because it it Foods addiction is a real thing now I did um a podcast recently with Dr Jen and Nguyen who's coming on later this afternoon um in regards to full reduction of food addiction is not recognized in the UK at least as an addiction so we we have gambling addiction alcohol addiction drug addiction food addiction which is in my opinion the most damaging is not recognized as an addiction but this is uh incredibly important because if it affects the capital manager neurotransmitters which is these neurotransmitters that affect the way that we we think and feel it affects things like dopamine serotonin and when we're not getting these hits that we need uh in our brain we begin to search them from other sources um you know we are uh We've evolved to chase these dopamine hits and if we are not receiving them through the foods we eat or we're not receiving the correct signal and we will look for these hits through foods that we consume and typically these are sugary treats so it is incredibly difficult to come away because food is an addiction uh and I think a lot of people don't give that the the recognition that it deserves that it is incredibly hard so to do this alone without the support of a family member can be incredibly difficult so what I find is that um a lot of clients I work with tend to like the incremental approach um the people who do better uh other families that do it together who as you say completely remove you know all literally pour the seed oils in the bin or or down the sink I don't know if you're allowed to do that can you can you pour Cedars on the sink because it's not like you know it might be like hazardous waste sort of thing which should tell you something about uh you know putting it in your body you know it's a dangerous chemical disposal only then um yeah you definitely shouldn't be eating that nonsense and that's exactly what it is yeah high in an oxidized omega-6 colonialic acid um detrimental to to our health which brings me on to Steve yeah yeah I mean I've got a list of things to throw at uh not not from me by the way uh just behind the scenes just to tell uh tell you what I've been saying a few people have said to me why are you doing 24 hours I said well have you ever heard Richards speak you need 24 hours uh uh yeah so yeah um I just wanted to add a little bit I tell all my clients is other ways of eating tend to be very negative like don't eat this don't eat that don't do this when you come over to Carnival I think it's better for your subconscious mind one of the things is to be positive don't wake up I mean uh I'm not gonna have ice cream today wake up saying today I'm going to eat some protein today I'm going to have some fat today I'm going to be carnivore and if you think in a positive frame of mind and I know it's corny but if you tell your brain not to think about pink elephants you have to think about pink elephants do it so it's a little tip there is just to sort of be very positive and think in a more positive way so today I'm going to have beef today I'm going to have bacon eggs butter that's gonna be a great day and I just think that can help people and what you said about friends and family I've actually dealt with two people who are having big arguments with their partner and if you're wanting to eat this one and sadly one of them actually is refusing to buy the the food so they they become quite individual when it comes to food and my advice was just stick at it you will become the example and it's very tough to say to somebody in six weeks or six months hey you know you've lost a ton away you're off your meds please don't eat like this because that person truly wants to be with you they're going to love that so yeah um if you don't mind I'll just do a couple of the pre-submitted questions because people have been kind enough to do that and we've got tons in the comments I am trying to get to the rule but these answers are brilliant so it's a nice easy one this is from Roxanna um do you feel that Dairy puts weight on it can yeah I mean especially like milk and things like that where you're gonna have uh you know enough lactose to raise your insulin it's going to put you into a fat storage metabolism as opposed to a fat burning metabolism and uh some people have an inflammatory risk well everyone's going to have a bit of an inflammatory response to casein especially A1 uh casein proteins and some people have a very large inflammatory reaction to that you're going to you know retain water weight and it's going to sort of mess you up in other ways especially if you have autoimmune issues um but regardless of all that this is just something that we see you know we see a lot of people stall when they're using Dairy so um you know people get it you know you hear that carnivore diet and you know you you're just eating meat and drinking water and like Dairy ooh it's a bit of a gray area you know yeah you can have some of it as a condiment put like a slice of cheese on on a burger patty or something like that but really what you're eating you're supposed to be eating meat they hear that all grag and eat dairy and they just eat like just absolute ton of dairy and and then they're just I was like oh I'm not really losing weight in fact I'm not putting on weight you know I lost like 20 pounds at first and now I put on like you know 15 pounds like what the hell is going on you're asking what they're eating and you're just eating just just piles of dairy um you know our body chases nutrients doesn't taste calories you know and so you you need different nutrients from meat Dairy is not a complete nutrition source and so um you know especially like pasteurized sort of things and um so you know your body's still going to need like the different nutrients from meat and then you're going to be eating meat a lot of people eat this basically the same amount of meat that they do without the dairy but they're also eating the dairy and so you're just getting more more than you need and it goes back to that sort of difficult to overeat but you can do it sort of uh part of of this equation and that's what um what I've noticed a lot of people when they're stalling rather still using artificial sweeteners uh or dairy or maybe both and you know some of those every now and then you know your body can work through it but it is something your body has to work through and so um you know I do find that people have difficulty with dairy and can can definitely put on weight or uh and not not good weight you know you're not putting on muscle mass you know you people will put on a bit more fat or find it more difficult to lose fat there are other things in the equation too though you know when people are working out lifting weights especially uh guys that get really you know into the gym because they feel so much better and they're just lifting weights you know four days a week and they're like oh I'm stalling I'm not really losing weight well that's because you're putting on muscle and the muscle is offsetting the fat that you're losing so you know just because you're not losing as much weight as you want you know it may not be uh because you're not losing fat and maybe because you're putting on muscle as well but uh definitely something to keep in mind you can definitely eat you know you can definitely run into problems eating too much Dairy absolutely and too much being more than a very little bit you know it's like more than a condiment uh you know if you're if you have a cheese platter and you're just eating chunks of cheese too much you know if you're if you're drinking you know multiple glasses of milk a day too much you know and so you just as a condiment to meat you shouldn't have dairy on its own yeah a simple thing about Dairy is as well it's all the odd chain fatty acids you always end up with a free Carbon fragment which is a substrate that the liver loves to make glucose out of so that's uh one of the things I say about the the dairy Richard you wanted to jump in there didn't you yeah on you really quickly I mean it's uh I look at I know this sounds stupid I quite often look at cheese and dairy as almost two separate things because of the way that it's made and treated with the enzymes random things I think milk is highly problematic um what I find Is that real cheese a lot of people uh can get on with in small quantities um milk for me is the biggest issue and what I find and see in the Facebook groups at the moment and in my group in particular somebody mentioned about 82 milk um uh you know and raw milk being okay and things and it is considerably better but what many people don't understand is that it still contains casein and it will still contain um it will still cause intestinal permeability so even um and this comes back down to um oh my God what's up what's the tribe uh in Africa my goodness it's um yeah perhaps no it wasn't the hadza um it wasn't a had to try um yeah I can't remember the try but basically one of the two what was that yeah the master so the Maasai and the app because you were neighboring tribes at night um and yakikuyuha uh vegan or you know predominantly vegetarian or vegan based and we have the Maasai who are meat based um the Maasai outperformed the akakuyu on every Health level born mineral density muscle mass height strength age uh everything apart from one metric which was intestinal permeability and that's because they still can consumed and pasteurized A2 milk so for me milk across the board is is a normal um even the A2 although A2 is better but then I I almost put cheese into a different category whereas you know I think it's okay to consume in in moderation but as you say you know it still contains uh Casio morphine which is highly addictive more so in milk so you know there's lots of reasons to abstain from from the milk but I do often put cheese into it into a slightly different subsection I do consume cheese real cheese not an awful lot of it but you know it is it's not something I can consume every day but it is something I'll consume you know as you say as uh as a condiment isn't it but it wouldn't make up a meal I wouldn't you know but um but yeah I don't know what your thoughts are on that Anthony but it I'd almost put them into into two to a degree you know no I I think you're right you know and and cheese is you know especially like you know traditionally like fermented and and and and uh grown cheeses or manufacture cheeses whatever it is you know those are very different you know as as um you know a friend uh Dr Bill Schindler talked about he you know he's a professor of paleontropology and and Archeology and and you know she studies this sort of stuff and um and uh and he was saying that you know when babies are drinking breast milk it goes into their stomach and actually turns it curdles and actually turns into cheese and then they sort of break that down and and eat it so that's sort of that same process you know when you're adding sort of different sort of chemicals uh to uh basically turn milk into cheese that's sort of what you're doing then you're eating that it's much more bile available it's much better for you um babies are different than adults obviously but um but it's I I would I definitely think put those in two different categories the fermented dairies are going to be fermented any things are going to be better than the non-fermented anything so uh except for maybe meat I don't I don't think you need to go rotting your meat doing the high meat thing you know teach their own you want to do that that's fine uh maybe like just the bee's knees but you know I'm okay I'm good where I'm at I'm feeling great I don't think I need to do that um but uh with the fermented dairy uh yeah that that can be very different and you know in the back sure things like that will eat up you know the lactose or at least a lot of the lactose and so if you're doing that in a traditional manner it's very different the um you know the the Mongols traditionally would drink fermented mares milk or or use fermented Mare's milk products and um and you would think that because they they use a lot of you know Cow Dairy or sorry horse Dairy um and then we just eat meat as well and drink the blood that they probably be pretty used to lactose and things like that no they are not they are some of the the mo most lactose intolerant populations in the world uh almost all of them are lactose intolerant if not all of them and so uh it's because it's all fermented they do not come across lactose they're always coming it's always fermented and you know they've been doing that for a very very long time now is that the best thing that they could ever do I don't think so I think of you getting if you're able to get enough fatty meat then that's obviously the ideal but um uh you know I do think that yeah fermented fermented dairy is definitely in a different category than than unfermented and um like milk and things like that yeah there would be an argument to go against age meat because of the increase in oxidation and increase in in linoleic acid content isn't it so uh aged Meats I don't believe um you know as good for you as fresh I think fresh is best um that's why I consume all of my meat fresh um yeah the oxidation of the meat can cause issues I guess in the same way um so I'm not a fan of age meat as I thought I'd uh put that in there and you get more histamine of course when it says for sure yeah yeah just gonna put another question up um here we go so just to the people watching who have submitted questions um the deal here is we've got 24 hours okay so um we'll get around to it and and Dr Anthony chafee has given us three hours of his time you know um behind the scenes if you don't know how this works no money changes hands we're all doing this because we want to do this all right so um if we don't get to your question we'll uh I mean I'll collate them I'll send them to to Anthony and um maybe we'll just do another one just like a catch up leave it or not 24 hour plus or something [Laughter] um but I thought that when the questions were were literally flooding in which is really nice for you guys out there that have done that I thought we really are not going to have enough time uh really so here we go so Peter's put six weeks on strict carnivore suddenly inflammation markers right up and blood's low RBC etc etc thoughts great question probably would need a little bit more information there on inflammation markers uh how long have you been not eating Carnival because six weeks yeah you're gonna see some changes but anyway that's for uh Dr chafee any thoughts well also also which inflammatory markers you know because there's some that that are you know like high sensitivity you know CRP and that goes up okay well that's high sensitive sensitivity is right in the name but you know there's other other inflammatory markers uh you know such as your platelets or ferritin levels and different sorts of things that you can look at and that can be indicative of increased inflammation you know there's nothing on a carnivore that's going to increase your inflammation but there are other things that that maybe it can increase and we generally associate them with increased inflammation that are not in increased inflammation um if your high sensitive vcrp is going up okay maybe you need to look around at what you're doing and what you're putting in your body you know are you using seed oils are you cooking your steak in olive oil are you um have you gotten rid of you know Stevia and and erythritol and monk fruit sugar and things like that um you know those sorts of things matter you know and um and they will they will cause a problem so you know there's there's nothing in meat that will increase your your um you know nothing in meat that will increase your inflammation inherently so if your inflammatory markers they are indeed going up and there's something else going on you need to identify that and eliminate that now it could be as simple as uh you respond very poorly to the linoleic acid in pork you know all these things just fetish soy and processed you know oils and things like that as well and that gets into their fat and then we eat them and we eat that fat and we get that seed oil direct from the animal right so that's um that's a problem as well that's why you know some people have a serious reaction to pork chicken and certainly Farm fish Dairy and eggs you know because they're the animals are being fed things that they shouldn't be fed and so you can yeah and omega-6s are are quite pro-inflammatory and so if you are eating a lot of those uh High linoleic acid Meats because they're being fed garbage then um that can that can do that you know it it's it would be weird that you know you'd go from like a standard if we just assume you're on a standard American diet which is very pro-inflammatory and you cut off all that crap and all you're having now is a bit of linoleic acid that's in pork it still should be uh disparity it should be still going in the right direction so I would think that there's need more information and um I would I would wonder if you're if you're not being perfectly strict exactly what markers are we talking about exactly when did you get them checked when you check them again also how did you get your blood test done this changes your blood test will change if you get your Bloods taken five times over the course of the day your Bloods are going to be different five times during the day except for you like your rbcs and hemoglobin and and things like that that'll that'll remain pretty consistent but a lot of your inflammatory markers can change your cholesterol can certainly change your hormones will definitely change and and a lot of other things as well even your minerals and so so what I tell my patients is that you need to take your blood test in a very consistent manner you have to take it in the morning between eight and nine A.M you have to be fasting from 9 pm the night before only drinking water after that you drink two glasses of water right when you wake up at least an hour or two before you get your blood test no more than four glasses of water uh you know in that time as well so you want the same fasting status the same time of day the same hydration status and you want to be resting for a day or two before that so for the day of the test and the day before the test maybe even the day before that you should not be working out not going to the gym not going on a run not having sex all of these things will affect your your blood results and so you just need to keep a consistent pattern to all of this and you will get you'll get more consistent results that you can test and you know at the end of the day a test is only as good as a retest so you have some you know weird markers on your on your blood test now okay keep doing what you're doing see how you feel if you're feeling good great in a few weeks time get another blood test and and see where you're at and see if you need to make an adjustment and if you are eating anything except meat uh you know red meat and water go to red meat and water and see what that does for you I think with the with the um lobotomy hat on as I'm a qualified phlebotomist I've seen thousands of blood and when you go carnivore some things do go up anyway like the blood urea nitrogen because you're eating more protein so you'll get a red flag for your buns reading um because you're just basically producing more nitrogen waste from the protein synthesis um and there are other things as well when you've got a reference range that is a normative range it doesn't mean it's optimal for instance Anthony just mentioned the high sense dcrp the range is is very minimal and you need some context here because I've had people really panicked because their CRP is five where I've seen CRPS of 80 and also hundreds and even thousands so um you've got to understand that they're very dynamic as as Anthony just said but there's also a lot of nuance to it and I think um the hydration status and also test for kidney function tests the cystatency is a much better test than the estimated glomerular filtration rate for instance so there's lots of things you can do with your Bloods but it's it's probably better to get someone who understands bloods in the context of low carb keto or carnivore because there is some Nuance to that as well which I think you know is underestimated I I was just going to say as well you know if your inflammatory markers are up you know I'm sure fine okay we covered that but then blood's being low like your rbcs are going out so if your rbcs have gone down in six weeks that's not from carnivore like you could be bleeding somewhere you know or having like a um you know or having you know if you have you know the MTHFR Gene um you know that that's you're not going to process folate you know as well you could you know get some uh form of anemia from that um if you're looking at yourself and you've got perfect blood but you know don't don't think the Bloods are telling you the story because yeah always question how you're feeling I mean presentation of symptoms actually is a big deal for you know when I was doing blood ever such a lot um you know people would say I've got low folate and then you'd look at well is there any clinical presentation here yeah and you just have to go through well you're not being bleeding gums it's difficult for you to say eight o'clock in the morning uh you know all those other things you have to look at the whole path and the context sorry Richard yeah you wanted yeah just as quickly I think um you know it's easy to ignore external factors as well you know it's it's quite easy to blame uh you've began a new lifestyle uh and you know these results are showing what they are you you could be you you may have come down with some sort of virus or infection there are lots of external factors going on um so definitely as uh as Dr Chaffey recommends a retest is super important um a lot of clients that I work with Will begin the journey they'll have um one negative uh outcome from something and then it's to do with a change in diet yet they weren't willing to accept that every ill health in their life leading up to this point was to do with their diet it was always some other Factor you know but the second you change your diet and something goes awry then it's because you've changed your diet there's lots of external factors involved well um but this in my opinion is uh the healthiest way to live and I'm sure that um you know you're going to see improvements should you stick to the lifestyle but good point on um on uh the sources of meats of linoleic acid and are you consuming processed Meats um yes processed meats are bad and then again a lot of junk um but idv we want to go with with fresh meats particularly red meat in my opinion uh chicken and pork as you say um should be uh you know exercised lightly um I do love pork and chicken but uh they're not a staple for me on a daily basis red meat is what I eat every day without today I've got a fabulous question uh just to finish the first hour I think this is from Andrea uh what is your experience and guidance for a post-rny gastric bypass patient that's carnivore I'm 54 postmenopausal Carnival 1.5 years uh 25 years plus post-op um starting weight was 460. wow well done and current is 165. yeah that's brilliant sorry I was reading ahead guys when you when it went wow I mean that's a ton of weight uh five for eight it's very hard to get nutrients in unless you eat three to five times a day does that tank blood sugar and fat burning great question Andrea um well you know and and sorry this is in the context of gastric bypass sort of thing yeah yeah I think because when you've had bypass your stomach volume is it's smaller yeah yeah so I I just want to make sure I heard that right so um uh yeah so it uh that's fine you'll eat five times a day that's fine you know if you're eating if you're eating uh meat then then that's okay that's not that's not a problem um you're going to need to do that right because you you're going to need to eat a different amount of of meat then your body's going to allow you to do by sheer you know lack of volume available uh another thing you can do is don't drink water during the meal or two hours before the meal you want every square inch of uh space in there uh to be for food and for for fatty meat in particular focus on fatty meat that's going to have more nutrients uh per Vol area of volume right so no water during or before the meal so this is your stomach is empty and then you just fill it up with fatty meat right let your body digest you get on with your day and then and then you do it again and you may have to do that a few times and that's okay you still need to get enough food you still need you know it would have been nice if if uh we could have gotten to you before you had the surgery because um you know you would have had very good results with that as well and I think just as good if not better uh with that and um and then you would be able to to eat to satiety and not have to not have to um worry about it but you're in the position you are now and that's okay you know you just you just eat one when you're hungry until you're full and uh if you have to eat more than once a day that's fine as long as you're eating the correct thing which is me too yeah I agree and I think a lot of people within the keto Carnival Community get caught up in fasting uh which fasting is fantastic but what many don't realize is that being keto and Carnival would elicit the same responses uh of autophagy mitophagy Brown fact activation like policies um we will benefit uh we'll receive the same benefits from just being in that ketogenic State uh as well as um you know compared to to fasting for long periods of time so as as much as I'm a fan fan of fasting um you know these responses and these results can be achieved from purely being in that ketogenic state so I wouldn't get too caught up with with going too long though fast and if you need to eat four or five times a day um then eat four or five times a day Richard you could you caught me out there being brief not on the board unless you let's do a question then to take us to the first hour um I found one here let's show this hi all is hint water okay to drink from Carnival diet is that something in America I've not heard a hint I don't know if that's a brand maybe that's a typo um hint water I don't know if that's a if that's a brand I haven't heard of it if it's not a brand you still haven't heard of it um so I haven't heard of it but uh yes water's fine to drink on Carnivore yeah there's a good hint there you go yeah but yeah just normal water I mean you shouldn't have anything sort of flavorings or any sort of crap like that you know it should you know if there's a bottle and has an ingredients list it should say water right and um you know and so that that's pretty much it filtered water I think is best there's a whole bunch of garbage that's in in city water and and you do want to filter that out charcoal filters uh get most stuff out does not not going to get everything out um you know some people do the reverse osmosis one that's fine the the distillation ones actually uh work just as well um and are much cheaper so um but yeah but the reverse osmosis ones are getting cheaper and cheaper as they go as well but at least some some sort of filter uh unless you're out in the country and you're just drinking you know Branch water go for it you know that that's the best you can do really as long as it's not contaminated with some sort of Filth atrazine all that sort of weird things that like change the sex of frogs and things like that like no thank you um I think maybe should we celebrate that we've done our first hour up anyway um maybe I've had a bell or something rich maybe 23 to go all right so Cody's asked uh been Carnival for over a year lost 70 pounds congratulations on that feel great but been tracking blood sugar and ketones and my blood sugar will not with emphasis go below 100 unless I fast for multiple days ketones around 2.5 any comments guys personally I don't think that's an issue I mean what is I just Googled what is 100 in in the UK I think that's for 5.6 million that's normal it's just just just at the border of of normal yeah you wouldn't want to go about that so I mean to me that's fine it's more important that the Ketone levels are 2.5 and not to forget that um we create glucose our cells through gluconeogenesis which is in Stephen and I covered recently with my um continuous blood glucose monitor um you know we have the ability to create glucose as and when we need it and uh when I did a 10k run uh mine went from 3.8 up to 10.6 after 40 minutes of running which is absolutely incredible but um personally I don't know what your opinion is Anthony you're probably way more qualified in in this than I am but I I think that's perfectly okay um you know keeping levels 2.5 ideally it'd be good to be lower but I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't be concerned with that oh yeah go for it yeah firstly um going back to blood tests when are you taking it is it in the morning because obviously you've got the dawn effect that's possible I know you're saying here in the fast multiple days if you fast for multiple days your liver is still going to produce glucose it does that overnight gluconeogenesis is there you may be someone that runs at 100 I'm sorry to say that uh again this is it I'm special practitioner in obesity in diabetes thousands of people uh I've seen thousands of Bloods and a hundred there are probably 90 of people I see first time would give their right arm for a hundred you know it isn't that high your ketones are 2.5 sort of show that your body's in a really good metabolic state to be honest um I would only worry about that if there were symptoms if you're feeling dizzy you're feeling anxious uh like you can't burn up energy you can't sleep personally if you've lost 70 pounds and you are feeling great and you've got 2.5 ketones there I think you're doing all the right things personally it could be stress there's another thing that will push your blood glucose up you and I know this sounds are strange thing to say you if you're stressing over it being 100 that could actually add to it so try and be relaxed when you take Bloods don't worry too much um like I say I don't think 100 is a particular issue of um yeah honestly about 80 of the people I've seen for the first time if I said to them you know in six months you're going to be 70 pounds down you're gonna have 2.5 ketones and you're gonna have a hundred will you take that now they would all take that I promise you um so yeah and also look at your variation and fast in multiple days it's just showing your livers working this is making the glucose that you require don't forget you need about 120 grams of glucose just to run your brain if you're reading books if you're very academic your brain needs more energy that's been proven so it could be your activity your mental activity is just demanding a little bit more glucose so personally I wouldn't worry about that do you want to do a question rich I mean I've got tons here from people that have uh submitted I'm just going to just hop in on that one as well um probably totally agree with their you know everything you guys have said um uh also you mean where are you coming from you know like it's like like Richard said you know it's like are are you diabetic have you been on medication are you should you still be on your medication a lot of people will go on a carnivore diet and they'll um you know you've been on it for a year so I mean you should you should be pretty good at this point you know even if you were on medication a lot of people can come off their medication even insulin however you know some people may need to be on it a bit a bit longer so you know sometimes people prematurely come off their their diabetes medication uh just because they're excited and they're like hey people are getting off their medication that means I can stop taking my medication well you know eventually maybe but um you know you need to do that in a graduated Manner and you can't just necessarily just come straight off of it maybe you still have a bit of a bit of a need it can take some people uh multiple years before they come off of uh of their medications completely or you know some people just have to stay on a little bit and that that's okay too but 100 you know level of 100 is pretty good uh you're definitely in ketosis because you're making ketones right and you're not dead so um if you're if you're fasting for multiple days and you still have blood sugar and you still have ketones where are those coming from well you're making them right so you're in you're in the right metabolic State and so it doesn't really matter you know um so your insulin is going to be nice and low which is great um you're uh most likely you know because you're you're able to make all the blood sugar and ketones and um you know yeah and it can matter at different times of day so you'll take multiple times a day chill out you know if you're stressed out that can that can raise that up as well and and there's a lot of other factors as well I at the end of the day I just take it easy if you were on medication came off early talk to your doctor maybe you need to be on those things uh for a bit longer and otherwise just relax you know and just just eat and be happy if you're feeling good don't worry about it if you're not feeling good go and talk to a doctor yeah I've got another quick question rich rich we haven't worked out a little secret signal here yeah I know we should do we should do what we did in the phc where we put the hands up there we go well maybe I could do that moving forward I'll put my hand up circularly ask a question yeah I've got a list as long as my arm but look you fire away uh we've got we've got Dr Chaffee from another uh two trailers yeah right um a very simple one Rebecca has given me a novel to read and I have uh basically diluted it down to um do you think that d calf coffee is as bad as coffee in terms of inflammation and uh those sort of things oh uh yes yeah absolutely I mean so you know I mean we always focus on um on caffeine you know because that's the only thing in coffee oh caffeine caffeine is a drug is addictive and it's a neurotoxin and it's an insecticide all those things are true that is one of 150 000 chemicals that exist in in uh coffee right and the coffee is a bean a bean is a seed a seed is a plant's baby and and organisms protect their babies more than anything and this is where you'll generally find the highest concentration of different sort of toxic chemicals so and and caffeine is one of them caffeine is a neurotoxin it was developed as an insecticide this this fries the brains of uh unwitty insects that try to eat that leaf or that Bean or that seed so it's um has a different response than us we're much bigger animals but uh you know I know people that have fixed their epilepsy with a carnivore diet and then they have uh uh caffeine or coffee and and then they've had a seizure as a result of that so you know that's why I refer to it as a a neurotoxin you know because it's it's affecting your brain so this is a toxin is as as clinically defined you know by you know Oxford dictionary and uh and it's affecting your brain so that's a neurotoxin right um but there are a lot of other things that cause problems as well and so uh people just go oh I'm just drinking decaf fries why are you drinking it at all then you know you just want the horrible flavor you know like yeah so um you know you want the caffeine but you're just drinking the the garbage that comes with it you know I mean that's sort of that's sort of it backwards so what I suggest to people is actually doing it the other way around which is you know getting a bottle of like nodos or caffeine pills and having one or half or a quarter of that to give you that caffeine hit that you're looking for and and give you a bit of energy Spike that you want and not bringing on the 150 000 other chemicals as well and this is something people people will see you know they don't you know you don't get sore on Carnival it's like oh well I still get sore do you drink coffee yes I do well there you go all that doesn't cause it stop drinking coffee and find out you know and um you know I drank coffee uh once I tried it out I was sore for two days after that I wasn't sore before that I you know I went uh lifting weights with uh um uh surgical colleague of mine and um you know and he like I put him through my workout and like maybe because he was doing carnivore so I was like pushing him through my things oh I don't I don't know I don't want to really go too too hard because I don't want to be sore uh you know because I'm operating tomorrow I'm like well you know you won't be sore if you've actually been strict if you've only been eating meat and water you won't be sore and he's just like looking at me all scants but um he's like well I'm really so he ended up doing it he's like I'm really interested to see if you're if you're right I don't know about this I'm interested to see if you're right and I just looked at him I was like yeah I'm interested to see if you've actually been strict you know and uh so he was like um okay next day he wasn't sore and he was pissed he said he's just like he's like I really wanted you to be wrong I really wanted to wake up this morning if you score and be like hey you let me wrong all this sort of stuff he's like but I'm not I'm not I just you were right this is crazy I should be sore right now and I you know I pushed him you know we were there for like two hours and you know we did a lot of work and um and and then sort of in the middle of the day where everyone's sort of hanging out in the break room and some of the the Reps came and bought everyone coffee obviously uh declined and um but he you know he got one and uh you know I didn't say anything and uh and then all of a sudden he you know sort of you know 20 minutes later he's just like well do you know actually yo actually I am a bit sore actually I'm feeling a bit sore I'm starting to get sore I just pointing The Coffee Cup in front of him and said what's that and he was like oh damn it you know so it does you know it does affect you it does cause inflammation and um and it objectively has these different uh chemical compounds in them that we avoid other plants for having and yet we say it's okay in coffee somehow it's like well I don't know you know I mean if we're going to avoid it in other plants you know we're not going to eat other plants because they contain these these uh compounds you know why why are we making an exception for coffee well it's a drug and it's and it has caffeine fine take the caffeine you know and just skip the rest of the crap it may be it might be also because it's a liquid version of a plant it's just so different people just don't make that connection I've got a great question that ties onto this um because Antonia talking about Real World experience and and this is one thing about carnivore um social situations working long hours I'm new to carnivore how do I know if I actually need to eat because I work long hours and I feel I'm ruled by the clock and uh actually missed the beginning bit Richard and I was just talking about when we were high carb thinking of a 24-hour live stream we would be like right I've got to wait at 10 I've got a wheat at three I've got to eat at seven and so we totally get what you're saying so what what's your views Anthony on that yeah so uh well if you you need to eat when you need to eat you know so you know the best thing about about carnivore is that you don't need to eat uh you feel great you know if you're eating high density nutrition you don't need to eat as much ore as often and so most people find that they they just once a day or maybe twice a day and that's not intentional that's not doing intermittent fasting or omad for the sake of doing omap because you don't get any other physiological benefits as Richard uh said earlier you get all those benefits from just having low insulin basically and just not putting that garbage in your body so you know the benefits of fasting um in general are that you're not eating stupid crap and your bodies can just just be you know and so if you're just eating meat you're not eating stupid crap and the same same results happen and in fact you get better results because you're actually getting nutrition and there are some improvements on um the fasting mimicking diets which is just ketogenic diet high in meat and fat and and fasting actually you don't have the same side effects like some people will lose their hair or you know at least temporarily when they're they're doing longer term fast you don't see that when you're doing keto or at least having 100 grams of protein a day so there are benefits of actually consuming nutrition as you may expect um as far as working long hours you know are you feeling bad are you feeling sick are you feeling tired are you feeling off you know those could be signs that you're hungry your hunger signals are going to change on a carnivore diet it's very easy to under eat I mean I didn't when I was in my early 20s I wouldn't eat for like three four days straight because I am just not hungry and I didn't have time either you you know because I was I was up you know first thing in the morning I was off to to school at uh University I was going to University of Washington at the time and uh and then directly after class I'd go straight to my university rugby team and as soon as I finished that I go directly to uh my men's Premiership team that I played for as well and I'd get home and then you know I'd go to the gym and lift weights sometimes as well and so I'd be home at like 10 o'clock 11 o'clock and I basically need to like read a chapter of ochem and then go to bed you know and uh and so I was just like well don't really have time to eat just to drink a bunch of water and study and go to bed and it would be days it'd be days and then all of a sudden I'd have I'd be home at you know seven instead of 11 I'd be like oh hey I've got time to eat and I'll show I should probably eat because I haven't eaten yesterday and I didn't eat the day before did I eat the day before like Jesus okay I need to eat but I didn't feel like I needed to eat because I didn't feel like I was hungry in in how I used to feel hungry um but I was definitely hungry now I can now I know my my Hunger signals you have to relearn your hunger signals so try to eat once a day if you don't feel you need to eat if you don't feel you're tired and out of it don't eat if you are feeling a bit tired if you are feeling a bit out of it if you are getting like carb Cravings bread smells really good ask yourself is this what hunger feels like try eating some meat if it tastes good keep eating it you know keep eating it until it stops tasting good if you're eating during the day and you eat until you're full you can get a bit lethargic naturally you just go into a rest and digest mode you know a lot of your blood goes to your digestive tract as opposed to your brain and your muscles and your Jewel just get naturally tired um so you know that's why I tend to eat my big meal at the end of the day and um and if you do that you'll generally find that you don't need to eat during the day if you're working out a lot and pushing yourself and you're already at a lean body mass then then you might you might have to eat twice a day you may not be able to get enough in one sitting um so you know you just have to listen to your body you have to relearn your hunger signals and um and I think a big part of that is just or going by how you feel um getting cravings and then just how meat tastes if it tastes good you're hungry a steak doesn't taste good you're not hungry I don't care who you are and um and I would just go by that if you're if you're going throughout your whole work day and you feel fine you're fine you know just make sure you get enough after you're done with your work day Rick ah did you want to add anything to that no I agree with everything um just a circle back to one of the points we made of the coffee in the previous comment uh one called acrylamide which is created during the raw simple roasting process is responsible for the law of the inflammation in coffee um so yeah acrylamide which is a non-carcinogen as well so uh and another reason to avoid decaf coffee uh in regards to eating windows and things yeah I'd do it intuitively um I think goals are important uh a lot of people get stuck into the Circadian rhythm so they eat the specific times of the day um the issue with this is that the body will release growling at about 10 to 15 minutes prior to your usual meal time um so you'll find that you may feel hungry coming towards a standard meal time so the way to to address this if you want to break that habit is to change up your meal times you could move your meal time forward by an hour and then the next day move it back by an hour and your body begins trip growling growling stops being released and then you find that these these fake hunger signals tend to go away and then you can eat intuitively and as Dr chafee says you know eat when you're hungry if you're not hungry don't eat uh coming back to the lean body mass thing even uh someone with a six percent body fat still carries around 150 000 kilojoules of energy is stored body fat so you're not going to starve uh you're not gonna go hungry um you know we can go a long period of time without consuming food but it is best to do it intuitively uh I do uh as Anthony just alluded to that something that goes against the grain um you know quite literally what we do uh Against the Grain but I eat not long before bed um or coming back to a convoy that um Dr Chaffee and I had in a recent podcast um you know what does uh The Lion and the cheat they do after it's caught and eaten is prey it goes to sleep you know so I I eat quite late in the day before I go to bed the body absorbs and process it'll process a lot of the nutrients as we sleep and then I wake up I'm not hungry I tend not to eat then for uh a long period of time I made a 12 from a day I may eat at six in the evening it may be eight or ten sometimes I don't eat at all um so I do do this intuitively if I'm hungry I'll eat if I'm not hungry then I don't eat um and I think it's as simple as that I think people make make it too difficult I've noticed some of the comments in the side about how many calories should I consume a day this is my weight blah blah ignore the calories it's not the calories that govern whether we gain or lose weight it's the endocrine system and the reason being is that the caloric model is highly flawed it doesn't account for the effect of insulin it doesn't come for the thermic effect of food metabolic rate ketogenesis and the effect of lactins um so I you know to put that into perspective I can consume anywhere between four to six thousand calories on a Carnival lifestyle and maintain weight compared to around two and a half to two thousand seven hundred on a high carb lifestyle and gain fat day on day on day so it's not the calories energy needs to be accounted for and I use the term energy over calories because not all calories are created equal drop the calories it's not the calories eat until you're satisfied uh if if you know if you're not hungry then don't eat it do it intuitively if you look into further lose weight on Carnival um then you need to come back to us as Anthony said earlier it'll look at the dairy products the high fat because the body can use dietary fat or stored body fat so one of the techniques that I use when it came to cutting for competition is I would reduce the amount of diet or do fat so I would lean over to slightly leaner cats um you know but this is to push your body to an extremity but the body's incredibly clever and it's going to fight you uh every step of the way when you get to a level of homeostasis when the body feels comfortable it will let you know um but you can move the needle should you wish to do so for for whatever reason but um just eat intuitively and that's uh that's the best advice I think that we can give isn't it definitely called you off guard again Steve yeah eat intuitively it uh you've I think your mic is off Steve Steve I think it makes off yeah it was actually well spotted my first deliberate mistake of the day so yeah I think when you're talking about being intuitive it is it is all about trying to go with the body I mean this is one of the things I find difficult when people come to this way of anything and they say I'm not digesting the fat shall I take some ox bile and what what that is actually saying is I want to exceed my natural production of bile and and that might get you over the hump temporarily but long term it's better to just listen to your body and think right okay if I'm going to eat fatty meat and this plate for which I've I've seen somebody online demonstrate you know and they're eating two pounds maybe someone like Sean Baker and you're you know you're five foot eight you're not going to eat that amount of meat you don't need that amount so be intuitive but don't um be suckered into you've got to eat x amount of protein x amount of fat in this ratio at this time because as rich said actually when I first met rich and by the way I'm going to give you a plug Rich because your YouTube channel that needs more subscribers because you an absolute you know font of information that is is amazing and I was really really um and I admit when I don't understand or know something I've never heard somebody actually talking about eating just before going to bed and it being a good thing a good thing for him and this is it there's no right or wrong way and I guarantee the three people on the screen now all eat differently but probably all get about the same results you know feel an amazing not craving for Stuff so just try and listen to your body a bit more sorry to give it a little bit of a a preaching moment there but um just listening to Rich he's full of he's full of great information and uh sometimes you can get a really quick answer from him but if you want a longer known to his YouTube channel and it's gold dust it is absolutely amazing right so um we did have another question just the reason I uh trying to be clever here and segue into these questions you see so we've got someone here I've been tracking macros 70 fat 24 uh protein I'm assuming six percent carbs do I need to change my macros so I might have preempted the answer there but what do you think Dr chafee well I think it depends on where all those are coming from you know those are some of your six percent of carbs from you know plants then yeah change your Macros get rid of that crap you know if it's if it's glycogen from liver don't worry about it um if it's lactose from dairy you know change your Macros you know so for for optimal right so this is this is you know when we talk about this you know we were talking about the absolute what we think is the absolute gold standard this is the best way to do it it's not the only way to do it it's not the only way to be healthy and it's certainly relatively uh healthy as compared to you know if you're eating a bunch of you know processed foods with seed oils and garbage or even being a whole food vegan uh or vegetarian this is going to be much better um you know even in that Spectrum it's going to get just better better and better but so what we talk about we're talking about optimal we're saying hey look this this is the mark to shoot for and you know if you don't quite get there if you're just in that ballpark you're still going to get improvements it's not an All or Nothing thing um everyone's going to be different you know you're going to you need enough fat you need enough protein you need no carbohydrates whatsoever um your body will make all of those and there's no such thing as an essential carbohydrate um so as far as as far as you know 70 30 fat to protein is roughly gram for gram fan protein right so one gram fat one gram of protein that roughly shakes out to 70 calories from fat and that's fine for a lot of people that's a that's a mark to shoot for um but again getting enough fat enough protein listening to your taste that tastes good oh I like a little bit fattier that tastes better to me now what about your body needs a bit more fat um and uh and that can change you know depending on what you're doing depending on your activity level depending on how much you know excess you know body fat you have on your person and how much you are exercising you're going to change the amount of of food and nutrition that you need um so you can you can aim for that aim for gram for gram fat and protein and then adjust you know if your body if your body is wanting more fat give it more fat I think that you know going by our stools is a really good uh way of doing that something we alluded to earlier for those that were were on at that time um you know if your body's gonna have a limited capacity to absorb fat and I think that's that's also why you don't want to you know because of the bile that you have I think that's also a good reason not to take Oxbow because your body didn't make a mistake on how much bile that it made it made a specific amount of bile because it wanted a specific amount of fat and if you're forcing it to absorb a lot more fat that's going to be too much fat by definition because it's more fat than your body is asking for it right and so unless you're in this very special situation where something weird is going on maybe you don't have a a gallbladder and you're at a big meal and you just want to eat that big meal right then fine but that's not going to be ideal um but your body has made a specific amount of bile because it wants a specific amount of fat and so if you're if you're not eating enough fat then your body's gonna absorb every ounce of that fat and none of it's going to get over into your stools you're going to be very constipated you're going to get a very dry hard difficult to pass stools and um and and that's why so if you eat enough fat and then some it's where there's that spillover you know that that overflow valve in your body not being able to absorb fat you're going to have softer stools and so at least then you know you're saturating your body's ability to absorb fat and you're not getting way overboard because you're not getting diarrhea right and so I think that that's what you want to aim for so if you're if you're eating you know 70 30 you know gram for gram fat and protein you're fine you're having dry hard stools well your body is wanting more fat you're making a lot more bile than you're bringing in fat so increase the fat you know add add a bit more fat get fattier cuts um and and do what you have to do just sort of get that up to the point that you're not you're not getting dry hard Rocky pebbley stools and see how you go or it could be that you're getting loose stools and you're not drinking coffee you're not using artificial sweeteners those are all laxatives right so that'll that'll off that'll throw things off but let's say you're you're getting diarrhea at that okay well maybe your body doesn't want as much fat and um and so on and then you know and then you know Richard could probably talk more about this but if you're you're doing something very specific like trying to cut uh down to really low body fat percentage when you're getting ready for a competition maybe you switch up your Macros then too but um you know I think that would be individual as well but either way if you're just if you're just a normal person and you're just trying to optimally feed your body then you just need to get you can aim for that Mark and then adjust for your own for your own person you need to get enough fat you need to get enough protein and that's going to be different for everybody in their individual State whether they're gaining losing trying to stay the same or their body wants to stay the same or they're working out a lot or exercising a lot or not so it's going to be different for everyone that's a mark to shoot for that's great and then you have to adjust for your own particular set of circumstances Rich yeah totally agree nothing to add to be honest I I think um you know I I don't track I I eat as nature intended uh I eat Foods you know that the nature provides to me nature gives us this perfectly packaged present of combination of protein and fat and that's how I eat everything that we consume in nature contains protein in fact an egg is almost equal quantities of protein to fat around six grams of protein five grams of fat depending on the size of the egg or see chicken breasts the skin on his protein in fact steak depends you know every cut of steak is protein in fat this varies depending on Cut but um I yeah I eat as nature intended uh and you know as Dr chafee says that it is goal dependent if you look into to lose weight for you know a specific reason then you know I gravitate into lowering the dietary fat ever so slightly but you know just remember the fat is essential um you know we need fat it's essential for life we need Saturday fats and cholesterol cholesterol uh is imperative for life is essential for cell formation cell communication nutrient absorption neutral Transportation the production of hormones is essential for healing and we cannot live without uh you know the saturated fats and other fats that we find in in Meats um so don't avoid the fats which if unless you have another question you wanted to jump on uh Steve I'd like to jump on to some of the fears uh and run these by Anthony really quickly you know in regards to beginning a ketogenic or Carnival lifestyle I mean some of the fears that the crop up uh you know what about the saturated fats you know and its effect on my cholesterol um you know what about the the lack of grains and fiber within the diet and um should I be consuming these seed oils to help lower my cholesterol level and what about meat causing cancer these are all the fears that I get um thrown at me on a daily basis now no we're all well versed in in the answers to these uh but I think given you know that we've got uh you know in my opinion number one in the world in in the carnival a song um no less tap into his knowledge what would your answers be in regards to these these fears um you know cholesterol I think is the biggest one and within the community I mean we know that you know it's laughable but for anybody new this is the biggest the biggest fear wasn't it yeah it is yeah no absolutely and you know it's like do you want to you know you know take a bunch of seed oils and linoleic acid and you know all these sorts of things you know because seed oils are very high in linoleic acids that's what you're getting but you get the you want to see some unsaturated fat and replace the saturated fats with that to help your heart well there's a randomized controlled trial um you know with thousands of people or they did just that they they you know supplanted the saturated fat with um polyunsaturated fats and you know which are predominantly from seed oils and those are predominantly linoleic acid and it did indeed lower LDL cholesterol and it did indeed uh kill more people uh more people died of heart attacks and strokes and had had more cardiovascular events in in the treatment group where they they gave them a bunch of unsaturated fat and lowered their LDL so no that's not what you want to do you definitely don't want to do that saturated fat is not and has never been a risk factor for any disease let alone heart disease the Journal of the American College of Cardiology actually published that position statement in uh 2020 and they they published a large literature review where they looked at all the the best available evidence the randomized controlled trials the meta-analyzes all the highest level uh highest tiers of evidence and they found that there was no association between increased saturated fat intake and heart disease none did not do it right and so um in fact they found an inverse relationship between saturated fat consumption and uh stroke so if you eat more saturated fat you have a lower risk of of getting a stroke and if you eat less saturated fat you have a higher risk of getting a stroke there was just a recent one off who I really wish I remembered the author's name um just just just published this thing recently anyway it was it was a it was a um an opinion paper but you know published in uh in a large in a large paper I want to say bmj I'll look it up but um anyway so he was talking about how this is this is basically the the new sort of guidelines on on saturated fat and what to eat uh are basically all they are is is to promote uh pharmaceutical sales that's really all it is and it is not actually to to help and benefit health and he was just saying that this this is actually ridiculous you know that we're vilifying saturated fat and cholesterol I mean the like the jury's out at this point I mean the decision has come back this stuff is not a problem this does not cause harm and uh and you know now they're saying that 50 of people over the age of 40 should be on a stat and why bet the Statin companies are saying that 50 of people should be on a Statin I have no doubt in my mind that they feel very strongly about that um well I feel very strongly uh in the opposite direction that you shouldn't need a whole bunch of medications uh to be healthy you know in fact uh that that is that is antithetical to life on Earth life on Earth is is healthy and robust and mean and dominant and we are the most dominant species that's ever existed now we can dominate because we've got a foothold right and we have all this technology and you know we're not you know we're not going to go anywhere unless we we blow ourselves up but it took you know some hard yards to get to where we are right so you know that's um you know and why is that was that because we're all just fat sick and diabetic and dying of cancer and had all this heart disease that you know at early ages because well we just didn't have the miracle of statins 30 000 years ago and so just you know everyone was just in pieces and just you know you know having you know just rotting colons and and things like that and just Cancer all over this is just nonsense it's absolute nonsense cancer is a disease of civilization period it does not exist in in the you know in the um uh you know more more you know primitive tribes and things like that where they don't eat all this crap that we eat in fact the Homer stefansen who wrote the fat of the land lived with the Inuits for 12 years a professor at Harvard um you know he actually uh wrote many books one of them was called just that cancer is a disease of of civilization I think it's called and you just argue hey this this doesn't happen if you just eat real if you just eat real food you're not eating this processed crap you're not eating a bunch of plants just eat meat fat fat and meat you know that's what you need to eat and and we're and we're seeing this with Otto warburg's work you know Nobel Prize winner in cancer research and you just said hey this is a mitochondrial disease this is this is dysfunction of the mitochondria Professor Thomas Seafood from Boston College has followed up his work and added to that work and showed that yes indeed this is exactly what that is and you can you can improve your mitochondrial function by eating meat and not eating carbohydrates and being on a ketogenic diet right and so you know it's um it's literally the opposite of everything they've been telling us and you know that already you don't need a study to tell you that why because we've been getting these stupid guidelines since the night since 1977 they were saying you know Fat's bad Meats bad cholesterol is bad stop eating all of that crap and we've reduced that increased fruits and vegetables everyone's gotten fatter and sicker the more we listen to these [\u00a0__\u00a0] the worse we get and then you have millions of people around the world that are pulling back and being like nope not doing that crap and they're going carnivore they're going keto and uh and they're getting healthy and they're like oh better not do that oh my God you better watch out yeah I bet you know because that's gonna that's gonna affect people's bottom lines and you really don't want to piss people off you know you mess with their money that's the best way to piss them off um no it is just ridiculous you know you get you improve all your markers you drop your you know your CRP goes down you're you're not anemic anymore your blood markers all improve um you know B12 goes up your magnesium and zinc go up your testosterone is going up your your growth hormone was going up um you know your your HBO and C is going down to normally fasting insulin is normal all these markers are improving your your antibodies for your Auto disease have gone away and they're saying you better stop that oh that's dangerous like yeah you're out of your mind like what what did you just see you just saw someone improve their health dramatically in ways that that doctors most doctors will tell you cannot happen you know I I had people try to try to um you know thread to like the you know um you know report me because I was talking I was showing people studies peer-reviewed studies in the peer-reviewed you know literature randomized controlled trials Interventional trials um you know a whole bunch of different different sorts of studies and trials uh on different on different diseases and just like these these can be dramatically affected there are thousands of studies on ketogenic diets now and it's very very very strong very high level evidence and uh you know buy fat meat based um ketogenic diets and people are improving and they're getting better and they're reversing diseases that people say cannot be reversed and yet we've been reversing them for 100 years with dietary interventions namely a carnivore diet so Dr Salisbury in the 1800s was curing rheumatoid arthritis tuberculosis gout Crohn's Lyme disease reversing these things and fixing people by putting them on a pure red meat and water diet because you notice this long before processed foods were around he knows that people are just eating more plants and Grains were getting diseases other people simply weren't especially like with the Native Americans in the 1800s they were the healthiest population on Earth they were also the tallest population on Earth and they were routinely living to be 115 120 years old routinely by their own records and so people discount that I don't and um and Salisbury didn't either he found these these people were healthy as hell and when you were putting people on their diet which is just red meat and water they were just doing Buffalo drops and just scaring Buffalo over the cliff and they were eating that for the rest of the year and um you know that people were improving dramatically and people kept doing this this was this was uh you know said in different different circles it was the first fad diet people follow this for decades it was very very popular for a lot of people it got a lot of people very very healthy then you have the you know the the artificial food companies like Kellogg's one of the first uh pushing the seven dead Juventus narrative that plant-based eating is is more holy because meat causes lustful feelings and lust is a sin and therefore meat is a sin and you have to stop eating that is the honest to God origin of Kellogg's cereal they tried to suppress people's hormones and health so that they didn't want to have sex as much that's insane that is someone who is crazy and is trying to force his will on other people and their their mission statement is still out there that's what they're still putting out this toxic crap in order to make people less healthy so that they don't jack off like I swear to God that is what Dr Kellogg was all about and that's why he you know he pushed all this stuff and The Seventh-Day Adventist Church you know pushed all this stuff as well and they're still pushing it and they run the nutritional curriculum they they have they have people everywhere on every board Walter Willett from Harvard he's like they're the main sort of nutritional researcher there he's The Seventh-Day Adventist vegan I wonder what kind of studies he's going to come out with but you know even then there was a hundred years post Salisbury where there was studies and papers and experiments and books dozens of books by dozens of different doctors and researchers you know Funston villheimer stefanson and then but many others as as recently as 1975 there's a book by Dr volklund and he was a he was a gastroenterologist and he wrote a book called the Stone Age diet and he basically argued that humans are carnivores here's the evidence for that you know he was your apex predators we have been for millions of years like that's a fact and apex predators don't eat a bunch they don't graze they don't eat salads they just they eat meat that's the definition of the term right is it apex predator you eat all the things below you on the on the food chain which is everything if you're at the Apex right and so you know he he wrote that he argued that basically you know all the diseases that he treats in gastroenterology don't need to exist if you don't eat plants basically if you just eat meat you don't eat plants you don't need him as a profession you don't need gastroenterology as a profession you don't need most Medical Specialties at all and you know and I fully agree with that and I want to get back to that state where people are much more healthy the cancer thing that's just garbage you know that the who in 2015 came out and said that processed meat is uh is a you know likely carcinogen or you know is is a carcinogen but low level and say oh yes there's a class one carcinogen but they put a ranking number of relative risk factor next to it I think it was six and they said oh it's the same category as cigarettes and plutonium oh my god well first of all are cigarettes the same as plutonium idiot then why are you not seeing that right why are you not seeing that this category is a broad category right it has it has a wide range of of what is is carcinogen or not they're like oh my God you know uh processed Meats the same as cigarettes and plutonium well that means that cigarettes are the same as plutonium and no one in the right mind is saying that right and so you know the the relative risk factor you know next to processed meat was six the relative risk factor next to um uh cigarettes something at 340 000 right not the same and then the the risk factor next to plutoniums 8.6 million right okay so this is not the same these are not the same things anyone who suggests they are are it is a a fraud and is someone who's trying to sell you something and convince you something is ideologically driven um and also what are process meets processed with it's not other meat it's plants it's sugar it's seed oils it's you know artificial ingredients and all that sort of garbage you know so that's not the meat's fault there's nothing inherent in meat that's a problem and even the who said well red meat is a probable carcinogen name one thing in meat that has ever been shown to even even you know to increase risk of of cancer and there's all these these these theoreticals it's just like no you have not proved anything um and so you know the the you know and then the main thing with that is is that that panel that was a panel decision that wasn't like all the best scientists in the world this is a bureaucratic decision um and uh the administrators at the who just decided this there were other people on that panel and there are other people that completely disagreed with that decision to classify these things in that manner and they said that this this was this was a fraud that this was [\u00a0__\u00a0] um one of them I can't of the man's name but he said that this was it was the most painful thing he's ever had to experience in his professional career because he saw people um you know purposefully throw out very high level pieces of evidence so there's this hierarchy of evidence right so there's meta you know uh you know run my control trial and then meta-analyzes of randomized control trial you can have meta-analyzes of epidemiological garbage and that's garbage in garbage out so that's not useful but randomized control trial trials like well designed randomized controlled trials with a lot of large populations and then meta-analyzes of those that's that's the highest level so they had these things and they had high level evidence and they threw those out because they said that yeah no there's absolutely no relationship between you know meat consumption and and uh cancer risk absolutely not and so they threw those out because they went against their narrative and they kept in studies that they kept in studies that were very weak very poor epidemiological studies that were absolutely garbage horribly horribly done in design you know the things that they they said that um uh they said oh when you eat less meat and you eat more fruits and vegetables uh that you know cancer rate goes down and not even that much you know I mean like a very very very small fractional reduction in risk and uh to the point that it's just like it's not it's not statistically significant when you're talking about epidemiological studies that have so many confounding factors one of those confounding factors which was actually intentional was that they lumped in processed foods with meat because sometimes there are there's meat in the ingredients of processed food therefore because Pizza has sometimes has toppings that are meat therefore Pizza is meat and so you reduce the amount of pizza you eat you're a reducing amount of meat you eat oh when you reduce meat people get better oh no wonder I'm I'm sure they do and then you know fast food you know I'm going to McDonald's you know how often you go and get it you know the Quarter Pounder meal or whatever you know and then you have to first of all remember that this is like a survey of the last year of eating I'm like who in any way is going to be able to answer that accurately right me I steak that's everyday steak right but you know the the McDonald's thing is like they're saying well that counts as meat because of that burger and that's what people say they're oh my God you're eating that fast food with all that meat and fat in it like no dude like that's the that's only like 10 of the meal you know Tim and certainly like 10 of the calories maybe even less because you're getting all the you know the buns and the sugary sauces all the different you know plants and vegetables and tomatoes that are on there uh but then you're getting you know potatoes deep fried in there used to be trans fats you know now it's seed oils which is you know nearly as bad and uh and then you know a giant drink with a bunch of sugar or a bunch of noxious chemicals that kind of taste sweet but really just tastes like noxious chemicals and uh what the hell is that doing for you that's going to be awful and you're calling that meat so I mean that's a fraud you know these people are frauds I mean they should be they should lose all licenses that that have been provided to them they should be sued into Extinction and they should go to jail you know because they're absolute criminals there are there purposefully doing this and it is affecting hundreds of millions and billions of people's lives this is absolute [\u00a0__\u00a0] and um you know especially at the who so you know the the people that dissented you have reported this and be like this is what happened this is [\u00a0__\u00a0] and uh and they said because the guys who were were pushing for this the guys and and you know ladies and gentlemen who are doing this fraud and perpetrating this fraud on the world um guess what vegans vegetarians and Seventh-Day Adventists all of them right or the majority of them or at least people that had serious industry ties as well because you know Kellogg's pays for a lot of research Coca-Cola pays for 11 times the amount of research on nutrition than the NIH does and nestling and Pepsi and Kellogg's and The Seventh-Day Adventists and sanitarium here in Australia which are owned by The Seventh-Day Adventist they get tax-exempt status because they're owned by The Seventh-Day Adventist it's a church sort of organization um you know they all they all pump out billions of dollars in research money in nutrition to push their product their absolute poison on people is like if you know Esco you know Pablo Escobar was allowed to put out you know research on how great cocaine is you know like he'd do it you know and Coca-Cola is doing it right um and so that was a fraud the University of Washington in Seattle um last year published a massive study looking at all the literature available literature looked at hundreds of studies um you know talking about how meat is bad and meat causes cancer or the extremely low increased risk of of colorectal cancer um and uh they found it and they they you know said that these were extremely weak lazy studies very poor science very poorly designed extremely bad studies and that there's actually no evidence that meat and especially unprocessed red meat has confers any risk of cancer or any other disease so this is this is a fraud and and I I think that people should start there they should start by investigating the fraud they should investigate um and look at the fact um that uh that this is an absolute con and and crime against humanity you can go to uh YouTube you can find a lot of people that talk about this I think some of the best uh reporting on this is my uh lady named Belinda fettke who's from Tasmania who's married to Gary fecky he's a great guy and and you know he's done a lot of talks in low carb space got into a lot of trouble because he was suggesting to his patients were actually helping his patients Get Better by suggesting low carb and the dietitians said like you're not allowed to do that and they they try to get his license taken away and thankfully they weren't able to but um you know this is this is how crazy this is you know you try to as a doctor you try to help your patients and you try to get them better um and uh by doing by doing things that go against uh the purse strings and and they and they try to crucify you for it you know and that's because you know these people are in control and so we need we as the people you know as the base need to understand this and to just be like absolutely not because they only have they only they only profit if we buy their crap right they make no money if we do not give them money so we need to make sure people know that they should not give them any money and and get them to actually do something that benefits people as opposed to you know trying to knock them down so people should go to YouTube and look up Belinda fatkey and look up her talks on uh nutrition I think it's called nutrition uh nutritional science how did we get here um and she has a number of talks on there watch all of them you know I'll give a bit of different information but um you know they that it's it's very interesting and you you look in there and you go like oh my God this is this is corrupt to the teeth and it has been for a hundred and fifty years and um you know you then you you'll never look at nutrition again the same way you'll never look at nutritional sizes the same way you'll never look at these studies the same way because the majority of them are put out by the by the sugar companies and the food companies the majority the vast majority and the other ones are pretty suspect too because they're probably funded by them or the people involved with them have industry ties kind of been paid off or on boards here and there um you know at different times so you know it is it is intensely corrupt and um and you just have to understand the facts and this is why you know people say well you should never uh well you know the problem is is that doctors aren't taught nutrition in medical school thank God they're not taught nutrition in medical school because it's going to be coming from the same people The Seventh-Day Adventist Church sets the curriculum they wrote the first textbook on University of nutrition in 1925 it's it's it's still in print it's current edition it's still being taught Sally uh Sally Norton that was her textbook at Cornell University when she was getting her her undergrad Masters in nutrition from Cornell right so this is it is still corrupt there's still completely controlled these are the Puppet Masters they're the man behind the curtain they are in charge and they are not telling you about it so they're not on the Forefront like we are talking about this they are 19 steps removed they're pulling all the strings you know Kellogg's is one of the largest uh companies in the world it's one of those if you see a pie charts of those companies that own everything like Coca-Cola Pepsi Nestle Kellogg is one of them and they are in insanely wealthy and extremely entrenched in every institution they have people everywhere and so does the The Seventh-Day Adventist Church who work hand in hand with Kellogg's and Coca-Cola and Nestle and all the rest as well so understanding that and understanding just how corrupt the system is um is is armor it's it's armor against the assault and I encourage everyone to to do that and look into that that's a that's a great answer can I try a screen share for people that are a little bit um maybe on the on the fence is that all right with you Anthony just I want to show you something yeah cool right here we go so here is something um here's a study let's add it to the stream okay right there's the study and I was reading this the other day like this you can go down to the list of authors okay and you see this High details it was hidden naturally now that study without clicking on that is quite convincing for people and I've actually seen this quoted quite a few times when we talk about skipping breakfast I'm not recommending skipping breakfast I'm just saying this is what it was talking about and this study's conclusion was well you know you could put in the comments what do you reckon if it's funded by Kellogg's what do you think the thing was for a recommendation uh when it came to breakfast well obviously it was don't skip breakfast eat some cornflakes yeah it really is as blunt as that um too Dr Kellogg came up with that that idea back in the late 1800s he said breakfast is the most important meal of the day you have to start off strong and eat Kellogg's Corn Flakes that's the most important thing the most important way to start the day that's where they came from people often didn't eat breakfast back then they'd they were like us you know they they ate actual nutrition and they they would eat later in the day they'd wake up they'd get going oh no breakfast the most important meal of the day oh you got to eat it but you got to eat my thing you know and uh it's absolutely absolute garbage yeah I agree while we're on the sharing side Stephen can I can I share this end yeah um I mean one of the things just to explain to people watching the live stream is we've never done a live stream for 24 hours with more than two people uh with lots of outside stuff so if it's a little bit clunky at the moment I do apologize and by this time tomorrow morning I'll be touched up in bed thinking whoa we managed it so yeah share your screen if I've set this thing up can I am I the only one that can share it or can you share it so I can I've just clicked on a share screen it says that I'm sharing this and I don't know if you need to click on the relative screen um this is I believe one of the studies that you were mentioning about the cholesterol so this is the study on the BMG the covers 68 000 participants and this was to investigate the relationship between high ldm and all cause mortality and as Dr chippy says the results showed an inverse Association representing 92 percent of the participants in other words the lower your LDL the higher your risk of death This is a study on the bmj this is a massive study uh this is no coincidence uh cholesterol is is essential and I just really quickly share something else which is this is one of the presentations that that's available on on my uh YouTube channel but this is a statement uh which was released in 2015 by the Deidre uh advisory uh guidelines committee uh in association with American Heart Association and they deemed on their website in 2015 the cholesterol is not a nutrient of concern for over consumption so the people that have been telling us for the last 50 years the cholesterol is detrimental to our health I've released this on their website it's it's difficult to find but it is on there so this is from the horse's mouth that um cholesterol is not a nutrient of concern for over consumption uh and cracking presentation just goes on for uh pages and pages I think this is condensed into a 15 minutes about how important um uh cholesterol is uh for life but uh but yeah there it is there's two pieces of evidence there uh and quickly coming back to another point that uh Dr Chaffey mentioned in regards to statins um statins lower cholesterol by blocking something called them a validate pathway the mavalanid pathway is is partly used for the production of DNA um so when you were taking start-ins you were preventing your body from producing DNA which is never a good thing so statins and obviously I can't give medical advice uh but in my opinion we should not be consuming something that's preventing the body from creating DNA um yeah and a few other points that I wanted to touch base on there as well I mean we touched base on on the cancer side you know I I had a message I don't know if if she's listening today but a fair or phc Ambassador who is vegetarian um and they are looking at basically uh you know the effect of food on mental health she's a vegetarian um which you know actually she states goes against all the advice of the phc which you know which we are ambassadors for um but she says a lot there's lots of evidence which show that um a normal meat diet for cancer as it's acidic is a good protocol for cancer and for anxiety and depression um but I'll just put my two parents in and then you know I let um Dr Chaffee jump on board with that but in regards to anxiety and depression again this comes back to the capricola transmit does um you know we need uh certain uh co-factors like iron vitamin B12 zinc uh magnesium amongst others and when we consume vegetables we block a lot of these cold factors which prevents the body from creating these neurotransmitters which leads to things like anxiety and depression which is why I used to suffer severely I believe with anxiety and depression now that I'm plant free my depression and anxiety I've completely gone away um now I did as I say in the early days of being keto I was consuming lots of vegetables um you know I was following the Dr Berg protocol um you know I was consuming stupid amounts of vegetables per day um I still suffered yes I was healthier but I still suffered with anxiety and depression it's only since I removed them completely so we need to look at the neurotransmitter synthesis the Capricorn neurotransmitter synthesis and regards to the nutrients that we consume that are blocking the absorption of cofactors allowing us to process these neurotransmitters so I don't believe that you know being and I'm not against the vegan or vegetarian I work with vegans and vegetarians I respect anybody's dietary choices uh but I do believe that they are misinformed I think that the information that is out there is misinformed um and I don't believe that consuming vegetables is the best way being a vegetarian lacks within B12 vitamin B12 is essential for methylation um it's essential for you know the category monergic neurotransmitter synthesis and all of these things will lead to depression and anxiety and then in regards to cancers you know as Dr Chaffey has stated many times you know plants are trying to kill us um plants contain known hostages every plant you know in the supermarket contains stupid amounts of of cancer causing chemicals um I've worked so successfully with two cancer patients on a Carnival based diet uh all cancer cells who will buy glucose uh and glutamine uh but glucose predominantly cancer cells are metabolically inflexible they cannot be fewer by ketones uh to me it doesn't make sense to consume vegetables to combat cancer one because of the glucose Continental carbohydrate and two because of the other uh the copious amounts of of known carcinogens Within These plants um though there is an argument you know when we look at things like sulfur pain Dr Chief You Know cover this in an earlier podcast that um broccoli contains sulfur pain which is used in the treatment for cancers um so broccoli sprouts you know are used successfully in the treatment um but I do believe that this is a conjunction with being ketogenic um and and I believe that it's it's predominantly being ketogenic over the consumption of you know this this sulfur pain that's uh that's leading to that but sulfur pain uh is gonna cause uh cancer I believe in in a situation in high quantities if we do not have cancer why would you take a chemotherapy pill if you do not have cancer but these are some of the questions that um I won't mention the person's name but I don't know if she's listening I have Pastor a link but basically you know long story short um you know she's a big believer in in the vegan and vegetarian movement in in regards to helping fight um anxiety depression and and cancer um you know as I just explained I think it's the opposite uh what's what's your opinion Dr JP yeah well I think everything is is always compared to what right so you know if you're if you're comparing uh someone eating a you know a processed food diet with a bunch of processed carbs and sugar and Seed oils all from Plants by the way and going to more Whole Food uh plant-based approach you know that that can confer benefits right but is it because you're dropping meters because you're dropping the the rampant amount of omega-6s seed oils um uh you know processed sugars and carbs you know like you're changing more than one variable there um you know so if you're paying like that that stuff is absolutely toxic and people say oh well there's all these benefits of it well maybe in certain circumstances at certain doses but you know a you're not necessarily just getting that in you know with the broccoli or whatever you're getting all this other stuff with it as well you know what are those things doing for you they're all positive for you as well um you know eating a certain amount of broccolios that help or whatever again you know what comparing uh to what you know what what where were you coming from before that now you're you're eating more broccoli you're more self-conscious you're not smoking you're not drinking you're not staying out late you're exercising you're more Health focused there's a healthy user bias as well um so there's a lot of different things that go in there um you know and so you know if you're if you are going away from alcohol and drugs and um you know uh and eating more clean and just being more health conscious that's going to help your mental health significantly um but you know we also see people with you know clinically proven we're going on a ketogenic diet help their mental mental health even even curing schizophrenia right that's that's not because they're they're eating more vegetables it's because they're eating less carbs and eating less uh sugar and alcohol and things like that um and and in fact I've seen people improve even better when they get rid of all the plants as well there's some sort of um you know factor that is going to be in these plants that that are going to act as a you know a neurotoxin just like the caffeine will whether or not they have carbohydrates you know they're not going to be good uh for your brain and um you know and then people have serious problems Jordan Peterson was one of these he went keto just eating you know steaks and salads and it cured a lot of his issues but he still had the depression anxiety Then he dropped the salads in three weeks his depression anxiety were gone I've seen that happen a number of times and so you know you can have people well wow this person goes plant-based and they improve great from where from what starting point to where they are now you know you have to look at all the different factors that that are in there and then also you know you have to you have to say Okay so that that improved from there but then why are people improving when they only eat meat right you're saying you're eating less meat and you get better I'm saying you only eat meat and you get way better and in fact mine is clinically proven at Harvard right where's yours where are your studies where are your randomized controlled trials with human subjects they don't exist and so people are saying that like wow this helps people going to a vegetarian diet what and that's something I get all the time it's just like well if uh plants are so bad for you why is it that so many people are are curing their cancer and curing their diseases by going vegan or vegetarian well first of all are they is that clinically proven have there actually been randomized controlled trials or at least Interventional trials where they they've changed that one variable and actually have better outcomes where these you know people individuals that have had a good outcome but are also on doing standard of care getting chemo and radiation and they went vegetarian at the same time well which one did it was it going vegetarian or was it the chemo and the radiation you know chemo radiation actually do work for people you know depending on the cancer it can be it can work extremely well there are there are some cancers that we can absolutely cure with chemo and radiation and surgery and a combination of all three so you know has may have nothing to do with what you did maybe it actually would have been better if you hadn't done that but again where did you come from were you eating a whole bunch of processed garbage every time I talked to people and they say well actually improved I went I went uh vegetarian I went plant-based I went vegan and I just got so much better my health got so much better and I said okay was the only thing you changed uh that you stopped eating me oh yeah as soon as I went vegan I got better no no so that's in the name so they think vegan no meat I got better when I went vegan when I said I'm a vegan right but what did you actually do when you went vegan I said okay so so you still eat cake and and drink alcohol and you know smoke cigarettes and drink sodas and do all these sorts of oh no no no I don't do any of that I don't eat out anymore I don't go to restaurants I eat all at home it's all Whole Foods no processed carbs I cut out sugar I don't drink sodas I stopped drinking alcohol I don't smoke anymore like okay okay so you've you've changed on 9 000 things in your life all of which were plant-based you know except like when so you you threw out the baby with the bathwater okay you get improvements I'm really glad to hear that you've made very positive moves in your life you know but I think that getting rid of meat was not one of those positive moves because I see people and I have people uh who are my patients that I that I track their bloods I track their numbers and they clinically and objectively improve and reverse very serious diseases by going on an only meat diet so where you know where's where's the Common Ground the common ground is that you're eliminating a lot of bad things you know and um you know if you're eating plants stuff like that you're not going to be as good as if you're only eating meat but you are going to improve from the processed food diet but you know Oreo cookies are vegan so so is heroin right so you know is that gonna is that gonna help people going on an Oreo cookie and and uh heroin diet is that is that you is your plant-based friend going to recommend that diet well it's plant-based there's no meat and the only bad thing on earth is meat so therefore uh Oreo cookies and heroin should be great they're plant-based they're vegan right so no obviously that's insane there are a lot of bad things in this world right and uh the majority of them come from plants right because that's plants make them they make them on purpose to stop you from eating them and so you know the the idea that you can only you know because someone has gotten better on a vegetarian diet therefore vegetarianism is good I mean that's a that's you know a fallacious uh at the start but uh it's also not paying attention you know because there are other people that are improving just as much if not more in fact more uh when they're just eating meat when they're doing the exact opposite you know so that's what people don't understand is that it's the processed foods that that they're getting rid of that that's making the marked improvement and those processed foods are plants those are plant-based processed foods you know and that's what's causing harm this this food that is not food and I would argue that plants are not food for our species because food is very species specific and animals in the wild eat very specific things but you cannot say that these processed foods are food because they didn't even exist a hundred years ago some of them didn't even exist yesterday you know so it's uh you cannot call this stuff food the stuff is not food it is just highly processed garbage that can provide some nutrition some nutrients but that does not make it food you can get nutrients like that you need you know like minerals and and uh you know like iron and zinc and copper and magnesium uh from eating dirt right that doesn't make us dirtivores right you can get calories which you have to have you know from from drinking Coca-Cola so she was eating dirt drinking Coke and taking a multivitamin is that is that just good enough you know is that is that food you know I mean like honestly that would be better than some of the crap people are eating now you know and so you know it's a bit it's a bit and it's all vegan you know dirt and Coca-Cola diet that's vegan right so it must be good for you so obviously that's that's not the case it's a bit silly but it's a bit of a silly argument that you just stop eating meat and your life improves so much okay well what the hell does that mean that could mean anything you know like a like a vegan diet just means lack of meat but what what is the positive you're talking about the negative is is defined by its negative which is not eating meat but what's the positive what what the hell are you supposed to eat you know because you can eat fast food all day and be vegan right good luck with that yeah it's a that's such a great answer um and I think people forget about the healthy user bias I have never had anyone come to me and say I'm going to do one thing for my health today because when you start thinking about your health you realize there are so many things that you you can change and and I've just never met any if anyone goes vegan first thing is well they're trying their best aren't they they're thinking about their health but I bet your bottom dollar they might start running they might start like say stop smoking so um just want to get into the Super chats now we're not doing this is not a fundraiser it's not a money raising thing people have been very kind to donate um I think there's quite a few on your channel Anthony have and I think it'd just be nice to just whistle through some of those questions because they've been very kind to do that is that okay with you yeah yeah so uh Uncle jonga so we're gonna have some great names coming up Dr Chaffey how do you manage to stay at your current weight when you've said you often eat omad so I'm assuming they think how do you keep your muscle because it's something I imagine and would you share details of your workouts please thank you yeah so I I've answered some of these in in the chats just to make sure that people were sort of getting them but um yeah so um for that you know I mean there's not really nothing wrong with doing all that you know so I mean that that's that's how much I need to eat you know remember if you're eating high density nutrition you don't need to eat as much or as often and so I find that if I'm if I'm just having a normal day sedentary day where i'm just you know working on the computer or at the hospital or seeing patients I'm you know I don't need to I don't need to eat all that much you know so I well I still eat a lot I still eat like you know two pounds of ribeye you know which is you know scares some people and other people who are in the space going like oh my God is that all you eat you know and so anything else different for everyone but when I'm working out when I'm able to work out when I have time to uh that will that will double that will easily double I'll be doing you know you know four pounds of a fatty ribeye a day if it's more lean it's going to be more than that um so that so that goes out but you know the that's the the wonderful thing about carnivore is that you you don't you never get out of shape this this is out me out of shape this is where I'm at out of shape because I work out maybe once a month at this point and I just haven't had time and now I you know I need to sort of I need to make time and I need to get back into the routine right now I'm not in the routine I work out like once a month and so this is this is what it looks like for me when I really don't work out right so I never get out of shape I can get in a lot better shape and when I work out consistently I get much more muscular much more lean and I feel much better too so I like that I like working out um and again but I never get worse than this it never gets worse than this right which is kind of nice you know but then that's just eating intuitively just eating as much as or as little as your body is telling you to eat when I am working out uh I like to be consistent I like to work out like at least four days a week Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday that was my old schedule when I was playing rugby so I'd have my Rugby skip my Rugby games and practices on top of that that was just my lifting schedule so I've sort of continued on with that and then you know obviously that's not not always enough for me so when I have time I try to add in extra workouts an extra leg day extra Sprint day or like you know Sprint Hills or stairs or something like that on the other days as well and if I'm doing that I you know I feel absolutely amazing and I get very muscular and uh even more lean I usually hover around 10 body fat if I'm not working out I'll easily drop down to six percent body fat without trying just eating you know four pounds of beef a day and just working out you know I'm sure I could lean down more than that if I wanted to but I don't particularly care to I'm not like in a competition or anything like that as long as I've got you know veins popping out of my abs like I think that's why I think that's more than fine and so um so that's what I do so that's my workout routine is uh work out when I can and when I do I hit it hard you know I mean I've been working out since I was a kid and you know I've been working out at a high level since I was 14 years old you know and so I I do push myself very very hard when I do work out so I get a lot out of it and because I'm on Carnivore I get a lot out of that and and so you know I really enjoy that that side of things and so I I get a lot of you know I I do like that but um if you're able to work out then just go four days a week you'll start with that you know Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday set up your workouts for each of those days and and push it hard you know work to exhaustion you're trying to wear yourself out and let your body you know rebuild and regrow you're on a carnivore diet you're going to be able to rebuild them you're going to be able to push yourself a lot harder you're not gonna be able to wear yourself out as nearly as easily and you're going to recover a lot faster you're going to get a lot more out of it and then you just need to eat enough you have to if that's once a day that's fine if it's twice a day it's five is six times a day it doesn't matter just make sure you are getting enough for you and whatever you're doing um and um you know and and that's going to be different for different people most people won't need to eat more than twice a day if they're eating maximally if they're eating to the point of uh of satiety and um even if they're working out a lot so that's what I would suggest people do excellent next uh question we'll rattle through these T Alexander is there a perfect I actually think we've covered this but let's do a quick one is there a perfect fat to protein rate protein ratio you should consume daily yeah yeah really just just you know uh for the individual you know aim for that one to one gram gram for gram and then adjust from there you know depending on if you're working out a lot or you're leaning down or you have a lot of excess body fat or or you're you're very slender and you need to put on weight you might need a different uh amount of fat and protein most people need around a gram of fat and a gram of protein um you know equal equivalent Parts but you know some people need a bit more fat some people need a bit more protein you need enough fat you need enough protein listen to your body listen to your taste signals and just give your body what it needs that's brilliant uh Nick ale will I gain the same amount of muscles doing intermittent fasting 16.8 two meals a day or not fasting and eating breakfast but I gain the same nutrition during the day um that's the question basically yeah I mean I think look if I think you're eating maximally and you're eating to uh satiety and you're eating to the point that that meat stops tasting good um You probably won't need to eat uh multiple times a day I don't think you need to stick in an eating window I don't I think that only applies when you're eating carbohydrates and your insulin is going up and so you know you you get you get the the value of doing that in intermittent fasting or long-term fasting or whatever just just by being on a ketogenic diet which carnivore diet is and so you know but but there might be some some idiosyncrasies with that you know eating like a big bolus of uh was it leucine and then you know getting your your mtor kick and things like that for for a muscle um hypertrophy so you know if you're sort of spacing out smaller meals throughout the day maybe you're not getting that that big mtor hit the way uh Richard was talking about so um you know what would you think on that one Richard all right I moved it myself there yeah completely agree again it um yeah that completely it you know comes back to the point we made earlier isn't it about um uh you know the myth of the the anabolic window um and consuming these nutrients but Lucy Lucine is the key uh and Lucine is found in abundance in in red meats in particular we need around three grams to activate emptor um so typically you know uh any meal that we could soon be Carnival is going to activate uh and tour and allow us to build muscle I think we can um I think we can waste it one way or another through the inventor reset every four hours um but it is incredibly difficult to hit this on a daily basis even with the best oil in the world um you know it's incredibly difficult to activate M4 times due to work and lifestyle um but the key is in the M2 reset no carbs required fat and protein um you know I tend to uh I tend to recommend around one gram of protein per pound uh of body weight for a meal and around uh 0.9 for for a female but I go considerably over this uh I don't think there's any further advantage to building muscle once then it was activated you know you're up a threshold um but I love eating meat I love it so I um you know again I eat until satisfied they're coming back to the point that uh you know Dr Chaffey made about you know the volume of food you know I can eat stupid amounts of food some days and I can go days with eating very little um same situation to Dr Chaffey I came away from competing professionally last May uh so just over a year ago um I'm down three stone in weight but I'm only down two kilograms in lean body mass so in muscle mass which is incredibly interesting because you know I haven't actually lost an old floral muscle I'm training weights less than once a week but I've still you know I've still got the shape my I'm still ripped with abs and veins running down my arms um I was recently uh called um Action Man over He-Man so apparently I used to look like but I'll take action man um but it just goes to show that you know training once a month or once every few weeks when you've built this lean mass and you were consuming highly nutrient dense food your body will maintain the shape if I um I was working away I recently with Phil Taylor uh the x-star player um 16 times world champion we had to support him in a comeback um and uh I went to the gym in in the day first time I trained in in three weeks in the gym uh I wore a vest and I was a little bit Shady walking into the gym initially because I felt sort of I felt almost like a little boy because I'd lost all this weight because I'm used to bodybuilding instead of running and cycling um within five minutes lifting weights everything lumped and bumped everything came back um and and I was quite pleased with the way that it looked in the mirror and I'm hardly doing any training and again you know uh I'm sitting similar to Dr Chief between eight and ten percent body fat from doing very very little so this is heavily weighted towards nutrition uh you can't out train a bad diet bad diet uh nutrition is key um and and I believe truly believe that carnivore uh at least heavily weighted towards animal based uh lifestyle is is the key to this you know you you can train all you want but nutrition is is the number one uh key to this so yeah yeah and I'm just going to put the disclaimer up because we should this is not medical advice we're not giving one-to-one advice this is purely for education and informational purposes so if you've got a very very specific question we can't really do the patient uh doctor sort of relationship it's just giving you some information you can do your own research so LS very kindly donated um father is 72 diabetic on dialysis almost passed away three weeks ago sorry to hear that he's back home now can barely walk his eggs beef the best diet for him what is most optimal for him to do I see him tomorrow uh yeah I know I I think that's 100 the best thing for him and for anyone to do you know regardless of our of our medical conditions and pre in preconditions we're all still human so you know the the best thing for us to eat is is a proper human diet are biologically appropriate species-specific diet where we are biologically and biochemically designed to eat and benefit the most from and eliminating out all those things that harm us that's very very important right and that's that's that's the why on why you don't eat plants right because they they cause harm there are some benefits there are some nutrients that you can get out of them not not as much because a lot of them are not bioavailable and they're or as bioavailable and there are no nutrients that you that are in plants that you have to have that you cannot get from meat but the reverse is the case you there are nutrients you have to have that you can only get from me you cannot get from plants so you know being a diabetic 100 is the clinically proven to reverse diabetes is going on a ketogenic diet especially when you eliminate out seed oils and linoleic acid and things like that and a carnivore diet is the perfect one to do for that because you're getting all the animal fats and proteins and all that sort of stuff you're getting the perfect nutrition and you're eliminating out all the carbs and Seed oils and things like that so that will reverse diabetes type 2 diabetes type 1 diabetes it will perfectly control because you'll get you'll get perfectly controlled blood sugar and you only have to take you know a very you'll take a much much less insulin as a result of that which is very beneficial for a lot of reasons um and then on dialysis dialysis is tough you know your kidneys are not really functioning anymore they may not ever function again you know and uh you know normally here to four we thought that they would never function again that that that's sort of it but I've seen you know anecdotally that I've seen now three people come off of dialysis uh on a carnivore diet it took like from nine months to a year but they actually started making urine again which is insane but what you're doing is you're you're eliminating out a lot of things that are nephrotoxic so they're toxic to the kidneys right like oxalates but many other things are nephrotoxic as well and you're providing actual proper nutrition for your body and people think oh my goodness you know uh you know protein gets broken down into to uh you know ammonia and that it turns into urea and that's that's a problem for clearance out of our of our kidney so that's going to be harder on your kidneys in fact that's that's not the case in in the actual studies that have looked at this they actually find that nope actually more protein equals better kidney function now you don't have any kidney function it may be a bit of a moot point but it's certainly not going to make it worse and um and if you don't have kidney function at all anyway it's definitely not going to make it worse because how can how can you get worse than zero right so um it's going to help in many many many other ways um it will definitely help with the diabetes it can't say it's going to fix the dialysis because you know that's that there's there's such a thing as damage done and people can um you know you can you can permanently damage your organs unfortunately uh but it's certainly not going to hurt him it's certainly not going to hurt them and um you never know I just I've ceased I I never cease to be amazed like I've seen when when I say this before but like when when you start seeing you know people with Huntington's Disease start to improve on a carnivore diet then you're like okay what the hell is going on this is just nuts that's supposed to be like 100 penetrance if you have that Gene you will get that disease period there's nothing you can do you're never going to stop it it doesn't matter it's coming and that's horrible that's a really scary thing to deal with and you know it's just a matter of time and once it gone well you have a little shakeel [\u00a0__\u00a0] is it starting oh my God I got you know you know my as a clock ticking already you know like that's terrifying now people are getting better on that that is nuts that is nuts and then you know again three people getting coming off dialysis you know that that could have been a complete fluke you never know but it's going to be better in a lot of other ways as well certainly not going to hurt and um and it will I think it will help uh in a lot of in a lot of ways so yeah definitely beef and eggs I think he also asked in there um about water uh when you're not making when you're not making urine you know it doesn't matter if you're on carnivore or not you have to you have to limit the amount of water that you drink because it's only coming off with dialysis and you know sweat things like that um so that just whatever Direction there his doctors say on on on how much water to drink it should just stick with that Rich did you want to add anything let me unmute that um no I mean spot on the only thing that I wanted I think Dr Chief he's on said everything in regards to help me coming back to you know watching and seeing Huntington's disease being reversed and things uh you know dementia which we're told is uh you know infrared dream and uh and genetic you know it it's uh dementia is 99.9 um preventable um you know just going off on one really quickly I don't know what under pressure with this but you know Alzheimer's is affected by the glucominergic neurotransmitters um and these need rapid energy from glucose uh and some of the nerve cells can only use glucose for energy uh so because they don't have mitochondria and only mitochondria can use ketones for energy the glucose passes into the brain so the group one transporter and most of the cells use glutes three Transporters both of which are insulin independent meaning they do not need insulin but the hippocampus also uses glute 4 transporter which is into dependent which means the hippocampus requires insulin now the issue with this is in a situation creation of insulin resistance we fled the brain uh the blood-brain body with insulin and over time it causes recessions to downgrade lid I mean the brain can literally be swimming in a sea of glucose unable to utilize it for energy um and this is why dietary intervention is so important too much carbohydrates leads this into resistance uh these oxidative foods high in the united acid cause all of these issues and this is why it is Diet related all of these these illnesses and diseases that we look at and we believe are hereditary and um you know cancers because it runs in my family we eat what our parents eat you know we are um we are uh you know prodigies of our parents and we so you know it's not the case of it's the genetics it's the foods that we eat in and yeah it has been reversed Alzheimer's preventable and and maintainable manageable um the things that I've seen the diet that achieve in Reverse is absolutely incredible but apologies one offer one agai n there but uh that's okay um and the final one on the"

        "body": "n there but uh that's okay um and the final one on the n there but uh that's okay um and the final one on the Super Chat which is Kearney for health what would you suggest for blastocystis uh hominis which is just for people that don't know what that is that's a single cell parasitic thing that grows in your uh digestive tract unless anything wants to put me right uh carnivore for over four years the ibsd over 20 years what would you suggest uh you know unfortunately that's not something that I that I treat so I wouldn't have a great uh answer for that but you know as far as nutrition is concerned keep doing what you're doing with carnivore you could add in some uh you know fermented sort of dairy products you know the live culture uh yogurt you know without any any sugar or anything like that um you know people like you know kefir kefir however you want to pronounce it um but you know I've looked at a lot of uh the products and they have tons of sugars in them so I don't know if they add those back in or or what but they're not supposed to it's supposed to be supposed to be fully fermented out of there um but so don't get those um and I would um yeah I would just eat that way and then you know you need to sort of you know talk to your your doctor and see if you need to be on any sort of um pharmacological treatments as well I don't I don't think that you know you know medicines are always out of bounds it's just you know in specific things I think the vast majority of illnesses we can treat with with diet and diet alone and in fact those are the only treatments for it because it's the diet that's causing them you know so they only you have to you have to address the diet to address the root cause but uh there are other things like you have you know blastocystis hominis where you're uh you know you have you have some little bug that's running around and uh if your body's having trouble clearing it that's that's a time when medications can be very helpful you could I suppose you could look at sort of Nature's antibiotics like maybe Ginger or um garlic apparently uh I'm I'm not great with herbs but that's just I just put that into the mix but yeah uh rich yeah look I mean it's you know we're carnivore uh we preach this way of living where we do not consume any vegetables but less you know medicines come from from Plants uh and I believe that you know that's what they're there for they're there to treat certain things I would be dead now if I am consumed or taken medication at different you know various points in my life so there's a place for it but medication um you know is a tool you know we should not be we we don't consume medication unless we're sick uh if we're sick you know okay take some medication um but look at the root cause let's look at what's causing this problem and uh what's the matter Steve going off on it but uh you know it I'm not a lover of plants but I I think you know as you know Dr chief he says there's um there's definitely a case for for medication as and when but um take it as and when you need it but not it's not preventative you can't use you don't take medication unless you have a problem and if you live this lifestyle it's very likely that you won't have the problem in the first place um you know I can't remember the last time that I've taken medication you know of any kind um yeah Journey when you can't uh you know it's years and years since I've taken medication because I'm not um I'm not becoming sick I don't you know I I don't feel sick I don't get tired anymore it comparatively to carbohydrates um I don't come down with illnesses um it's been a long time since I've got to take any medication for the doctor and just to Circle back to a point that um that Dr Chief in Middle yeah um you know I went to my doctor after reversing my type 2 diabetes um which he couldn't do with medication and said fantastic you've reversed your diabetes but now I recommend you come off this diet as it's going to make you sick and like wait a minute I just reversed my diabetes when you couldn't with medication and now you're telling me to eat the way that I was eating that made me sick in the first place I have not been back to my doctor since and that was 10 11 years ago um and it just baffles me how people who are clearly intelligent can't take a step back look at the bigger picture and realize that the way that we live in um is is healing and and repairing the body and reversing things in ways that they can't do with medication so look I'm not against medication um I just think that uh you know you take medication if you're sick if you live this lifestyle um you'll find that you're not sick very often well I think in the in the most basic way of looking at it bacteria will thrive on what you feed it so if you if you take out what it likes it's going to die off anyway which is which is why we get some improvements isn't it once you get the carbohydrates out a lot of the bacteria are not getting the food they need so I think carnivore does resolve most most issues that I come across where it's gut issues I think the Improvement is huge but things like parasites are a little bit different aren't they um right Warwick what do I do if I'm not producing stomach acid he's using uh HCL and digestive enzymes they don't seem to work yeah well so you know I mean is is this an actual fact that you don't produce stomach acid because I think you'd be the only one you know um and you know you may have you know symptoms that you feel that you're not you're not having as good digestion or maybe you're feeling that you're getting bloated or weird sort of symptoms um you know and that's one thing but you know that doesn't necessarily mean that you're not creating any stomach acid it'd be very difficult for you to be alive right now if you weren't making any stomach acid um because you you need it right you do need this stuff to start uh the initial process of breaking down your food any food and so the the the B10 and HCL um I'm not I mean I've never used that but from my understanding that's like a like a like an herbal supplement sort of thing um and I I don't know if that's is actually very acidic I don't really know I understand some people take that to sort of help them digest and things but I I don't know um and digestive enzymes don't seem to work so I mean the main problem is is not you know so you you sort of diagnosed yourself you say I don't produce stomach acid so how do I fix that but what are your symptoms what are you feeling what is the problem because it could be something else it could be that there's something else that's going on that's causing the symptoms that you're experiencing has nothing to do with stomach acid if you if you do want to maximize your stomach acid and the acidity of your stomach then you need to avoid drinking water but you know around meals so you have to like for two hours before a meal you don't drink any water you don't you don't put anything in your body you don't you don't put anything down your mouth and um and and then you're you're eating and that will concentrate this up so you know if you have you know a half a cup of stomach acid sort of sitting around and you drink eight cups of uh of water you know during the day or four cups of water during the day you're going to dilute that down to a 12th of what it was before and so you're you're going to have a much more dilute um much more dilute stomach acid right so that's not what you want uh you want that stuff to be very potent and very acidic and so you don't want to dilute it and so you know just don't don't drink water for a couple hours before you eat a meal see how you go you know see what that does where you don't drink water during the meal don't drink water for another hour or two after your meal see what that does for you um but again I I don't know what what symptoms you're experiencing and so I don't really know how how much better to help you because um you're taking all these digestive enzymes so obviously you have some sort of digestive issue if you don't have stomach acid um I don't think you'd be here so you know it's like you have to be making stomach acid you know and maybe you're not but uh if you're not then you're not and you just have to sort of deal with that as best you can you still need to eat meat you know meat is what we're designed to eat and it's going to be the most bioavailable it's going to be easiest to break down so you know if you're eating plants you definitely need your stomach acid you need to start you know really really really you know put the chemicals thumb screws to this stuff to try to extract any nutrients out of that crap and so you know you want to um you know you want to eat what's very bioavailable which is which is meat so you know eat meat drink water but don't drink water two hours before after your meals and and see how you go can I just add a little bit there as well and don't forget your mechanical digestion um maybe chew your food more just actually enjoy it a little bit more look at it before you start eating it uh just to get everything flowing a bit just take your time but I think mechanical digestion is is really really underrated you know I know I sound like your your parents now but if you chew your food properly it's going to help a little bit definitely going to help um yeah Rich sorry not fantastic yeah nothing to add with any of that that's fantastic um what are the comments that have popped up on the side door by low carb low drama um Dr Chaffey any link to the debate you have done with the guy who convinced macola long-term Couture this was unhealthy you know Dr Chief you know recorded a little piece with this with me which we haven't released and I think we're going to redo when we um but you you did record one with um um uh Georgie is it Georgie yeah yeah yeah Georgie said yeah so I guess they're looking for a link to that but I I think you and I are still on for recording uh our thing to this which we did prior to this one isn't it but um yeah so they've just asked that question there which I thought I'd just read out now as it uh as it was something you know that we put a lot of effort into wasn't it we did yeah and so you know uh which I thought I thought that was great we did um we addressed sort of all the different points that was made that were made in that in that discussion uh with Mercola and there's there's certainly evidence of the contrary you know one of the main points of evidence of the contrary is that you know I've been doing this for six years and I don't have high cortisol and I don't have abdominal fat and um and and Central adiposity and and visceral fat um you know and so you know and we see this a lot and in fact there are actual studies you know with uh with patients who put on a ketogenic diet and uh one in one study uh after eight weeks their uh cortisol levels actually significantly went down you know and so there's a there's a mix some go up some go down there's one that that followed people for two years it was very long-term study for for ketosis or P1 keto is this safe long term and this followed people for two years and so the argument was like well if you're on if you're on uh keto eventually your cortisol will go up uh high enough that you actually you'll stall your weight loss you won't lose any you won't lose any weight but you know in this study with two uh for people with two for two years follow-up they found that actually they lost a lot of weight and it was statistically significant so they uh statistically statistically significant they lost a statistically significant amount of weight um uh that was significant so they lost a significant amount of weight that was statistically significant Jesus that was harder to say than it should have been and um and uh so you know and their cortisol levels actually hadn't changed you know and and in fact they found that all the symptoms of hypercortisolism were ameliorated right and that's actually something that that shows up you know in study after study after study is that when you are regardless of what your cortisol level is the symptoms and signs of hypercortisolism so having higher than physiologically acceptable levels of cortisol uh they go away you know they get better right and even to this extent that people actually really do have like Cushing's Disease or Cushing oil syndrome or Cushing syndrome Cushing's disease um you know that they are going to need surgery or medical intervention they're put on a ketogenic diet beforehand because this actually helps ameliorate the the effects of hypercortisolism being in ketosis right and so they're put on a ketogenic diet before and after surgical or medical intervention to treat the primary cause so that I mean that's very telling you know um is that you know that people actually get better they they don't have the hyper cortisol problems on ketosis in fact those problems get better um and people wondering about you know well are you going to gain weight well no there's that that study for two years no they didn't gain weight they got lost a lot of weight there's a study looking at kids with epilepsy they're put on a ketogenic diet um because their doctors had some damn sense and they uh you know they were very slender slim kids they're like oh hey you know maybe they're too skinny maybe this isn't this isn't healthy so they came off a ketogenic diet and they found that as soon as they came off they just their weight slammed up right and so they actually gained they gained a significant amount of weight after that and so it's um you know there's there's differences in the literature and so it just depends on the studies that you're looking at and but if you're looking at you know broad range of these you know you'll you'll set definitely find examples of very big you know high level you know very high quality uh studies that actually show actually you know you know this doesn't increase cortisol or if it does it's it's marginal and in fact the but it's not giving the symptoms of high of high cortisol some people think that in fact that that rise in cortisol that you see in some of these studies is is actually good that's that that they were actually below where they should have been physiologically and now this is actually correcting back up to where it should be and people with metabolic syndrome which is a lot of people um you have you have um depressed cortisol levels so you know this is something that I've that people who listen to me know you know that I've spoken about that that that the reference range is in studies or labs and things like that are just garbage because it's just the average for the community so the first two thousand people that come into get lab tests that year that's the reference ranges right because it's the average for your community well you're in you're in that range you're in that good range of what people are at well people are sick you know 92 percent of Americans have at least one metabolic uh issue 70 of Americans are overweight or obese the rest of the world is right there with us all right so some of them are worse um you know as far as as far as obesity concerned America's only number 19 which is way higher than it should be but it's like there's 18 other countries with higher obesity rates in America so people talking about you know just mad trash about how you know fat and obese Americans that there's 18 other ones that are worse right and a lot worse actually I think we're like 42 I think some of the Pacific Islands are like 60 obesity not even overweight and obese but obesity so you know you don't want to measure yourself up against the average person so you know you can have these differences in reference ranges and so you're looking at your cortisol and you're going like oh wow their cortisol um level goes up a bit and oh that's not good it's above the reference range or maybe it's on the high end of that reference range it's like okay well maybe everyone else is too low and maybe that's what that reference range is looking at they're looking at a bunch of sick people with metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome is known to depress uh cortisol below you know sub physiological levels so there's a lot of a lot of sort of um uh you know reasons why that could be but at the end of the day there is no such thing as essential carbohydrate and um you know a number of different um you know uh bodies there was the international Institute of medicine or something like that I'm butchering the name but um you know they they've said that you know there's you know absolutely no such thing as an essential carbohydrate you know the amount of carbohydrates you need throughout your entire life do to be healthy is uh is apparently zero you know because there are you know a number of different uh you know civilizations live right now that don't eat any carbohydrates or maybe just like you know once or a year when when fruits in season for a couple weeks and the rest of you don't eat any or others that don't eat any carbohydrates at all throughout the entire existence generation after generation and with seemingly no uh negative Health outcomes and health ramifications because of this so uh you don't need them you know if you had if you had a whole bunch of hormonal um issues thyroid depression things like that uh the Inuit would be dead all of our ancestors during the Ice Age would be dead uh they would all have been um you know bred out because you get cretanism that's what what hyper uh hype congenital hypocortisolism is is cretanism or sorry congenital hypothyroidism is core is cretanism and that and that is a very serious um birth defect and congenital abnormality where people don't develop properly a very short stature small brains uh you know changes to very specific changes to their facial features and they're quite intellectually impaired and and physically weaker and impaired as well so I mean that that doesn't go too far when you're out there in the the tundra hunting Mammoth and things like that like yeah you're on your game or you're dead and so um that that doesn't make any sense so you know there's a lot for that but you know I actually like that debate it was uh you know George is actually a really nice guy we actually actually see eye to eye on a lot more than that that Mercola interview I think I think is um uh is is you know I I don't I don't think that's I think it's sort of harsher I guess than than what it appeared that he actually you know sort of espoused during our discussion and he was just like actually I'm fine with carnivore uh I just think that you should do it in a very specific way to you know maximize your your health and results and I was like no that's that's fair enough um and you know we we agreed on a lot of things and we differ on a few others but it was very it was very uh collegial I was actually it was a very enjoyable discussion um that's going to be on Brian grins uh podcast so g-r-y-n um and I did I was on his podcast before and uh he hasn't I haven't haven't gotten an email from him uh yet but he was saying he's gonna try to get out next door a couple weeks but I don't think it's out yet so long-winded answer um it's not out yet yeah see Anthony you've been hanging around with Richard too yeah with a bad crowd like I've never been good at that I've I've got a great question Rich if it's okay just one of the submitted ones because I feel people have gone out of their way is that is that okay Rich because I know you've got something there but it might interest you as well as Dr chafee um the question is why would I have tested low info late after more than two years carnivore and eight months of beef beef fat only uh could low folate cause anxiety which I currently suffer and she's got a little bit of context in because Anthony you were asking for a bit more context yeah she's currently stage three bone she currently has statory bone cancer which has been stable for two years I suspect some damage from the CT scan contrast I and I switched to MRI scans so it's basically why is it like why is it low folate um I know a little bit more that that person was told actually she wouldn't be around to be asking this question a year ago so um yeah why would she have tested low folate with eight months beef and beef fat only yeah well look everyone has a bit of you know different demands um you know that their body goes through and you'll have a different sort of metabolism as well who will have the MTH uh FR genes I always look at that I always think it's the mother effigine and um and that's what that's what it is and um but uh that you know impairs your ability to um you know to process folate so so you can you can be getting in dietary folate and it's not really going to be doing as much for you it's just it just sort of impairs that and um uh and that's okay you know I mean actually you know when you're eating regeneratively raised uh you know beef or or wild animals and things like that you know you're gonna have a much higher level of folate so uh for example I saw a regeneratively uh regenerative farmer Rancher um uh who's giving a talk I think at Hillsdale and he was saying that that um that normal chicken eggs in America that's like the USDA puts out that they're they're marked as having 41 milligrams of folate uh per egg right but his eggs have over a thousand milligrams per egg right so you're talking you know 25 30 times the amount of folate in in a chicken that's just fed what the hell it's supposed to eat you know which is not hard to do you know and so you know it's much more nutrient nutritionally dense and so you know from from a you know bang for your buck sort of point of view it's like well it's more expensive to do that it's like yeah but you're you don't need to eat as much because you know it's much more nutriently nutritionally uh packed um same with beef you know there I've spoken to different ranchers they do regeneratively raised uh you know beef um you know grass-fed and finish you know rotating their cows around different pastures and they and they and they're reporting and Publishing their nutritional values are like four or five times in like every micronutrient vitamin and mineral that you care to look at you know even even getting like you know 120 150 milligrams of Vitamin C you know which is like people say oh there's not enough vitamin C like well then then that you know there's there's more than you need there's all more than you need anyway um because you just need four less when you're not eating a bunch of plants but um you know so we're not eating what we're what is perfect for us anymore right so we're not eating you know just wild caught Mammoth which is what we sort of uh you know grew up eating and just wild animals in general so the wild animals are going to be more healthy the regeneratively raised animals are going to be more healthy um some people you know like with those that Gene variation are going to need a bit more folate and if you're not getting that from just a store-bought uh sort of meat and eggs that you're getting you know you probably need to add in some uh liver liver's got a lot of folate um you know most people don't need it most people do just fine with just uh skeletal uh let's go a little meat and fat but um you know it's uh it is much more packed with nutrients and so if you if you find yourself deficient for whatever reason you know fine you know just just eat you know eat some more organs you know eat some more liver or something like that don't go go overboard and go too far in the other end because then you'll get hyper vitaminosis and you get you can get a you know too much vitamins and minerals sort of building up especially the fat soluble vitamins and you know copper and things like that from beef liver and so you know you just just add that back in you it may be that you you have that Gene variation and you just need a bit more folate and just for you know the type of uh meat that you have access to you know it's not enough but you know it could potentially cause some anxiety um you know stranger things have happened generally that's not I don't think that's um I you know I don't know if that's a typical uh side effect of this but there are other ones that are more typical of low folate levels but uh but either way you know you feel like there's something a bit off you have this number that's a bit off you can correct it and see how that goes just add in a bit of liver you know you know sort of have that you know a little bit of that you know a couple ounces a day or a couple ounces you know three times a week check it again in a month and see where you're at and if you have to eat more liver eat more liver if you got to take a folate vitamin take a folate vitamin it's not a big deal rich did you uh want to get back to your questions that you've got for Dr chafee apologies I've got so many I don't I don't think eight minutes I don't think it would be long enough but I mean just just just to add to that as well that you know medications can prevent the absorption and fall it uh overcooking your meats can do so as well so I mean this is why I tend to you know cook my steak rare um and sauce of of uh of nutrients as as Dr Chaffey right besides about the source of eggs it's the same with a source of meats and things so all of these things I'm a big fan of organ Meats uh beef liver in particular fantastic sauce um folate I I did a an interesting podcast recently with um oh my goodness uh Patrick Holford who um is an expert in Alzheimer's uh and these neurotransmitter signals in the brain um you know affect Alzheimer's as well as mood and depression and anxiety and fall it as well as B12 when omega-3 is a big factor um so foreign B12 B6 and fall it break on homocysteine to create other chemicals that the body needs and high homocysteine levels um May mean that you have a vitamin deficiency um so so we need to treat that with you know extra vitamins and minerals and as Dr chief he says that one of the best sources uh is uh animal proteins particularly uh organ Meats I'm a big lover of uh of beef liver um I haven't been able to consume it raw yet but uh I don't know if you've if you if you're a lover and connective tissue as well connective tissue is a thing that a lot of people tend to miss um you know I eat the gristle on the bone and all the stringy bits on the stake and on the bone of things and these are pieces that people cut off which are highly nutrient dense and Fuller collagen and other vitamins and minerals so yeah um yeah there's one thing that I wouldn't mind hitting you with before before you go so it within the keep doing Carnival Community uh recently I noticed there's been a shift over to cycling carbohydrate especially with with females around um Cycles uh particularly to do with the production of progesterone um we're told that we need you know a week before cycle uh to increase carbohydrates to increase uh progesterone the research that I've done has led me to believe that it's not so much the carbohydrates as the case that we just need to be consuming the nutrients and this could be as simple as consuming more nutrients from a carnivore ketogenic lifestyle not typically consuming from carbohydrate and while avoiding fasting uh but you know there are a few influencers who I I highly respect within the community who have posted this a few times lately about cycling carbohydrates for a week before cycling and not fasting they're not fasting I agree with the carbohydrates I can't I can't get my head around that because I just don't understand from an evolutionary perspective men and women were consuming the same Foods I don't understand why a female would be consuming more carbohydrate around certain times of the month and I I believe that's to do with lack of nutrients from just in general as in protein and fat and not you know carbohydrates so we do see an increase in progesterone where we increase carbohydrate but we also see an increase from The increased meats and fat so do you have an opinion on that is it a case of do we need carbohydrate I I think I already know the answer but it's that um you know it's nice to have a certain wall but I you know this is what I advise to to the the female clients I work with eat more a week leading up to your cycle but you do not need cycle carbohydrate what are your thoughts yeah no I I don't I don't think you need to either um you know like you said people were eating the same things you know I mean like your female lions eat the same thing as male lions even during estrus or leading up to estrus and same with every single other animal on Earth um animals eat what animals eat they eat the same thing you know once your weeds um you know from your mother's milk as a mammal you eat what the adults eat basically until you die you know and that's pretty much it and you know the other animals don't they don't they don't sort of eat slightly different the variation variation wise not really you know they you know especially you know predators they hunt they take down the same animal they eat the same animal they all eat it together and you know and cows eat grass you know and quality eucalyptus and um oh and there's a there's a resident expert who was pretty apropos for this question on fertility and whether women should uh cycle uh carbs the week before I don't think they they need to I don't think that it makes any um sense that they would um and you know when were they going to have access to this I mean they can't just go down to See's candy and get a box of chocolates you know as they do now and um you know so especially in a in an ice age or something like that you know you're like you maybe you may want a box of chocolates but guess what you know there aren't any and uh and so what you're eating mammoth you're eating mammoth that's what you're eating that's what I want you well you're eating mammoth all right that's what we have all right and so you know if that didn't work uh for our fertility we wouldn't be here yeah it's almost it's almost written in the stars that Dr Robert kiltz walking capitality so uh can I just sum up Dr Anthony chafee's first three hours that that was fantastic Anthony really appreciate the generosity of your time there um to help us with the kickoff and hand the bat on to a fantastic Dr Robert Kilts here which is great um do you want to give us some final thoughts Anthony when you go off oh gosh no I just I just thank you guys it's been great you know I've been looking forward to this for a while it's sort of a it's it's a very um you know um you know it's it's a big Endeavor that you guys are taking on you know and so uh you know I'm I'm looking forward to it and I think yeah I think it'll be fun for people to see you know you're on hour 22 and 23. you're not going to be drooling you know you know you're gonna be fine you're gonna be gonna be a bit more worse for where uh but you'll be fine you'll still be talking about everything you'll still be happy and kill going you'll still have a ton of energy so uh I'm sure you'll sleep very well after that but um you know you won't need uh you know capping or anything else and so this would be just to show people like wow look at that look what you can do uh when you when you're giving your body what it needs so you know hats off to you guys uh for doing that I'm glad I could help where can people find you yeah um yeah well no thank you for having me on um so you're my my main uh YouTube channel is just Anthony Chaffee MD and that's where I have almost my podcasts and and videos and everything sort of goes up there I have my podcast if you just want to listen to it and that's just Anthony chafee or sorry that's just the plant free MD and then my Instagram is just again Anthony jvmd and you can you can find the rest of my socials all through that but those those are the main ones anyway fantastic which we have two fantastic podcasts on so I I urge you guys to check those out those are fantastic we're coming out soon definitely yeah and I think we've got a few more to record that we saw uh take care my man um yeah we'll touch base soon have a good one thanks again to see you sir oh Dr chafee always amazing to see you great great strength in the story we appreciate what you are doing yeah uh well you're very welcome thank you for what you're doing thank you everyone this is everyone's working very well as a team it's a good good team effort we look forward to seeing you very soon yeah absolutely yeah looking forward to it I've just realized I missed a trick what we should have done is got the person before to inter intro introduce the next person that would have been quite good there you go yeah so we can you sort of roll it down for the rest of them now he's got to come up with an introduction uh for her for whoever is next yeah yeah that's the that's the downside because YouTube guys were on reverse weren't you you know each other I think yeah okay right well uh let's let's get on to Dr Robert Kilts thank you Anthony once again you're welcome good to see you guys have an awesome day yeah thanks you too Kilts would you like to just introduce yourself to the people that don't know you what what you're about what your expertise is well my name is Dr rod kiltz and I'm a fertility specialist I specialize in helping those that are suffering from fertility issues can't get pregnant miscarriages genetic issues uh both uh medical and surgical treatments in vitro fertilization is the main thing I practice I own and run CNY fertility centers which is a large Fertility Center in America but we see uh couples and individuals from all over the globe I fell into the keto carnivore space about 15 years ago I've been focusing mostly on Carnivore for myself but I share both Avenues and health and wellness is something that I think is Paramount to all of us and we've been shared the wrong Story the master of messaging has basically give us the wrong story of who and what we are and that's the cause of our suffering and like the good book that Dr uh Ken Berry's written about the lies my doctor told me realizing that most of us in in Western Madison essentially fed I believe a lot of lies that lead us down the wrong direction we've been taught to treat disease with symptom relief but not getting to the Core foundation of the cause of disease and so my real passion is to get to the core of the cause and help people become their own doctor practitioner and leader of their life instead of wondering and worrying that someone else has to give you numbers and data that may be distracting and completely incorrect so here I am for Tilly doc Upstate New York mostly but all around the country in the world and I'm really grateful that you've invited me here uh Stephen and Richard so thank you have you met Richard before let me do the English thing Robert this is Richard Richard this is Robert Russell nice to meet you awesome pleasure to meet you good we'll have to get you on the podcast um yeah fantastic Stephen and I uh we do a weekly live on a Sunday obviously we both got our own podcast shows obviously you've been on uh Stevens I believe but it's uh yeah fantastic we're trying to spread the word as best we can and really appreciate you coming on so thank you absolute pleasure yeah my pleasure I feel like I already know you Stephen for for a number of years now and again really inspired by what everyone's doing in this community very positive sharing ideas that are radical uh but I think we're seeing tremendous amount of improvement uh in people's Health and Wellness yeah and I think Richard will be right up your street Rob because he is absolutely on it with the science I mean really on it with the science we could have done a 24-hour live stream with just Richard answering one question so let's do a nice broad question for you Mr Kilts uh let's do this um why carnivore why did you you know what drove you to this crazy way of eating a crazy concept that carnivore cures and it really uh so much of life is accidental and and uh for me I I I'm a fertility specialist I actually introduced uh a lot of Eastern medicine into my practice meditation prayer yoga acupuncture massage about 20 years ago and many of my patients were leaving the fertility treatments because it was too stressful so anything we can do to reduce stress was so important uh and then and then many of them were getting pregnant on a diet called paleo and essentially I didn't know much about nutrition because none of us know anything about nutrition I've come to believe but I suffered also from arthritis psoriasis bowel bleeding hemorrhoids kidney stones ADHD OCD uh depression as a child had severe migraines and bowel problems and I was uncorrigible I was uh kicked out of school and again gang couldn't read and my father in jail I throw that out there a little bit because it's like the training grounds of life nothing bad all part of the process but as I begin to learn more about paleo and then keto I met mariach and we we did a lot of things together and still do I learned and questioned the fuel for the Ferrari and and I know as as Richard talks a little bit about uh the fuel is ketones but the fuel ultimately is only fat and we burn fat we don't burn sugar we don't burn proteins and and as I dug deep into the science and realized how wrong we were I went carnivore about 13 years ago when I watched a guy on some video and and the guy said I eat meat I don't exercise and he was ripped and he looked great and felt great and I was like that is the one for me so I was paleo Atkins and paleo and Keto go and and uh and then when I when I found carnivore I was like Wow and I one month all those diseases went away I've never felt better my brain energy and my overall energy is amazing I sleep well and I pretty much stick to uh bacon eggs butter beef and salt occasionally my ice cream I've been off coffee for a year although I've had about five cups in the last uh three months I have a little bit from time to time but this nutritional way of living uh eliminates so many diseases gives you the strength to be the lion and the master of your life instead of being the slave to the story which is basically slaughtering all of us with so many so much sickness and so many of my patients you know they don't do a carnivore all of them any some do some do keto some don't but but you know it's all part of the process my job as a doctor is give people options of treatment and ideas that they might go huh and and many of them so many people I don't even see I never hear from and but I hear stories hey my friend had a baby because they did your diet uh you know they've been suffering for 13 years no pregnancies no children and voila they went carnivore or ketovor and bingo a baby so I think we we need to realize that that our diet is actually the cause of disease and a healthy diet is a labeled word that may not be true so we have to very much watch the words that we use so I use this way of living for myself but for my patients uh my community my family my everyone everyone I run to it's just a broken record it's all I talk about so you know this is our lives yeah and you're very inspirational and uh you know you do a lot do you do a live on Instagram every day 5 a.m Monday through Friday typically eastern time so I get you guys you guys get in a little later that's all good but people maybe you know in between that's a little harder U.S you know the west coast is a little hard but yeah every day I do an Instagram YouTube Facebook and I actually do my mighty tribe everyone's welcome we just talk about positivity and we talk about uh faith we talk about food Faith food and fitness those are the sort of the three pillars of my focus yeah Richard do you want to dive in with the question as you've not met Dr kills before yeah no I love that I mean the holy thoughts uh you know fantastic it's uh and I think the work that you were doing is um yeah it's brilliant it um it just further adds weight doesn't it to uh the fact that you know a conversation of Stephen and I had yesterday in regards to um you know the progression of be getting in a ketogenic journey through low carb then maybe go and do the keto then stand there then clean then become a carnival and the different variations of Carnival and how uh people within the in the community will clamp down on others for maybe not be in Quito or carnivore um but it's a progression and I think you have to work uh with you know the individual uh we're all different uh and this is a convo that we went through yesterday's not the the incremental approach seems to be um you know the most beneficial over time rather than the step change approach where you just get someone to cut out everything uh you know we see benefits from you know Stephen mentioned a client of his who you know is predominantly dirty kid or has lost stupid amounts of weight reversed almost every illness and disease that he suffers from that could only be a positive thing yes he may still can consume foods that we don't agree with but those results are positive and I think we need to you know we need to celebrate that we need to support that but I think what I try to do and I think and Stephen would agree as well you know the two between the two of us we tried to promote the options to people and we try to explain the differences between the lifestyle so you can make an educated decision if you don't want to be carnivore and you would want to go low-carb or keep doing these are the benefits fantastic but the further you go down this Rabbit Hole the more benefits that you're going to see um you know myself included I've been ketogenic for 10 11 years of which I'd class myself as being Carnival for four to five um but even only recently you know have I removed or reduced I should say coffee the same as you uh you know I still consume coffee occasionally uh and we're live for 24 hours I'm sure what I'm going to be consuming a few later on today um you know but it again I understand the damage of that cause is it's not something I consume a lot of and I believe most the damage comes from the acrylamide which is a cumulative so again you spare only you know it's going to seek benefit but that's a long way of coming around to my question apologies I do tend to get kind away so look you know we're told uh to consume certain foods uh you know polyphenols for example um you know curcumin which is found in turmeric uh Resveratrol in berries in tea um nope curcumin and turmeric uh and spinach contain oxalates uh they cause DNA damage hyperoxyloria which leads to hypothyroidism and even autism in children it comes back to damaging you know the end system which is you know something you're um you're a profession so what would you say to people who are you know searching for these uh these foods that contain flavonoids and Resveratrol um but in my experience uh you know flavonoids isoflavones they're digestive Inhibitors they block the absorption of vitamin C they cause a reduction in net protein utilization um they cause uh infertility poor sperm count uh because they are endocrine receptors they block thyroid peroxidase in which we need to make thyroid hormone by activating the 17 B estradiol receptor an increase in estrogen which can lead hypothyroidism and women gynomaster are men and flavonoids you know also increase inflammatory markers like uh if the Lucan one interleukin sex I believe uh tumor of course Alpha because these are things that we are told to consume you know either five or seven fruit of veg a day um yet they are Laden with these what I believe to be toxic chemicals so what would you say to people who were searching for these flavonoids and uh you know and these resveratrols and coercetins and katachins and Etc apologies that's a very long approach to a question I'm just gonna I'm just going to show you this that's the short answer to my very long question Occam's razor is simple answer is the one science is great but quite often the story is so complicated that it really misses the mark for most Humanity we can't understand it but it's a marketing message that you need all these things but we know that is not true because the dose makes the poison basically small amounts of something might make you feel good just like a little bit of heroin cocaine marijuana nicotine or caffeine but Sinai my friend in small amounts May kill you quickly this is the idea that most Humanity doesn't understand is that we're marketing a bunch of drugs to make you feel better from The Chronic exposure of the plants and lean meat lean meat is deadly for us fatty meat is the critical part of the carnivore diet or any keto diet in my opinion but ultimately the message is complicated because someone that we believe has statue in the community because they're really so bright because they have a degree from some major university and or they've been given accolades because of the company they own and market a message that ultimately is deadly it's like going down on a carbon fiber tank to the bottom of the ocean we know it's deadly and then when people say things with the utmost of of absolute knowledge but but they ultimately are making them a story and again I'm telling this story also by the way don't believe me don't take what I say at face value you've got to do your own research and experiment but there's only one experiment to do and that's on you you see science is is is studying thousands but giving you an average not realizing that the that the the the the spread is humongous so just because you're not that average number you think oh my God I'm diseased just like folate numbers I was listening to you with Dr Chaffey again we've we get caught up in a number and a thought and and the worrying brain just goes right down the rabbit hole and can't realize that the majority of these things no animal in the universe is like let's see what's my folic acid level over what are those toxins but many organisms and animals know the signs of a deadly plant or a dangerous organism right we have been masterfully manipulated in order to sort of wipe away maybe those natural instinctual things that say don't touch that and now that's basically the the constant marketing of flavonoids or antioxidants what's an antioxidant I have no idea what an antioxidant is again because it's a it's a scientific term that some some really intelligent marketing person wrote this story do you know that most scientific papers have to go through an editorial to make sure they kind of like sound like someone's going to read them and believe them it's you know it's if you just want to get the straight numbers you'd probably look at it and say wait a minute these numbers don't match up to your story but we don't get all the numbers we just get again it's back to Ansel Keys the the the the seven country studies it kind of wasn't really true so the whole point here is that no no animal no organism no plant wants to be eaten that's number one right and so you don't need those drugs which may be helpful from Plants by the way to make you feel better in a moment because of sickness or cancer and we're using drugs that heal you but they also are at risk of causing a secondary disease or cancer but we're like really and so uh I would say that that um it's you just don't need those things of any significance or frequency but remember heroin cocaine marijuana nicotine caffeine uh and in a multitude of of mushrooms and psilocybin and Ayahuasca are being utilized by people thinking they're good and okay for you well they're highly addictive and we know in again back to plants and the sugars and all those chemicals you mentioned may be addictive chemicals that like I love coffee so good for us is coffee good for us it makes us feel good I even like it okay but I really minimize or eliminate it now because I realize the story is a lie to get you to spend your money on something you don't need which likely cause another disease which you're going to need more money because the cost of Health Care is only going up and so many people in this globe do not have do not have health care but again they don't have health care for the disease treatments that are caused by the diet and the flavonoids and the antioxidants that we say are good for us it's a lie yeah and I'm sorry I interrupted in the middle there but I wanted to say what you said was brilliant and I had an actual practical example yesterday because when we moved into this property um this makes sense Rob okay the roof was leaking and everything and only yesterday when it was dry could we fix everything we put this varnish down on the floor and now our puppy right normally eats with us he eats in the garden we eat in the garden and because we'd fix this room we thought well let's eat in here the varnish smell was horrendous I think uh I've got better sense of smell than than Jane our dog would not eat his food in that chemical Laden environment you know he's got a lovely duck next week he's raw carnival by the way we literally took it out of that room put it in the garden straight to it so they know they don't need a Tracker they don't need hey this you know this is good for you that's they they know we put something on his plate um and he will just eat it if it's good and if we put something that's got plants in it strangely enough you know if we got some food the other day we said we were all Carnival and feeding the dog Rock Carnival and there was there's plants in it didn't want to know you did not want to know it's so yeah that's great uh come on then Richard do another oh sorry Rob go on varnish comes from what plants I I don't know yeah straight away and so again all of these products from plants are there to protect the plant who to either attract or repel certain organisms for its life cycle yes going Rich did you want to do a follow-up don't forget yeah yeah yeah I'll keep this one yeah we'll have to do a carnival 24 round two I think with me um but yeah I mean they're supposed to come back to to what we made uh the statement that uh the Rob made in regards to antioxidants you know antioxidants um activate the Nrf2 pathway they're in fact pro-oxidants and the Nrf2 pathway is an oxidative stress pathway um the the same pathway is activated with the ingestion of things like arsenic lead Mercury um now this will give the same antioxidant effect as consuming vegetables um so if you are to reside to the fact that vegetables have an antioxidant effect and it's positive for us then you must also admit that consuming Arctic milk or your lead is good for us tobacco smoke and we know it isn't this is the same outcome from vegetables as consuming these toxic products this whole thing about anti oxens is the biggest load of rubbish that has ever been probably second only to cholesterol um these are not antioxidants I believe that um you know we can the argument would be uh for something called homicis the effect of hobby cysts which is where we put something that's a little bit toxic and we have a positive result um now there's two types of hobby cysts molecular homicides and environmental environmental would be the likes of cold water therapy and heat treatment which I I'm a Believer in I believe you know I've looked at the science I I believe the cold water dipping calories positive um uh results but these uh molecular homeostasis effects from consuming foods to me and I'm sure Robert will jump in on on this um is nothing more than a market employee uh by by the food industry um and it's it's rampant and I still hear it within the keto and Carnival Community antioxidants this is one of the biggest load of rubbish that we've ever been been spotted but there we are that's not that's like two minutes of it was the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has a journal they put out and last year they had a an expert review of nutrition for pregnant and lactating women it was mostly a plant-based lean meat no red meat or very minimal and it focused and also said that red wine is okay and so you got to wonder about the experts that are basically uh pushed and moved by some marketing money I suspect or just like we used to recommend tobacco uh and and as a physician that it had medicinal properties for people and again we're uh here's here's a little bit of alcohol how do you like it wow this is really good okay let's have 10 of those now whoa I don't feel so good anymore so again a little bit makes you feel okay or makes you feel good but a lot have 20 cups of coffee in one sitting uh espresso by the way will that make you feel good my friends we know that it won't but you're right how do you feel on this science is is a lot of how do you feel wow I feel great after taking that that's great wow let me Mark that down feels great must be good for you we know that's not true and that's our challenge in in life and again the science is really I love science I'm a scientist I went on this journey to figure out okay glucose somehow has been labeled as our energy source right but but a a type 1 diabetics has no insulin they have high glucose levels and they lose weight quickly right they get become skinny right and then a type 2 diabetic right they're they're fed all of this you know it's sugar sugar and and yet they're insulin and sugar levels go up something's wrong we call it insulin resistance right well the question came to me is well what is insulin resistance is it the insulin that's a problem is it the cell that's the problem and and I finally found this term called hepatogenous diabetes have you guys ever heard of hepatogenous diabetes I had never heard of it and if I never heard of it and yet and it's not recognized by the American diabetic Association nor the World Health Organization that it is likely that insulin resistance is actually a liver disease that's simply the liver cannot function to do its job and then the question is well what is the liver's job what would you say the liver's job is what do most people say toxic it removes toxins right well what what disease can you name that it doesn't remove a toxin you can't because that's not his job its job is to make fat and it makes fat so good we see it in the world and it makes fat out of two things amino acids and simple sugars and it requires one thing to do that insulin insulin's job is to make fat not to put sugar into cells it's to make fat in the liver because if you have liver damage significant you will become skinny and you will become a type 2 diabetic but no one talks about that and so if you really want to get down to the nitty-gritty of understanding the human body ketones are just a little bit of another distraction by the way we burn fatty acids that come from fat you can't take glucose in the in the cytoplasm and make pyruvate and acyl COA and then think you're going to get your your ATP produced it doesn't work that way you must make fat in the liver via insulin out of amino acids and sugars because if you think about it the majority of the diet in America or in the world is a plant-based lean meat diet most people either cut it away but are cooking methods for meat actually remove the fat it's cooked on a grill uh or it's boiled for hours or in an oven and all the grease goes away and the majority of humanity does not eat fat and really if you want to simplify all of this it might not being a carnivore it still may be simply being an omnivore you eat plants and meat but you must eat the fat and that's the fact that we're missing I think in all of this now I do believe that significant plants tend to be part of our damage but that's a hard one for people to sort of get in their brains that it it may be as simple as that story and Rob that's that's why you're here because I love the way you think you think outside the box I think carnivores are a subset of people I think being a carnivore means you look outside the box and you're prepared to do something that's not generally accepted when you talked about the liver there um that is something I I mean I'm a specialist practitioner in diabetes and I'd never heard that term so at 59 this old dog has learned a new trick because you know what when this 24 hours is over I'm not going to bed I'm going to look that up first I'm gonna go and learn about that because I think that's one of the things I love about this space and I love about you and and Rich we'll learn you know if if something um goes against what we believe or what we think we don't go that can't be true well like all that if it makes sense you know I think that was brilliant thank you for that no it's my pleasure what you think about it all right so uh sugar is your fast energy source and fat is your slow energy source ever heard that mm-hmm not really is it I mean it uh you know it can't be true why would the why would the mitochondria the TCA cycle say well wait a minute we're going to take the glucose now and use glucose for energy but you got a shitload of acetyl-coa and fatty acids all over and and you have short chain long chain and medium chain fatty acids everywhere and why would you ever say I'm going to take glucose and I'm going to use it for energy right now and then later on when your glucose levels are down now have you ever measured and found someone's glucose levels are down after a big rut race really fast nope no they're up nope they're normal it's not true which is what we did recently isn't it yeah I did a race yeah and so again even in the keto carnivore space we keep on saying sugar is your energy and the Brain requires sugar for energy it does not it does not know now glucose is critical along with with mannose and in acetyl glucosamine innocent galactosamine are critical for glycosylation which no one in the carnivore keto space talks about glycosylation which again we talk about proteins and making proteins but do you know that the majority of proteins are glycosylated and if they're not glycosylated do you know that you will die or be diseased and there are hundreds of diseases caused by abnormal glycosylation remember glycation is the abnormal binding of sugars onto everything and anything and glycosylation is the normal binding of a sugar again a sugar which is critical in our body by the way but never in our diet that's the amazing part and really when we talk about carbohydrates we should simplify it because that's too complicated plants plants and or animals those are our kind of choices of what to eat we never have a requirement to eat a plant but they do taste good and feel good don't they but when you learn the goodness of eating that fatty meat that organ meat the bone marrow the bone broth again if you want to go to all sorts of fancy brain and liver and thymus and kidney and heart go for it is it required I don't know but I enjoy them and I imagine if I enjoy them that means I've convinced myself the required but but ultimately what's our real requirement right uh we will die without air water amino acids and fatty acids and and and and really those are the simplicities of it even when we talk about uh mineral deficiencies have you ever seen someone with a mineral deficiency ever measured a mineral deficiency oh no and I was going to say that in phlebotomy I very rarely say I can't even remember seeing it well you might have seen it in sick patients who have a really low potassium or calcium elevation but but again you know we say well I think I'm mineral efficient well again you've been fed a story that makes you think something but maybe it's not so true so that's why it's really important that we get a chance to really be open to ideas that are radical and different and maybe again don't believe me don't believe most of everyone out there but go out there and dig deep and do the research to and then question everything well question everything hepatogenous diabetes because liver failure patients all have type 2 diabetes yet they're all skinny and have no fat on their body they're cachetic and the question yeah yeah I mean it's it it's brilliant it's what's really strange is one of the things I often talk about my personal training is the minimal the finite amount of glucose we got stored and yet we've got Dan's worth of fat energy on us even if you're a lean athlete you can go further and further but Rob that was brilliant uh I can't believe I'm saying this in a 24-hour span we haven't got enough time um but we've got Ben now uh from the big fat challenge so I've tried to link everybody up so it goes from one conversation to the next um so Dr Roberts thank you so much for giving us half an hour of your time you guys are amazing the story 24 hours of Kick-Ass remember fat is the critical food for the Ferrari and we're Ferraris so eat like when you'll feel like one and be the lion a ticket now there you go Ben the big fat challenge you see the big fat challenge you've just been given the perfect bat on so do you want to just talk about your big fat challenge yeah well we're basically trying to educate the world in a very simple but uh apparently radical message which is that fat is your body's ideal Fuel and you've been fed a whole load of nonsense about it all right really that simple so um it's it's basically what we say to people is um give it 90 days switch to I mean I like to call it like the manufacturer's recommended fuel if anyone's ever put diesel into a petrol car and you you get you know half a mile down the down the road and it goes and and you end up on the side of the road where the head and your hands go oh I know what I've done waiting for somebody to come out and try and try and rescue your engine but the difference is and um obviously kind of alluded to it now is the this difference between the cute toxins and chronic toxins you know a small amount of cyanide can bump you off immediately but the problem is when it comes to diet that the uh the toxins that we're taking in through excess carbohydrates and through things like seed oils are chronic they they build up over time and they they kill you slowly but uh they do make great customers for the pharmaceutical industry at the same time so uh you know it's it's a very good investment if you're um a director of a corporation yeah I think I've been rude here and very young English because I haven't introduced you I don't know if Richard knows Phil or Ben um but guys nice to meet you both nice to meet you Phil and Ben Richard good to meet you too yes I don't think we spoke brilliant did we speak no what it was it was such a fantastic event um but the only downside was the break time uh didn't leave an awful lot of time for for networking so you know you travel to these events to speak to people that you've you've met online uh and I ended up not speaking or conversing with very many people at all unfortunately that was still a fantastic one there was comedy lunch though wasn't there that was yes it was great we had we had quinoa and um and a bucket full of boiled um beans of some sort very bizarre yeah so yeah I fasted it it uh strangely enough I waited for uh for a steak later on in the evening but yeah and stuff Ben stole all the salmon and brought it to us it pretended he was very official and filled up with a couple of big boxes of salmon I I jumped the queue and went around the wrong side of the table Stephen as well so you know we're all no one's English here so just for the broader audience by the way we went to a conference in Sheffield and it the guest speakers were people like um uh Sean Baker and Jen unwind David and you know some really good people Ben bickman and the lunch that Phil refers to was fit for vegans that's about it I mean I went out to a local butchers and found a bag of um chicken legs for about four quid so that was that was great cook I'll tell you what we could we there was I wouldn't have eaten that when I was a vegetarian what they were giving there it was really weird it was like storage boxes it wasn't even something in uh you know like a pot plate or something like that but Sophia you know it's a fair Clements she had some nice um bison sausages from the Eskimo kitchen she went back to the hotel and got some for us and they were delicious so that tided us over the other day you know because we nicked the salmon one day they expected that uh to the next day because they promised but they wasn't but yeah well I'm moaning but it was great I mean you know it was great to see all those people there and people that haven't actually met in person before it was very cool it was great Phil now just quickly for for Richard uh and uh and everybody else watching but mainly Virgin uh could you just give him a real brief bit about what you did and uh what caused you to look at diet and how you resolved your issues oh well you see my my expertise is being an absolute idiot and this is what I've done mostly over my life with diet and I I was vegetarian and vegan for um let's see sort of 30 odd years and even wrote books on vegetarian eating and then I got really sick with full-on psoriatic arthritis in 2010 and uh had to figure it out and uh ended up writing a book in about 2014 called arthritis the best thing that ever happened to me and I still hadn't quite discovered carnivore I was very very close but I pretty much got it sorted but then in 2015 I went Carnival and everything's been great until I copped something up last year and then I managed to get out of trouble in three months whereas it took me about three years last time because I knew what to do this time but this is a warning I've just done a an episode with Anthony uh with Anthony chafee on his channel um that isn't released yet going really into what I did wrong and it doesn't take much when you've got autoimmunity in your past you know for me it was it was a lot of other factors outside of diet but you know being a bit of a uh having a bit of a rock and roll lifestyle and traveling around playing too many um festivals and misbehaving but um I had uh I I all it needed was some Dairy some eggs some pork and some chicken because it's easier to get on the road and I really screwed myself up I mean here's here's an example of it and I had a CRP in in uh November or December I can't remember 192. I mean I was I was really um proud of my 82 CRP back in the day you know before I wrote the book uh but this was horrific I brought it down I think about three weeks later I had another test it was 19 and I haven't done it since then and it's fine now I'm out of it but it was a horrific winter and it it's I wanted to say that you know all of the the sort of carnivore advice and and whatever does change when you're Auto term you you need to be a hell of a lot more strict and for me it's fatty beef and lamb and I can probably take a look at some other stuff short term but I came did a bit last year and I hastened well I didn't eat any plants didn't even take plants to set me off but uh there I was I'm supposed to be this arthritis Guru online I was stuck on the sofa and wasting away lost three stone and uh yeah it was a you know I'd like to talk about it now because it's a good warning for people who are who are autoimmune because it's a whole different ball game when you are so it's it's fatty beef and lamb for you guys don't deviate yeah and I think that that's the thing people think carnivore is the Cure All for everything and actually you're right talk about food but there's still environmental issues as well you know I'm this is sad to say the only thing I'm worried about doing a 24-hour live stream is 24 hours looking at a screen you know I don't think I don't think that's good for me personally not getting outside not touching my little doggy you know my little puppy because that de-stresses me seeing my wife which sort of stresses me and you know if you strap them both on all right but um let's compare a little bit of um uh a center stage as well to just talk about his personal Journey yeah well mine's far less interesting than than Phil's I'm afraid my wife and I moved into this big house about 10 11 years ago and with a couple of Acres of garden and I got really really into into no dig gardening and thought it would be a great idea to suck loads of carbon out of the air by building soil and stuff like that I designed and built my own Greenhouse here and um that then took me to a bunch of conferences and seminars and stuff like that like the Oxford real farming conference and stuff run by the sustainable food trust and I started hearing uh people talking about the importance of Ruben and animals and not just for the soil not just for building soil but also for health and they were talking about things I'd never heard about before like DHA and and conjugated linoleic acid and stuff like that I thought that's interesting so people talk about how you've got to eat meat because I like everybody else I was brought up with this amazing myth which was that fruits and vegetables are the healthy option they are the healthiest food that there is and this came as a big surprise to me so because I I'm an Explorer you know I'm I've I've done all kinds of things in my life I start a new project about every 45 minutes really and and I get a new passion but really fundamentally when when I look back with the benefit of hindsight my life's been about trying to figure out what it what it looks like to be a happy healthy fulfilled human being walking upon the Earth that's kind of it so that then took me to social media and I found Phil's Facebook group 100 carnivore and Beyond and uh got to know Phil and then the rest is history and then about three years later here we are um trying to trying to spread the good word that you should fuel your body with fat instead of carbs yeah and I think the yin and yang between you two is is is evident and it's great coming in I've come to a couple of your campfire meetings which you call them on Facebook which is just so laid back and and relaxed you know and Ben comes with all the sensible stuff and Phil just makes you laugh it's really good but I've just thought uh Dr chafe is still watching and he's saying that you were brilliant um Phil so that's that's good to know so Richard Anthony thanks for having me on it's always great to chat to you so Richard you've not met these two guys you got any questions for them about their big fat challenge or their yeah I think I just wanted a circle back to something that fellow said you know it again as you say when we say the carnival kid was all um you know it is to do with uh um specific conditions because there are certain foods within the carnival community that will affect people who suffer with autoimmune issue um you know cheese and eggs uh you know Dairy even eat or dairy can be problematic um certain types of fish so as as Phil rightly says you know it um you know beef uh is the key for me um I I do Dave David occasionally uh I don't suffer a source of severely with the autoimmune issues that I used to um but certainly you will see people gravitating into this sort of Lifestyle who will be consuming meat eggs fish and cheese and still suffering with uh certain conditions but it comes back to what we mentioned earlier about these incremental changes and not everybody fits into the same box um I'm what I'd regard as being strict Carnival but I also understand that not everybody wants to or can live the way that I do and when I look at my journey um you know I began uh low carb and then I became duodikido and all through accident initially because I didn't know what I was doing I just knew the bread brought me um I don't know if you guys know much about my story but I and I'll get through this really quickly I won't bore you too much of it but I used to be clinically obese and type 2 diabetic except for the chronic fatigue depression anxiety arthritic pains uh daily debilitating migraines will make me blind and in my mid to late 20s I could barely walk up the stairs without stopping or being severely out of breath super long story short I cut out bread I began my low carb Journey uh gravitated into Quito and in the UK Tito didn't exist you know 10 years ago nobody knew anything about it so the information was very scarce and what was available was misinformation I believe uh you know I I like Manny I gravitated to YouTube found people like Dr Berg who were pushing stupid amounts of you know plants every D and I fell into that category same as Ben I began growing my own vegetables and things and yes I became fitter and healthier but this improved further as I gravitated uh into a more Carnival base lifestyle about four to five years ago and and basically a long story short four to five years after beginning my journey I went on to become a European champion at a professional level in men's physique bodybuilding so I went from being unable to walk up the stairs uh to be a number one in Europe through a change in my lifestyle and not genetically gifted if you look at um pictures of of my father who died unfortunately two years ago from heart complications you can see that I was on that trajectory I was on that path of being severely uh obese uh and riddled with all sorts of illness and disease diseases and I changed that through the food that I consumed um but it is important just to Circle back to to the fact that you know we are all on our own journey and I do support any anybody who begins their Journey whether it be low carb dirty you know Stephen mentioned the story yesterday in regards to one of his clients who was uh received massive benefits from living a dirty kid or lifestyle and that's fantastic as long as people understand that there's always a better option the further you you gravitate down this Rabbit Hole the more benefit that's going to come and this is something that I've knocked this personally the deeper that I've I've gone into becoming Carnival um and you know as such reducing and removing things like A2 milks and foods that contain casein um I seem to get on very well with eggs they don't seem to be problematic for me um but at the clients who I work with who live carnivore lifestyle and deemed to be strict will still suffer with issues and they'll question why but so just circling back to that it you know we are all individuals and if you are suffering with severe autoimmune issues you know as Phil right he says it's you know keep it simple um you know red meat is the way to go um and I predominantly How I Live yeah yeah the Amazing Story there man well done um yes I when whenever I get clients who um well I get them a lot because I'm sort of I've got all these Carnival groups on the YouTube channel and whatever and when I when I get clients they and they say Carnival is not working it's always down to either uh chicken pork dairy or eggs particularly egg whites and pretty much every time it's that but also I deal with all the other things you know once you want to get the symptoms out the way with a good sort of PKD type diet um I'll explain that in a sec if listeners don't know um but um as soon as as soon as you get the symptoms out of the way then there's everything else you know that we deal with in the big fat challenge all the other ancestral disconnects I'm a big fan of Jack Cruz who's a friend of mine and did the forward to my book and you know he's just saying you stop being stop being a diet Guru and be a light Guru stop it doesn't matter what you eat as long as you get enough Sun well you know people always have these these sort of areas of expertise and you can pick from all of them right I mean I did a um I would really if anybody's watching this is autoimmune please go and have a look at my channel um and see the interview I did recently with with zofia with Sophia Clements from paleo medicinal because I asked specific questions that somebody who is actually autoimmune would ask and I think a lot of people she's been interviewed a lot of times but nobody's quite done that you know by other docs and podcasters and whatever but I really wanted to go deep on that and I think she's going to really piss a few people off with her views on Dairy um I did a little video where Ben and I were wandering around the Peak District with her as well on that where she says raw dairy is worse than um pasteurized Dairy and this this will annoy a lot of people I'm sure who have that as a sacred cow but I understand I think what she's saying there that more of the um growth factors are are intact in raw milk and so down the line there could be more problems with um you know unusual cell replication whereas pasteurized milk will give more initial issues because they messed up the whole sort of enzyme content and whatever and so that'll give more immediate issues whereas raw dairy won't and so I would say that anybody who who wants to sort of suddenly start shouting which they have done on my YouTube channel a bit of Sophia for saying that go and have a listen and and there's some very interesting stuff on there because you know that that whole autonomy inside is is what I'm kind of focused on and um I found that I had to look at everything some people fix it with Carnival now I didn't even not even with a PKD diet completely I had to look into all the emotional stuff the grounding the light the emfs everything really and and and that's how we've been become disconnected from our ancestral heritage and that's what really the big fat challenge is all about not just you know the primary goal of getting people onto fats rather than horrible plant carbohydrates but also you know seeing all the other ways that that we become stressed um our ancestral heritage Ben yeah yeah um just kind of jumping on on what Richard was saying as well and and what what Phil's just just um shared that one of the things that we teach because fundamentally what we're helping to do is to help coach people from the transition from the the sad you know the shitty average diet through to something that's appropriate I think we do all have I mean there's so many myths about one of the big myths is EV everyone's different and there is not one ideal diet for Humanity well that's not really true I mean it would make us unique amongst the entire Animal Kingdom if if it were true and things like the blood type diet we were on a show yesterday and people kept saying what that blood type does absolute nonsense right but our circumstances are different right so Phil has had to go and you know Richard's had to go a lot stricter than say I do because you know several times a week I'll I'll have I'll have chips fried in Tallow and and I'll cope perfectly well with that because I didn't ruin my gut and one of the things that we coach people a lot on the big fat challenge is we really want to drive it home that apart from the fact that there's not one type of carnivore either you know a carnivore is an animal that gets the majority of its of its calories from eating other animals and not necessarily every single calorie right but one of the things that we we really try and drill home to people is there's nothing wrong with putting on uh body fat it was actually an essential um evolutionary survival trait there's nothing wrong with eating some berries and some nuts and even some grass seeds in season in a Paleolithic context because it helps you to lay down body fat and up the insulin and everything else like Robert say um the problem is because our bodies are extremely good at detoxifying but the thing is in in the in the traditional kind of solar cycle you you take on all these like high deuterium Foods higher sugars higher lectins all this kind of stuff um in the summertime and the Autumn time but then you'd be kind of fasting throughout the winter and you'd be detoxifying be peeing all this stuff out every day during the winter and so you've got this this kind of Yin Yang flow going on but what people do today on the sad is they're guzzling a half gallon of high fructose corn syrup when they go to the cinema and and you know munching down fruits that have been flown around the world all year round and high sugar and everything made out of seed oils and you're just literally massively overwhelming your body's ability your body's incredible ability to get rid of environmental toxins by just giving it an absolute tsunami of Filth that's the problem it's not that we can't deal with these things it's just that we there's no way we can do with them in in in in that kind of quantity and no wonder People's Health collapses because of it yeah Jack Cruz has a lovely phrase isn't he that if if the food that's going into your mouth doesn't match the light that's going into your eyes there's going to be mitochondrial disruption and that's just a a fancy way really of saying that just you know eat locally and seasonally what you would have done probably more than 10 000 years ago wherever you live and you'd be all right you might not need to go fully Carnival but you know here where I am and where Ben is you know sort of quite a way up in England towards the North we wouldn't in the winter have been able to find any plant foods and so what what on Earth did we do this is this is the thing that amuses me about the vegans where I think you know how successful would they have been you know before agriculture to to go on a quinoa hunt in um Scotland in December I'm going foraging this afternoon I'm I'm a forager right my wife is a forager she teaches foraging courses there's no way we could feed ourselves in this lovely kind of gentle um climate that we've got here in in nature without animal products we haven't got hope in hell we're hopefully going out to get some mushrooms this afternoon it's nonsense I'll just say I mean I'm actually an animal lover which people don't seem to think you can be on this way of eating and I was watching a channel where they were studying animals Behavior um and they put a load of bananas and they peeled some of them some were green some were ripe and they stuck them in the forest and these fantastic cameras strapped to trees and they genuinely thought that it wasn't a carnivore Channel and it was an animal channel looking at their behavior and the researchers genuinely thought we put this big stack of bananas and we will get loads of animals coming in to eat them four days later I will take my hat off to their honesty not one bit of banana had been eaten and they had the footage of all these you see raised eyebrows raised you know I'm open to everything so um to me I mean we me and Ben we live in the same sort of part of England there is no way on Earth we could go out and find a banana ever right so that's not appropriate for it you know if we did have no air travel if this is where we were born or where we'd traveled to and settled many many you know Generations ago would never have eaten a banana certainly not a modern banana with all this high level of sugar so I think that's that's the other thing when you're talking about what's good for us to eat even if you think well I'm gonna still eat I'm still gonna be vegetarian and I'm going to eat all my fruits that that isn't appropriate because they're all hybrid hybrid you know apples in the supermarket are at least a year since they were picked so we're not eating anything that's particularly natural even though it looks lovely you know it looks natural but Steven bananas are paleo don't you know that the animals didn't know though okay you know you can see you see it in the painting it's like it's a banana Paleo and then somebody pops up isn't there there's always like two a day or something you've just discovered palette oh have you discovered banana pancakes all you do is mix bananas and eggs and fry them up and everyone goes no we've never discovered that before because it's like every other post and it's so funny and if they you know they don't think that in Paleolithic times There's No Bananas there's just in fact there weren't any anywhere because bananas are tiny and full of seeds right they're not in a natural environment absolutely they're not even like bananas in the shops so yeah nonsense so that's your guess we've got a new guest waiting to come in I don't know how I don't think you should put a camera on yet um how would you like to sum up what you're offering people because you've you've got a lot of interest in the chat you've did a little bit about your big fat challenge but just tell us a little bit more um I I think we offer something for everybody because you know everything from people who are just trying to lose a bit of weight to people who are severely autoimmune we've got in there um I I think we've really over delivered with all the other kind of stuff but I'm going to let Ben say exactly what's in there even including our upcoming book so you won't be able to find anywhere else so off you go then yeah yeah so really we we do two main things we we help people to retrain their thinking around food which is a long journey to take because we we have been fed and all a huge amount of BS for our entire lives through every channel you know even up to proper proper you know beard fiddling science and and everything it starts when you're very young girls all the way through so retrain your thinking around food and we help you to retrain your habits because it's not easy to to do this and in the context of family co-workers and everything else can you afford to eat you know species appropriate diet well I'd say can you afford not to um and in a lot of countries if you factor in the the cost of uh Healthcare then then it becomes an absolute no-brainer um now but we so we it's like a 13-week program we take you through you can dive in on day one and try and go do the full monty immediately that's absolutely fine but we also include for example our forthcoming book The Red Pill food Revolution that charts the whole history of our our terrible relationship with our degeneration um the degeneration of The Human Condition with regards to food and leading up to this kind of end game that we're in now um and that that book isn't even out on sale yet but you can get it in PDF and in audiobook uh formats as well there's a bunch of other bonuses and stuff but really we're just set out to answer every single question and we and we do you know the everything from the the health issues do you need fiber surely you need fiber what about vitamin C aren't you gonna die of scurvy well no you know all through to the environmental side of things and even the ethical and spiritual side is stuff that's really really important for people like like Stephen just said you know we're animal lovers and we we care very much about about this but we do believe that every single argument every single objection out there can be answered fully we that's what we try to do to to help people through and uh make it through successfully to the other side and just realize a whole new level of Health Energy and well-being that's brilliant thank you Ben thank you Phil um for for coming on um I'm gonna just quickly thank Dr Kilts and also Dr chafee Who are still looking and listening in after their appearance which was which was going above and beyond their um their allocated time which that's really great so you two have a great day and we're now going to go over to Rachel who uh is the founder of boil and broth do you know each other okay can I just thank Ben and Phil as well fantastic chat in and uh yeah I'd like to connect outside of this if we could to arrange an offer the chat or podcast maybe but uh yeah definitely I don't think 30 minutes was enough for us I think we probably could have gone on for another hour and 30 plus yeah um but it'd be fantastic in that book I'll take this but thank you both so much for coming on guys would you want Rachel do you want to just quickly introduce your boil and broth company to everybody that's uh out there yeah sure so um I'm the founder of boiling broth I actually started the business back in 2018. um I started bubbling bones boiling broth back in 2017 and the reason I got into bone broth was because I had a whole heap of gut health problems um I'd not long had my children and I I was overweight I was actually 16 Stone and um yeah and I I was just on this roundabout of the NHS you know going to within my with my symptoms they'd give me medication I'd come away and I went through this for about three years and then I just really got to the point of I can't keep going on to this round bar with the NHS so I had to sort of take my hand my health into my own hands which I'm sure a lot of people watching this now have had the the same experience um yeah so I started on Rabbit Hole Charlie you know deep down in the rabbit hole what's going on in the gut um and as a result I learned all about well not all about but I had it I gained a good understanding of gut health enough to sort of make me start thinking that perhaps my condition which was actually candida overgrowth I don't know if anyone is familiar with it but interestingly some a carnivore paleo diet is is perfect for it because it can it candid overgrowth is a condition that feeds off of sugar in your body so it the more it the more sugar you have in your diet the more it grows it infiltrates the digestive system and as a result you get a whole ton of symptoms so I started on the bone broth journey and I also started to make kefir water as well which is a naturally um probiotic drink Sparkling and yeah I I and I cut out all sugars so pretty much went into more of a a Paleo carnivore type I just I did have a few you know sort of veggies and all that sort of thing but the main core part of the change of our diet was the broth in the cafe of water and within 12 weeks I'd completely reverse my health condition I've completely got rid of candida overgrowth that I've been struggling at the NHS for three years and then um after two years I actually lost six Stone and weight so naturally I just went into business and you know the passion within me was really about you know getting this message out there that you know that actually you know the system is so corrupt and that they actually want us to be sick so really the only way to to make get to get better is to take Health into your own hands and do the research you know follow you know guys like yourselves you know and really important influences in this space who have the correct information that can can share it out so yeah and then obviously baller broth was born out of this um selling frozen bone broth for for five years now we've got a small team a factory shipping all over the world we sell for pets as well because the pet space is just as corrupt um and uh yeah and my husband works for me and it's good you know we've just innovated the broth to basically make a pure broth protein now so we remove all of the water from the broth as part of our preservation um instead of freezing and then by doing that that means that we're left with pure broth protein and then we can ship it up anywhere in the world and then the customer just needs to rehydrate it back and can have it as a a warm nourishing drink so that's what I always say ditch your coffee get your broth instead in the morning so yeah that's brilliant excellent that's brilliant have you met Richard before no what happened I've only seen you seen you on social so it's good to meet you yes YouTube pleasure thanks for coming on thanks for coming on fantastic story um yeah I'd be interested in in speaking of in regards that because I I operate and run um a keto low carb carnivore uh website um so I mean if you're looking for stockists for the broth uh I'd be interested in in Chapman but uh yeah I mean it's and it's something that people can do at home as well isn't it it's just it is highly time consuming in regards to chicken which is around 24 hours I believe no it's a nightmare I mean look you know I I've I've had slow cookers at one point in my house I had nine slow cookers bubbling away you know it was just at the point and then we switched to pressure cooking because it was better for nutrition it's also cuts down the histamine levels it's also quicker for our production as well so now we just cook broth under pressure and it works so much better for for the product itself um but yeah you know people anyone who's tried broth at home you know it's time consuming it's smelling you know if you're really bad at it like I was initially you know then I I didn't remove the fat I when I first had my first cup of broth I kept the fat with it and I'm sure all the carnivore people are thinking yeah go put them up but actually I didn't really enjoy it so you know it was a it you know and making broth it is an art because you do have you know it can there's so many variables that can go wrong you know in making a really good broth you know we don't add any vegetables with it but people often add vegetables for flavor um we don't we add more bones because we want protein and that's essentially what froth is all about it's about the proteins the amino acids in the in the broth itself that are the uh are the the you know the game changers for people's house that collagen particularly you know a lot of people don't realize as we age our collagen production slows down so you know having a natural source of it to replenish it is great and and broth is perfect for that because you can't get any more natural exactly and I think you know people don't give College in the credit that it deserves um you know through the carnival Community there's lots of people who want to eat the gristle on the bone um or the marrow from the bone or the stringy bits in the steak and that's where the collagen is which is incredibly important so for those people who are avoiding I I eat bone and everything I'm okay every bit of an animal when it comes to that but I mean these are ideal you know substitutes isn't it in regards to collagen replacement because collagen uh you know particularly one and three is incredibly important you know one uh predominantly from from Marines which is predominates the body and Bovine which is which is number three uh which is ideal for intestinal Health um but you know it's we need one and three in particular um and I think even Within you know the carnival Community the people that I work with it's something that is is missing um my first piece of advice you know as I'm sure yours would be is is to eat the stringy bits and the cartilage off your bones but if you're not into that you know then the collagen shots you know the broth um shots that's what I drink in the morning occasionally um you know people look at me stupid so instead of having a cup of coffee you know it's a cup of uh of born broth um which is fantastic you know it's just the case of getting used to something different and I think that uh I think there's going to be a big change in the UK over the next couple of years in regards to coffee shops stocking things like this because the movement is growing and people are understanding how important that you know the replacement of college you know and these you know the coffee shops and the faces they need to be part of leading that change because people the nation is sick you know not just the nation the world is sick you know the amount of people that come to us you know even vegans come to fibroth from us because they might have been vegan for you know the last 10 15 years or something and their body is literally stripped of all the nutrients you know and and they they come to us and they're like help you know my gut health is in a terrible State what can I do and and yeah I just say you know the best thing you can do is get some protein into it's really very simple you know because these people have been depleting themselves of these vital nutrients for such a long time and you know and I think unfortunately you know mainstream messaging there is still a lot of the wrong information out there you know you'd go to the doctors that they haven't got a clue they have not got a clue you know and I I don't I'm not here to disk doctors I'm not talking about all doctors I'm just saying you know the doctors are often with the GPS that you go in and you're just on a routine roundabout appointment with them and they're not trained it's not their fault they just don't have that education yeah I agree and it's you know we are it's indoctrated from such a young age that we need fruits and vegetables for vitamins and minerals because that's the first question that I get asked as a carnivals where are you vitamins and minerals coming from well fruits and vegetables I hate to break it to everybody and not a good source of vitamins and minerals um vitamin A retinol we cannot get from plants plants contain beta-carotene which is a precursor that needs to be acted upon by an enzyme called bcmo to convert it into the active form of retinol plants do not contain high levels of B vitamins particularly vitamin B12 cabalamin um you know we do not get vitamin K from Plants yet this is what's stamped on Kale isn't it in the supermarket vitamin K but kale contains K1 the human body needs K2 and the list goes on create incarnacine carnitine taurine all of these things that we can only get from animal proteins and one of the other biggest misconceptions is that vitamin C where do you get your vitamin C from well meat contains vitamin C you know so it um unfortunately we are fed this uh Harden the pattern or pun intended we are fed this massive load of rubbish isn't it in regards to plants being uh fit for Optimal Health Unfortunately they they bind to lots of the nutrients and they prevent the absorption their anti-neutrons plants are antenutrons they prevent the absorption of these essential amino acids collagens um and I can understand so I work with vegans and vegetarians um you know I respect anybody's dietary Choice uh but I I I try to to uh educate you know as much as I can because there's a lot of misinformation out there and the people that I do work with I find that they suffer with sarcopene earlier than life you know muscle waste there's osteoporosis because they're not consuming these essential nutrients which we can get from meats and Bone broths you know yeah and Richard I think you hit a point point there you know that there is so much misinformation out there and people you know and I like you I do respect Everybody's Health choices you know their diet choices but at the end of the day you know there is a lot of misinformation out there and it's gonna it's getting worse because you know we've got all these you know the AI chat Bots you know they write blogs you know people when they're searching stuff they keep stopping researching really bad things this is why it's so important to have leaders in the space influencers that people can go to for the right information because otherwise you know it really is going to become a major issue and just going on to the point of vegetables earlier with the with the lads that you had on prior to me you know they were talking about environmental toxins and you know they're really that really is a major issue you know people don't realize that you know farming you know it they they do they are using pesticides they are using you know unnatural things on our fruits and vegetables you know so if you're going to eat fruit and vegetables try and grow your own you know and people don't need a lot of space to grow their own vegetables you know I think that's really you know the important to say you can you can just grow them in pots you know you don't have to have a massive allotment to grow your own veggies yeah definitely there's lots of miscommunications I mean you know some of the arguments I get are animal cruelty yet I love animals and that's why I consume my food locally from a farm two miles away um all grass-fed grass finish the animals are well looked after one one cow would feed me for a year which comes from two miles up the road so I'm uh helping you know the the environment uh in regards to pollution and I'm not desert defying because what people don't understand is when they eat you know vegans and vegetarians they consume these Foods you need to desertify a field which kills a whole ecosystem destroys the microbes in the ground and that land becomes desertified it can never be used again yeah and obviously the combine Harvesters when they they pull out a field and there's this other the seagulls and birds above that's because of all the dead animals that are caught within that machinery and these vegans and vegetarians don't understand that you know to desertify the field titles ten times more animals you know than than it does to to to feed a carnival lifestyle and what do they do with it they they you know uh buy off avocados and these exotic fruits I'll tell I know it's insane honestly and um I I have to say sorry just search right because Stephen has brought on his lovely dog talk about that you do carnivore stuff for dogs yeah absolutely so I think I think our bone broth is because we do we put nothing in it just three ingredients that's it and we home make our apple cider vinegar as well because we're fortunate enough to live on an orchard but the greatest thing is is that we have a dual license to reduce the bone broth for pets and for human consumption the broth that we sell for the pets is actually no different to the one that we sell for the humans we just have to have a license and a different label to put on it but essentially you could buy a pot of broth for yourself and share it with your dog that's how that's how it is yeah help our surprise that exactly and you know and I think to the point of us doing this was because you know we do see that there are you know issues within Health space for pets as well you know they are not getting access to a lot of their correct information and there's a really big Drive in the Royal feeding Community now for pass which is amazing you know because so many vets in the UK really stand for raw feeding you know they they highly recommend carnivore diets for dogs and absolutely dogs aren't meant to eat you know um they're not they're not meant to be herbivores at all you know um so broth is a great way to supplement a dog's health as well so you know for the same benefits is why you would have it for for a human which is for inflammation reduction in the gut um for collagen benefits as well um and also joint and ligament benefits particularly for dogs you know especially as they get older you know they do need that extra glucose glycosamine and chondroitin in their bodies as well and that's another amino acid structure that can that's found within bone brotha too so yeah it's really really good stuff and just just I just want to go on to something that rich was talking about there uh this is from the smith Smithsonian National Zoo and conservative conservation uh there you go um in a year 67 million birds are killed due to pesticides agricultural pesticides um 672 I reckon across the world in a year and destruction so you know and these are the things that don't really get exposed do you know what I mean you know mainstream media it's just always because they have the power they have the half the majority you know so they're able to push that that narrative out there um but you know again as I'm reconfirming you know this is why it's so important to have these sorts of shows on this sort of you know Network for people to be able to come and get the right information um because you know I was horrified when I went on my own health journey to to see you know um just how you become on a conveyor belt you know you go in with your symptoms they treat your symptoms you come out with something else and then you know this it's not just that it's when people come to you and they've got the problems I'm sure you guys are both the same you hear that all the time where people are just stuck on on medication and they don't know how to get off of it and actually the first thing to do is Diet has to be for sure yeah for sure it is a shame I mean one industry feeds the other um and yeah I mean thank you for coming on and spreading the word as well I mean it's I I've been living this lifestyle for 10 11 years and screaming from the rooftops but a lot of my content seems to be blocked on on Instagram Facebook and YouTube as such my following hasn't growns I've been screaming this for 10 11 years um and I I don't have a following um you know anywhere near the size of some of these other influencers um and and I think it's because content I've put out earlier um which is a shame and it's tough you know Stephen I were speaking about this yesterday when we in regards to trying to improve that following in order to get that message out but a lot of my my items posts have been censored over the years I must be in Facebook and Instagram jail or something but um [Music] these are fantastic ways isn't it to get that message out there I mean this is the first ever 24 hour you know keto Carnival live um and I think you know a big thank you to everybody that's coming on to help spread that word you know and thank you as well it's and also you know it's such an important message I mean you know our diets naturally the human diets are naturally carbohydrate-based you know and um and there's so much science and research information now to say that you know more of a heavily approaching fat diet is better for our bodies you know and if we go back throughout history you know most you know people were hunting they're hunting for food you know they're not they're you know and eating grains and and natural foods from the land for it for years you know and unfortunately because we've become so massive in terms of population there's just not enough feed around to go around to feed everyone now so you know everything's become genetically modified you know trying to get us to eat insects yeah yeah have you seen it on food yet yeah even on some of the ingredients they're slipping them in you know so it just it's yeah it's not great it's not great but that's why getting the right information and and doing what you can at home and eating local I think is the most important thing for sure you know because you don't know where it's you know know again it's great for the environment but also you know you don't know how Foods what hands they pass through the further afield they go you know and I always stand by British farming we do have the best farming in the world for sure I know it's not no problem it's perfect but compared to the rest of the world yeah I think so and I think Phil and Ben made a fantastic mention when they were on about locally sourced produce and the fact that you couldn't sustainably live on um you know on on plant Foods uh it is just not enough around we predominantly we're animal based you know we would have spent days hunting and tracking an animal we would record and kill that animal we would have eaten everything within our animal there are animal contains protein and it contains fat there's no carbohydrated within that animal yet we are told as a society that we cannot live without carbohydrate and carbohydrate predominates everything and I think one of the biggest um misconceptions which you know needs to be addressed I think maybe a point we can come back you know time and time again but I'm sure everyone within the community already understands this that we look at carbohydrates and sugar as being two different things they are the same thing I haven't eaten any sugar but I've eaten a bowl of pasta sorry about it but it's really interesting say that because for me in my own personal health Journey that was a real big education for me because you don't realize that your Banana's got carbohydrates in you know it's just pumped into you yeah your fruit's good you've got to eat it you know but actually it is full of sugars yes they're natural sugars but you're still your body doesn't go oh that's the natural sugar that's a processed sugar therefore I'm going to treat it differently your body isn't that intelligent it just or the the scissors it just says that Sugar I'm gonna deal with it as it deals with it you know um yeah I think you know there's so many conceptions and I was gonna I was going to say something then in a minute from my mind sorry I've forgotten it will come back to me you're feeling author isn't it but yeah I mean a bowl of muesli um you know I used to think was incredibly healthy um now that that bowl of mues leaf per 100 grams contains anywhere between 70 to 80 grams which is you know around 20 teaspoons of sugar or 20 um yeah 20 teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams and one that I used to do is to chop up a banana or add some berries so I used to add sugar to my bowl of sugar you know and I I thought that I was being healthy um but unfortunately you know this is um the brainwashing that has gone on you know since of the 1950s and it um worse with children you know I've got two children and you know the cereals that are around for the children it's just a nightmare they're they're you know they say oh they've got extra you know vitamin D or you know this and they'll you know this and that in there but actually the sugar in there is just insane and when they say so what they see on there is four to fade with now that four different reasons they have dug those minerals out of the ground and added them in that cannot be that cannot be a good field you know uh dig in our you know to the ground and adding it to your food which is absolutely incredible our new dance should come from the food that we eat naturally um not not from not from the ground at least in my opinion anyway what do you think Steve well I I was just looking in the chat there because someone wants to go to your website Rachel what is your or you can get free samples as well on the website so it's www dot oil and broth.com um if there's anyone overseas and they want some samples just message us that info at Boiling broth.com um but yeah we've got um free so this so what I was telling you about with the with the broth so we're just going through a change and as of as from September we're stopping all of our frozen bone broth and the reason we're doing it is because it's just costing us so much money to make it and ship it now and we can't ship it overseas because it's it's oil so quickly so this is why we dehydrate now the broth so it gets rid of all the water sprout down into a pure broth protein and people just rehydrate it back so five grams rehydrates back to 100 bales of bone broth um yeah we're giving away samples on the website so people can go on and pick up a sample they can try the dehydrated bone broth we've got samples for pets we've got samples for humans we've got six different flavors for pets we've got beef lamb chicken venison goat and pork for pets and then for humans we've just got the three chicken lamb and beef but actually we're also going to be launching a new venison flavor for humans as well because I don't know if you guys eat medicine at all but it's becoming really really popular now in the UK yeah um I would I would say that this morning it's brilliant um we were talking about coffee and giving up coffee and I think um substituting coffee with bone broth is is a hack that a lot of people use and it does work actually I think um coffee is lovely uh I have decaf and it doesn't cause me any issues but I understand the social side of it so if you want to get off coffee as we spoke about with Dr Chaffey and also Dr Kilts um then bone broth is a really good thing to try as an alternative because it is tasty and it is nutritious and it's a hot drink and um you could sit there where you normally sit in the morning so you have your coffee and have your bone broth and uh because it's now dried you can supply I mean I remember buying some off of you that was the liquid and I think actually it might be Serendipity that you know costs have gone up and you've gone more into the dehydrated because it's easier to post and it's easier to store at home and then you just just make it like coffee granules you know it's just this it's so easy and simple and such a good thing to have a hot drink instead of coffee which is uh deleterious for most people and have something that's nutritious I think you know hopefully people will take you up on that offer to go to your website so just it's it's boilandbroth.com is it yes it is yeah yeah and we do offer is not great so just email us um and we can ship them out to you that way yeah well um I'm just going to answer a couple of the comments by the way um just just so people know we we've invited as many guests as we possibly could and yes we're gonna have guests every half hour so Rachel was very kind to come on um we tried to get Kimberly but I think it's just been too busy for him to to get on uh I don't think Dr chafe is coming back he's given us three hours already uh Dr kiltz may come back but we have got people booked um all the way through the day so uh we're now four and a half hours into this 24-hour live stream so rich we're out of out of the woods now so you know we've only got 19 and a half to go but Rachel thank you so much for um appearing yeah I really appreciated it yeah thank you I'm really grateful separately and um we'll have a chat about what we spoke about the beginning So yeah thank you very much all the best for today it was really great thank you okay bye bye yes so um that was brilliant we did I didn't realize I was moved in there when I was apologize yeah I did say thank you and yeah for sure uh yeah so yeah I mean just going into uh what we were saying um about that being nutritious I mean just before the next guest if you want to just talk about what keto Pro does what you do that would be interesting from a severe Health background and as such I I've sold three houses everything I own to put into the business in order to educate and help people along their journey in car production removing seed oils grains and ideally the transition into Carnival eventually um and we support every stage of that so we support every stage of low carb uh dirty keto clean keto and everything is signed posted on the website so the products and foods that we do uh will either be stamped keto Pro approved which is the creme de La Creme anything else it is you know deemed to be keto friendly or low carb but no matter what what side of the fence you're on whether you're low carb dirty keep your clean keep your standard Carnival what type of Carnival you know there are products and foods and snacks on there that um that can help anybody along their Journey uh obviously we always promote real food uh real food is you know is the way forward what we do stock is classed as Foods um and that's what we do part of our journey is to help educate and that's what Stephen and I do every Sunday on the live this is what we do on the website there's a knowledge base on there with lots of free information lots of free information on the YouTube channel uh and Instagram Etc but that's enough chapter for me um Dr Rachel Brown hello would you like to introduce yourself to those people that don't know you sure yeah um so I work as a consultant psychiatrist in the UK um but I'm also qualified in functional medicine so I have a real interest in um looking at the root causes of illness which I think uh modern day medicine doesn't do particularly well um and I've been carnivore for four years now do you know Richard follow me I don't Hello Rachel I don't think we've met prior to this week no no we haven't met I think we've interacted a bit on Instagram brilliant oh have you well did you have a bit of a ding-dong argument about something no I don't think so is that yeah I'm joking Rachel can you hear us okay no sorry I don't know if I've got a bit of a delay here but I'll try and do my best yes there is a delay it's like speaking on a satellite so do you want to give um the listeners and viewers a little bit of background about why you ended up you know been a carnival sure so um gosh I've been interested in low carb nutrition for decades there's a couple of decades which makes me feel really old um but I came to carnivore by a keto and it was really just um because of families or poorer Health um in older Generations in my family and I've been doing I've been a big fan of Mark Sisson for years and I've been doing low carb but not necessarily strictly key to for quite a number of years for before I decided I was going to go strictly keto and then I just came across carnivore via one of my favorite keto influencers which was Vanessa spinner so I'd followed a lot of her work um for quite some time and like a lot of people I thought it was crazy when I first heard of it um and I first saw it I first was introduced to carnivore via just a food plate that she shared on her Instagram and because I trusted her opinion on a lot of things I felt um there must be something in this if she's doing it so I went down the rabbit Hall and just researched it myself and and the rest was history yeah and I think there is a slight delay by the way so um Richard do you want to ask a psychiatrist any particular question about carnivore and how it's helpful yeah so it um I mean a lot of questions that that we get within the community yeah you know is regards to how the diet will affect uh the catacolumo transmit the synthesis within the brain and how the brain functions uh I did an interesting podcast with Jen and win recently in regards to food addiction and many people don't understand that the food that we consume massively impacts the way that the brain works and and the way that it makes us feel isn't it um do you want to go into a little bit of detail and explain a little bit about how this can affect the way we feel and the moods and and because everything comes to me comes from from Diane I used to suffer severely with depression and anxiety and since becoming kiddo and Carnival uh you know these things have gone away and I used to I used to tell people my life was spent living in boxes so I used to leave my box and jump in my metal box I drive to a big box where I walk into a small box my life was spent living in boxes because of depression and anxiety and through the foods that I've changed in my diet I know I've been able to to come out of that box and now I do public speaking events to thousands of people where I couldn't have dreamed of doing before and all of this is to do with nutrition but when you tell that to somebody they won't believe it because it doesn't come from a medication you know and it's um yes if you wanted to go into a little bit that would be fantastic yeah sure happy too um gosh where to start there's so many different um complicated Pathways within the body that all interconnect um you know it really really astounds me so I'm part of a critical Psychiatry Network group and there were some emails this week that I found particularly triggering and it was in response to one of the psychiatrists in the group asking is there any evidence that food can make a difference to Major mental disorder and um someone else in the group very opinionated said or there's absolutely no evidence and I'm sure we'd all be very happy if there was any evidence uh and um I was just too triggered to actually respond to that email tune because I have emailed them all before but obviously they don't pay much attention to my emails um but it never ceases to amaze me when people say that what we eat has nothing to do with our mental health because um our neurotransmitters a lot of them are manufactured in the gut by our gut bacteria particularly serotonin um but don't get me wrong it's not just about neurotransmitters in terms of having good mental health but there's certainly a part of the puzzle and in terms of all the enzymatic reactions that happen in the body we need uh minerals to access code to others those those reactions so for example production of Serotonin production of melatonin um conversion into those sorts of neurotransmitters or chemically active substances in the body come originally from amino acids such as tryptophan and where do we get our amino acids from but we get it from our food and that's also where we get our vitamins and minerals and so on and so forth and I think a good way of thinking about it is that whatever we choose to put into our body really does affect um our body's response and so our body always responds to our environment and be it toxins or foods that we're putting into our body and part of those responses can include an immune system reaction um but really I like to start off in the gut because I think I think the guts brain connection is absolutely crucial and you know there are certain foods that are just terrible for for health in general never mind mental health and one of those is gluten um so we know that foods like gluten because of a component in the protein of the wheat protein that leads to Leaky guts and when you have leaky gut it means that there are certain bacteria and toxins within the gut and toxins that come from bacteria that can then leak across the gut barrier into the bloodstream and travel to sites distant in the body including the brain um and when that happens we know it's very clear from research and particularly in relation to something called LPS which comes from gram-negative bacteria but these bacterial components trigger off an immune system reaction and an inflammatory reaction in the body um and in the research literature when we talk about peripheral inflammation we are also talking about immune system activation and that comes in the form of cytokines um that are released and there's a clear connection between the gut and the Brain along the vagus nerve but there's also chemical signaling that goes between those two organs back and forth and when you have we know from the research that when you have inflammation in your gut you also have inflammation at the level of your blood brain barrier and then your blood brain barrier is quite similar to the intestine is how I often think about it because it's a similar single cell layer that can also become leaky and once you have a leaky blood-brain barrier this means certain toxins and components from bacteria effects we can cross over into the brain and cause inflammation in the brain and so those are a few different mechanisms and but there are there are other aspects to just um in terms of oxidative stress being one so having an imbalance between the antioxidants that we have endogenously in our body versus pro-oxidant molecules that are formed as a result of different processes in the body and part of which can come from the food that we choose to eat and so we know that having a high carbohydrate load in the body is inherently inflammatory and then this inflammation and oxidative stress can trigger off changes in the neurotransmitter Pathways so you particularly the tryptophan pathway that's a really good example where you can have tryptophan is diverted down the kind urine pathway which is essentially an inflammatory pathway in the body and it means there's a bit of a tryptophan steel so you don't produce as much serotonin and or ultimately melatonin and and so you can see why that might give rise to mood symptoms or sleep difficulties at night um so so those are just a few a few different Pathways in the body and But ultimately um in my opinion it all starts in the guts and and that's often the opinion of other functional medicine practitioners as well yeah I think you know looking at that you know you mentioned inflammation there you know inflammation is the activation of the immune system isn't it and all of these things seem to come from the foods that we consume you know you mentioned um serotonin which is an adult I mean um synthesized from tryptophan uh as you say this the cold factors involved like iron zinc and b12 um now the foods we eat uh that are caused excess carbohydrate consumption for example will lead to insulin resistance and inflammation um you know this can lower our immune system uh in particular things that the as2 reset does leaving us more susceptible to viruses and infections and when we get these viruses and infections and the body's a quest as I am isn't it uh interferadine that takes a lot of circulation now one of the main core factors to produce serotonin is of the circulation so the body could have an abundant amount of iron stored in ferritin but none of this bioavailable and then this affects the serotonin production um so all of this comes back down to the foods that we eat isn't it which again people find absolutely crazy to understand but what we eat massively affects the way that we feel and the way that the brain functions um and I I genuinely believe I I we've mentioned this before you know we're not against medication in the treatment for certain things but predominantly I think if you eat a a carnivore or ketogenic-based lifestyle low in carbohydrates avoiding grains and Seed oils so we're avoiding glycation and oxidative stress um you know we've we're combating and reducing inflammation and that's what PHP does also beta hydroxide it does and it blocks nlp3 inflamazon which is the main inflamed remark within the body um pathway and it um all of these things uh help prevent the these illnesses now our need for medication uh you know goes away I mentioned earlier in the talk I can't remember the last time I've taken medication um yet I was on an abundant I was on a myriad of medication every day for all sorts of things and now I am completely medication free all from from changing my my diet yeah yeah absolutely it really frustrates me um working particularly in the NHS where the food is terrible that people are fed in hospital and um we're just piling on different medications on top of this underlying inflammation and immune system that activation that's going on and no nobody really spends much time thinking about addressing the underlying cause and yes medications can help and they can help to suppress symptoms um but as we all know new pharmaceutical comes without potential for side effects and I just wish that more people were aware that they could really ultimately improve their mental health by changing their lifestyle and what they eat and I do think it's all about diet so I think other things are super important as well such as light routines particularly for circadian health um and and limiting toxins and and so on but yeah diets certainly a fundamental place to start and I I'd be very surprised if people could get to a place of um complete Wellness without doing something at least to address your diet I'm a really big fan of Dr Sarah myhill's work and um it's particularly a Paleo ketogenic diet that she promotes for people and suggests and I think that's a really good place for people to start if they're you know not everybody needs to be carnivore but we certainly see a lot of people in this community who have amazing Health Transformations and I know of quite a number of people with major mental disorders who and for whatever reason keto just didn't do it for them in terms of resolving all of their symptoms whereas carnivores one step further um in terms of promoting recovery so I think people have got different options and everybody's oh let's say everyone's bio individuals so particularly when it comes to our gut microbiome you just don't know exactly where somebody's starting from unless you do detailed testing and even then I think there's so much that we don't know yet about that field uh Steve you're on mute I think I think the delay is a little bit disconcerting for a few people but I just wanted to know um I've got a question about sleep which I'm going to put on uh if you want to answer it that would be great it's not as specific as uh to your job but someone here uh TFC locks uh I have problems with sleep on Carnival wake up in the middle of the night like two to three times just wondering what your advice is for fixing this issue and also wondering butter is fine for the fat increase so you got any views on that Rachel yeah so my first thought is that it might be a bit of a cortisol issue if you're um waking up in the middle of the night particularly if you're unable to get back to sleep and I suppose I would wonder a little bit um sometimes gender can be relevant in this in terms of fasting protocols that people are doing uh so I used to I started off carnivore doing quite a lot of fasting and then in the end just decided to stop skipping breakfast because um I think particularly for women having a meal early in earlier in the day can be really helpful for normalizing your cortisol response during the day because I think I think a bad thing that some a bad habit that sometimes people run into is if they're just fasting all morning and particularly if you're using caffeine or have coffee on board and you can end up just um disrupting your circadian rhythms because food is a secondary signal to the Circadian clocks about what time of day it is and as well as getting morning sunlight I think if you're doing a lot of fasting particularly skipping breakfast then that might be one thing to try to scale back a bit because fasting can be an additional stress around the body and the butter yeah I mean I'm a fan of butter I'm not I think there's been quite a big Trend in carnivore um in the part of our community to add loads and loads of butter and brown butter bites and and um very intense um intense fat load into the diet and I think some people can run into difficulties with gaining weight on that but certainly from a fat point of view I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with butter I'm just not a huge fan of making it your main your main fat in your diet so I I think it can be complementary to other other meats in the diet um but there's certainly nothing wrong with butter unless you're someone who's highly sensitive to the case and so the the protein in in cow's milk in which case you might be better off using ghee or thinking about another Fat such as Tallow or other animal fats Rich yeah yeah I completely agree with that and and as Rich directly says you know fasting uh can can be a contributing factor to elevated Corpus all levels uh you know fasting is fantastic I I tend to fast every day but it can have uh negative impacts on cortisol um another thing is inadequate sodium uh inadequate sodium you know in the day a canal of it cortisol um uh coffee so I don't know what what do we do when you know what do a lot of people do when they begin the carnival keto Journey they begin with you know the Bulletproof Coffee isn't it um so they end up consuming way more coffee uh and I know we've covered coffee a couple of times but too much caffeine um can cause disruption to the adrenals uh leading to increased quarters also all of these it's not just the caffeine but it's again the interruption the court that's all into the into the system there and timings as well so um you know we're told to eat um well before bedtime but I eat just before bed I find I don't sleep if I eat you know four hours before and the reason that I do this one because I eat and I want to sleep but I look at animals in the wild once an animal has caught its prey and eaten it you know it goes to sleep we cover this earlier with Anthony chafe isn't it that that's what an animal does once once it's it's called as prayer and it goes to sleep but and that's what I do so I tend to eat just before bed um so there's a few things there to uh to address I think isn't it a few things to try and agree completely with the butter I think there are better sauces I'm a fan of but uh I think um the casein is lowering better than uh the milks uh you know again I sort of put buttered into a different category from milk uh the casein content is a lot lower but if you are susceptible to intestinal probability uh and suffer with those issues then you know would be a better option but yeah a few suggestions there to uh to implement and try possibly but um fantastic any thoughts on you Steve well I think after a 24-hour live stream I might not have problems sleeping but actually with the screen for 24 hours I may I may and I think that that's one of the things I would always add it isn't just about what you eat it it is about what you're exposing yourself to all day and if you if you sort of run your iPad or a mobile device and you're watching something scary or the news triggers you you're not making the environment conducive to going to sleep are you you're using your animal analogy you know if you were out in the uh forest with your dog and you know the Twigs were going and rustling was happening on your dog wouldn't sleep you wouldn't sleep because you'd feel like whoa I've got I've got to stay awake then if someone was flashing lights at you you'd be like well I don't like that so but we're doing that we're we're exposing ourselves to noise and lights and things we don't know and things that Annoy Us or scare us and then go oh I can't sleep I can't sleep and it's like you know diet is in credibly important but I think these other things that that we expose ourselves to we do need to look at so um goes back to exactly you know what uh what Rachel mentioned earlier but these uh external uh you know sources a day yet you know fundamental about these external sources like massive contributing factors as well but what I tend to find is that when you begin this journey you know of of self-improvement uh these incremental changes you begin to look at other things and you you begin to look at um cold water therapy and and groaned in and all these you become a biohacker you know with what began in just taking up bread trying to respect carbohydrate now suddenly you know you're you're a biohacker that's doing all of these things and buy your hack in your body into better health and uh it is an incremental system but you know fantastic answers there I think yeah and I mean this this reality chick which is a great name by the way uh coffee shops have become the sweet shops of the modern High Street Costa is in every hospital and the sugar content of their Cakes and Pastries is off the scale um I included that comment because I lost my parents many many years ago and before I knew about carnivore and certainly before I knew about low carb and I have found it quite strange that they would feed this you know Heist now I look back high sugary meals and then give my mother a sleeping tablet to help her sleep and she's in a stressful environment she had uh well she died from it what she was in hospital for but then at five o'clock in the morning they would wake her up to take all her readings so they they were completely messing up for circadian rhythms feeding of the wrong food um and I think that's a stressful situation so we've got a psychiatrist here but not many people are asking questions that you would expect you see they're talking more about environment and and food in that that respect so I was wondering we're talking about cortisol do you think uh Dr Rachel that it does raise blood sugar you know and if you're stressed is that is that part of the mechanism of why some people can't sleep and POS you know feel anxious yeah absolutely um but unfortunately in mainstream meds and that's not something that we look at or a test so in terms of NHS and mainstream Psychiatry um I you know there will be a bit of an awareness about stress hormones and so on and being relevant when somebody presents in a highly anxious or agitated state but um I can't see from uh the last 19 20 years of working within psychology that that's something we actually look at objectively however it can be done um but people need to go privately certainly in the UK for that sort of thing I mean do you feel quite passionately about hospital food do you feel that they are going to look at that at some points and the cafes or do you just think it's just making too much money for them that you'll never make any inroads in getting people to eat properly in hospitals gosh yeah that that feels like a mammoth uh project to take on um particularly oh gosh the NHS is such a massive organization with um and very siled so so many different departments and one Health Board doesn't necessarily work the same to the next and it's certainly something I've had thoughts about in terms of the hospital I work in but in order to make any change and a big scale in the NHS that's very tricky very difficult there's quite a focus on quality improvement these days which can be helpful but it tends to be starting off on a very small scale so test out a very small project and then try to generalize that if you if you um have good results from it so I'm not saying it's something that couldn't be done um but it's it was certainly take a long time I think and a lot of effort to make any difference there so what do you what do you offer people um do you offer online coaching or can they contact you if they've got any anxiety issues what what do you cover yeah so I'm working now with um my business partner Ali Houston and we founded Matt by um so people can go to metsai.com Center metabolic Psychiatry and we do coaching there and so we're doing small group coaching at the moment and we'll have a course that will run ultimately twice a year for people who are just interested in metabolic approaches to Mental Health um at the moment I'm not doing any direct one-to-one private work but that's something that may well change in the near future so I'm looking into some different options there and I've just put your Instagram up on the screen as well so people want to follow you they can get that um link and contact you which would be really good so um yeah have you enjoyed coming onto the 24 hour live stream I have thank you but my internet is doing my head in so I'm gonna have to contact my provider because I'm actually playing I know I'm plugged in so I'm not on Wi-Fi and there's still a delay so uh there is a question just before you go uh let's have a look any thoughts on increased adhc in children these days is there a connection with the sad diet yes absolutely I would say um so we the studies that show that um particularly in autism and ADHD there can be an increased susceptibility to Leaky guts and this can then trigger off inflammation in the brain and and so on but there are also some slight genetic abnormalities that can mean that people have higher requirements for certain micronutrients um for example um the mthf pharah cycle which is to do with folates and bioavailable folate is one that a lot of functional medicine people are very into testing um but there there's certainly a lot of evidence that um I'm certainly in my mind as well that the symptoms of ADHD can be treated via diet and I've had people contacting me just dming me privately saying that they've done really well in terms of improving their symptoms and you get cases within functional medicine that show complete resolution of symptoms just looking at diet and lifestyle and environmental and environmental measures so so I I'm not sitting here thinking that ADHD is a deficiency of stimulant medication I'm not saying that those can't help some people but I think there are other ways around around looking at diet and nutrient requirements for that group yeah I think I was listening to an autobiography actually uh lee Max autobiography and he was diagnosed as he's a comedian by the way for the people that are not in the UK and you know he's he's as an adult being told that he's got ADHD but I think he also went vegetarian so I'm just wondering if there is a connection but anyway uh so Dr Rachel thank you for coming on uh Rich do you want to say your goodbyes as well yeah Rachel's been an absolute pleasure um I'd love to connect I'd say this and get you on the podcast as well so if you're up for that we'll we'll get something booked in but fantastic chatting I love going into into the weeds in regards to the science for things and then yeah you've appeased my uh my scientific nature with uh with the Convoy today so thank you so much for coming on board very much appreciated okay thank you yeah happy to chat anytime sounds good ah okay lovely thanks Rachel thank you yeah just just do it just go just to go back to that really quickly um you know this circles back to the polyphenols isn't it and um you know things like curcumin and turmeric uh again the oxalates are things in Spanish um you know coming back or calling me dude you know about DNA damage and causing hyperlox Oreo which leads to hyperthoudism and autism in children um so again it's all connected isn't it it all comes back to to plants um you know carnivore is the way forward and you've got to shoot now Stephen Avenue so yes five hours we've done I have to be away for 30 minutes and you've got a guest coming in having a hard timer past timer Stephen so I'm gonna go and do that and um you've got you you can and you can let the guests come in can't you Richard um I don't know I don't think so I haven't seen anybody pop up I haven't seen any um thing um can you get them to enter in the room when they're there I don't think so can you are they on a pre-screen when they pop up because I haven't seen anything till they come on the screen oh you don't get a little screen at the bottom with them coming on oh I was hoping your guests would be on so I could let him in uh yeah I've just just messaged now um so I'm hoping you pop on um yeah right okay I'm hoping he's on his way but uh yeah I I don't think I've got to access this scent to allow him uh to come on unfortunately right okay right well I'll uh I'll have to do my 30 minutes away but I'll have to wait for your pop-on to pop on and then I'll pop off and um anyway five hours we've done so there's 19 to go and lots and lots of guests like I say somebody asked if Ken Berry is coming on but he he uh he's just too busy which is a shame did ask him here we go so I can let Phil come in and let you uh do your your stuff for 30 minutes you fantastic let me add him to the Stream hello ah there it is yes very well good good so the other the co-host Stephen has just had to leave us for 30 minutes or just to give you the rundown Phil we will we're live for 24 hours uh we've got viewers from all over the world we've got some uh besides myself obviously some World leading speakers within the carnival Community um so Steven's just snipped out so it's just you and I to touch base but what I wanted to do I mean you've kindly agreed to come on and share part of your journey um do you want to first let I'm sure everybody knows exactly who you are you need no introduction but do you want to do a quick intro and tell everyone uh yeah I tell you I might feel the power tailing 16 times loving it 16. we've got the seniors World Championships now so that's what we're working on exactly exactly so just a quick rundown uh for everyone who's watching now that um Phil um uh reached out to me recently uh Phil's always been known for looking um at ways to improve athletic performance as well as health and well-being he's always been known as an out of the box thinker um he's come across uh you know key door carnivore that sort of lifestyle and looked into it found me on a podcast I believe Phil reached out to me through the share chat um and then we began working together yeah and um it it is honestly I mean over the years ever since I was little really I've been an on and off diet probably most of the people watching have been exactly the same but this is the first time and I can say this I'm not art that I don't want to change I'm enjoying it it's like you know they always say it's not a diet it's a lifestyle and every time someone used to say that to me over the years it was in my head and I couldn't stick to it but now especially now I've got more time but more time at home you know living out of hotels country to Country I mean we were literally worldwide weekend and week out so it was difficult to to to get get your regime to eat us what you should be eating you know so it's it's a lot more easier now but it's it this is what I want to do now for the rest of my life because I'm enjoying it and it's it's easy the first thing Elijah used to say to me when I wake up in the morning what do you want for your tea I mean I don't know what do you want for your tea it was half past seven in the morning but we don't say that no more because it makes things simple we haven't got as many dishes the sinks empty which is another one as well saves your protein or washing up so it's it's a great it's a great lifestyle and it's and it makes you feel good that's the main thing I've always wanted to get up in the morning and get that feel good feeling which I've never had before I was all I was always like jet lagged and then in a Muslim yeah you know what I mean I know this know that feeling all too well Phil Ascot we are done a little while ago I was just giving you a hey Phil so glad to see that you're still on it um yeah so I feel like Scott giving you a shout out there and lots of Praise coming from from the live chat as well uh from everybody uh so yeah brilliant thanks for coming on but let's get back to your journey so I mean you're currently um what's the what was your driving factor for beginning the journey you know for most people it's weight loss but I I feel it for you it was a a different driving Factor do you want to go into that there was a few things I was I guess I committed to the seniors adjacent team with Jason Francis Jason Thames a promoter Jason Francis as a promoter but he's running O'Sullivan's manager that's how people might know Jason Francis and Jason Thames got a company called modus which do a lot of promotion work in the darts so we started a series they've asked me if I'll commit which I which I am I've signed a contracts are committee so starting off thinking you know just do what you used to do today but I haven't really been competitive for like five or six years and I didn't realize how hard it is to get back into being much fit if like a footballer you know it's okay in the training ground which when you're on the pitch when you're under pressure you know you seem to lose something then we hit I needed a new hip so I built that up and it was on the 28th of last month and I canceled it I re I'm going to rearrange it if I have to do then I'm going to do it again well I've decided did a lot of research that I want to see if going a bit more Carnival doing everything right having a bit more Fatima diet rather than carbohydrates get me weight down and see how I feel then and see if see if I can do it without having operations operation I want is the last choice cutting bits out my body so I've decided that I'm not going to give it a go see how I feel but if everything's fine then that's me not for the rest of my life I won't meet anywhere so that was the main one then then obviously then I wanted my dad to become better so I got a little gym uh built in the back of my yard with a little bit Big Shed thing and then um so go and then I do a few shoulder exercises now every night don't do a lot I'm only in there for maybe two or three minutes to get that really good burn on your shoulders then I'll stop and it's working wonders I met you in more 180s now I think than when I was at the best but but all I've got to do was put that now onto the stage so I've got to work out now that little Gap in the middle which is that little bit there I think so we're gonna we will do each we'll put it right and and you know thanks to people like yourself who are giving me advice it's great for loving it yeah it's absolutely life-changing it and I think you know the the beat the catches that fish initially if for most people is weight loss but the weight loss is a side effect of being of being healthy and living the lifestyle as you you know correctly coin it um so you've lost a little bit of weight to date as well how much are we down so far probably probably John up to now about two stones and then I've just started to Plateau a little bit so I'll be ringing you tomorrow get ready get your phone charged um so I'm I've got a few things in my own mind which I'm going to run over with you like today I'm having a couple bit of carbs today but not a lot I've had like 25 grams of boiled rice just this morning I even at the rights on its own and I loved it that's right white rice yeah yeah good Jasmine so just for the listeners and if it was white rice is left in free so it is the better option of that races so so I know now because that's 14 grams of carbs and then a little bit later I'm just gonna have a little bit of rib eye not much but a good say 22 20 grams of protein and then for me tea I'm having a curry with some more rice so I'll probably have about 50 grams of carbs today maybe maybe a bit more maybe 60. but I'm just gonna yeah energy level up a little bit and then tomorrow I'm gonna go clean again so maybe Monday Tuesday Wednesday I'm gonna go clean with no carbohydrates at all and then maybe Thursday maybe 50 grams of carbs and then I was going to go then to suddenly and maybe have 100 to 150 grams of carbs just to carb load a little bit so I'll be wait I'll be doing it tomorrow yeah it'll be an interesting chat um yeah I mean again it's uh you know just to reiterate it to the guys this thing that um you know we support all aspects of low-carb ketogenic and Carnival um and these changes are incremental we're all on our own Journey not everyone is as strict as myself um you know I'm zero carb generally um but obviously you know this is an incremental change for Phil so yeah for weeks Richard as you know so yeah interchange but want to go into anything I have to go into it 100 I can't do it any other way otherwise I can't do it like even me even be cooking things you know anything with tea fall on anything with a non-stick coating they've gone so everything now I bought this one yesterday um the allergen oven because it's metal stainless steel and it's glass so I'm cooking in that now because I know that the non-stick coating is can give you cancer so that goes out the window I don't just cook for myself I do it for my grandkids me wife and you know what I mean my daughters and my son so I want them to eat as healthy as I can my saucepans are made out of titanium which is the hardest metal so it doesn't give any uh taste out at all so if you boil water on a titanium saucepan it's just water you know it's a bit expensive but then a lifetime wanting to so you save your money in the long run so what is going 100 and I love it I love it with your will I find your world your your expertise it starts at this and then it just goes like this yeah and it doesn't stop it's like a black hole in the University you just keep learning all the time and I love it love it yeah it is and if this is yeah I mean going back to the conversation we had with uh Dr Rachel who was just on now um you know it begins with restricting bread or lowering carbohydrate and then it gravitates into changing other Foods removing certain plants yeah and then we look at other external factors and just to show people uh how strict and dedicated fillers to this so Phil recently competed uh in this the senior starter tournament at Yeovil um uh stayed in a hotel and Phil took his own camp in stove so he could make his own food in his hotel room uh I mean if that's not dedication I don't know what it is you know so yeah the maid asked me for me autographed I thought it was Gordon Ramsay what you don't realize as well because you're reaching it a normal diet I'd say a normal day it's where you're eating most things but when when I was doing it last week well last month I was sticking to one thing so I was having a chicken breast but when you you start introducing other foods which your body doesn't accept black whey protein I didn't realize whey protein knocked me Bandy I don't know why it just it makes me nervous so strange so a food intolerance test saying is cow's milk and whey protein isn't so good for me so I tried it I've been trying it and it did send me a little bit handy and the day that I played um at Yeovil and I got beat on a Saturday afternoon I had whey protein for my breakfast so I've dropped it I've dropped one there so we can put that right we can move forward and put it right exactly I mean just to Circle back to that the the first match that you played in you were the outsider for um and you won that uh comfortably uh I think you know any at one point he was looking to be uh four legs to one Victory wasn't it uh but you saved so I think you had the most um the most amount of 180s um and then yeah day two again I think a number of factors again food related wrongful choice but also the fact that you're back to competition you're standing for a long period of time and what people don't understand is I mean that is that you need to be match fit standing in that position yeah is is stress on the body and I I know I'm sure you all might be saying but you're you're 62. is that right yeah 62. 62 years young and and still fighting fit I'm looking only 40 films great but as we adopt now deeper and become a little bit more strict the body's going to produce and you delays more beta hydroxybutrin and it's going to block nlrp3 inflamazon it's going to lower inflammation these aches and pains will begin to to dissipate um you know so I you know the next match I think is September the second in York um and you're going to be a lot fitter for that and the beauty is as well that BHB be the hydroxyboot breaches the blood-brain barrier and glucose cancer your concentration now when you're practicing uh is is on point isn't it I mean you know you're you're hitting those 180s uh as if you were back on on the main tour um which is really exciting we just need to understand yeah the only thing now I've got to work on is uh like me Fitness of walking up and down because cosmith was killing me all the time I never used to do so much practice I got a little bit lazy so now when I go into model it is at least tomorrow afternoon two hours practice I shall go in it once I finish the podcast I'll go in and properties for about one hour but I'm trying what's the cricket at the same time because England are doing okay so um yeah so I know I've got to get him get me Fitness up like The Walking Fitness so I can spend more time on my feet so yeah so first thing in the morning I've got some electric bikes but maybe messages about electric bike so I'm going to go out in the morning first thing before coffee and anything else because we normally have a cup of coffee I'm gonna go and um have a little cycle maybe I mean you can do four or five mile an electric bike in 10-15 minutes you know what I mean so I spend half an hour just tunnel around nothing strenuous I'm not a totally France yet so just enjoy it yeah and then yeah just get that blood going and get your hips going and get your shoulders going and then up three or four hours in to get ready for practice yeah so I mean it you know this is a multi-stage approach isn't it for health well-being weight loss I think for four months because I mean I know that's what people don't understand uh you know one of the advantages of living this lifestyle and producing key Dawns is you know BHP helps you concentrate so what what I found in your will was that to us you know the latter end of that match because the lights were so intense you know you could see that the sweat was dripping off everybody up there and you could see the other players were starting to wane at the end concentration was lagging but you were 100 focused but the on stage at the oval it was over 52 degrees and so that's how I watching when you think outside it might be 30 degrees in Spain it was 52 degrees with that being in sauna whoa and stand there for that long time so I mean all of those uh you know uh yeah effects uh or external factors gonna have massive effect on the body especially in regards to standing that long the concentration for that long as you say rehydration and again um well that's something you were doing wasn't it was using my electronics to rehydrate the state to stay you know uh well hydrated on stage but it yeah it's it's it's exciting stuff because you know people look at this as a weight loss thing and and then you know they look at it as health which is exactly why you're doing it but you wouldn't have thought that live in this lifestyle would help improve athletic performance to the point of you know of concentration uh but concentration is incredibly important especially if somebody uh begins to overtake you in in a professional match and it's easy to become and that's what I noticed with you your concentration was was a hundred percent on point um and I'll be honest I'm super excited for September the second because I think we're gonna see a new filter that I think yeah I think so I mean so you've recently it started to introduce a little bit of carb but I mean prior to that you know we've experimented with strict Carnival as well and we yeah so what what what were you typically eating um on the strict Carnival before I mean I did have a little bit of cabbage and a little bit of broccoli um maybe once a week but mainly I'd have in the morning I'd have an omelette with a little sprinkle of cheese maybe maybe three eggs but I'd only have two yolks and three egg whites so that a baby first meal and then at dinner time but I pound it down to about the thickness of my little finger then a pan fried and a pan fried I put it on fairly warm at the beginning and then I put coconut oil in and I do it to about two minutes one side flip it over two minutes then I put some butter in and turn it right down to about medium and then I cook it until I get my temperature of 165 in the middle I've got a little um thermometer that's sticking a little pro it'll get to 165 and believe me it's the nicest chicken you'll ever ever eat and it's lovely and I used to stick that on its own maybe it should have a little bit of recording with the gravy but I thought maybe the fat from the coconut oil and the butter will be okay and then a little bit later on at night time which was which was about 220 grams in cold weight in raw weight which is probably about 60 grams of protein so probably up to about 80 grams of protein there and then I'd maybe have a little bit more chicken a little bit later on and try and try and get me protein up to about because you you set a figure at 190 which you think it's easy but it actually isn't but you have to get used to it and do it but it's become quite easy towards the end especially eating the way eating the chicken wow that looks great yeah and you know it's it is important to remember that um you know lead me uh lead meets are fantastic but we need the fat as well within the diet isn't it which is where you know you will add in the fats in so I mean we always tried to promote the din protein with fat and we've experiment I mean the reason that you gravitated more towards the Lena cats uh is because you didn't seem to get on very well with um I think eggs seem to be problematic isn't it because uh we believe it was the over mucoid and um which is a protein in the egg and uh uh the the fattier cuts of steak I think were causing issues um early on so it's all about experimenting and seeing what works for you isn't there so do you want to tell us a little bit about that because the yolk was all in one piece you know obviously that's when I was getting R burn off it up acid reflux but when I mixed the agoma so it's all mixed together don't get it so I've had I've had a omelette this morning and I haven't had it I haven't done it at all and then forget it well say dinner time I'm gonna put some little chicken wings in because I've got the fat on there so I'm getting some chicken wings maybe six six chicken wings or something and then it was kind of likes them as well so she'll finish the rest stop because you can get like a big box of chicken wings from the supermarket for the patterns you know what I mean it's great it saves you money and it saves you a lot of washing up as well but uh and then for tea time I've got a rib eye out defrosting so we'll slice that up then and we'll make a curry kind of makes our own Curry so I think she's doing the balti um I love onions in mushrooms and then we'll have a little bit of rice with that maybe about 50 50 grams of rice which is 100 grams of rice is 28 grams of protein now 28 grams of carbohydrate sorry so that's today and then tomorrow as I said I'll go back go back to I mean um because we went sometimes I mean yesterday I didn't have that much food and I got the scales and I put half a pounder it doesn't make sense so it's only water weight obviously but I'm still working at it and I'm enjoying it and I'm gonna keep going I'm I'm too addicted to it now it's so easy anybody struggling away believe me you don't crave for anything I mean these sweets they can be in there they've probably gone rotten now and don't even want look at him cakes biscuits not interested bread there's bread on the side there though could we do Robbie's Daddy's breakfast and everything but other than that we don't eat it never yeah which is fantastic and again yeah I mean it's just to reiterate the fact isn't it that uh it is a journey um you know some of the foods that um that you're consuming is it's about an experiment in the see what works for you yeah and I think over the next couple of weeks you know we're going to gravitate into being a little bit more strict uh we're going to look at you know the the macro reassures uh of your fats the protein obviously which aim to reduce or completely remove the carbohydrate but um it is interesting interesting Journey isn't it because um you know you were thriving in the beginning and then there was sort of uh you know a drop out in between with mental Clarity and things you know and stall weight loss um and then it's almost done sort of you know a a 360 and now you're back sort of looks looks to be gravitating back more into a more an email based type yeah yeah yeah yeah you've got to get used to you find red bit red meat can be a little bit harder to digest for some people depends I think over the years because I've experially you know been on different diets and everything else and done this and done that I think it's Knack at least don't look up a little bit so I think I've got to get myself to get my body right first I think my body's got repaired and get running properly like having your engine re-tuned I think that's the only thing I can put it down to and then uh start from afresh so I'm going to keep doing it as I say and then open my body will repair itself and then it can run properly now at all before I was having tablets off the up from the chemist every five minutes you know what I mean I've heard every day drinking water for you know just that one advantage you know it's worth continuing with the lifestyle I think when we looked into this um it was the the high lacking content in the food that you were consuming the lectins were bind into the Masters and causing the recent histamine which was leading to acid reflux and when you took certain foods out because early on we were still consuming things like tomatoes and bell peppers things that contain lectins and when we took those out the acid reflux just cleared up almost overnight I think yeah yeah tomorrow Tomatoes yeah and again you know within the keto Community tomato is a staple it's one of the ones that we are told that we you know we can consume ad-lib but it again it just adds more weight to the fact that these plants contain these five double accents these plant toxins which cause issues within the body and it goes well beyond can we remove grain so that you know we remove the breads the pastas the rice and all this because of because of a carbohydrate binding protein called lectins uh in the form of regime remember what people don't understand is that these plants contain lectins in the form of phytohemoglobin um so we need to remove you know these foods and when we did you massively uh you know repaired and recovered from from this uh from this acid reflux but it is a journey um you know we're getting there um I think it's um it's an exciting Journey I'm really excited to see your progress and how you develop in in regards to health and I think it's it's one of these things that we we can't feel it because from one aspect or another you know you're either going to lose a temper weight and be healthier and improve athletic performance uh and make you know this big comeback in in the seniors tour always going to be two two of those at least you know um the best results were too for me uh is the tape Magic of course it is yeah exactly I've got one I only did one measurement just above my belly button so I went down me waist just a Bobby belly button and when it first started I was 53 and a half inches around me belly button so God knows what I was like when you're sitting down so then I did it this morning I was I was 47 and a half so it's coming down it's absolute bottoms where I was gonna throw them in the bin because they were too Thai so now too baggies yeah even though you know you wait weight loss is like plateaued a little bit the anxious are coming down and that's a bit strange as well it's it's it's weird so yeah just gonna carry on keep going and then see what happens and I'm I'm not going to stop because this is so easy to do yeah and I think that's what a lot of people seem to not understand is that they over complicate things in regards to what to eat Thai means to eat um and it's just simply a case if he's doing intuitively eat when you're hungry if you're not hungry don't eat uh you know we went to a spell initially with you where you said look I'm not hungry and we've almost had to force feed isn't it um two days I wasn't hungry and on the third day off weird yeah and that's fantastic I mean fasting we know we've covered the benefits the Epson and the Downs of fasting and the benefits of autophagy and things but it's um you know to go two days fasted without feeling hungry it is incredible but for the sake of testing your metabolism for the next stage uh that we're going to implement you know we have actively tried to increase the protein and fat of me and I remember when we had the conversation via Zoom I'll never forget the look on your face when we worked out how much protein you were eating intuitively and then I think we almost quadrupled this didn't we I thought you'd last week honestly he's gone he's not right how can anybody eat all that food and shed weight we've been down local supermarket this morning and we bought a big bag of rice honestly it's a it's like that and it was seven pounds so I mean there's probably a hundred portions of I said so it's quite cheap you know I mean anybody that's struggling a little bit because I know the electric bills never you know everybody's bills have gone up it actually isn't that much yet more expensive than buying junk food in fact I think it's a lot cheaper foreign thank you you also get a lot of your protein from a relative of a family as well as they mean when we look at the cost of living in regards to protein I'm Carnival all I eat is meat I spend 60 pound a week on meat that feeds myself my wife and my little girl um and again just circling back to what you said I mean not not that we're pushing or promoting rice um you know by any means but it again it's these incremental changes isn't it um you know it uh it's it's you know we don't we don't want to get everybody eating buckets full of rice no no but but it is these incremental ideally you know we wouldn't put it in at all isn't it but it uh you know we do understand that it's these incremental changes we don't expect you to begin a journey immediately and for you it's this gravitation from low carb and the low impact carbs in regards to lactic content um replacing the foods that you eat with highly nutrient dense Meats uh quality fats uh and making these incremental changes and as we go along you know we're gonna we're gonna facilitate these changes and hopefully hopefully you know within an hour my my ambition is get me a body where I feel 100 when you wake up in the morning I don't know any I don't know if I need no carbs or I need 100 carbs a day I don't know so I've got to work everything out with you and then find out exactly like like you would have had a sports car what whatever petrol goes in that car it's perfect but that person because we're all different so some people need more some people need less you know so it's a manual working everything out and that's that's what makes it so um so exciting I think it's great and we're making progress every every week you know those figures and the mental cloudy and you sleep I think which is uh you know a real important factor that we've uh We've touched base a couple of times so we've been live since eight o'clock this morning um so we're five and a half hours in uh but one of the reoccurring topics keeps coming up is is sleep um you know some people say that they struggle but you've not there's a massive Improvement in your sleep since yeah uh you know removing a lot of these toxic foods isn't it yeah not every night I mean every pool during lockdown and just before we were waking up every night on the dot oof two o'clock three o'clock watching the TV try and get back to sleep again and a lot of people are doing the same thing I don't know why whether it was these injections they give us I don't know but something was not right seriously yeah and every night and wide awake three o'clock turn the TV on and then buy time seven o'clock comes you won't go back to sleep now you've gone tired so it was a lot of night it all depends on the weather as well I mean there's been a couple of nights up in Stoke here it's been red hot so you know we woke up at like four o'clock in the morning because we're both red hot even though we've only got like a little throw over on the bed you know about as thick as a tea towel but it's just the weather as well can affect your sleep hello Steven's back this is Stephen Curry Hello nice to meet you Phil Andrew bloody how are you sorry I said that with you I'm I'm good yeah yeah well yeah I mean I'm 59 right and all right [Laughter] we've got our next guest lined up now oh we are fantastic pleasure thanks for sharing your stories tomorrow and we'll Implement those changes but brilliant stuff thank you no problem at all no worries look forward to chatting take care mom all right that's the legendary 16 time world champion hello have you met Richard before no I don't know Richard hi hey Emily nice to meet you thanks for coming on board super excited shut up actually because coach Emily was on the reverse TV series and she's one of the coaches at the steak and butter gang but do you want to just quickly for everybody that's out there because we've got quite a massive audience today uh give us your story a little sort of sizzling short story about what everyone yeah well I mean now now oh wow yeah absolutely so um I have been carnivore for two and a half years so what are you at now Stephen how long is your carnivore how long have I been Carnival four years four years okay well I guess I can't ever gain on you gain on you but you know over time the amount is gonna like get shorter between us in a way so yeah um so that has been a carnivore for me was like the finisher to my health Journey so my health Journey was keto fasting extended fasting imminent fasting um I definitely come from that history of morbid obesity so I was double my size in my previous life and so I was up at 300 pounds and had been at that for um many different periods during my life with Mom it was you know having four kids and um just not understanding the the types of food that were ruining my life and were just making everything a disaster in my life emotionally energy sleep my capacity to just um live the life that I wanted to live um and so it was the the fast testing journey in 2017 when I read Dr Fung's book that kind of got me started in all this but what really what happened for me is I needed that nutrition part because I we know so many people now that have been on that keto and fasting journey and it didn't take it didn't solve their food addiction it didn't solve their emotional issues with food and because they really never got the nutrition they needed so it was one thing like what to do in the fast I learned how to fast like a champ and I loved it but I really um the keto the keto treats the artificial sweeteners this you know the nuts um vegetables like that just they were not my friend and they were not helping me and they couldn't help me to make good solid decisions for my life I never had that food piece so carnivore for me gave me the peace with food it gave me that food could be in its in its uh the spot that it needed to be as nutrition amazing delicious nutrition and it gave me um this huge mental Clarity and the the lasting success on maintenance because you know there's there's a whole situation of that uh if you didn't lose the weight and gain your health um in a way that is sustainable long term is a way that you want to live your life long term then um you can't expect those results to stay with you because you're not going to like it you're just going to abandon it so that's my story my I lost my first hundred pounds with keto fasting my last 50 with um fasting combined with a carnivore diet and then I've been able to get involved in coaching I've been able to help others figure out just all the journey this you know cooking for your kids and family Dynamics and how to social dynamics and so I love just problem solving and helping people through those and just you know just being an example of yeah you can do this long term it's absolutely sustainable um and so yeah that's that's kind of where I've been yeah it's good so I'm losing about 150 pounds there's no mean Feats is it but we've talked a lot coach Emily and I about health is actually more important because the weight loss is a side effect and many people think it's the other way around I've lost this weight and everything's going to get better but no I think once you eat the right nutrition and your Healthcare is better because it's the right nutrition you're not making yourself overweight I mean it just seems everyone looks at it the wrong way so Richard have you got a question for Coach Emily yeah I mean what a fantastic amount of weight to lose I mean you've beaten me there 150 mine is 107. um so you've beaten me hands down um absolutely incredible a question that I get asked quite often and probably more sore for you um is the skin you know you've lost all this weight um are you left with any saggy skin or stretch marks I'm I'll give you you know an example of me I'm I don't I don't have any saggy skin any stretch my ball um and I was just wondering how you know that that is with yourself have you noticed the skin has as as regressed typed again um and I've got a theory behind this as well but I'd just like to hear you know if you've noticed anything similar in regards to stretch marks and and uh and and skin elasticity and yeah phenomenal so I'm I yeah you know I've always had some level of stretch marks even as a as a girl I did and so I don't know if that was just like I mean I've struggled with my weight from that whole time so I cannot claim there's there's things that I can say that are noticeable and not noticeable I I don't have um hanging curtains which is phenomenal because I I would think that I would um and so I I don't have the typical when I hear about people that have lost that amount of weight and I've seen and they've had to have surgery no I really haven't had that so for me I attribute that it took four years to lose the weight so it wasn't a super super fast and there was so much autophagy involved in that process for me and then I also enjoy lifting weights and so I think that probably just like the weightlifting has had a big impact the fact that it wasn't super um quick that it happened over time and the fact that so much of it involved water fasting and so it just to me there was a lot of autophagy that was happening during that process I definitely have some but it's just I don't know it's not um it's not what you would think so yeah that's phenomenal for you Richard I know I want to hear your theories about this absolutely so I mean yeah you've just hit everything on on the head I mean uh you know when we're fasting it puts us into a state of autophagy which is seller repair regeneration uh you know the the body will use amyloid plaques from from the body and through scar tissues and stretch marks and this is why so I used to suffer with stretch marks along my arms um especially when I began sort of weight lifting lifting and things but um it was only fairly recently when somebody asked me because I used to compete professionally um in in the in the sport of bodybuilding uh I won't bore you with you know with my story uh but it um uh yeah I was left with with no stretch marks and somebody somebody recently asked you know where has all of your loose skin gone where you know why don't you have stretch marks and I didn't realize this until they'd mentioned it and I put it down to fasting and the fact that I was ketogenic and coming back to you know a point that we made earlier just by being ketogenic your body is in a state of brown fat activation it's instead of my topology autophagy uh lipolicism the the body will benefit from from all of these things whether we fast or not but the fasting especially I believe has cleared out a lot of these AMOLED plaques and and repaired my my stretch marks and Scar Tissue um again I mean I lost the weight incredibly quickly over the course of a year was 107 pound uh but I didn't begin competing until a year or two after that and um I think that uh you know I'd give them the skin time to to repair the foods that we eat in uh you know a highly nutrient dense allows the body to repair I've always been a big lover of um of the grisly part of my food um the you know the parts on the chicken bone that the people don't eat which are full of the collagen so I've always had a high concentration of collagen in my dad since I've been living this this way um all of these factors I believe have contributed to that but that is a big concern isn't it you know especially from from females when they begin to lose a lot of weight is you know what about my stretch marks and loose skin but it just seems to be a case that you know the body the body heals itself doesn't it um the body's an incredible machine and it never ceases to amaze me that um you know what it can do when we Supply it with the correct nutrients and more importantly when we remove these nutrients or empty nutrients I should say because they're not nutrients in the foods that we think are nutrient dense but yeah that that's my that's my short version is that short enough you've seen I usually go I usually get told off for going off on me you see Emily is worth the name for long answers but yeah I think I think I would just put a little caveat in there there are some people that just have to resort to surgery um Norris bath comes to mind who is an incredibly transparent and I take my hat off to her for going online and saying I'm gonna have this done because she's a big advocate of this way of eating so I think um Emily's been you know not lucky because it took her four years and I think also how quickly it comes off makes a big difference um but yeah it's great so Emily this is your your uh little guest spot so is there anything else you want to tell us about that you're up to like a cookbook for instance sure sure um so you know uh we have all these friends in carnivore space right and so we had uh I don't know what it is right now oh sardines or something I'm not going to make a starting English would believe me um so back um I had tried to go up my fat and do like the higher fat version of carnivore um would have been in uh last year 2022 and so during that time I just developed tons of high fat recipes that I was trying for myself and so I really wanted to share that with folks so yeah I do I use a ton of Tallow I've developed like and so you know it's like you were saying with the anti-nutrients because we're all on different spectrums of what we can tolerate so some of my recipes have a little bit of vanilla in there or you know something so they would be more on the keto Spectrum um but yeah I was just experimenting this so much like I needed sauces I needed little candies I um you know I mean you don't exactly need a recipe for brown butter but we started doing all kinds of fun things with the brown butter putting bacon in it and adding some other you know components to it um so yeah I do have a coupon for sale it's for sale on the mighty networks on the steak and butter gang I and so uh that is super helpful and you know for me I have always been oriented towards a higher fat approach that has just helped my mood it's helped my sleep um but I did this on purpose for a while um and so yeah that that is out there and I try to add to it it's actually uh at this time right now on my networks I can continue to edit and add I don't have it out there available on um like a it's not in a static form quite yet um so yeah that was a ton of fun definitely put like our family favorites in there because yeah it's a it's a great uh lifestyle change but it doesn't uh there's not a lot of resources out there for ideas for getting the cookbooks going going Rich have you got any more questions I've got questions but I know Emily so yeah look you you fire away I I'm gonna be incredibly rude for two seconds and nip to The Lure you've had 30 minutes but just just under six hours um but yeah if you don't mind I'll do that well you you can't I'll be two seconds though I promise okay yeah we'll shut the door yeah so yeah brilliant Emily so um what what I'd like to ask you about is uh are you still interested in priming and talking about that and food freedom because I think that's one of the big things that you you're pretty much an expert on [Music] um carnivore is can be um you can you're not used to eating a large amount of meats and so we're used to what do they tell us our plate was like this and it was half was vegetables and then maybe a quarter was meat and I don't know what the quarter of carbs or you know all these ideas that we've had about my plates or what to put this together and so when people are thinking about what is a serving size of meat um and they're wanting all these benefits they've heard they want the health benefits they've you know heard what an incredible plan this can be that um they're gonna revert to oh maybe one piece of chicken is the appropriate serving when we're getting started with carnivore and so they're going to um fall into under eating by just on accident and not even know that's happening and then the thing is is that um yes carnivore is a wonderful plan but under eating on any plan is going to have a lot of problems and you're not going to feel good and so when people are coming going through carnivore they're already going to be in a keto flu in an adaptation flu and a huge adaptation from their body getting used to things and then if you're under eating at the same time you're basically putting yourself into a calorie restriction mode right in the beginning of your journey so I do think that so priming is a two-week period where you are feasting on me and you are um you know actually eating three times a day plus I'm to I'm really fill up every nook and cranny nutritionally and to get your body to transfer to use um animal Foods instead of the other Foods so um yeah I I think it's like the best way to start if you're going to start this out is to take a priming period and then to let your appetite naturally kind of fall down from there but what can happen too is that you will it will prep you for fat fasting so you'll probably start doing some intermittent fasting and then if you're wanting to do some intentional fasting it really sets the stage for doing that as well so yeah for people that don't know about that process we're talking about priming Richard um so have you I I assume you've heard about this concept about this is a Raymond Nason developed this concept but you know we've just been teaching it for a long time and second better gang and so many people have just had incred amazing benefits from this from taking this period of time feasting um but you know I I heard of it something similar when I came to carnivore there was a philosophy about that eat as much as you want meat but I never heard anybody sort of um let's push this to the next level and actually on purpose have a period of time where you're kind of hyper um nutritioning yourself to get your body really really ready and to have it coming over and to um you know that fasting will oftentimes come out of that as well but just to make sure that you're not um under eating you can't under eat when you're priming that's for sure yeah and I mean I actually did experiment with Emily we're not with a personally but at that period of time uh last May and I was gobsmacked actually because coach Raymond said to me I'd been carnivore three and three years ish and um well three years and he said you're not eating enough and I I so you know there you are three years of Carnival and I thought I was eating enough and somebody just eyeballed my pictures and we were doing a weekly live stream and he said you're not eating enough now um that's why I put that comment up there because that that a few of the messages I'm getting uh personally as well under eating is a big issue because people want to lose that 150 pounds like Emily did or 107 pounds Like Richard did and they think oh yeah eat less eat less and move more and that isn't gonna work because if you're underfed undernourished and in my diabetes and obesity practice I have many people that are very overweight and man nourished and they just don't get that because they are thinking of volume of food and the fact that they're fat must mean they're eating too much but they're actually under eating the things they need and overeating the things they don't need so you have to unlearn that sorry to Nick that phrase from one of the uh one of the Instagram things but yeah I had to unlearn and rethink and eating more was counter-intuitive but I got it I understood it and I found in the first week of priming and I don't believe in calories but people wanted to know so I was having three and a half thousand four thousand calories for seven days three meals a day and snacks and I lost four pounds because all of a sudden I was absolutely satiated and the following week I didn't want to eat any more but I mean that's the beauty of this way of eating gives you that food freedom and I used to laugh at the time poor old Emily's heard this a few times but it's the only way of eating where I've ever heard someone go do you know I don't want to eat anymore that's it I've actually had enough of eating whereas other types of diets are you're always hungry you're always thinking about food and you're underfed well this way of eating was eat so much and the analogy of eating so much is like you know the 1950s dad who would lock his son in a Cupboard with 10 packs of cigarettes because he found him smoking said right you smoke all them you'll never want to smoke again and you're not coming out until you smoke them all and you know that's what it was I was just eating so much I suddenly got to the point where Raymond said to me you're okay for next week eating you know throwing meals and snacks I don't ever want to eat that's it I am I'm genuinely actually full and that completely changed my food freedom and even my wife Jane said you know you don't talk about food at all since you've done that I mean obviously yeah that looks nice that rib eye looks nice but not in between meals not go oh what we're gonna have tonight you know what what's gonna what we're gonna have tomorrow there was just a complete food freedom and I would say I'm gonna I mean I've tried to get Raymond to come on but he didn't reply properly but anyway Emily's come on it would be really nice to take my ass hat off to Raven and thank him for it because it was a great thing to do and I think under eating sounds like the best thing for people that are overweight but it actually is about the worst thing you can do because you just end up binging you end up getting all the stuff that you crave I mean how can you crave something when you're full you you just can't because you're full you don't want to go out and eat stuff because you're full and to me that seems like a really obvious thing sorry I'm talking too much it's Emily's time but I just want you to say that Emily why are you um that really was uh Revelation for me to overeat so much and to lose that much weight and Bart K had done the same thing previously at tons of food and saw the white come off but when I'm saying tons of food it really literally was you know quite quite a big volume but then by the third week you know everything had settled down and I was just eating what I would call normal amounts of food which was just to my hunger and then stopping when I was full so big it was a big thing to do and that's what Emily does he does this chisel program and it's it's um it's based on that isn't it I know you then change it and you have uh alternate day fasting and a few things like that as well which is which is great so what else you can what have you got coming up Emily I'm let's see oh you know I just started doing a podcast for my YouTube channel so Steve and I have to have you come and come on for a podcast so that has been fun um so yeah I just been interviewing folks and stories and that's the thing is being in this community you hear so many incredible stories so I just recorded with Cassie you know Cassie right from Rivero a long time ago um and she was one because her weight loss is up in the 300 type category she did have some surgery she had needed some on her arms and you know what not um but yeah we just covered like every little basic that we the two of us had been through we're kind of like little sister twins or something our Journeys were so parallel and so because we had the fasting we had the carnivore we had you know had done a little bit of that under eating thing had figured out that priming had figured out that full nourishment and how much it actually really helps to the fast um so uh yeah so I've got that going on you guys can uh check that out on YouTube um and I just had uh Anthony chafee I just recorded an interview with him that went and you guys had him on earlier today for a couple hours yes yeah oh I mean he was great I think I some like one question is like okay I got every anthropology every historical data every cultural data every like all right we've got it right now so yes now come on you've got to be better at plugging your YouTube channel how do we find it um I mean I think this is under my name I gotta get better at everything I only have a couple of episodes out you're right yeah Stephen thank you how do I do that a little bit better and you need Richard as a guest because if you like someone giving you a really long scientific answer I do you are looking at okay A little epitome of that and in fact we had Richard and Anthony this morning for three hours and I literally could have just turned my screen off it was just brilliant to hear them the energy was peeing and rocking beautiful yeah and so on Instagram too I'd link everything on Instagram I'm running the little bytes of the inner tubes uh the interviews through that so it's uh healed by meat on Instagram so you guys can follow me there too okay and yeah I'm still uh we're still doing stuff at the steak and butter gang and so we I love being you know just involved in community everything that we do here is so Community oriented with your YouTubes and so in any place where people are have excitement and um you know problem solving or helping people figure out the steps on their carnivore Journey like I'm just so happy that these things were happening that's okay so we've got a question here from and I'm sure people use these names so when I read them out it sounds incredibly difficult for me but plumps oh I don't I'm not even gonna bother with that I can't read that but uh the question is what's the proper alternative thinking we have on cholesterol does the body specifically try to increase cholesterol levels when it knows you're unwell for example now you don't have to answer that one Emily that could go to Richard what do you think yeah uh well I mean I will just say no I'm just going to say from my personal experience in eating the high animal fat diet what that the benefits that that does for me just mentally energy hormonally um but no I'm definitely going to punt that to what actually happens to okay so they're talking about when you're in an illness is your body gonna what's what's you're gonna what is it gonna raise up and what is it gonna have to kind of uh bring to that site so now go ahead Richard I think it was a nice side stepper yeah yeah technically LDL cholesterol helps us fight off viruses and infections it's imperative for Life cell formation cell communication nuclear absorption neutral Transportation the production of hormones is essential for healing we needed to fight off viruses and infections and typically LDL will come down when we have an infection when we begin the ketogenic or Carnival lifestyle cholesterol can increase but this is just a cholesterol returning back to its natural physiological level because we've had a lifetime of abuse from phytosterols which artificially lower our cholesterol so when we remove these and we see an increase in cholesterol by becoming keto and carnivore it is simply the body just restoring cholesterol levels back to its natural level um and the production of ketones use uh uh the same pathway them a violinate pathway which we spoke about earlier um uh which is the same pathway that produces cholesterol so there may be an argument there that the production of ketones in any over spill will raise cholesterol although that just a hypothesis um you know there's no data to back that up but what we do see is when we become keto and Carnival the increase in cholesterol is nothing more than a an elevation back to its natural physiological level but LDL when we become sick in short it typically comes down because the body's fighting that virus and infection but an increase in in cholesterol to put into perspective mine is double Figures it's around 10.26 um eight to point something I think my LDL is and to be honest I'm disappointed that it's not high yet and we measure in you know different forms or whatever mine's right around at that 230 and I'm just like great like that I I don't I don't have a concern about it I feel so good to me I feel like it's you know lubing my vessels with the right slippery types of substance that I need that I'm you know to me it's just very protective and so um I I celebrate the high fat and the high cholesterol and yeah our bodies so wise our body has so much wisdom that's why it's just like okay reverting back to this ancient ways these ancient ways of eating fasting is you know ancestrally appropriate then it lets your body turn the knobs we don't have to turn the knobs y'all our body can do it and it's it's you know has that wisdom to um adapt and when you're fighting an infection when things are coming up it knows what to do oh sorry Rich sorry I'm just going to share a screen just very quickly um we have the technology to do this um which is a little graph uh about from a study and um this was recently shared by Ken Berry but basically good um a good graph to show when it looks at LDL levels so this is as your ldo increases along here and this is your likelihood of dying and these are hard end points these are actually people that died it's not like guesswork and as you can see as your cholesterol so as your cholesterol is low your risk of dying is nearly twice as much as here when it starts to increase and The Sweet Spot there you know it seems to be 120 right up to 240 even going up to 300 it still looks much better your chances of living with this high LDL uh twice as good as um as over here and these dotted lines these areas of confidence really it actually shows up here that possibly LDL is is um protective so I think that's pretty interesting personally so let me just get rid of that now uh because we haven't really got time for that um so yeah that's brilliant Emily that's your half an hour which is fantastic thank you so great to be with you guys you know Dr Sabrina sort do you know her of course of course yes let's get her to come in through the door hello beautiful how are you hi so good to see you and both of you guys thanks for having me ah beautiful have a wonderful talk and uh enjoy I'm so excited for your new life in Florida Dr salt it just sounds like these are coming along it's great but it's so humid right now and I'm so pregnant so it's just so uncomfortable oh my gosh can't wait to see that baby have a great session y'all thank you so uh hello Dr Sabrina sort do you know Richard I think that just via social media but I don't think we've ever actually the pleasure of speaking so nice to formally yeah nice to meet you too Sabrina thank you very much for coming on board know my pleasure I'm excited to be here this is so fun I was thinking just like how cool this whole concept is and if you haven't already this should definitely be at least an annual thing for sure the pressure's on I'm sorry thanks for that you can go now so yeah everything six hours in isn't it bad um just for the viewers who don't know you could you just give us a little intro to who you are and why you're here yeah I'm Dr Sabrina sols I am a naturopathic medical doctor by training and certifications and all that good stuff I used to live in Scottsdale Arizona where I currently still operate a regenerative and anti-aging medicine practice I currently live in Florida um I have been a carnivore for over a year and a half now uh somewhat shifted in the last I would say seven or so months because I've been pregnant so I've been incorporating a little more ketovore animal based just due to some media versions of stuff that I've had otherwise my whole I think I feel purpose in this community is to share health information that helps people really try to figure out what might be happening underneath as far as root cause issues as to why they might have had to find their way to carnivore in the first place to help heal a lot of things or also why carnivore may be challenging for some people as well too brilliant now Richard have you got a question do you want to start with a question I'll leave you kickers off and I'll jump in with something for for um well something picked my interest straight away do you said now you're pregnant Sabrina that you felt some cravings and you've added some stuff so what what have you added so when I've when I first got pregnant I mean I'm 32 weeks now so we're we're seven months in we're very close to the end which has been great um and it wasn't necessarily that I was craving anything as much as I had meet aversion and I it honestly broke my heart like I I can't tell you how upset I was because I was sitting at work one day and I had my rib eye that I normally would bring with me to work cooked it up got my butter on it and I sat there and stared at it and I was like I cannot eat this for the life of me I knew I was pregnant already at that point I was really hoping that this wouldn't happen this happened with my first pregnancy as well this is number three for me and I got out my phone ubereats and I got some Sashimi delivered to the office because that was all I really wanted at that point was just just give me some fish um the meat aversions lasted until somewhat into second trimester so I ate some chicken we had a period of time where we actually did a vacation to turkey and Egypt and this was planned before I ever became pregnant and we were in a situation where we were on this cruise ship there was only one option for food one option for meals specific meal times I wouldn't recommend it um but I didn't trust a lot of the meat they were cooking it was mystery sauces could have been thickened with flour which I have a pretty severe gluten intolerance the only things that were safe for me on that cruise ship were fruit and full fat yogurt so I kind of sustained on those for about four or five days which not ideal but it's what I had access to even all of the eggs were cooked in seed oils they had the fake butter Pockets which were actually mostly seed oils and I I react very poorly to those uh so I keep them out of my diet other than that to get over a lot of the meat aversions what I had to do was condiments we'll say so if I was eating ground beef I would need to like chop up tiny pieces of pickles to go with them or I would add in like a small amount of sauerkraut like just these these things that I knew I could tolerate um or even a little bit of avocado things I knew didn't bother me I got into carnivore because I had health issues severe gut issues skin issues anxiety things that all really dramatically improved so I if I am gonna quote unquote stray from it I'm gonna do it with things that I know aren't going to upset my body besides that though the period that I'm in right now is actually really weird I am all about pork I am bacon I am pulled pork I am pork ribs it's just it's just a crazy flux being pregnant you really have no control and it's kind of weird so I'm excited to get this baby out and get back to my like normal way of eating fabulous fabulous um we've got a few questions in the comments section one thing that we were talking about before you came on was LDL we had a little look at some data about whether high LDL is is deleterious or not um and I know you uh not one to shy away so I'm happy for Richard to have a pop first if you want to does APO B and apoa matter in carnival so uh Richard do you want to pop in an answer on and then we'll get Dr salt to add something yeah Dr Sabrina just jump in I've taken up way too much air time at the moment I think isn't it so I'm uh I've got I've got a couple of things lined up um so I I'll first for Sabrina so I let her jump in on this and I'm gonna go into something a little bit more technical now as we go on if that's okay so anytime I get a question about a specific value and does this value matter I almost always say no not because the value is not important but because it matters within what context are we looking at this you can have these elevations in an otherwise metabolically sound person and you can also have these elevations in somebody who's metabolically very unfit so the context absolutely matters and if a person is carnivore that doesn't always necessarily mean that they're metabolically fit how long have they been carnivore what type of carnivore are they what other things do they do are they still really overweight how they develop some sort of insulin resistance because they've been carnivore for so long which I've seen clinically actually happen people who have almost no insulin levels that if they were to reintroduce something like carbs they would absolutely go into very diabetic symptoms so I don't think that they are the end-all be all by themselves I will look at them in the context of everything else so are there triglycerides elevated are there inflammatory markers elevated things like hscrp myeloperoxidase PL A2 even things like oxidative LDL and if we are seeing these elevations within that type of picture then yes absolutely we might need to do something about them but then that context also changes so how are we going to address it do we adjust the diet do we consider statins almost always never but again it's all Case by case unfortunately we're all individuals yeah and I think that I think one of the things when we talk about cholesterol is if you start with a false premise uh that high LDL cholesterol is causal for atherosclerosis then everything all your ducks are in a line so if you look at Apo b or with apolipoprotein all that means Apple just means attached to lipoprotein Greek it's just so if you assume that high audio was a problem therefore High EPO B is going to be a problem because it's attached if you see what I mean so um I think there's a lot more Nuance to it and I think people just need to go back to the drawing board and firstly decide what is what is the issue here that's personally what I think and um you know there's there's lots of things to say actually when you look at where plaques form it's always in a high pressure area it's always in an artery it's you know so there's many reasons to say it's also where there's not laminar flow of the blood there's lots and lots of things that point to it not being LDL necessarily but the environment around that so anyway and also how does it get into the into the space well what caused that Gap that lesion for that thing to get into it so that's maybe the cause you know inflammation or you could look at the other Theory which is about thrombosis and anyway right I don't want to get into the wind too much because I've still got 18 hours of this to do um so let's let's have a look so there's a nice phrase here which I don't agree with you you bring up a very good point just to really just to hold on that is that cholesterol is not a root cause of anything except high cholesterol like unless you're just assigning the diagnosis of high cholesterol it is not a root cause so we really do need to be better investigators versus just attacking One Singular thing because one of the concepts of elevated cholesterol is that it's elevating in response to a process that needs repair well if you're not looking at that underlying process that needs to be repaired whether it's you're producing more cholesterol because your hormones are declining in middle age or you're trying to repair something else in your system unless you're actually looking at okay where where is this happening and then you just go to try to lower it because that's what you've been told that's what you've been taught you're actually going to make things worse overall and I think that's what's actually really disappointing is that you end up with these people who are consistently getting sicker and sicker despite doing what the medical you know the whole medical Paradigm suggests which is lower that cholesterol to prevent disease yeah and I think one of the things rich I was trying to find the comment here because that he really liked it we were talking about levels you know globally because you know I do the phlebotomy side of things and these levels these normative ranges are not optimal it's it's a range so people can be outside of those ranges and be optimal and people can be in range and not healthy so I think it it's much more holistic than that and also we were talking about um language and how we say high cholesterol but of course if you take out the plant steroids is it high or is it actually where it should be that's what we was talking before you go on so and it is how you talk about things that's quite emotive to say oh you've got high LDL well no actually you've got the ordeal you should have had in fact it was too low that was the problem it was artificially uh you know reduced because of what you were doing so yeah that's cool um right the biggest tip the biggest tick when it comes to cholesterol is it's imperative for life it's essential for cell formation cell communication nuclear absorption neutral Transportation the production of hormones and it's essential for healing and I it doesn't matter what the level is if you were eating a ketogenic carnivore lifestyle then your cholesterol including LDL is healing and repair repair in the body we reference the study uh first thing this morning with Dr Jeffrey that shows published on the BMG 60 000 participants and it shows a reverse uh in representing 22 percent of the participants in regards to high LDL and all course mortality um which should tell you everything that you need to know but cholesterol wants to heal and repair the body we can go into the science you know behind that if you want to Stephen but it'll probably take about five or ten minutes by the time I get into the weeds um maybe we could jump on that a little bit later on but cholesterol is essential for life we certainly shouldn't fear cholesterol um you know if anything I'd like to get mine higher um in fact the most recent test it could come down ever so slightly and uh and I was a little bit upset that yes I agree with you for sure yeah so I think um I've got some questions that were pre um pre-submitted I'm trying to find one that I can read quickly for you please don't laugh at this all right because I said any questions this could be a parody question but I'm going to tell you um please don't laugh can I have nuts or are all herbs and spices vanilla and cinnamon onions and garlic allowed what about pickles fermented veg olives salads cabbage any sauces ideas please thank you um and the the rationale for this is they need some variety and tasty food she thinks it might get too boring um so do you do you have any ideas for sauces that are 100 carnivore that can really spice things up um and or are there sort of pickles you can have that are laced least problematic what do you think I mean the pluck seasonings I have no affiliation with that brand whatsoever but their seasonings that are made out of organs so if you wanted like a pure carnivore option I'd say that would be the thing to go um I am gosh I I feel like speaking clinical practice for as long as I have in working with patients the best way to get somebody to create lasting change is to meet them where they're at so if somebody is embarking on Carnivore and they need some sort of transition period which was me personally too so I can strongly relate to this and the feeling of okay I can't go full in yet just because it's not agreeing with me for whatever reason whether I think I need variety or in my personal experience it was a history of Eating Disorders where I absolutely could not have rules um or somebody else's rules so to speak it was fine it was coming for myself but I couldn't have that because it would trigger those previous feelings so I can I can empathize with that need and the ultimate goal I think for all of us should be well what's going to get me towards this level of Optimal Health and if right now what you need is a small amount of spices maybe you need to put some I don't know maybe you're whipping up some egg whites for some sort of fake dessert and you got to put a little bit of cinnamon and vanilla in it fine like get the egg whites in because those are gonna be beneficial for you or even put the yolks into because those are way more beneficial but if what you need is a small amount to again get you to that eventual we'll say strictness or eventual pure carnivore go for it because it it can work for some now there are some people that absolutely need the cold turkey method where they have to cut everything off in order to you know release what might be food addiction or those really specific Cravings that might come up that's fine only you can know yourself and unless you're actually working one-on-one with a provider or somebody who says oh yeah no this food may actually be a food intolerance for you you should get rid of it right away don't even ease out of it I think that it's you know we it's fine to be flexible totally fine to be flexible but also totally fine to still continue to do things that are going to work towards your goals and the definition of carnivore can be different from everybody I've seen some people use the definition of hyper carnivore which is anything that's 70 percent or more animal based we have obviously the definition of lion meets salt water definition of ketovor which is mostly carnivore with the addition of small maybe plant foods that are not gonna you know spike your to take out a ketosis I should say as far as like safer options you're asking about pickles uh I personally actually do terrible with pickles pickles and cucumbers but for me I can do like half of a fermented pickle and it won't bother me the fermentation process seems to attack those lectins that I react very strongly to and it seems to be okay sauerkraut seems to be an okay thing for some people again with the fermentation which would bring us into more of like a western a price sort of approach to carnivore where you're including these more traditional foods and I think that can work for some people as well too and ultimately you know once you've healed from whatever might be ailing you or why you found it right at carnivore in the first place May maybe that becomes how you live flexibly right so if you wanted to go to restaurants or you want to go to dinner parties or things with other people that aren't necessarily needing to eat this way you can have that freedom that's brilliant Richard yeah I think that's important I mean it's you know we it's a point we keep coming back to isn't it um we see this within the carnival keto groups quite often where somebody will post a picture of a meal and everybody would jump on it on their back that's not keto that's not Carnival and look you know for a start you know all Carnival all carnivals are ketogenic um if you can't avoid in the metabolic state of ketosis and what is what is ketosis it's a metabolic State it's the metabolics that we're born in it's the macabolic Sid that we've evolved in our entire existence um what we eat uh you know what can we eat technically we can eat anything and still maintain the ketogenic State as long as it does not pull us from that ketogenic state by altering that insulin to glucagon reassure so if it takes a food as you rightly say that we shouldn't many were deemed to be non-ketogenic or carnivore but if it takes that to keep it on the street narrow but you understand that there are negative effects of that then that that is absolutely fine I think we need to try to stop jumping on or down the throats of these people who are new to because what I find out I've got a keto group um somebody new will come on and they're super excited they'll post a picture or something and the first comment that's not that person removes themselves from the group throws the tower in and never progress we need to support these people not not attacking them you know we need to commend them you know congratulations for joining the group um you've made the first step in your journey uh the benefits are fantastic you know what you're doing is brilliant there are different types of as you rightly say being in a ketogenic State and some sections of being Carnival where you want to fit on that path or where you want to be you know end your journey um reside on that path as it were is is entirely true but it's down to knowledge and understanding that wherever you are now you can be better off but if you are at this point in your journey and you were benefiting and you were healing your body then that's fantastic but always understand you can go deeper down it but I think we need to support these people uh I I'm Carnival to the court um that's a new term you can use that Carnival to the court um you know it's yeah I support all aspects of uh of low carbon you know we've touched base with this a couple of times this morning already but uh you know coach Stephen was uh deals with a customer who is duty door um he doesn't want to gravitate away from that but he's changed his life lost stupid amount of weight healed his gut and he is reaping the benefits and you know kudos to him for doing that and I think we should support that if that's the choice he decides to make that's fantastic but always be aware and this is what we do this is what these pieces are for isn't it these education pieces the show people where you are is fantastic but if you remove this this and this you'll be further down the line but you need to make that decision yourself we can't force this upon people um and we need to remember where we are in our journey as well I mean it's you know I've been on my journey for 10 11 years it's taken me you know six or seven of that to become Carnival I didn't just flick the switch and wake up it's been these incremental changes so if you need those those um pieces you know those sources or condiments whatever it may be to to allow you to maintain that Journey then then so be it you know it uh so that's my two pounder yes it's good and Dr Sabrina there is um soaking up your lovely Welsh accent I can see that and I think one of the things that the reason I asked so many people on is to actually prove this that you don't have to be Zero Tolerance none of the influencers that have come on a flat out you can't do that you can't do that and most people do have that angle of if it's the only thing that's going to keep you doing Carnival or be closer to Carnival and get rid of all the processed foods and Seed oils and all that then do it you know if someone says to me I fancy an avocado I'm like okay we'll eat an avocado I mean what is the big deal uh but I think there are you know a little bit of demarcation if someone says I really fancy a donut and I know that client you're going to have one are you gonna have one a day are you then gonna have two you know so you have to moderate but something like sauces I mean a big thing that helped me was finding a carnivore mayonnaise which is just an egg yolk and some butter whisked up together and I was like why did I not know about this nine years ago this is amazing so I mean and that's mayonnaise that you can make literally fresh there and then I mean you don't have to you know just steal it or do anything to it so I thought that was good I do have a another question oh by the way I'll tell you another thing that has got me in trouble when I've done what I eat in the day I'm just going to show you some yeah and it's the sausage because that's processed uh you know I I laugh because at this conversation because just yesterday I had an Instagram post with like this meme um like ready to go and it was about this topic it was about the people who are policing carnivore and keto content with the don't do it and I had the whole capture like it was ready to go it is saved in my drafts right now and I'm just like oh I just didn't want to deal with the backlash from the purest and this this is exactly what you're saying I don't know another you know I don't know if you don't call this professionals influence whatever in the space that is a quote-unquote purist it's always these people that are in these Facebook groups that say things like you're right okay oh that's not carnivore and I have never encountered a person who was on the receiving end of that that was like you know what thank you for that my life has changed I am now going to be the purest carnivore and you've fixed all my issues it just doesn't happen and it's so crazy to me that this is how people want to are trying to help other people and I think well maybe they're not maybe they're just trying to be the person who flexes on social media maybe they are sad and unhappy maybe they're actually not even carnivores themselves and they're just trying to troll these groups because maybe they're vegan and they're trying to get people to not be carnivore who knows but ultimately yes we should be guiding people along offering true assistance when needed because we all know the benefits of this way of eating and how much it can cure different diseases it can put people in better metabolic States it's just overall and it's better for the environment too I mean my gosh there's benefits all around yes and better for the environment is a is a big deal that I'm really pushing at the moment um I showed a a a thing earlier from this Smithsonian about 672 million Birds killed by pesticides agricultural pesticides in one year 62 million in the states so that's not environmentally friendly is it um it's not good for animals and anyway we could get very political what Richard doesn't know about you Dr Sabrina is uh you're pretty feisty about these sort of things which is great I've got a brilliant question it is a bit nuanced I don't think you're going to shy away from it and I think Richard might end up doing the rest of the 18 hours and here we go I don't think it's a a negative comment it's a genuine question I hear a lot about bile flow in other nutrition communities specifically the vitamin A toxicity groups and the idea that we need soluble fiber to help prevent bio essentially stagnating in the body and as far as I can understand it causing toxicity issues have has either of you come across this Theory I've never come across the theory or I've never come across that clinically no honestly I I truly have not I truly have not had a patient walk into my office where I've been like yeah your bile is stuck it's just it has never happened and maybe it's because I'm ignorant to it right maybe it's because I just don't know to look for it um but that's it's honestly never been a concern have you come across that Richard no I haven't and it just I had adds more weight to the fact that um you know fiber um I hate to break it to you all is not essential um it's an anti-new joint we do not need it um there is no benefit to consuming fiber whatsoever um it negates the body's ability to absorb all the nutrients uh it's usually one of the main contributing factors uh to um you know bowel bowel issues uh IBS amongst other things um we have no need for fiber and that's one of the big concerns of people beginning to keep on Carnival lifestyle Carnival in particular you know where do I get my fiber from no fiber feeds um I'll break something to build drill or feeds the color on the sites in the gut but and that's the big thing that people will come back to when it comes comes down to fiber uh but what people don't realize is that all protein breaks down into isobacterate isolated papaya in it which which is a short chain fatty acid which feeds the colonoscience in the Gap at a higher rate than good grade from vegetables so we can think of animal protein as animal fiber and the interesting thing is that technically we don't even need that because when wikitogenic um we have beta hydroxypgrid flowing through our our veins every colonosite within our body is fed with beta hydroxybooted and the boot rate the short chain fatty acid boot dread is further broken down into beta hydroxybutrin but we don't need to do that to feed that single colonoscope because every color on the site is being fed so it doesn't matter which angle you look at in regards to to fiber we don't need it we need saturated fats for the production of bile fat is essential um ditch the fiber increase your fat it's as simple as that yeah so with you on on all of that yes and it's I mean personally like that was what really I would say cured my issues because prior to this I mean as a naturopathic doctor I had access to every single gut healing protocol you could imagine and I did them I would I would say I did almost all of them everything like because my gut was so destroyed and it truly was until I cut out all vegetables cut out all fiber and was fairly I would say strict carnivore I don't like the word strict I was just carnivore because that was what felt good to me and what was doing really well for me that I actually finally healed and I had normal bowel movements and I never got bloated and I never had gas and like nothing bad else ever happened and even with that taking out the anti-nutrients finally allowed me to get my nutrient levels up to good standards I had hair grow back that I didn't even realize I was missing like I had like these spaces right here were back like there was no hair there and now I've got hair there so it's it's just amazing what properly fueling the body can do and no we don't need fiber for proper fuel at all at all full stop yes I'm not a fan of fiber and I often quote Dr Paul Mason's brilliant video which looks at the study where they had high fiber medium fiber and zero fiber and the resolution of all symptoms and bleeding and constipation was only well it was everyone in the in the zero fiber group had full resolution and the high fiber a medium fiber did not so that's a pretty good study it's very small bit underpowered only like 65 participants but it's the best study we've got um and another interesting question um so just just so you know Dr Sabrina we um asked people to put some questions forward before we started and um I got quite a mixed bag uh so that was one of them here's another one there's often talk about long-term zero carbs spiking cortisol and leading to issues longer term for certain people Sally Norton recently emailed saying that long-term zero carb can cause issues especially when dealing with oxide dumping uh so I'm Keen to understand this more and if anyone does recommend tactical cyclical carb intake to prevent cortisol or other hormone issues long term such a good question this is something that I've touched on in in some of my social media content which is this relationship between um being in a high cortisol State and diet and I think the misnomer here is that people are saying that diet is the cause of the high cortisol State and in my experience that's almost never entirely true so you can do things diet wise that can exacerbate a hypercortisol state like coffee on an empty stomach for example especially if you're a female that's going to exacerbate your cortisol but it's it's mostly the other habits that we have throughout the day consistent scrolling on our phones consistent exposure to Blue Light working at jobs we hate being like not having proper connection with other human beings we are in fortunately this this day and age where we have so many things that are stressing us out and creating these consistently elevated cortisol levels and we're missing we're misappropriately attributing them to a diet State now one of the things is that yes carbohydrate consuming carbohydrates can blunt the effects of cortisol but I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend that as the treatment per se um I would recommend getting to the root cause of what's actually spiking the cortisol and start there so if it's if you are consuming coffee on empty stomach and you are having a tough time with you know this being in that ketosis state figure that out because what's going to happen if you are consistently putting yourself into into ketosis with a high stress state or at least trying for that you're actually likely to eat away at some of your lean muscle mass you're gonna detrimentally affect your muscle um so that's important because well we need muscle in our bodies some people will call it the organ of longevity um Dr Gabrielle lion I don't know if you guys know who she is she's got a lot of really great content on just this exact topic why having muscle as you age is so important uh preventing sarcopenia preventing Frailty preventing fractures being just an overall active tissue in the body all very important but the cortisol issue is it's not caused by diet in pretty much anybody so I don't think that you should I think you should you can support it with diet and if anything higher fat can be beneficial for some people if you wanted to if you wanted to cycle carbs I think you could I think that's actually a reasonable thing for a different population in my experience working with women who have damaged their Metabolism from years of yo-yo dieting can actually get better results for instead of being strict by actually cycling some carbs very strategically with guidance that's almost the only population type that I would recommend that for the rest of us seem to do just fine but again focus on the root cause of the cortisol Richard he's sitting there listening so intently yeah it look again I mean this is a topic that popped up earlier isn't it long-term you know ketosis calls in uh negative issues in the body I mean I've I've been ketogenic for 10 11 years um I've recorded all tests are different difficult ones especially when we do it by by Blood because cortisol is elevated in the morning you'd have to do x amount of blood tests for Corpus or throughout the day so you know these studies that show elevated cortisol levels I question some of them anyway but look coming back to a point in the middle earlier um you know being ketogenic I think can cause an elevation um you know fasting can cause an elevation um in some people uh usually if the biggest contributing factor within a low carb ketogenic lifestyle is lack of sodium um and again coming back to a point we made earlier you know when we begin Quito we we all hit the coffee and and the fat bombs and the bulletproof coffees and this increase in caffeine affects adrenals um it causes adrenal dysfunction which can increase cortisol so you know if there is a link between Diet you know it's not Direct in regards to being ketogenic you know is what I would say but um I've you know I've measured my CRP and my DHA uh DHEA and you know my CRP which is directly correlated um in one of the studies that I reference in one of the talks that we do in regards to elevated cortisol levels my CRP is always incredibly low uh my DHEA is always High um you know I never have um it doesn't appear that I have any adrenal dysfunction or any elevated cortisol and I've been ketogenic for for a long long time um another factor that people you know will put down to damage and effects of being ketogenic is um you know something called the Randall cycle which Professor Barclay I'm sure will Enlighten us a topic that he's well versed in so you know looking forward to chatting to him in regards to that one but look it's um I've lived this lifestyle for 10 11 years uh all I've seen is benefits and when we look at some of these influencers who you know show that um you know testosterone is lower or thyroid hormone is lower uh you know in women especially well TSH thyroid stimulating hormone is also lower and if that was an issue in regards to hormone being lower thyroidism it don't want to be elevated so all of these things you know we need to look at them in context and it's not just as as easy as looking a a one thing there's a bigger picture to this um I truly believe this is the healthiest way to live but coming back you know to to the point um it isn't one size fits all and you know I do believe that some people will get away with consuming carbohydrate I don't think it's essential I believe that any any so-called lack of carbohydrate can be I don't think we need to test the metabolism or or testing insulin based cycling carbohydrates at all these are things that I've tried and tested over the years and I just seem to not benefit from them okay I'm one person the clients that I work with seem to have similar results to myself we all look for what we call this like metabolic flexibility where we can start introducing carbohydrate again but when these people do they seem to be worse off for it and gravity back into an animal-based lifestyle um so yeah you know I've got questions on that and I I just believe that living you know it's almost people looking for excuses isn't it to come away and feed sugar addiction again but um I'm often within the animal lifestyle I'm all for people experimenting you know you need to try these things but uh I honestly benefit for for living long-term ketogenic and Carnival based Lifestyles um but that's my two pair nothing yeah yeah I mean I think the way we look at testing is is just so wrong because like I say I'll do the phlebotomy and I I don't do that much now but I used to and people would say I failed a glucose tolerance test can I take it again and I'd be like why do you want to be able to cope with a drink that's got 15 teaspoons of sugar in that you haven't found your body has said to you that's too much sugar I mean exactly like if you have a drink that's got too much salt in go well that's too salty you know yeah that's what you should be doing you should be taking a sip of that and going um excuse me man in the white coat or female in the white coat I don't want to drink this this is too sweet that's what you should be selling yes yes that's the tolerance right like that it's just too sweet for you I didn't do I didn't they they meet pregnant women do that test they need pregnant women do a glucose tolerance test to check to see if you have gestational diabetes and I'm like I I'm refusing that first of all I'm not really doing any care for this pregnancy but I'm refusing that on the account of I my metabolism is going to go crazy if I do that because I haven't had anything like that and I'm like I'm getting to this baby I'm not gonna do it to myself there's zero point to it it's it's terrible I oh we could do a whole topic on the whole uh the Pregnancy Care disaster that is our medical system but we don't have to do that today the fat addict there um Adam there I've read effects I've read effects that coffee can cause an even bigger increase in cortisol within the first two hours of waking well yeah I mean it's a stimulant yeah everything is a fan substance and it's compounding on your body's own natural cortisol production in the morning you're supposed to get a cortisol response in the morning and see your to your points um about the testing of the cortisol there's some things that can impact just the testing of itself so when you're getting it via blood draw and you are freaked out by needles guess what's gonna happen your cortisol levels are going to go up and of course we do have um a pattern which cortisol releases throughout our body and it's supposedly four times throughout the day that you're supposed to get these cortisol responses and they're supposed to follow a specific curve so some people will do uh salivary testing I did that for patients gosh I think the last time I ran one of those was 2016. um because I it was much easier to just correlate symptoms versus make them pay for this 200 spit test that they have to spit into a tube four times a day so that I kind of took that out of my toolbox but one of the other things I test beyond the hscrp that you were talking about that's always included as well um is the hormone prolactin so prolactin is a it's a hormone that promotes lactation so it's a hormone that should be elevated in women who are pregnant and or breastfeeding when we test this in people who aren't alongside cortisol and we see a spike in prolactin but cortisol might be normal or it might even have an elevation I got to call prolactin cortisol snitch and it's because this is the signaling for those two hormones it's almost like sister signaling so there can kind of be a crossover on that so if somebody has elevated prolactin and of course we want to rule out something like a prolactinoma which is a small prolactin secreting tumor that might occur in the brain and it's usually almost always benign but um again it's in the context of the rest of the labs and their their clinical presentation but if you have an elevation in prolactin you can almost always guarantee that there is an issue as well with their cortisol response so that's one of the ways that I kind of check my work so to speak um because again you can just have a false elevation because somebody was freaked out by getting the blood draw foreign yes I think Richard's speechless yes you see Rick another potential guest for your YouTube because the the carnivores out there they know their stuff so thank you Dr Sabrina that's really good I'm going to now make you a little bit um I'm gonna I'm gonna promote you a little bit because I'd like to know about your stem cell applications what what that's about because I think Richard's ears will prick up which they already did um can you tell us a little bit about what you do in the area of stem cells yes so gosh I've been in the stem cell or I've been in the regenerative medicine field since about 2013 so it's been about just over a decade now um that I was performing regenerative injections and the regenerative medicine field that that term can comprise various different modalities including things like Prolotherapy stem cell therapy uh PRP and even things like birth tissue products things like umbilical core products amniotic products exosomes uh and I've been doing this like I said for about 10 years and the most common thing that we treat I would say are musculoskeletal disorders so chronic pain chronic injuries things where people either don't want to do surgery or aren't a candidate for surgery or have previously only been treating those with things like pain medications or hyaluronic acid injections or trying to rehab them with physical therapy and not getting the results that they would like basically what we do is we use these regenerative medicine Tools in our toolbox depending on what the patient's presentation is and we actually cause the area to heal one of the things that I actually started doing was incorporating uh we'll call it a spectrum of carnivore diet for all the patients so anytime someone comes in who wants to work with us they actually get access to a whole online learning platform where we take them through transitioning them into mostly a keto carnivorous type of way of eating because oh my gosh it has skyrocketed results I mean for us at this point a failure almost doesn't exist as as far as our patient base goes which is amazing because we're we're kind of covering all of the bases when it comes to getting all that proper nutrition in and of course treating the areas that we need to be treating [Music] foreign that's great um and Richard surely that has inspired you to ask a question a follow-up question yeah for sure it um I mean obviously a lot of your research is around so two wins uh I'm guessing uh Sabrina uh And in regards to energy plus and nadh and things um you know when when the body is created as we age entity plus through the Electoral transport chain um or cellular respiration is converted into nadh this energy plus is lowered and this is what leads isn't it this damage and and this sign of Aging um and when we become ketogenic uh we can alter this ratio so it costs the body four NAD plus molecules the process one glucose molecule uh but it costs the body One beta hydroxyboot or one NAD plus molecule to process One beta hydroxide molecule so it's 400 more efficient um you know first question one part of two I mean you've gone down the carnival did you attribute a lot of that benefit down to that that that increase in the NAD plus to any DH reassure and then coming on from some of the therapy that you're using so NAD plus is nicotinoid adenine denucleotide but you can use a supplement form of this in the form of nicotine made mononucleotide uh do you use any of that or is it a case of you just using you know the the increase in ND plus through the diadem lifestyle or do you attributed a combo of the two so good question I actually never even put the two and two together which is the increase in the NAD and the decrease in the carbs but it makes a ton of sense because as like you're right as you're saying the amount that we make naturally just as humans goes down dramatically as we age and it's kind of one of those Hallmarks of Aging I would even say because um it relates directly to mitochondrial dysfunction and how your cells are able to function in that energy production way so that makes complete sense and yes we use NAD frequently in our practice because well it works um we we actually just do either intravenous administration or we do subcutaneous Administration I I understand that there are the precursors that are available available in oral form I've personally never seen great results from them that doesn't mean that there isn't people that are getting them because I always talk about this the doc the built-in doctor bias is that the people who are doing great aren't coming to see us so for me to say that I'm I haven't seen this don't take it too you know too much of the grain of salt but so I don't know exactly which ones are working I just know what my patients are coming in for when they aren't working and normally if they haven't been working with like the nmn like you were saying um or even the NR um Dr David Sinclair is the person who really speaks a lot about this and I think he he has gone back and forth on those two as far as which one's more potent do you know for sure if it's the nmn or the NR at this point uh I do not as you say the research is to win or throw in but um I mean most of the research I've done is in regards to n m which is a mouthful to say isn't it it's almost easier to say if nicotine um but yeah it's an interesting topic and um it's it's one that uh you know that when we look at health and well being in regard so I'm all for supplementation um but I mean living living the lifestyle as well and it was just interesting when you said there that you know you're using therapy treatments um and in conjunction with living the lifestyle and you've seen massive improvements I just wondered whether that that was the case but it um you know I'm all for supplementation um you know as I own a supplement store um which you know I I personally call you know a ketogenic carnivore story if you like because everything there is classed as Foods um you know to me anyway at least but it uh I'm always interested I've never never used Eminem myself um I do work I don't know if you know um uh Lisa tamadi uh an award-winning author from New Zealand uh she uh and her mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer um and was given a few months to live five years later she's still alive and trains five days a week um and she's done this you know through uh ketogenic uh based lifestyle but she's a big advocate of n m um and she's the type of person that looks into this you know to the end degree so I mean you know I respect your opinion on it but I've never tried it myself uh but yeah in regards to which is best I'm unsure work but um yeah it's it's uh interesting to say the least isn't it it is it's cool stuff and I think it's important that the the other aspect too I'm with you on supplements I've used supplements personally with patients strategically over the years and I don't think that I think that it's important to be again very strategic with what you're doing aim for short term while you dial in everything else and then also take into consideration can this person actually even absorb what I'm giving them um there's so much gut dysfunction that's kind of rampant throughout the world we'll say um so if you are giving a person something like just make sure that it's it's not a waste foreign that's brilliant and um I've been dying to say this name Bob's pistols and Pay Dirt has asked the question question for the panel we all understand the physical and mental benefits of carnivore lifestyle why is it so difficult for others friends and family to understand slash accept Carnival it's I think there's layers to this most most common layer I think being that everybody's just been kind of brainwashed I mean I certainly was you know I was I was brainwashed too we have to eat the vegetables and all the things that have been fed to us literally and figuratively over the years um it's just kind of hard to get people to break free from that and until a person reaches their own true Breaking Point whether it's their health and mental or physical ways they're not going to seek out other Solutions and even then the amount of people that actually do find their way to this I feel like is very very small because most of the other people are still under the impression that their family physician is the person to go to for a solution and that's often not the case at all because all they're going to get is maybe a pill that might make them worse cause other side effects get another pill for that continue on this trajectory and they're never actually going to see these positive changes and they're going to end up with those diseases lifestyle that are killing everybody heart disease diabetes certain types of cancers and that's why we're in the situation globally that we're in with the health of humans it's people don't they don't know to change they don't want to change sad yeah I think you're right about the brainwashing or I call it grain washing but I I definitely was that person I can remember in my 20s I did my bodybuilding show yeah and um not as good as Zach's by the way Zach is Sabrina's husband um right so yeah I did a bodybuilding show and I can remember going through muscle and fitness magazine and seeing an experiment where they I was high carb at the time low fat um here's an experiment some of our bodybuilders are going to eat high fat and I just literally just flicked straight past well that's not gonna work you know I wasn't open to it at all in any way you shape or form and and you know even when I started doing my qualifications diabetes and obesity it it was it was just the things not adding up it took a long time for me to start thinking properly the reason I'm saying this is for those people that are upset or worried that their friends family don't really accept it try and put yourself Back to Before You discovered Carnival how you found it difficult to understand how you were saturated no uh pun intended saturated with news about fat being bad for you all of that stuff is in there you know it is absolutely deep in in that person so I always say you've got to just actually wait out play the long game because if you're convinced about it and I and I get this with lots and lots of people I've coached and I mean I'm lucky enough to have over you know 500 people to draw from now that I've coached the ones that have the friends and family supporting definitely have a much easier Journey definitely without a shadow video but those that have the pushback and again I had it uh strangely enough I know we've mentioned this person a couple of times but it was amazing you know they'd lost 250 pounds reverse non-alcoholic fatty liver disease off diabetic medications actually they literally could not move all right they could not get off uh the couch they lost their job because they couldn't do any of their daily activities so they went Carnival now um he said to me oh everyone thought it was it was crazy and you know I was mad I got to the point where I didn't want to live I mean that's how bad it was then by the end of the interview long list my mum's doing it my mother-in-law my father-in-law's doing it my brother you know because huge difference this person who was basically lost in the uh militia of the NHS and medications was this fit healthy person back at work by the way and and everything's really great well you could put yourself into that I mean that's both the Spectrum there you know the the real worst case in the best case but if you're in the middle and your partner's saying I want you to eat some fruit and veg please eat some fruit and veg it's because they actually think of doing the right thing by you but if you stick to your guns and in six months later you're you know looking better you're off your diabetic mids they will come round I promise you without you having to talk to them or have an argument because it's self-evident it's worked for you and that doesn't mean they've got to eat like you either I mean you've got to accept their autonomy because you've made this decision that you wanted to do and it's worked for you it doesn't mean it will work for them it probably would of course you know I think it would you probably think it would but if they don't want to do it if they're not open to it it's not worth ruining your partnership your marriage or you know falling out with your family over because you know that really crap phrase you do you and I do me is is true all right if you eat this way and you feel great and I promise you I live in a in a real world of a family that think I'm weird um you just got to do what's best for you but don't try and push it onto other people the joke about you know if you go into a into a restaurant or you go into a bar how can you know the person in front of you is a vegan because they tell you that's it stop talking about it don't be that person just be yourself and people will come to you I mean that's that's the way I I look at it um right we have come to the end of the questions which is which is great uh doctors thought has kindly stayed on for a bit longer because I think he was down for 45 minutes do you want to see the hour out I'm happy to hang out with you guys I think this is so much fun okay uh any books let's put this Bishops deep learning any books suggestions for converting people something easy to read with lots of compelling images and diagrams honestly I have no idea because I I only read I'm gonna say I didn't even listen to it one carnivore book and it was uh Dr Paul saladinos and I the thing I enjoyed about it was his um Arguments for all the plant toxins that was where I really got my my first education on the negativities I've I have not read it I admittedly I'm sorry I'm a bad carnivore but it's um I yeah I could see that one being a good one too um yeah otherwise I don't really have a lot of book suggestions it's it's just something that at least I dove into based on watching my husband do better on it because it was that it was the physical proof right I the this conversation's so interesting because people they want to do good like this is why I I love people and believe in people because we see this in our community people being like how can I help everybody else because it helped me so much and I'm like it's beautiful it's great slightly misguided because nobody likes being told they're wrong nobody likes being told what to do especially if it's Uninvited and I get that you have the the greatest intentions for it my husband certainly did it took him a little bit of time to actually convince me but I had to see his results in real time I had to see his eyes getting whiter I had to see his skin getting better I had to see his mood improving I had to see I had to see all of it for myself I even had to see his poop so you know we have one of those marriages we're just open about everything but I I had to actually see the evidence for my own eyes before I was like all right let me give this a shot because again that brainwashing ran really really deep for me um so books are are a fine suggestion but at the same time you can find books on everything I mean the medical medium has books you know it's just because there you have evidence that you deem good doesn't mean it's going to be automatically received by the other person and and we see this you know we we've seen the vegans push their stuff we've seen the the breathitarians the fruititarians I mean everybody's got their pill that they're dying on and their their evidence and their resources for why they're doing their things um and it's it really I don't think it's it's about that I think it's honestly this movement in particular it's that social proof it's the people that are truly healing from these really really deep medical issues and sharing their experience yeah I think I think that's that's basically what I was saying about your friends and family nothing beats seeing somebody or learning I mean you know Zach's looks amazing he's a lovely guy you know and and uh bit shy you know it doesn't put his opinion out there that much um but you know I'm not plugging books for guests just I mean Sean Baker's book is a very good Gateway into carnivore if you're interested my website has some really good tips if you want to start there's a video on my thing 19 tips for starting um then we've got Maria Emerick and Craig emmerich the carnival cookbook uh lies my doctor told me Ken Berry who sadly we couldn't get on um Judy Cho Carnival Q is very good um one of the things I would say about uh Judy show is she gets into some real brilliant stuff about things we rarely talk about like food additives and coloring and dyes and stuff in food and I think that's that's pretty good as well because there are a lot of additives and I think we really suffer that much Richard in the UK but I think in America there are a lot more um you know additives and colors and stuff what what would you say about books or anything like that rich um to be honest I mean I'm I'm not a massive book fan um I find you know YouTube to be a fantastic source of information uh but you need to be able to read between the lines of certain things because you know as Sabrina rightly says there's there's an argument for everything but I mean it um you know you only need to look at the likes of you know people like Dr Chaffey um you know 130 odd thousand followers um you know the information he's given or can't be that bad if he has that many followers you know uh the information you know the reason we are doing this the information that we put out the information Sabrina puts out the information you and I put out it's all content available on our YouTube channels it's free and it's available on all our websites um and I think we all make an effort to try to break it down into simple terms I know you know we like to go into the into the weeds a little bit into the science and stuff as well but um you know there are simplified versions of uh of how it impacts health and well-being and just circling back to a point that um you guys made earlier it is incredibly difficult beginning you do Journey you know I I received a lot of backlash um my friend's family you know my mother in particular and on that side of you know of the family what about your cholesterol are you saturated fats all out of you know of of Goodwill and Care uh but not understanding that um you know cholesterol is essential and it comes back to this misinformation we've been fed for the last 50 years the saturated fats are bad for us cholesterol should be feared too much sodium is bad for us we need to eat our whole grains and consume our seed oils everything that we told is is is back to front isn't it um but I I you know there's a point there that I've highlighted on and DC 77 you know should you not be more pushy if it saves lives and I almost feel like that I'm that person because I am that vegan the the anti vegan in the pub although I don't go to a pub but you know it I am that person telling people in the street um and maybe I shouldn't but it I do feel that it's you know it's almost my digital people um but I've lost friends and family over it because you know I almost seem too pushy but I I feel that we have the magic Elixir to help them and it's just really disheartening when they're not willing to to step back and look at the evidence and listen and take it on board and change your life because the information you're giving out is life-changing and I think that we should be pushing it we shouldn't be pushy uh you know to a degree but as you rightly say the proof is in the pudding we continue on our journey we improve our health and well-being we've all lost a pump of weight improved as well but the people we work with see these improvements and that ripple effect you know we'll we'll draw further down the line and convert those other people moving forward but um yeah it's online is the best references for me so that's the long version of you've probably noticed there's another person on the screen and we're introduce him in a second because uh he's early which is fantastic but what we've found coach Bronson is that as people have been passing the bet on it's nice to come in and hear the tail end yeah and then segue into the next thing um and I want to just say I am looking at the comments I'm trying to organize 30 odd guests a live stream and the subject question and the chat I can't do everything but the really interesting thing the guy that asked about the books has just said it's all well and good you something about YouTube but my dad's old he doesn't look at YouTube he wants to read a book so that's why we recommended the books so uh Dr Sabrina last question and then then we'll introduce coach Bronson who's looking very studious there uh Bob's pistols and paydo would really like to hear doctors thoughts opinions on four stem cell uh Wharton's Jelly versus Cord Blood Etc does that make sense to you uh IV stem cell yes yes I am 100 a proponent for intravenous stem cells however not necessarily Wharton's jelly or Core Blood and I'll tell you why um there's different regulations in the United States versus other countries and in other countries you can actually get pure Cord Blood products Wharton's jelly products that are prepared proper properly in the United States our birth tissue Market is um sad and deceptive at best not to say these are these products are all bad all the time but according to the FDA and this doesn't mean we like the FDA but according to the FDA they it is illegal to do the transfer of live cells from one person to another which means that these products that are created from birth tissues don't actually contain live stem cells by the time they reach the patient both legally and due to how they're produced so they have to go undergo cryo preservation irradiation they undergo what's called a shock thought in the office where it's just kind of warmed up by that room temperature by your hands stem cells are very sensitive cells they die and so that's that topic now intravenous stem cells the absolute best way in my opinion clinically I can back this up with data I can back this up with studies in the United States at least is through intravenous stem cells as a result of getting them from a patient's own adipose tissue that has been by far the greatest results that we've seen we can do this for autoimmune disorders we can do it for if simply anti-aging benefits neurological disorders I mean anywhere the blood travels in your body putting stem cells intravenously you're going to benefit from um I could go on for this topic for a while um but I will I will leave it at that um is that great thing to do do not trust any of the birth tissue products in the United States if you have a company that is selling these to you or pushing them for you or clinic that says this is the best ask them if they do any other stem cell therapies because a true regenerative medicine practice will offer all of it based on what the patient might need not just kind of one tool because that means that they don't actually have the the skill set or understanding and I'm just going to throw shade there really quick um is that yeah they just don't um so find a place that can do all of it ask them which company they Source their products from and contact that company to get a third-party analysis of their fine product after it's been thought out they won't be able to provide it for you to actually say that it contains live stem cells so I will leave it at that brilliant Dr Sabrina salt do you know Bronson dent I don't think I do hi ah okay virtually somewhat but not we haven't actually met yeah [Music] yeah you should do to do a um podcast together because I I will speak of Bronson Dent's amazing brain and and his capabilities to listen to new stuff is is incredible and I just want to say it's seven hours in Brunson and I've just read IV as four because I'm that old I used to write doctors and some result that has been a pleasure thank you for doing that extra 15 minutes it feels great good luck the rest of the carnivoreathon hopefully you guys get to eat and drink something you know meaty and refreshing but yeah you guys are doing awesome so good job as well you guys should have a whole 30-minute session where it's just you eating yes thank you so much thank you goodbye awesome thanks Sabrina thank you right fronts and dance coach Bronson style of the reverse TV series now I I had this I've written introductions for everybody but uh it's it's not really working I'd rather you to just introduce yourself sir if you don't mind sure um coach Branson I've been carnivore for a little over five years I'm 51 years old I didn't get started on this journey really until my late 30s I was almost 40 years old when I decided hey I need to do something because I'm fat and out of shape and depressed and can't do anything like I want to do so uh my journey has not been short it's been up and down I've been fat I've been skinny I've been fat I've been skinny until I realized that it's not about being fat or skinny it's about being able to do the things that you want to do and that's really what my message is all about right now and do you know Richard I do not hi Richard hey there coach how are you doing you okay I'm doing fantastic I'm good to go you have 45 seconds to film coach Bronson in your journey your weight loss and where you were just 45 yeah we haven't got long we've only got 14 hours left just the 14th so yeah um I used to be take two diabetic I was clinical obese I suffered with daily debility in my dreams would make me blind chronic fatigue depression anxiety arthritic pains in my mid to their 20s I could barely walk up the stairs without stopping or being severely out of breath super long story short changed my my uh my diet um unknowingly didn't know what I was doing I just knew the bread used to make me feel uncomfortable and that's what I began on my journey uh 12 months later I'd lost 107 pound reversed my diabetes uh no longer suffered with chronic fatigue depression anxiety arthritic pains my migraines had cleared up I still suffer with migraines but this is usually to do with lack of sleep or stress which when you work for yourself uh unfortunately go hand in hand but I used to suffer with these daily debilitative migrants every day that would make me blind which was on three different medications for um I went on to compete as an amateur in men's physique bodybuilding and then became professional won the British championship and then the European Championship also went from being unable to walk up the stairs in my mid-20s to be a number one in Europe uh within five years of living a ketogenic carnivore style lifestyle and now I try to teach others to do the same which is where you jumped in on I believe in you know early on in regards to preaching um yeah we tried to screaming from the rooftops in the same way I guess as you do you know you've come across uh what I tell people or regard as a secret you know I found a secret and I'm trying to tell as many people as I can about my secret this secret that goes literally Against the Grain goes against everything that we've been told but it's so simple and it comes back down to and and I know we've highlighted this other contributing factors and environmental factors but most of this comes down to day yet you know nutrition nutrition is key and unfortunately that is negated or passed to one side if you will in in lieu of medications um which is unfortunate but that's the short version a little over 45 seconds I don't know 45 minutes maybe yeah Bronson I mean that's that's why I had to do 24 hours just to get Richard's answers no other reason uh but anyway you two guys should hook up at some point and do a podcast because you two are fantastic your knowledge about training and exercise and this isn't flannel to the people out there that think it's not you know I've invited people on because I think they have got a lot to give and um these two guys are great Richard is my co-host today so we're doing 24 hours but coach Brunson we got for an hour uh or 45 minutes so um I asked people to submit some questions right now true your followers are about the best there are because I don't do these long they don't do these long novels they do this question right so here's from one of them hey why Carnival I love it it's funny because sometimes the shorter questions have the longer answers yes that could be we could do the whole 24 hours on just why I mean that's what this whole thing is about right this whole 24-hour thing is about why carnivore so um why carnivore gosh maybe let's let's make it easier why Carnival for you then I was just gonna say my story for carnivore for me uh there's a couple things number one I had um IBS irritable bowel syndrome urgent bowels my life was pretty much governed by how close I could be or how quickly I could get to a bathroom so there was a anxiety stress you know I tell people that I didn't lose 150 pounds um I had a 70 pound overall loss but I didn't lose 150 200 pounds I wasn't severely obese morbidly obese but the biggest change from the reduction of stress anxiety feeling of limitations in my life came around my the tether and the the chain that I had to a bathroom and just my ability to travel my ability to do things enjoy things where I wasn't always thinking about am I okay is something going to happen that I'm not ready for and um that going away that took less than 30 less than 90 days uh for me going carnivore I want carnivore May 1st 2018 within So within a few months I realized hey look all these things that I'm stressed about all these things I'm doing to prepare for the inevitable I didn't need to do anymore and it's been five years over five years since that so living free of that anxiety has been one of the biggest changes in my life on top of that from a physical performance perspective from a feeling perspective from feeling my age you know I was 40 almost 40 when I started this this journey I was 45 when I started carnivore and I just felt like I was 65 70 80 years old I owned a CrossFit gym I worked out all the time and I thought it was just my level of activity that was keeping me worn down uh I was at a point where if I worked any more than if I worked out any more than three days a week I felt horrible I had aches and pains and injuries and pulled hamstrings torn meniscus torn labrums um uh torn calves I just one injury after another one chronic pain after another I just could never feel okay I felt like I'm doing all this stuff to get in shape but I'm always in pain and everything always feels bad what's going on um again within about three to six months of going carnivore everything changed uh I went from three days a week to being able to do five or six days a week of my Crossfit workouts and feeling absolutely great The Chronic issues of pain and the issues that I've been dealing with for years previously not only did I not have any new things come up but they all went away the things that I had been dealing with I no longer had to deal with I didn't wake up in the morning and have to take 10 minutes to warm up just to start my day I didn't have to warm up for 30 minutes before my workout and then stretch for 20 30 minutes after my workout just so that I felt okay the next day or two days or three days I could go in do a quick General warm-up get ready for the work that I was going to do do my workout you know do a cool down and go home and be ready to do that again the next day and I felt fantastic so not only did my quality of life improve by getting rid of the injuries getting rid of the pain The Chronic issues but I was able to actually improve even Beyond where I was because I was able to actually train more and get the consistency back into my routine that I hadn't been able to do before I changed the way I ate so for me the two biggest things were health and performance well I I thought Richard would dive in there because you are birds of a feather because the training is is a big part of your life um but I think isn't it funny that it has to happen to us even though we're interested in Fitness you know I've I've been a personal trainer a long time and it was only when I really realized my health was going south that I I got serious about research and I think that's one of the things that is you know I'm I'm ashamed to say that I will be honest and it took me a long time I didn't start low carbon July 50. uh and then keto and then carnivore when I was 55 so now I'm 59 and I just look back and think my eye should have been opened but we are saturated with such misinformation it's difficult to see through that that screen which is deliberate they they want to keep you ignorant out of what you should be eating um so that's great did you want to ask a question rich no I mean just to add to do something you just said there know that um I think the reason that we do what we do is because we've been in that situation prior I think if we were um you know thriving in our 30s and 40s then maybe we wouldn't have made the decisions that we have now so it's you know we look at these events as being unfortunate but it's what it's what's made us the people that we are today and because of that we've learned and we are now able to teach others you know so they don't have to fall into the same pitfalls and make the same mistakes that we do um but yeah similar story really I mean it um you know the three of us have come from massive ill health uh and and improved you know health and well-being from from being kind of water and I used to get gastro distressed uh issues I've worked with clients with severe IBS who have paid private and paid thousands and thousands of pounds uh for uh you know medicines to help and you know the the one thing that changed their life was two weeks of going Carnival you know and it's it is as simple as that when people think what people kind of quite often ask me what would you do for this what would you and it's the answer it sounds boring but it's almost always the same it comes down to food and there are variances within this and and I think this is the reason why a lot of influencers um who I do respect within the community seem to deviate from the message lately I wonder if it's because you can't keep on saying go and eat a steak you know it's the same message and I think that they need to change um the message that you're giving for attention because they you know yeah and that's and that's the challenge when you have people who are trying to be influencers versus people who are trying to coach and help people and again I talk a lot about context and you've got to listen to where the people are coming from what their what their experience is and what their purpose is so there's a lot of people out there in carnivore space and I you know not not disparaging anybody but I want everyone to understand that there are a lot of people in in the carnivore Community who are on YouTube or social media who are not doing this to help people and you have to look at the background you have to look at what these people are actually doing and track their message is their message consistent okay because here's here's the deal boring works best every single time if you're not getting a consistent message and that message changes or now there's a difference between I learned something new so I need to make a tweak or change or Nuance of what I'm saying but the core value the core Basics and principles of what I'm saying should never change if you're really trying to do something that works hey if you're just trying to keep up with the latest trends so that you can get good views and get your monetization on YouTube up that's a whole different conversation so you know boring works best I look at myself as a lighthouse you know I'm not going to attract everybody but the people that need me are going to see the light and then at some point in time they're not going to need me because they passed me and now they're looking for the next thing in their Journey so I'm not going to go out and get in a boat and try to go all over the ocean and try to say something different and catch everybody's attention I'm sticking my my my my flag in the sand and this is here for people when they need it and that's how it should be for each of us yeah and I think one of the things you'll find interesting and Rich doesn't even know this I've not not done this publicly but when I decided that we should do a 24-hour live stream okay I think some people don't understand that everyone is giving their time up but you know there's no money Changing Hands nothing's happening and um we're just doing it because we think it's great to get the word out there when I had quite a few messages and you won't believe this that just didn't like what I was doing and and in essence they were saying uh how are you going to stretch out 24 hours saying just each take that I heard that and then I get that I got that totally and um you know I would I answered everybody I said well I agree with you but it it's not going to get people doing it yeah you've got to be different you've got to get out there and spread the word because someone that could survive from just eating steak needs to hear personal experiences personal stories they need affirmation because they might be in a group where everybody is like I used to be when I was 20. fat man you've got to have loads of carbs so it it is how you look at stuff and and I and I think a lot of people just didn't believe that there was no monetary thing going on you're getting 24 hours of your time now the other thing is and I defend you and I said look the other side you know that the anti-carnival or the anti uh low-carb lot have money they have loads of money beautiful videos great advertising they've got the media in their back pocket the only way you can get some traction is to do something different something unusual we've had tons of comments and is this really going to be 24 hours how are you doing you know so I think people have watched purely because no one's ever done a 24-hour live stream um that's it it's just trying to get a word out now if at the end of it let's say every single hour we get one person and uh you know I did a success stories recently that one person then got all of his family yeah you know and that's it you know the rough medications they haven't got non-alcoholic fatty liver disease they're not got diabetes right well I can sleep at night we're like I can really sleep at night knowing that's absolutely I'm getting a bit emotional now because I was there I was coronary artery calcium scan 639 I was having a colonoscopy I had lower left quadrant pain I lost lost my mum to colon cancer I was in that Ward after that colonoscopy thinking that's it I'm 49 I'm gonna die because it's genetics never once did I go maybe it was what I was eating because I didn't smoke because I didn't drink and I I didn't have a red meat and I didn't eat fat so I'd done everything right and here I was tubby you know I was a personal trainer I was training people in the Olympics to throw javelins you know I was not a slouch and anyway right so that's why we're doing it guys so I've just maybe 20 emails that have just been dealt with in one one thing so we've got the word here calling themselves saved that's that's the other thing so saved us like they've done this and some things happened here's a question does number of ketones matter I I'm only able to get to 1.8 if fasting for more than 20 hours normal day just 0.2 to 0.5 and for those that are listening on the audio coach Brunson just shook his head yeah ketones matter because we you know they're great um but having extra does what for us so there's a couple a couple principles to think about and that is one minimum effective dose you know we talk about that in medicine we talk about that when applying solutions to things and there's a certain amount that you need so your body can function but anything over that what's the point if we look at ketones as excess fuel in the blood as being a good thing for some reason I'm not sure why but if we look at excess glucose in the blood that's a bad thing so in one hand excess fuel is good and one hand excess fuel is bad that doesn't make sense to me what makes sense to me is the processes that go into creating and utilizing the fuel how well are those things functioning and ketones doesn't tell us that if we're looking for high ketones lower ketones does tell us that so in a lot of cases when somebody is first getting started High ketones great your body's transitioning you're adapting but you should expect to see those Ketone numbers go down the more your body gets good at using them if you are ingesting a lot of extra that your body can't use then what's the point again that's it's really like I only need so much why am I going to put extra in um it just doesn't make sense to me so it also leads to thinking about this as a weight loss solution not a lifestyle solution so most time when people are looking at their ketones it's because they want to be in optimal fat burning right how am I burning enough fat off my body well how about let's look at how is your body working do you are you building lean mass how is your movement do you have energy throughout the day uh are the other aspects and and we need to get away as much as possible from thinking about weight as being our metric for success there are just looking at let's just say we talk about the Medicals what we consider medical right the blood work let's there's 15 20 30 50 100 different measures and metrics in blood work that you can look at to see if you're making an improvement if we add in Fitness and quality of life aspects how well do you move how what is your metabolism function there's another 30 or 40 things that we can look at there from a things that we can look at are we getting better am I getting stronger am I getting more flexible can I move easily am I have aches and pains that are going away just looking at weight is looking at One symptom of a problem not even looking at the problem itself and you're focusing all of your decisions on that symptom and instead of looking at what is causing the weight what is causing the extra fat and then trying to deal with that so um long story short no ketones don't matter worry about how your body is actually functioning and you'll have a lot more success rich yeah I agree um I think there are situations um I've noticed in regards to some of the athletes that we work with that increased ketones May improve you know uh athletic performance and these other studies when we look at increase ketones for cancers and things like that but look I was chasing Ketone levels when I began my journey my Ketone level is if I test it now it's probably 0.4 not 0.5 if I'm lucky and again as coach Bronson says you know initially if the ketones are elevated but the body begins to utilize them as be dehydroxy move it or not waste them as acetoaceted and acetone so your Ketone levels drops of what we see in the Facebook groups is people looking at their blood glucose and their Ketone levels um and Chase in the Ketone readings and keep on reading is it doesn't mean anything if you are uh keto adapted if you've been ketogenic for a long time or carnivore um your blood Ketone levels are going to be lower and this scares a lot of people so a lot of people along their Journey will test on the urine test strips uh which is the first thing to go on and I I am an advocate of people using these because it does give them the indication initially if they are consuming the right Foods because for us I mean we've we we're seasoned ketones if you like um you know we know exactly I keep telling it I love it you can use that one um you know we've been living the lifestyle for a long time we know exactly what effects our keto levels you know we uh our blood sugar um but early on in the journey you know I was consuming foods that uh you know I deemed to be healthy that were detrimental to my health um so it is it's a learning phase and I think the the urine strips are away a segue if you like into learning about which foods affect that but yeah they won't work for long they won't work for long the unit strips will begin to stop working and then soon after you know you spend a fortune on on a blood uh keep on Monitor and then these stop working because they keep on levels and your blood become lower and lower the best way as coach Bronson says is how you move how you feel um you know if you were not consuming any of these foods that are detrimental to your health if you were not consuming foods that contain grains or foods that contain uh seed oils or foods that are high in vinoleic acid if you were causing no glycation no oxidative stress within your body and you feel amazing does it really matter what your Ketone levels are anyway you know and yeah it doesn't it I could not tell you what my Ketone levels are because I have not tested for such a long time yeah I think I tested just because I heard about it when I first got started for like three months and then I stopped that was five years ago right um You just took the words right I just wrote down a note as I was gonna say like it doesn't matter people that are for worried about testing the only thing you really need to worry about testing is if you're doing something that might throw it off so if you're not doing the things that you should be doing from a dietary perspective then testing can be helpful because you know okay this is affecting this is doing that whatever and like you said from a learning perspective it's trying to see as you make these changes in your life but in general if I'm putting 93 octane in my car and that's the only thing I'm putting in my car do I need to test my exhaust to see if 93 octane is what my car is using right I'm not going to put 93 octane Testament exhaust and it's going to come out and say oh you use 85 like no if I'm putting 93 and that's all I'm doing then what else is there to do why do I need to test it yeah I mean I think with the Keystone urine strips as well I often say to people good because I do the phlebotomy side of things you do realize that urine is waste okay so whatever's on that strip is your body has said don't need those so yeah it's telling you maybe you got like ketones and we're not using them it doesn't doesn't really matter what matters is is what's happening at the tissue level level and how you feel I mean it really is that simple how you feel and how you act how you look is is better than numbers so with that said Scott Seidel has got this what advice would you give someone who has had success with girl look at this rub in his handsome and he's thinking about becoming a coach well I'll give you one bit of advice don't do a 24-hour live stream not right off the bat at least um okay so this is fantastic uh I love this question because this is for me this I I love I am a coach's coach I love working with coaches I love helping other people help other people um my passion and my long-term goal eventually is to have something in this realm where I'm doing coaches coaching for coaches um because I feel like as much as I can help an individual as much as I can do challenges and programs and all that other kind of stuff I'm limited in my ability to spread myself out and help people so helping coaches who can do that again right get that ripple effect going is what it's all about um Scott I think the the biggest thing that you can do number one is just start telling your story okay the Imposter syndrome and people feeling like well I'm not who's going to listen to me I'm not polished I'm not professional who cares okay the biggest part of being coach is being able to share your story find people that connect with that story and then help them through their Journey that's really all it is so your story is going to be different than my story it's going to be different than everybody else's story so there's going to people that be people that connect to it start sharing your story that doesn't mean become a YouTuber that could just mean just talking to people that you know that could mean uh you know when you meet people when you're out okay this is another this is one that that I see that I try to do all the time when you're out and you're eating dinner and the waitress says do you want your bun with your burger and you say no and they look at you weird you could tell them why don't be afraid to share your story that's that's the number one thing from there get as much information as you possibly can read all the books listen to all the YouTubes listen to all the the different podcasts that are out there um and then thirdly start networking with people get involved in the community get involved in events go to all the conferences you possibly can go to go to all the meetups meet people get to know other people that are doing it and expose yourself to the community more so that you can be in touch with what people need and will help you find your message and how best you can help people out what about you rich have you got any advice yeah love that it um again it comes back to that vegan in the pub statement that you made earlier um you know I've almost been ostracized from friends and family sometimes when it comes to events you know they'll go away on holiday or they'll go for a meal somewhere and I don't get invited um and the reason being is that you know I probably preach a little bit too much um and I think that some of this again comes down to feeling uncomfortable because if I for example used to get invited to to go to the pub with a few friends um I used to drink an awful lot so I don't know if coach Bronson knows this but I used to come home from work and I would drink a glass of wine one glass led into two or two is nearly a bottle so it was a bottle and then before long it was two women three bottles so I was drinking up to three bottles of wine a night or a liter of whiskey um technically an alcoholic um although you know I didn't feel that I I wasn't you know I had a professional job I wasn't you know a bum drinking on the side of the road you know but technically from the unit I was alcoholic but I don't drink anymore so when I came to going out for drinks for friends I would drink at the time uh you know a lot of coffee uh as most of us do as we gravitate in to keep on Carnival so I'd sit there with my coffee and cream uh and I'd feel content and happy but they would feel uncomfortable why aren't you drinking a beer have a beer I bought you a beer use the beer I don't want to be a you know I do want some whiskey or something I don't want it yeah um they'd order a plate of chips uh or you know whatever you know have one I don't want debt oh you must want it I don't want that um why you would and then it gives me a stage and just to say you know do you understand that these foods contain this this and this this food contains you know it's high in lectin so it's cooked in these seed oils this is this is the damage it causes so that almost gives me a stage then to you know to to if I eat out I make a point of going into the restaurant uh and when the wait waitress comes up to me and asks me what I'd like the first question is what you cooking and it's always vegetable oil so I'll say that I'm allergic to vegetable oil um you know I'll make a point of telling them that you know vegetable is detrimental to your health so I'm always standing up on my so coming back to the point you made about every opportunity of telling people and spreading that word um you know it has had a negative impact in regards to friendships and and and family events but I thrive on that because that's what drives me forward I make a point people will say oh one one hurt I don't want the beer I don't want to eat you know that burger or those fries or chips or whatever whatever it may be um I'm so I like making that point and making that stand so that's a a really that's a highly important point that I think is is worth making you need to almost be that I know Steven said anyway don't be that vegan at the bar I am that I'm T vegan at the bar and if you like you know telling everybody that I'm keeping um you know I've I use my number played on my car which I've sold recently to put into the business was keep doing it the license plate number was k77 ETO um keep on to the court um you know I walk around with Peter or strapped all over me I'm um you know I try to scream it as much from the rooftops as I can and I think that's really important because it comes back to this ripple effect um you know this is the best way to to press it Forward pass it forwards and Pay It Forward um people will become jealous you'll begin to and they won't believe it because you need carbs for energy you need carbs to build muscle you need fiber in your diet Etc and then we begin to improve our health and well-being year after year after year we begin to run faster than these Runners who are carb run as we begin to cycle harder and faster we whatever it may be we begin to lift more in in the gym um we begin to start looking younger you know all of these things over time it sinks in and I think through sheer um grit and attrition you know we'll we'll wear them down one by one but it does come it does come with a price but look I'm fortunate enough to be surrounded sorry go on yeah yeah it's gonna say it it it it comes at a price but I think that price is worth it because there's a couple things that happen when you believe inside well and that's part of the part of the process is you have to believe in something enough to put yourself out there so if you act if you're looking to be a coach to answer the question if you're looking to be a coach the first thing you have to do is really understand am I willing to take a stand for what I believe that's the first question because you're going to have people who who challenge your thought process who challenge the information and challenge you so part of the process of being a coach and I've been coaching for almost for a little over 12 years and you know even now there are things sometimes where I'm like am I right you know so being willing to evaluate your own belief system and the things that you've interpreted the information that you have but then also say look these are the principles of values and the concepts that I've that I've established as the basis for my decisions my protocols my methods do they still work yes they still work am I validated by this that or the other thing and when someone challenges that being able to explain and say look even even if you don't get into a debate with someone else being comfortable to to be able to in that internal debate why do I believe this is this something that is still passionate for me and that I will still want to help people with so being willing to go through that process I think is a big part of coaching yeah I think it's the why that makes you cry mate remember yeah absolutely that's fantastic yeah yeah you've got you've got to be passionate definitely um and I like the way that leads into the next question because evaluating what you believe and I'm gonna I think I might be out on a limb here against you two uh Bishop's deep learning has put stretching is a scam just like toothpaste so I'm not going to get into the second part of that yeah why not it's a conspiracy on I used to be a big fan of stretching and I have got into the science and I am completely against stretching now uh a jokey thing that one of my instructors taught me was um if a tiger came into this room you would not say to the tiger hang on a minute I've just got to stretch my quads all right you would run so we we're designed that way and when I was in soccer and I've got an fa coaching by a Football Association coaching badge more injuries happened in the warm-up than actually in the game and it seemed like stretching actually seemed to be detrimental and I've I found that with my own training uh when I go into a session now I don't stretch so that's a complete 180 for me and that's why that that is on there I don't think Bishop's deep learning has ever seen me before but I do mention that I am not I'm not into stretching I don't think it's it's good I understand why people think it is uh this is different to visualization and practicing that's different you know if you go onto the football field and you haven't kicked a ball about you might be the sort of person that needs to do that that needs to stand at the edge of the Penalty Box and have a shot into the top corners and just get your eye in you know I get that but I'm talking about is the stretching that is prescriptive uh you've got to stretch before you do your workout you have got to and I don't think that's that's true necessarily so I'd love to know because you're both I mean you know you're both at the top of your game when it comes to training well what are your views on stretching yeah um you're mostly right I think the the last five to ten years a lot of the the studies and information coming out about stretching has been opposite of what I was trained initially um you know I was always told from the earliest I can remember is you know in your warm-up you're stretching to get ready to work right you're getting your body ready and that's in general that's what a warm-up is for but the stretching should be dynamic because you're getting ready to do work and then at the end you're stretching to increase range of motion you're warmed up your synovial fluency your body's all warm you got blood pumping you can increase range of motion at the end of the workout um and again what a lot of the science is showing a lot of the studies are coming out now is saying that the benefit of stretching in some cases is in that negative to Performance and in most cases it's probably in that zero it really doesn't make any difference from an injury perspective or performance perspective so um I would agree with you there I do think there are some cases for stretching um from a proprioception perspective for beginners especially just and building that habit of doing something there's some people who can't work out right I'm not at a point where I can spend 38 30 minutes a day 45 minutes a day in the gym I don't know what I'm doing so hey maybe your initial entry into a fitness routine is 15 minutes of stretching just moving your body building that mind muscle connection learning how your body works learning what positions there are understanding how to move your joints in your body that kind of thing so I think that can be beneficial um from a general perspective of stretching my over the past few years I've pretty much gone into the your stretching should be movement focused in the work that you're doing that's kind of where I look at so you should be looking at getting maximal range of motion when you're doing your exercises and that should be your structure because if you're doing functional movement then your range of motion in those movements is also going to be functional and that's what we're looking for we're looking for quality of life mobility and physical Independence as we get older and that means functional movement so doing a lot of stretching just for stretching's sake um I haven't seen a lot of uh a lot of benefit from that in the long term um and I've seen more mobility and that's another aspect of it a lot of people get the the word Mobility confused with flexibility Mobility is flexibility plus strength so if you want to get range of motion and get strong in all those different positions then there has to be some resistance or some stress in that equation so doing the combination of range of motion while you're doing your weight training while you're doing exercises under stress is going to do a lot more for you than just buildings flexibility Rich any views yeah completely agree I don't stretch um my warm-up before the bench press is I like the bench press um I don't stretch before I go for a run I go for a jog before I run you know if I'm going on the bike I'll spin at a higher Cadence on the bike so you warm up the muscle that you're getting ready to use uh but I don't stretch um you know the research shows a stretching especially for explores even once reduces the amount of power output within that movement so if you're a sprinter and you're stretching your legs you will lose in power in your Sprint uh same thing with sprinters on the bike or anything that's power related for that matter so I don't do any stretching yeah and I would add a lot of the I think there was a study as I read a couple years ago or an article something I read a couple years ago about hamstring injuries in soccer or I should say football for you guys yes absolutely and that is uh they determined that like 80 percent of the injuries are more than 80 of the injuries that are hamstring pulls in soccer are not because of tightness they're because of weakness so the injuries that we've commonly attributed to not being stretched out not being warmed up are really not that at all it's a weakness it's it's the strength of the activity the the muscle's ability to to hold its tensile strength and keep its integrity under stress it's not that they overextended their knee right if you look at anybody if you look at anybody in sports who pulls a hamstring and watch when they pull the hamstring their knee is bent they're not fully stretched out right that muscle is not at its maximum length so it's not an issue of strength of of stretching or length of the muscle that's an issue of strength in that muscle to hold that pressure so if you want to avoid those types of injuries get stronger don't get more flexible now we've got a question that says to coach Stephen I got all excited someone wants to know the answer from me and the question is do you work with older patients 65 plus and if so what have you noticed from them switching carnivore and then they added this sorry I meant oh man uh thanks for that uh so yeah there's there's a question uh I mean absolutely a little bit facetious with these sort of questions because I say yeah because when they were 64 they were very very different to when they were 65 but yeah um we're talking older populations in general over 65. the the nothing changes it's the same if if you're 35 you're going to see benefit if you're 65 you're going to see benefit and they're all the same things it's just a matter of degree uh Greg Glassman the founder of CrossFit uh is quoted and I'm going to get this quote completely wrong but uh the needs of a grandmother and the needs of an Olympic Athlete are the same they just vary by degree so we all need the same things we need more muscle we need less fat we need less inflammation we need more metabolic flexibility we need all these things the same thing we all need so for somebody who's in their 60s and I'll use my mom as an example so I've been working with my mom for almost 10 years she got started on her journey at 60 years old okay I started personal training her she joined my CrossFit gym we started doing a bunch of stuff she went carnivore about four years ago she just turned 69. since she went carnivore with the combination of strength training she's reversed osteoporosis she's lowered she's hypothyroid she's lowered her uh her thyroid medication she's increased bone density increased strength like the the physical Independence that she has right now at 69 years old is far and above where she was in in her 40s okay so her favorite thing to do is deadlift she loves working out when she can't work out she gets depressed uh she it's absolutely amazing to see the things that have happened for her um as a small frame woman who started out not doing anything her entirely she didn't do any Fitness in her life until she was 60 years old and now we're having we're actually having a conference next week in our in our area and she's speaking on the journey and what it's been like for her to go through this process so uh if your 60s if you're in your 50s 60s and 70s and you're just getting started and you're doing carnivore number one thing is don't get caught up in the minutia just keep it simple and it really is like you guys said eat more meat move your body get more sleep those are the big three things okay so uh it will make a difference if you're looking at increasing bone density if you're looking at increasingly mass and fighting sarcopenia which is probably the number one thing that you need to be worried about over 60 is keeping your lean muscle as high as possible so that you can maintain into physical Independence um then this is a great way to go rich yeah just touching base on um uh the soccerpenia sort of a thing there I mean we um we're told as we age that uh you know muscle weight stage is a fact of life and osteoporosis osteoporosis can be reversed uh with protein when we look at their born uh born is mineralized protein as protein and minerals uh what do we consume lots of on a ketogenic Carnival lifestyle lots of protein minerals um you cannot only stop osteoporosis in his tracks but you can reverse off the process and part of um building bone or the absorption of calcium within the bone is directly correlated with the consumption of sodium we can't send calcium into the bone without increasing sodium consumption again you know another thing that we we consume lots of within the keto Carnival community and another thing that goes against literally it goes against the grain you know we're told to avoid consuming high amounts of sodium sodium is essential for Life protein is essential cholesterol and and fats you know are essential for life um so age just a number and I think you know you guys have all shown that I'm a little bit younger than the two of you but I'm I'm nearly 40. um and I'd like to think that I don't look it yeah and more comments please no you look about 50. yeah come on seven and a half hours eight set seven hours and three quarters and you know what I think we're absolutely flying to be honest I mean we've been non-stop I was joking and I'm I'm still feeling full full of energy um my bum isn't dead yet you've been stuck fair play so I may have to do some stand a little bit later on but it must be all this uh transitioning from bodybuilding to cycling this uh this um hardened my uh my bum because uh yeah I'm still going strong but our age is just a number yeah I want to add to that and that is um if I can remember because it because that question just popped up and now I totally forgot what I want to talk about don't you hate when you have a thought on your head you have a thought you're like oh man um oh yeah we talked about you know amino acids and protein is required for building muscle and or and Bone right that is one aspect but even for bone and I think a lot of people don't realize this is your body still needs a stimulus in order to make the change happen you have to tell your central nervous system you have to tell your body I'm doing more than I've done before so now that you're getting all this extra protein here's what I want you to do with it okay and that goes for muscle growth we have to stimulate the muscle so that our body says hey we need to add more muscle fiber we need to add density we need to add myofibrils whatever it is but the same thing happens for bone density if you're not stressing the bone structure the bone structure is not going to grow it's not going to get stronger so resistance training is also a requirement for reversing a sarcopenia you've got to get your body put some stress on your bones move some weight absolutely and this doesn't have to be lifting weights does it I mean this could be body weight exercise abandoned exercise no we're not talking about you don't have to hit the gym if that's something that you're you know free you're full of you can do these exercises at home you know plain simply and you don't have to do an awful lot you know we think that um from the days of you know the the body builders like our Schwarzenegger and things you know spending four or five hours in the gym anything beyond an hour in my opinion is is negative 45 minutes to me is optimal because we raise cortisol cortisol is catabolic get in the gym or at home do your body weight and exercise or do your band next whatever it may be you don't have to do an awful lot to stimulate the muscle protein synthesis but yeah I completely agree and the thing is I mean you're evidently sort of into the high performance athletic Arena but I just want to add a little um a much broader statement that any Improvement on your health is good so if you can't get out of a chair okay getting out of a chair is an intense exercise for you all right yeah yeah you can be sitting in a chair and I I actually had this a woman with a Zimmer frame sitting in a chair and she said my well this is really sad sorry maybe I'm getting emotional uh and she's she said to me my world has just shrunk you know I can remember her saying the NHS has given up on me and my world is just these four walls absolutely pitiful lovely woman bright you know wrote poetry for a local magazine and all this sort of stuff well six months later she's not got the Zimmer frame she was bent over like this she was straight now walking out into the garden you know uh to the point where uh you'll both get this because I'm sure you've had people like this that you've coached well I want to walk to you into the street this is the person that couldn't even get out of a chair you know so um your horizons start to get better the oldest and that was a very old person that was in their 70s the oldest person I've actually trained and seen a remarkable difference to was was 89 and he came to me I do rehab in this room as well with a little bit of um spinal manipulation all this sort of stuff anyway he came in and his son had to bring him in it was old school he didn't want to take painkillers he had a handkerchief in his mouth because he was in that much pain uh and uh basically could hardly get out of his car so anyway a little bit of manipulation took about diet and stuff like that six months later I'm walking in the park with my wife Jane and uh I said look nice dog that's that client no cane walking in the park 90 right uh and I said to him whoa Doug it's me Stephen remember bright as a button yeah yeah you sorted my back out and yeah okay um what you've been doing and he said oh it's my 90th birthday yesterday and I've just played nine holes of golf right so you haven't got to look like a bag of walnuts you know you haven't got to look like that we're just talking daily functions a little bit extra if you want to walking in the park walking the dog enjoying the beach all of that is exercise it's not it's movement it's living you know yeah it's living and that's the thing that I want everyone to understand is the the fitness routine that you develop for yourself or the things that you start doing to improve your Fitness should be based on the vision you have for how you want your life to look right if you just want to be able to go for a walk play with your grandkids and do some gardening without feeling like crap then do the things that make that easy you don't need to worry about going and running a 5k you don't need to worry about lifting 300 pounds you don't need to do all this stuff what can I do I want my life to be walking with my husband or my spouse playing with my grandkids and gardening three days a week what do I need to do I need to walk I need to learn how to get up and down off the floor with no problem and then I need to to figure out how I can do the things outside for gardening what are the things that that that requires and make those things easy it's about taking the things that are limiting you and slowly removing them from your life it doesn't have to be this giant expectation of what you see on Instagram or what you see you me or or anyone else doing it's it's a hundred percent based on what life do you want to live yes that's great now this name Primal Mike I know Mike it's Primal mic and he's got Roar in the middle of his name which is very clever uh to put on weight in Brackets mostly muscle on Carnival is there a protein limit above which there is a diminishing result in muscle build rate and I should increase fat instead great question okay uh yes there is always there's always a point where you're going to get more than you need uh the fact the process of finding that uh if you want a rough number from what I've seen and maybe this is something you guys can corroborate or maybe you've seen something different uh somewhere around 1.2 to 1.25 grams per pound of lean mass is about where I've seen people max out on what they need in order to get optimal growth anything above 1.25 is probably too much uh too much in meaning it's not really doing much for you uh and I think there's some studies I think meno hensel's men had some stuff out where he did a meta-analysis about that I think it was around 1.2 as well um basically you want to find what I call your protein threshold start at a number and I like to start people at one gram per pound of lean mass so if you weigh 200 pounds or 25 body fat you want to get in 150 grams of protein per day start there am I gaining am I losing is my performance good how am I getting stronger whatever performance metrics you want to have if you're trying to build muscle build athletic performance if you feel like okay I'm good but I think I could do better go to one and 1.1115 something like that slowly bump it up so you get to a point where even if I keep going higher nothing is improving faster and then you can bring it back down and try to find that thing so it's a process of experimentation add a little bit see if you notice a difference if you're not noticing a difference you can bring it back down um and just playing with those numbers but again on average I think it's about 1.2 to 1.25 is what I've seen for most people Steve Rich you must have uh yeah for sure yeah it that seems like a sensible number um I mean looking at the research that I've carried out over the years 0.5 is minimum to maintain around 0.82 grams is what's required to build at one gram per pound which correspondsman mentioned is is what I I generally you know tell people which is what we mentioned earlier um around one gram per pound for men there are 0.9 for women um I'm considerably higher than that being carnivore um but yeah that makes perfect sense about what 1.25 sounds about right I would say it's perfect start with with one gram per pound it's nice and simple uh and exactly as corresponds and says if we you weigh 150 pounds that's 150 grams of protein I wouldn't be fearful of going over protein and the fear of gluconeogenesis pulling you from a ketogenic state is a myth um that's not going to happen we can go into more detail than that if you want to but don't feel your protein do not feel your fat we need protein and fat to increase muscle protein synthesis uh we can build muscle with just protein alone we need leucine to activate now around three grams give or take but carbohydrates do not further increase muscle protein synthesis at all so the co-ingestinal carbs does not increase muscle protein synthesis when adequate protein is consumed um but protein with fat does increase muscle protein synthesis so a ketogenic carnivore lifestyle will build muscle quicker than than protein and carbs so look at nature nature provides this with everything that we need the perfectly packaged present if you like protein combined with fat sorry it's the Bell my end um yes um you know an egg is protein in fact a steak is protein in fact a chicken with the skin on its protein in fact eat food as nature intended and you know people will come back and we'll you know when I've built the muscle what about building uh or cutting down on body fat and maintaining this lean mass and it's a case of of experimenting and reducing the body for the dietary fat ever so slightly the less daily fat we consume the more body fat that we go into to uh you know to to burn or utilize for free will um there is no figure with this everybody is is independent and individual and you know you have to find that number for yourself but around one gram per pound is a perfect place to start I leave you cat I'll leave you chat on a second while I go find out it was ringing the bell there sorry apologies and I would add to that is that is the other thing too is is um what is the impetus for putting on weight you know my Mike is asking this about weight and should he increase fat if the protein isn't working uh there there are some cases where overall weight is needed I deal with a lot of women in their 40s 50s and 60s who have been starving themselves for 30 years and they're at a great body fat percentage they're super lean but they're 15 20 pounds underweight because they just have not been feeding themselves enough for so long so when I look at them and say you need to increase your protein and your fat they kind of their head explodes because they're like well but I don't want to gain any weight well guess what you need to gain weight so we're upping your fat and your protein because you need more fat and you need more and you need more muscle um so that is a case most people really don't need to worry about gaining overall weight they just need to gain lean mass so that's just something to be mindful of yes brilliant um I mean now he's away we could talk about him but let's not uh right so um all all capitals so should I shout this one AKA zinsomniac Yeah question my mom has arterial fibrillation uh can she do the Kano diet yes yes absolutely um just it's a little bit different you gotta it's a lot more experimentation with with electrolytes and activity and the things that have to that you have to do but in general I haven't seen anybody that has afib that hasn't been able to do it excellent uh we're coming to the end of your hour but I'm trying to get these questions in uh there you are yeah there's Richard is back which is great uh who was at the door it was my wife so I'm in the shop so this is where I do yeah so she's um she's busy so the shop is closed today um but she's busy working as always I mean when you work for yourself I don't think there's ever a day off is it um we work seven days a week so she's she locked herself out um the door Clause behind us super excited Bishop's deep learning who has uh got a few questions through which there you go uh coach Bronson do you get resistance towards eating only meat from your clients and how do you handle this um no I don't force anything so it's it's there's a there's there's a sustainability in meeting somebody where they're at is always more important than getting in someone to do something the way that I do it so there's the principles and the concepts that we talked about before the principles of what makes carnivore successful is the goal so carnivore is successful because it eliminations it eliminations eliminates processed food eliminates seed oils it eliminates carbs eliminates the sugar it does all these things right so taking all those things out is part of the process the level at which we do those things to start somebody out may be different so I may have someone come in who's completely oh no not Dr Sarah hi I have someone who's coming in who's completely standard American diet where if I go to them and say hey we're going to switch you overnight from sad to carnivore they're going to quit day one so for them it may be let's get the first principle in line and let's say hey let's just stop eating bread out of a box or a bag if it's processed that's step number one and then go from there over a period of time and understanding that this is a process and uh maybe it's not even doing any of that maybe it's keep eating everything that you're currently eating let's just increase the amount of red meat that you have so everyone's going to be different but we're trying to get people to understand and follow the principles and the concepts of why these things work not fit within a specific methodology or protocol brilliant coach Brunson and Dr Sarah zowdivar you have got her name right you know the reverse TV series um just why you're swapping the bat on that's okay and we've got you both here firstly uh Dr Sarah do you know Richard absolutely I had him over on my YouTube channel it's one of the best interviews ever yeah of course of course yeah do you want to share something about doing that did you think it was worthwhile and oh have you seen the difference yeah I mean I'll go just go real quick I think first off getting to meet Dr Sarah was fantastic so that was that was that was very fun uh for me I think the biggest thing about reversed was um outside of my personal experience of getting to meet all these people and getting to build those relationships which was fantastic but just seeing that um much like what I just said where it's about Concepts and principles we all have our own little nuances our own context our own backgrounds and experiences that make us talk about things differently than each other but that's what makes this powerful and I wanted to say this earlier Stephen when you're talking about can we talk 24 hours about just eat meat yes we can because it's not about eating meat it's about relating to other people and all the different stories that we all have that bring people to what it means to eat meat so it's not eating meat isn't the message of this 24 hours the message of this 24 hours is that no matter who you are and where you come from this can help you move forward and that's probably the biggest thing that I got is you know I eat a little you know I have some things that Dr Sarah and I probably don't agree on there's some things that Kelly Hogan and I there's some things that Dr Barry or Dr kiltz or Dr chafee or Bella or Emily who you had on earlier you know all these different people we have little nuances and things that we do differently but it all comes down to eat meat don't eat crap move your body and get sleep right that's those are the four main things if you do those things 90 of your problems are going to go away absolutely what about you Dr Sarah yeah I likewise um coach Bronson like I just was so happy to meet everybody in person because I had interviewed pretty much everybody there like we knew one another digitally and so to see them in person was really cool and everybody was so kind and friendly and uplifting um and so it was really my first time actually meeting everybody in person so that was really really um fun and it exceeded my expectations and then just the fact that we got together in the first ever show on Carnivore diets is something huge I think and hopefully this will Mark the beginning of more to come you know just bigger better more carnivore programming so that we reach the whole world I mean you know imagine the diseases that we can reverse imagine the lives that we can impact if we remember our species specific diet you know brilliant so coach Brunson uh thank you for doing your hour shift much appreciated pleasure to meet you absolutely thanks nice meeting you guys and next time I got to do like two or three hours this was not long ago do you know when I when I came up with this stupid idea I thought oh 24 hours how are we going to feel that and honestly we could have done this for for three days couldn't we rich already yeah yeah so chafee didn't really want to go Dr Kilts has already been on I can come back if you want you know seriously the questions you know it's amazing so that's really really great so yeah so thank you for doing it again thank you Dr Sarah take it easy on them all right I'll try all right see you guys thanks for having me on for those that don't know you would you like to give yourself a little introduction sure um so I'm a nutrition professor at Miami-Dade College I am a classically trained dietitian so I grew up in Lebanon I got my bachelor's and my Master's in nutrition and dietetics over there and I did you know the whole year-long internship being brainwashed into the high carb low fat guidelines and you know became a licensed dietitian and then I flew to Miami and I got my doctorate from the University of Miami in exercise physiology and nutrition and I spent five years out of that doctorate researching and doing my dissertation on sugar addiction and I did that for you know five years between literature review and you know collecting the data and then defending the dissertation and even with that I was still in denial with regards to the addiction I was still I literally wrote a keto dessert cookbook after I defended my dissertation on sugar addiction so um that was like the academic background I also worked with the American College of sports medicine um and they uh so basically they hired me in order to train potential personal trainers to become certified with the ACSM which is the hardest one to get so I would conduct like intensive three-day workshops um teaching the basics of what like what are the things you got to do in order to pass that exam from the first try because the the passing rate was pretty low so you know I've taught for ACSM I've taught at the University of Miami at Miami-Dade College at DeVry University um nutrition courses and also exercise physiology courses and all throughout that whole period of time I am also struggling with binge eating sugar addiction um I've struggled with weight all my life and So eventually um through enough personal research realized that everything I was thought was wrong and so um I did keto and after seven days of Keto I felt like my brain came back online and that's when I was sold and I was doing keto for anxiety first it was an even for body composition and then I realized like wait a second I started dropping weight like crazy I was like okay and then from there though um I still struggled with binge eating and every time I would go through an episode like that I would um as a reaction to that episode to try and prevent that from happening in the future I would watch more podcasts on the topic I would go buy books I would do research um on PubMed and Google like Google Scholar and all of like scientific people like whichever place I could get my hands on data I was doing that so I became like the the master researcher I mean I've always been a nerd like I've always like I wouldn't even they wouldn't make me do my final exams throughout school because I was always at the top of my class I was like she doesn't need to do her finding stuff so we know she's just gonna do well so it's like for me collecting information and nerding out came easy to me and so uh but still even with that it took like thousands of hours I would say of like so many books and so many podcasts and so many articles reading until finally it clicked for me and I realized that um everything I thought I was taught was wrong and then and keto wasn't enough and addiction is real and there are plant toxins and carnivore is our species-specific diet and it's been a long journey basically and hopefully um what I try to do is try to bridge that uh Gap and try to help my students at Miami-Dade and also my clients try to get them from point A to point B in like a few months as opposed to decades which is what it actually took me fabulous that's a fabulous introduction I think that's the best one we've had so far Richard but I'm not really allowed to say that because every guest has been fabulous take that away from me I I couldn't take that away from you after you seeing that my interview was the best that you've ever done so yeah I agree that's recorded so that's going on air I'm reusing that and repurposing that again and again um we have some questions submitted beforehand um excuse my bad reading but this one is from Jenny who's been carnivore five months uh cut out Dairy recently and she's asked um can she eat ground beef and eggs long term and get all the nutrients that she needs yeah I think we have enough people doing that for decades and they're thriving to know that yeah you totally can um it's a good idea just because we don't have thousands of people that have been studies and randomized control trials are like you know very high quality scientific studies we don't have this data just yet because nobody has bothered to study our species-specific diet for some reason um it's a good idea to just get a nutrient panel just to see where you're at I know that um Michaela Peterson um was doing a lion diet for a very long time and turns out like folate levels were low but even even with that like I would see and look for symptoms as opposed to just having the blood test marker so um you could get those labs check for symptoms or you can just to be on the safe side take organ supplements or if you do enjoy eating organs you could do that but we we know and I think we all in this community have a a very good knowledge of so many people who are doing um you know just meat and eggs for decades and no nutrient deficiencies no scurvy and if anything it's like it's not like they're not dying they're actually thriving so you know and it would make sense right it is our species specific diet that is the diet that we ate for um 99.99 of our existence as a species here on Earth yeah it's cool Rich have you got um something to add to that yeah um do you mind if I share my screen let me see if I can uh do this again though because it didn't took me a bit of thing last time tonight it worked earlier there we are oh by the way that question is so good Sean Baker's coming on in a couple of hours and I'm going to ask him that very basic question because I think that was a great answer Dr Sarah I might actually answer ask a few people that because there are there is that common worry I'm giving you some time by the way Rich why you saw it I'm ready I think you you need to okay the screen deal um it's sharing my end but it's ready to go whenever you want yeah I think um that's what all I was gonna say was a lot of people worry about not getting enough nutrients strange when they're on this process sad diet that's a complete of anything right um you know so let's get yours let's get your screen share so the two two slides to this one is taken from the secret code book by um um my goodness calendar name and the other is uh it's from um Paul saladino's book um the carnival chord uh now if you look at the amino profile on the left instantly we can see the amino profile is far superior in animal proteins compared to to plant proteins and the slide on the right where we look at blueberries and kale compared to animal proteins uh in the case of ribeye beef liver fish roll and an egg yolk just by looking at that slide on the right hand side we can instantly see that there's a massive um increase in uh in micronutrients in in every aspect uh and and when we break it down I mean we look at Vitamin A vitamin A does not exist in Plants I think we covered this in our talk and we went when I was on with you uh Sarah no vitamin A implants plants contain Vita caridine which is a precursor uh it needs to be acted upon by an enzyme called pcmo to convert it into the active form of retinol so no vitamin E B vitamins incredibly low cabalamin does not exist in Plants contrary to popular belief vitamin c does exist in animal protein means vitamin D you cannot get from Plants you get this from the Sun and from animal proteins vitamin k does not exist in Plants you know kale is touted as being a good source of vitamin K but kale does not contain any active form of vitamin K the human body needs vitamin K2 kale contains vitamin K1 and then choline creatine carnosine carnitine taurine all these other things that we can only get from animal proteins every vitamin in the mineral that we need not just to survive but Thrive is found in in animal proteins um that presentation also highlights further on is when we remove these plant foods that are high in uh in lectins and phytic acid we actually absorb more of the nutrients so when we become carnivore not only are we getting more nutrients but the body's absorbing way more of them as well um but yeah that's a a super short uh slide or presentation in regards to the nutrient dense yeah like like you know papayas we all grew up watching it I know I grew up watching Papaya's cartoons and you know he's Downing the spinach you know for all the iron and it's like no you actually absorb almost none of the iron because of the high oxide content in the in the spinach you know and that's wrong and that and he was very wrong and that was that's why he was pulled off the air are they still making it I don't know [Music] which we can only get from animal proteins um spinach is incredibly high in oxalates um I I think sort of around by memory um you know one pack of spinach in the UK is 200 milligrams uh of uh 200 grams sorry of spinach which contains around 1500 milligrams of oxidates 5000 milligrams of oxygen has been known to kill people um so you know what do we do we take this package of of spinach we Chuck it into a blender and we mix it up with turmeric which is also high in oxalates um yeah this turmeric so Liam Hemsworth is a celebrity here in the United States and I'm sure you probably know him too he's like a famous actor and um he went vegan him and he was married at a time with the um Miley Cyrus and they were both vegan both eventually had to stop because uh Miley Cyrus and I quote what she said on the Joe Rogan podcast you have to stop because and I quote her brain stopped working and the moment she started adding Omega-3s in the form of fish like it was like as if the brain came back online and for him he had to stop because he had kidney stones because he was starting every day with a shape with the almond milk and the spinach and it was thinking oh that's like the healthiest start to my day and it gave him really painful kidney stones that required surgery so yeah yeah sorry I've got I've got another question what I've learned by the way sorry Sarah is we've got so many questions and we end up not getting everyone that's that's bothered to go online go for the questions just maybe not so positive Dr Sarah why does it seem that most carnivores keep slipping up and can't stick to the diet and before you answer I'm gonna say that's not my experience actually I think most people can't stick to it actually a lot of people can't I mean pretty much everybody that comes to me is because they can't stick to carnivore and it's because of the addiction and while I do think that you have a much higher rate of success on a carnivore diet because it's a sober meal plan it doesn't have anything addictive in it no carbs and if you don't do too much Dairy it's not as addictive it's actually the the least addictive food on the planet is a carnivore diet especially when you exclude the dairy so it is a little bit higher with success rate just because if we're gonna follow it you're not going to be constantly taking the drug in the form of sweets or artificial sweeteners or piece of bread even bread lights up the dopamine centers or those addictive centers in the brain so it does have a slight slightly higher rate of success but the addiction is still there and so people can do it and they feel great and they don't have cravings but then they don't realize that they still Harbor that addiction and so when they let go a little bit of the control or of the motivation of that comes from trying something for the first time like I just discovered carnivore I'm so excited you got that momentum you got all the dopamine coming from this novelty Factor eventually after a month or most commonly between like one month to 90 days one month to three months is when most people kind of let their guard down a little bit and they go to a wedding or a birthday or something happens and they think to themselves what's one slice of cake it's not the end of the world and before you know it the next day they're having and they're craving more sugars more carbs and they don't realize what just happened they don't realize that they just relapse because they're not even thinking from an addiction point of view right hey Ayanna hi so if you're not fully aware of what you're dealing with you're not treating it with the respect you're not treating the drug foods with the respect that they deserve and so you're too casual about it and and this is what ends up happening and so this is why what I've been working with recently is kind of revisiting really my dissertation and the thing that I specialized in and uh realizing like that is the answer and TR and basically fixing that dopamine deficit that everybody comes into carnivore with um and even if you're not a carnivore like most people who are struggling with their weight is because of that dopamine deficit because every time you engage in a drug whether it's a food drug remember sweet taste has been shown in multiple studies to be far more addictive than heroin not just cocaine like the cocaine studies are old now it's like it's more addictive than heroin so like yeah you stand no chance if you don't know what you're dealing with and so if you've dabbled with drugs like sweetness um or a real sugar or fake sugar or um alcoholism any kind of drug it all does the same thing it destroys the dopamine centers in the brain specifically it destroys the dopamine receptors in the brain because for you to feel good and have energy and be productive and not have cravings you gotta release dopamine in your brain and the dopamine has to attach to its receptor called a D2 receptor on the cell surface of your adjacent brain cell and so when you have that dopamine attaching to D2 receptors it's like a lock and key situation once the attachment happens is when you feel amazing Perfect Memory mental Clarity zero Cravings every time you have a craving it just means you're feeling what a dopamine deficit feels like you're low on dopamine in that state and so the craving is not for the cookie or the cake or the drug the craving is really to get a dopamine hit or it could be you can even get it from social media you can get it from so many different areas and so what I work with is yeah carnivore is a great sober meal plan but what I'm more focused on is optimizing and fixing that dopamine deficit I want to fix it and then why just stay here why don't we optimize our dopamine why don't we raise our Baseline level of dopamine because now all of a sudden my clients they're not just losing weight they're losing weight and getting sober but also making more money having more confidence setting boundaries it becomes easier to confront people when you need to confront them people respect you they treat you differently when you're operating at a high dopamine base like it they can sense it's kind of like the uh how you have like Alpha and beta in any uh interaction that's kind of equivalent to how much dopamine that person has the more Alpha you are the more dopamine you have the more beta you are the less dopamine you have and people can sense it when they're around you when they're interacting with you and they're in the room with you and so they're less likely to treat you negatively or poorly because they know you're you're tough and you know you're not gonna take that and so the whole their whole lives transform because we're dealing with the root cause of so many things so the weight gain is just a symptom of a dopamine deficit you know not making enough money is just a symptom of a dopamine deficit having anxiety and depression is a symptom of that dopamine deficit having um you know a poor memory is a symptom not being productive is a symptom of a dopamine deficit and so when we tackle the dopamine deficit and I like to do it with exercise intense exercise it's a very very different type of exercise not I'm not talking about you know doing like walking for five hours that's not what I'm talking about when we do that then we optimize dopamine centers and every single area of your life is going to be maximized and you can determine how high you want to be in every other area because the fitter you get the more dopamine you have every other area now is also improved Rich have you got anything to add we unmoved no I Sarah has hit everything on the nail I mean it comes back to what we mentioned earlier about the colominergic neurotransmitter synthesis um the body's ability to create these neurotransmitters comes from the food weak specific cofactors like Zynga and magnesium vitamin B12 Etc um you know when these are negated by certain foods that we consume then dopamine is is no longer produced and we are hardwired to chase dopamine so uh if we are not getting into a diet you know from natural sources then we are um we're trying to get it from from other sources and This Is Why We crave sugar things this is why food addiction um you know is a real thing and this is why we end up binge eating and as Sarah uh you know eloquently said that you know a piece of bread is still sugar you know it could be pasta it's not it doesn't have to be a chocolate bar candy bar um it could be you know a bowl of pasta rice uh you know it could be a bowl of vegetables even um but this is why I believe that you know a vegan lifestyle is not optimal when we're not getting the vitamin B12 of the iron um you know we're not getting um what does a vegan vegetarian consume lots of you know it's lots of lectins and phytic acid which is blocking the absorption of zinc gain and magnesium um you know this is leading to depression anxiety and we know from studies that vegans have a higher rate of depression and anxiety um how you suicide rate I believe as well um you know we need to be the meat you know this isn't um a fight against you know we have the same interests we care you know you brought your dog on earlier we're animal lovers I care for you know the condition of the animal that I'm going to eat you know I don't want to see uh cows in sheds uh you know contained and fed grain I want them roaming you know the countryside and live in a happy life um you know we all want the same thing but it comes back down to the foods that we eat them and the neurotransmitter signals in the brain and what we consume massively affects our it keeps coming back down to the same thing there's a reoccurring um message here isn't it that everything comes back down to what we put in what we put in is what we get out your diesel car doesn't run so well on petrol and vice versa um yeah so I think yeah on the head yeah fantastic I love it and yeah like you said you know if you the more you love animal the more you should eat meat because you actually end up filling up 25 times more sentient or emotion feeling animals to feed a plant-based or vegetarian or vegan diet when you're harvesting the soy and the wheat and the corn the sheer amount of animals that are sacrificed brutally murdered because inadvertently just in order to produce this food is just shocking and they've actually done a study on that it was published I did a YouTube video on it and you can check that out and there is a direct link to the paper 25 times more sentient animals are definitely not humanely murdered so which do you want to save more lives and if so all you need is literally red meat and you're good vegetarians also eat a lot of mushrooms mushrooms are sentients they're one of the most intelligent species on the planet yeah because it'll happily consume a mushroom you know a lot of people don't understand that but as a little piece of information are you uh learned from um uh gentleman we've got coming on later uh Sean uh Sago sakarovsky uh he taught me that one doing a podcast um incredible piece of advice but yeah they're quick enough to eat mushrooms mushrooms are sentient beings you know so yeah is that what I say they're fun guys just just like you and I why why would you want to kill fun exactly so a nice a nice question that's got the Zeitgeist here laughs uh based on your experience in nutrition research do you see the tide turning in favor of low carb diets in recent years I think we've shamed the American Heart Association and some of those and the American Diabetes Association we're just so publicly shamed them to the point where kind of they're trying to weasel their way back into low carb you know they're not doing it willingly they're it's like it's like grabbing a child that's throwing a tantrum and like dragging them into uh to see the light and so that's what's happening it's just uh you know they're they're just so closely aligned with the food companies that's the problem and so their paycheck and their funding um dollars in their jobs rely on keeping those large food companies happy and what is the thing that sells the most drugs sugar and carbs right there's a reason why the food companies can make so much money it's easy to make money when you're dealing with highly addictive Foods in broad daylight without any checks or balances and hooking children where their brains are still developing from a very young age and nobody says a word right we regulate smoking but when it comes to sweetness that's far more addictive than heroin it's okay to feed it to a two-year-old you know it's it's okay to go to school the preschool and give them all the the candy and the sugar and so yeah so they they the the food companies are literally um addicting the population from a very young age which makes the vast majority of people have a very hard time reversing decades and Decades of of addiction age of onset of a drug use is a very strong determinant of whether or not you can get sober from that drug and so what is the age of onset with sugar some are like one year one year of age when I was two or three years of two or three months old I was given condensed sugar it's condensed milk which is all sugar and cream and milk condensed milk instead of breast milk for a whole month straight until my mom found out because she had to leave me because Lebanon was in a civil war she had to leave me for a year or so with my uh with my grandma and so I wouldn't have the formula when she laughed and um and so I uh I was given condenser because like oh she'll take the condensed milk they'll shut her up and here we are 36 years later yes absolutely rich do you want to add um you know feel free to to dive in do you think I mean you sell supplements right so have you seen a tired turning do you see more people coming to you for keto and Carnival products yeah again I mean you and I do with these free lives every week you know we don't get paid for them we do the public speaking events you know we put an awful lot of effort into spread in the word um and I think it is working you know uh people the average person in the High Street now knows what uh keto and carnivore um you know five years ago you would stop 10 people in the street and you'd be lucky if one knew what what keto was I think what they think it is and what it actually is are two different things I mean they still view it as a diet and they don't understand what it is it's a big education piece and in there lies the problem um and it's through episodes like this that I think we're gonna get that out there that you know ketosis and again just to read a point we've made previously if you were carnivore you were in the metabolic state of ketosis Carnival and key door the same thing they're just different subsections of the same metabolic State um you know and that seems to be a big bug bow within the community around people I'm Carnival um you know it's one and the same it's just you're in a different group um a different subsection is the same thing but um it's a metabolic State it's our natural metabolic State it's the metabolic State we're born in and it's the metabolic sleep we've evolved in our entire existence when we understand that we're living in this natural metabolic City the heals and repairs the body uh then we can move forward but um unfortunately we are constantly obligated for every piece of information that is published in regards to the benefits of of protein and the you know the benefits of saturated fats and cholesterol uh the sugar Association will release another one to say that you know eating Kellogg's cornflakes is essential for you know to start your day the study you referenced earlier um uh but it is increasing it's certainly getting out there um and I'm quite shocked to be honest sometimes I get customers and clients who come into the shop and I'm astounded by the level of their knowledge and understanding in regards to some of the things that we speak about so it is death The Tide is definitely turning um how and when that impacts so you know you and I are members of the public health collaboration you know we work with doctors and nurses from the medical community um you know we are trying to spread that word as part of the public health collaboration and it is spreading Dr David and winner genuine who are guests on next I believe um you know they are predominant figures within that and you know and they're pushing and pushing this within within the community uh you know as we all are it is turning um when will it be accepted you know who knows but I think you know as as Sarah you know quite early it would be said that um you know at some point the banks have got a burst we are flooding it with with this information and it's only a matter of time I think until something will give but when that happens I don't know let's just hope it's sooner rather than later you can't help but feel that there's an underlying um you know thing going on behind the scenes I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist or anything but you know it it all seems to be and you know there's a machine here to keep us sick yeah you know you're not rich dude I mean it's it's demonstrate it's demonstrable you can see that big Pharma and big food do not want you to eat this way because it stops their profits I don't think that's going to get my channel shut down saying that I think that's that's absolutely I do it's just obvious and I think it's not going to come top down it's going to come from the bottom up and yeah but it's it's people that are going to accept it I tell you the big food is never going to accept it it's not going to be in the mainstream media but then that Legacy Media is is defunct really most people get their news from this sort of thing so uh and yes obviously YouTube tried to shut down discussion and stuff like that but in the end they've got to make money and if the views go down and if people only look at you know Sarah's videos your videos Sean's chafee's Dr Kilts you know everybody's videos if they're getting traction and advertisers are advertising on there that it's where the money is I mean it's where the money is and and the Legacy Media is just you know anyway let's not rent let's let's keep it nice and light 24-hour live stream uh we've got H young question here uh I'd like to start by just giving a little bit of context and then I'll hand over to Dr Sarah any research and dialysis patients on Carnival um if we look globally at dialysis machines before Carnival let's be honest Carnival is not a very big way of eating at the moment lever is live carb I think Ken Berry actually looked into the numbers dialysis centers where he lives and around the area that was something like eight in the 1950s something like 12 in the 60s and 70s now there's about 20 000 this is off the top of my head it it's a huge growth industry and uh business I'm sorry we're talking Health but it is a business and dialysis is uh you know they're making money out of these patients that's really horrible thing to think of but that's that's a reality um I I seem to remember Dr chafee at the beginning talked about somebody coming off dialysis because the carnival um so I know that's an N equals one but this is also one of the things that bugs me a bit because if you've got an N equals one and I've got an N equals one and you've got an N equals one and everybody's got an N equals one well that's actually data isn't it that's not that's not an anecdote if I got 500 clients and they've all got better and 250 a reverse type 2 diabetes that's that's reality that's data so um anyway right that's my little bit I'm going to take a back seat um any views on dialysis on Carnival yeah well no thank you for the little background um what is the number one cause of kidney failure type 2 diabetes right now it unfortunately if you get to a point where you've damaged um your nephrons your your kidney cells so much where they cannot handle now the metabolism of protein because you have to to digest protein you break it down into amino acids to uh utilize the amino acids in a lot of cases you would have to remove the amino group which is like that nitrogen atom that's part of the amino acids and so that deamination um reaction leads to nitrogen being converted into ammonium right away NH3 which is highly toxic so the kidneys have to come in very quickly and they have to convert it and actually the liver does that but it has to convert it into a less toxic form so it turns the ammonia into urea which is a less toxic form of nitrogen waste product from protein metabolism so it's a lot of work um you know and then the the kidneys have to release that urea excreted and so the more protein you eat it is true that your kidneys have more work to do because they have to excrete more of the urea because you have more nitrogen coming in and so if you got to a point where the you know your your kidneys no longer have that ability now you need regenerative treatments um in some cases you could be lucky enough that your body regenerates itself just by removing um plant Foods if the cause was some autoimmune reaction and you remove that and the cells can regenerate but it it's it's it's uh really hard to say that um this is going to be the norm because it really depends on how far along you are how much damage you have to your nephrons and you know whether and what the actual cause of the kidney failure was it just high carb content for a long period of time is it an autoimmune reaction are you reacting to certain foods uh you know are you so is there could be so many um different um causes which which can determine whether the diet alone can reverse this uh the the end stage kidney disease or not so it gets harder the more far the further you are in in any kind of uh condition the the harder it gets to say with complete certainty like yeah you can reverse it you know even with type 2 diabetes like type 2 diabetes very easily reversed in the beginning but if you've had it for 30 years then you know you you start having so many things that happen because of that that it's like it's not enough to just eat red meat now you know you have to do so many additional things so yeah I hope this makes sense and I hope that this answered the question and I don't know if uh Richard too you guys want to jump in on that as well I think you've covered it yeah I mean it's uh yeah nothing to add first time for everything remember hashtag the best yes exactly exactly you know people are gonna be like oh no we're joking guys we're joking uh let's have a look then um do you know I mean you know coach Brunson has his tournament meniscus healed does anyone know that foreign [Music] thank you Michelle Dr Sarah where can we find the study on Plants slash animal to share with those who are concerned about sacrificing animals if you just go to a YouTube and put my name Dr Sarah animals vegan diets if you put those keywords my YouTube video that I filmed on that topic should should show up it's very quick it's literally like a three minute video but the article that I'm referencing is also um in the description box so you can have a direct link to it yeah and I think Rich you mentioned earlier something about the um the harvesting you mentioned on mono crops do you want to just quickly repeat that because I don't think that was during Sarah's section we were talking about animals dying yeah when we you know desertify a field to grow crops um there's a couple of things you know basically we destroy an ecosystem the combine harvester will go through that field um and I don't know if you've noticed this but birds and seagulls will um you know will circle at the combine harvester and that's because of all the dead animals that it's picking up as it's going through the field um but then we grow crops within that field it's treated with toxic chemicals this this destroys um the microbes in the ground it kills an entire ecosystem birds and bees die off um so lots considerably more animals die as a result of growing crops compared to eating one cow so I use a local butcher um The Butcher for me is is two miles away um you know the distance traveled uh is incredibly small I'm using you know as a carnivore I probably consume one the equivalent of one cow a year uh but a vegan who drives the soup Market kettles an entire family of animals every time that they get in the car you know I know they're not doing it on purpose but if you do really care for for Animals health and well-being then being a vegan or vegetarian is not um you know the best best source for that even when we look at impacts on environment um you know vegans will consume and this isn't a dig of vegans or vegetarians just want to reinforce that I'm not against anyone's personal choices but I think that information out there is is scarce and we need to repeat this don't we and we'll bring back that study now sorry Stephen yeah we'll we'll read that again now um but you know we fly in these exotic fruits from all over the world yet you know uh a carnivores are blamed for the cow farts that are destroying yours only which is absolutely ridiculous um you know especially when we look at the amount of methane that a vegetarian will release from eating plants you know it's it's yeah it's Preposterous isn't it but that's that did you want to bring that back up again that's a fantastic yeah yeah I mean this is the Smithsonian National Zoo and conservation Biology Institute and they've got a low ball estimate that 67 million birds are killed each year due to agricultural pesticide yes take a picture of that I'm taking a picture of it do you want me to do this and um you know that extrapolates to about 672 million Birds poisoned in total just from pesticide use just Birds uh you know now I'm a member of the Royal Society for protection of birds and this but this bothers me in in a big way and I think it is quite surprising people don't realize that carnivores are also animal lovers you know if you want to get play on my heartstrings you show me an animal being mistreated I mean this morning I was looking I'm really in very interested in this as a side I don't really put out publicly I mean uh like rescuing animals uh part of one of the donations I made that they had a a puppy four months old you know been kids covered it in glue and dragged it through the mud and left it for dead in this Cobble box you know we should be looking at stuff like this like this agricultural pesticides we should be looking at cruelty we shouldn't be looking at cows that are out in a field you know eating grass and actually having I've got footage of cows loving where they are you know jumping around stuff like that and they have a much better life than you know animals in circuses and all this sort of stuff so I think um don't get into that too much because it's quite sad but anyway let's have a look let's get back to the live stream um let's have a little look uh yes you what you what you said about mushrooms Rich has definitely ignited the chat yeah one or two times yeah with the mushroom that's hilarious I'm glad you had fun so uh Dr Sarah what exercise do you do to raise dopamine the painful one it is the sensation of pain that upregulates Baseline levels of dopamine especially D2 receptor numbers this is why like if you're just walking there's no pain there so it's not going to upregulate your dopamine receptors the only exception to that rule would be if you were bed bound and now you want to upregulate dopamine levels but to go from bed bound to you can't jog you know so walking even a quarter of a mile feels so difficult for you so it's the sensation of difficulty that keeps upregulating your dopamine receptors so let's say if you're fit and you're running and you're doing great if you keep doing the same intensity you keep maintaining the same Baseline level of dopamine if you want higher you have to now push yourself to be able to run faster which means in order to go from where you normally run to go to a faster more intense speed there's going to be pain involved because that's the only way you grow right if I want to grow a muscle I can't lift the same weight that I normally lift I have to pick a heavier weight that's uncomfortable it's that discomfort that allows me to progress and become stronger have stronger muscles and also increase dopamine receptors so anything that is painful will do the job my preferred method I think it's fastest most effective honestly easiest in my opinion way to raise dopamine levels is is via exercise and a lot of times most of the people that come to me they have weight loss they want weight loss and they're struggling with sugar addiction and so exercise targets both it helps them lose weight very quickly while at the same time targeting the root cause of their addiction the root cause why they can't stick to a carnivore diet so it's like two birds with one stone rich what would you say yeah fantastic it I mean for me the exercises um as you know I used to come from a bodybuilding background so he was lifting weight and now it's destroying myself on a bike or or going for a run yeah um yeah running and cycling is uh my new form of chores and torture but uh as long as you're torturing yourself you're doing good and you know it is a hard place to push yourself through sometimes I was on the bike indoor yesterday um I was short for time uh I didn't get a chance to uh to get out on the bike so I jumped on the indoor trainer um and it's incredibly difficult to stay motivated in in indoor but I pushed I was hurt in I was sweat and I did about 40 odd minutes um yeah it uh it hurts but you know it you've got to push these boundaries if it's not hurting it's not working uh and take that with a pinch of salt to a degree I mean I don't want you to go in June yourself but you've got to push these boundaries um you know move in is fantastic uh and you know Stephen uh mentioned earlier but uh you know that elderly person sitting and standing from from the chair uh and that was uh an exercise that was um hard and difficult for them at the time but then they progressed from working you know walking through them and it's about pushing these boundaries so you know begin at the level you can push to the boundaries uh but it it's got to hurt a little bit it um if it's not hurting it's not working and then yeah I mean yeah sorry go ahead yeah sorry just you referenced um just someone did message me about that woman that I helped get out the Zimmer's frame and they asked how do you do that on the NHS I don't work for the NHS it was private so um sadly to get the sort of rehab and nutrition device that I offered the National Health Service doesn't do those things so uh for that but what was you going to say Sarah sorry um I was gonna say that the pain threshold goes up too so if um you feel a lot of pain when you first try to push yourself a little bit just know that that intensity of pain you will eventually not feel the pain as much and the more you do it eventually you become numb to the discomfort you're still pushing yourself beyond your limit and you would expect to feel a lot of suffering but you actually are numb to it like that's that's another thing to look forward to and I think that's what stops a lot of people because they cannot imagine going through 10 minutes of such discomfort forever and they forget or they don't realize that your tolerance to pain also gets better you adapt to the painful sensation because dopamine is an anesthetic too that's the reason why dopamine is being upregulated it's like uh oh you're I don't know what you're doing Sarah you're having a lot of pain let me upregulate your dopamine receptor so that in the future you're not constantly feeling those painful moments because they seem to happen every day for you and So eventually you become numb to it so I can push myself beyond my limits without really suffering as much or feeling the same intensity of discomfort the way that I used to in the past you know what I mean yeah that training that training response is is fascinating and it and I always use an analogy for um the bed of nails okay we have ascending Pathways and descending Pathways so if you lie on a bed of nails initially that's going to be quite painful so that goes up the ascending pathway across your spine up into the somatosensory part of your uh your brain and then there's the humunculus there that knows where that pain is coming from sends a message down down through your spinal economy to where that area is and it lessens the pain it sort of cuts it off at the at the you know the impasse so what happens is you can lie on a bed of nails it can be really painful and then 10 minutes later you'd be fast asleep because you you have this instant physiological response and I know that sounds really not true but that's what happens and that's the popularity of the Shakti mats these mats that you can buy that are acupressure they're very painful I use one when I have a lower back pain you know if I've trained too hard what don't get the pain but I just think it's good prevention by the way which we haven't spoke spoken much about prevention is better than you know trying to restore yourself after you've injured yourself and I think that that's fascinating um I'm rushing because when we're coming towards the ninth hour and Dr Sarah we want to make the most of having you around be wary I'm going to do a little joke here so we've got someone called T Ford I'm wondering if you're a model anyway no all right could you get you Tom send me your soup could you please give advice with regards to gout and high uric acid levels with regards to diet I seem to react badly with any fructose or spotted with gout and wheat yeah so um that's the thing that keeps a lot of people away from carnivorous like oh you eat carnivore it has a lot of purines which turns into and increases uric acid which can cause a gout flare up and that's just not true um if you talk to anybody who suffered with gout and did carnivore they will tell you that it completely eliminates gout attacks and that's because your own body can create its own purines and so as a matter of fact like you very um very accurately realize that you know the fructose and it's the weed and it's the carbohydrates but especially fructose that increases your own body's production of uric acid which then um you know you you start having symptoms of gout when the joint pain and the inflammation so don't uh don't fall for the Smith that oh you know purines can only come from the meat that you're eating you know and so if you're eating meat then that's gonna raise your a number of attacks and felt like that's actually the complete opposite and I think with from my history of Bloods you can have high uric acid and no gout and you can have low uric acid and gout the correlation between uric acid and gout is not there and that's from thousands of actual Bloods and thousands and thousands of data points and people that are coming in and having their bloods taken and um you know this this is where you look at it and you think right now I should say to you have you got Gout because you've got this high uric acid level well no I haven't right so that's where Bloods and uric acid you know they don't just don't correct they're more complex than than just that yeah very well said thank you okay rich yeah I completely agree I mean who readings get a bad rap but you know these are created naturally in the body from the big breakdown of cells for energy for ATP and GTP you know purines do not cause gout um five to ten times more created within the body than we get from the diet now when we look at uric acid uric acid it can be increased by pureins purines but these exist in normal joints as well as you know people who suffer with with gout but uric acid is actually an antioxidant um it's excreted by the kidneys for over 50 but it's reabsorbed back into the body so something that is toxic the body you know wouldn't be reabsorbed back into the body so yeah this whole thing about purines and gout and eating meat is you know is a fallacy it um it's inflammatory in nature which is what the standard diet would do in regards to carbohydrate and the foods that we eat fructose as we know um you know that's a contributing factor um uh sucrose uh elevated incidence insulin resistance alcohol um all of these can be other factors and magnesium potassium um a known factors to decrease gout so it comes back to our electrolytes again but again it's it's all of this mis misinformation uh in regards to to protein it comes back to protein all the time isn't it um protein has such a bad rap yet it's the most nutrient dense food on the planet um but yeah these studies are out there unfortunately but yeah nothing to worry about in regards to protein and gout so we've got our new guest in the waiting room Dr Jen Unwin and Dr David Unwin who I'd like to bring into the meeting uh and and say hello and then we'll finish with your questions Sarah if that's okay which is about tryptophan so let's uh let's add Dr Gin Unwin and David unwing to the stream hello hi guys screen uh we're just finishing off this hour with Dr Sarah zaldivar and this final question um so Dr Sarah how do you get tryptophan for sleep on a carnivore diet so sleep is actually one of the most commonly reported symptoms that improve on a carnivore diet and that's because there's so many things that could trigger insomnia there are so many things that could lead somebody to to struggle um with the falling asleep quickly and staying asleep um I like to remind people that when your brain is not inflamed and you are optimal in your dopamine and serotonin production serotonin eventually turns into melatonin and so now that regulates uh your your sleep cycle and your your surrogating Rhythm and I think that that is one of like the biggest reasons why people report just massive improvements in their sleep and the cool thing is like the Sleep latency improves so much so instead of tossing and turning for half an hour before before you fall asleep I've noticed so many people reporting on a carnivore diet it's like the moment you go to bed you're done in like five minutes and um and so it's just it affects every single hormonal system in the body every single physiological system in the in the body is affected positively the inflammation goes away your needs also for Sleep decrease so you might actually feel like you're going to require less total number of hours of sleep until you wake up feeling refreshed because now your body isn't having to deal with the inflammation from the seed oils and the sugars and The Addictive foods that you were eating previously so all in all it's one of the strongest things it's like that and better skin better mood better joints those are the top top most improvements that we see when people first make the switch to a carnivore diet or our species specific diet thank you Dr Sarah zaldivar that's a brilliant hour you've given us I really want to thank you so much for your time and the great answers to all the questions absolutely thank you everybody fantastic thank you Sarah very much appreciated great chatting again thanks for the comment on being number one I'm using that again [Laughter] I enjoy take care thanks so Richard I'm going to hand over to you because I think you know Dr David Unwin and Dr Jen Unwin and I don't so so I've um yeah I mean I I did a podcast and had the pleasure of meeting Jen in the PHD conference uh I didn't get chance or the pleasure to meet at David in person but Hello both uh welcome on board um thank you so much for coming on uh Jen and I recorded a podcast recently uh on food addiction which is one of the things that we wanted to go into detail today amongst other things but look look thank you both so much for coming on um huge huge pleasure to get you on you uh it's been a longer being nine hours into the 24-hour life I was wondering if we weren't the tail end or at the beginning you're just getting in your stride now nine hours amazing you're crazy you crazy guys yeah do you know initially we were concerned that we wouldn't have enough content uh but it looks like we're running out of time with the speakers I don't think we've I think we should have allocated more time but uh yeah nine hours and counted do you both know uh Stephen no hello hello Dr Jen and hello Dr David I mean I know of I know of you too and um I'd love to get you onto my podcast um I'm a specialist practitioner in diabetes and obesity the diabetes thing I love I love the the sugar infographics and all that sort of stuff that which is great obviously disappointed David hasn't got his bow tie on but um because I was expecting that yeah expecting the signature bow tie we're just being next door it's our neighbors 50th wedding anniversary and we were like oh we gotta go Gotta Go Oh I appreciate it thank you so much I just had this crazy idea that we might be able to spread the word by doing something unusual and it just had a ring to it a 24-hour live stream the biggest conversation about keto low carbon carnivore it just seemed to get people's interests we're the only people with enough energy to do it exactly well that's true yeah in fact that's the first thing we opened with that saying that when we were high carb if we were trying to do something like this we would be thinking oh we've got a week three times a day oh this is no good we've got to have breakfast you know and we would have panicked trying to do 24 hours literally I have a little sort of selection of stuff there to possibly eat and I haven't touched it once it's incredible and you're right this way of eating definitely does that um I'm going to hand over to Rich because for the viewers that don't know you we do need a little bit of an introduction of what Dr Jen and what Dr David do yeah fantastic I mean um Stephen has kindly written introductions for everyone but um we've been handing over to the guy so would you both like to introduce yourselves and give us a little run down on that on what you guys do yeah do you want to go first David I've opened my mouth now so I'll uh I'll carry on carry on uh yeah so I'm um a GP from north of Liverpool and um I'm really interested in what are the true causes of The Chronic illnesses that slay if my patients have why are they ill and I realize now I didn't show much interest in that I liked curiosity about why are people ill for the first 25 years of my practice application far too often now that I've really got into wire people ill I'm discovering that lifestyle is often um at fault and if you change lifestyle we're not using drugs specifically I'm obsessed uh and that isn't too much I'm obsessed uh with helping my patients with type 2 diabetes control their diabetes or get in permission without using drugs and I look after the physiology side of it and just talk to you about the psychology side of helping people Church their behavior we've been doing it for 10 years now in HS practice and we've published a lot of papers we go all over the world spreading the the word and arguably we've now gotten the best results of any clinic in the world and this is in an NHS Clinic looking after people with type 2 diabetes so this week I saw my 130th patient that's achieved drug-free remission of their type 2 diabetes and it just gives us such Joy and such pleasure and we hadn't seen drug free recognition of diabetes I hadn't seen it once in the first 25 years of my practice and now we've seen it 130 times and it just get back to said at the beginning um really if if the problem with diabetes is a high blood sugar it seemed reasonably logical to think well where did that sugar come from and could I have eaten it and that's the basis for us of the of the low carb diet that we use so it's in 10 minutes appointments we're doing this but we also have run groups group consultations for 10 years for me in general practice so that's I think that's enough from me now Jen yeah you're a bit yeah I don't know your room you're a bit so you're a bit fuzzy as well we can't hear you very well we've got a thunderstorm here so it's yeah yeah but um maybe it's just over you then anyway so Jen's feet seems fine yeah it might seems mine seems fine um yes so I'm Dr Jen um when I'm a clinical health psychologist by background so I've I've always worked I've retired now from the NHS but I was in the NHS for all my career helping people with chronic conditions to live as best they could with those conditions so it might have been chronic pain or some sort of disability or disfigurement or some some sort of Life limiting um condition and helping them to sort of um live their best lives with with whatever that condition was so I was always really interested in motivation and behavior change and um and hope so hope was my big topic and I did my doctorate on Hope and the difference that hope makes to to how people adjust to physical health challenges and to be honest hope makes such a massive difference it even makes a difference to how long people live so people are more hopeful uh and to take more steps towards sort of um you know their goals and their and their best hopes are actually more likely to to live uh longer to take less medication to consult doctors less often Etc et cetera so it you know makes it makes a big difference so that's the psychology side and then as David said about about 11 years ago now um we just thought it would be nice to work together we haven't put our skills together and worked on anything before then and I just recently found low carb I'd struggled all my life with with weights and uh and so on and I read Dr John briffel's book um escape the diet trap that some people will have come across he was also a British GP but he was one of the first to sort of talk about low carb in this country and so we thought and it worked for me so we thought right we're gonna try it we could see how it could work we're gonna try it with David's predator patients because they were just more and more of them and they were just getting sicker and sicker and um the first 18 patients um we wrote up for the um for a research article and and it's just been going on ever since that the rest is history practical diabetes on yeah impractical diabetes and then um I also really realized that low-carb ketos it's fantastic but it's kind of yes if people stick to it and um people people like me with food addiction problems and body weight problems often have problems sticking to a low carb diet even when it's worked fantastically for them you know or they felt amazing on keto we've got all those benefits that you've been hearing about in the last nine hours and we even know that then some of us really struggle to to stick you know to stick to that lifestyle so I started getting more and more interested in in that and wanted to really understand this thing that um that that looks like an addiction you know it quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck it looks exactly like an addiction um people who you know still craving foods that you know they don't actually want to be eating are losing control of eating those foods and continuing to eat them in in spite of the fact they know they're harming themselves physically and mentally and you know what what else would that be apart from someone with someone with diabetes who continues to eat um sugary carbine Ultra processed foods it's a it's kind of a form of self-harm so I'm just super interested in that and that's that's what um I've been concentrating more on in the last sort of four years four years or so love this fantastic and an incredible comment there um incredible 130 lives that should say saved I think opposed to change I mean because that's exactly what you guys are doing is Saving Lives isn't it um and unfortunately I mean there's this is common uh disassociation between carbohydrate and sugars within uh the community you know we feel carbohydrate and sugars as being two different things uh they are and one and the same carbohydrates break down into sugar and unfortunately within Society people who are consuming lots of bread pasta cereals um but unknowingly consuming High quantities of sugar as well as damaging Latins and phytic acid and things but circling back to a comment you just made there so you Jen with a catalyst that began all of this in the first place which I wasn't aware of so fantastic pretty brilliant stuff yeah it's it's like that um I don't know whoever said it but I love it is to to make your mess into your mission so you know it's it's it's that thing of if you've struggled with something and you've tried to understand it and you've actually you know you you feel that probably through that struggle you can you can help other people to live a better life you know I think there's there's nothing there's nothing more rewarding than that is there and to carry on learning and helping more people it's um yeah it's very it's very very rewarding and we get to what's lovely is that we get to do that together you know it's not we had two separate careers but now as David says you know we get to speak together and people invite invite us to go all around the place speaking so what would be nicer yeah fantastic and I think you know we're all in a similar board in that regards you know Stephen and I um we give up much of our time for free to do lives every Sunday uh free coaching public speaking events in regards to to spreading the word I mean I think um you know we touch base on it earlier Steve wasn't it that we feel that we found a secret and we're trying to spread that secret to as many people as we can um you know during our podcast you know I I mentioned too that I used to be a type 2 diabetic clinical obese suffered with depression anxiety arthritic pains daily debilitating migraines that would make me blind for which I was on three different medications for um I was unable to walk up my stairs without stopping or being severely over breath and from changing the food that I put into my mouth uh I didn't only reverse every one of those things I lost 107 pound reverse to diabetes I went on to become a professional uh champion at a pro level a European Champion um and this is all down to diet and lifestyle and you know similar to a similar situation my wife and I have sold three houses to put into the business where we try to re-educate people and this was the whole idea behind this this live this crazy idea that Steve came up with where we've got life for 24 hours um which I'm sure he's beginning to regret now and I know is in but a lot of fantastic you know and coming back to something you said there now I mean it's food addiction and something you told me during the podcast food addiction is not a recognized illness within the NHS is that right so we've got alcohol addiction drug addiction gambling addiction yeah so at the moment obviously you can't because it's not recognized here or in the State anywhere internationally in the even in the US although there are probably a little bit further ahead than we are in sort of acknowledging that it may be um it may be a problem um yeah so of course that means because it's not acknowledged there's very little research being done and there's very um little indication about you know how you effectively help people and therefore there's no help we think that conservatively I mean really conservatively 10 of the population probably have this problem a bit a bit like you know all of us drink alcohol but not all of us develop them you know uh a kind of clinical problem with with alcohol the same with food a lot of these kinds of foods and many of us struggle you know to resist them but that there is this this group of us that that you know really have this really addictive sort of relationship with processed foods and particularly sugars and carbohydrates um so 10 would would equal about four and a half million adults in in the UK so that's four and a half million adults doing themselves harm on a daily basis um don't know what to do with themselves you know struggling and if if they go and see their Healthcare practitioner unless they're lucky enough to live in Southport and they get to meet David those Healthcare practitioners aren't wouldn't know what to do with them they wouldn't probably ask about it they wouldn't know where to refer them you might get sent to Mental Health Services but they wouldn't have any idea how to treat you you know the even the Addiction Services they're not going to be interested because they only treat alcohol and you say like drug addiction these are these other addictions so it's um it's yeah it's a sort of um hidden sort of Emperor's clothes thing like we all if you ask the public is it possible to be addicted to to certain foods that they're going to say yes but then there's no help for people or you know you're actually kind of laughed at if you say so that certain foods are addictive and people say oh food can't you know how can food be addictive we have to eat kind of thing for one of the things one of the things is shame that people in every Clinic I do I'm discovering people who they know they are a car addict but it's the shame they say it's so ridiculous I can't give up bread in fact bread is is one of the things one of the foods I made most and here's a funny thing I never found a single birthday in the first 25 years but if you never ask you never will find them because they're so ashamed yeah um and they nearly ought to cry when they tell me because they sound so ridiculous it's almost a relief when people understand why they're behaving in this odd way intelligent people eating stuff those shortening lives and it's a great pleasure really to help people with that in terms of at least they know they're not mad yeah they get that sorry yeah I think it's the big problem is they blame willpower you just lack willpower which is absolutely ridiculous to say I mean I've never met anybody that smokes for their health and I've never met anyone that smokes and says I'm just choosing to smoke you know and it's it's the same with this drug carb addiction there are people that say to me I know I shouldn't eat bread I know I shouldn't eat donuts I just can't stop myself and it is just that's right because they're driven near the Primitive brain is is driven uh to you know to kind of stop you starving basically and there's you know you're driven to to eat these Foods even though when the frontal lobes are telling you you don't want to eat those foods but your hand reaches for the foods it's it is the most incredible process and of course you know makes you feel like you're a bit Bonkers if you don't understand that that mechanism and so as David says people kind of hide it they're ashamed that they can't control themselves um also there's the kind of denial Factor because although we know we should give up our Foods the thought of and David will tell you this the thought of giving up the bread or the chocolate or whatever it is which is kind of your best friend well it's not your best friend is it but it you know life without those things feels incredibly you know it just feels impossible as well so people are often often in in denial about the harms that that are happening and also they don't know what what to do anyway so there's just someone deny it's a problem yeah and again sorry another supplementary point I'd like to make is that you know I can help patients with cigarette addiction with alcohol addiction and even gamble gambling there is no substance so I can refer you for your gambling addiction which is very serious on ruins lives yet here we have this thing which is affecting so many people and we're denying that the condition actually exists so that there is no help for any of those which is a real tragedy but it is shortening lives it is King people and I'm so mystified how I missed it 25 years and it's such a tragedy that many people are suffering privately and secretly and there's nobody they can tell and any doctor you go to is going to say well we don't have anywhere to refer you uh for that time to tell them about your book Jen probably oh yeah yeah so um I have got a copy here so I wrote I wrote a little book in lockdown called fork in the road and uh all profits go to the public health collaboration which is the charity that um Rich was at the the conference for and it's just got all the all the basic things that I'm probably talking about uh this evening are in that um in that in that little book and uh you'll also be helping helping the charity that David and I both work for and support to spread you know this thing what I was saying about raising people's awareness spreading spreading the good news and hopefully soon we'll be launching some courses for professionals to understand the problem and also for the public themselves um you know we'll be doing groups and courses um so that people can people can start their journey to recovery love this it's fantastic and you know it um it baffles me how this isn't recognized as an addiction because for me it's the single most um uh detrimental thing within Society um you know we look it comes back to this name and shame of things you know we become ashamed of the food we yeah and I've been there I've hidden the food that I eat and I know that I'm doing wrong I'll nip out to uh or used to nip out to a fast food restaurant uh I'd hide the rappers um and it's this it's this name and shame um Society where people will just say to you that um uh you know uh you need some Willow power but it goes well beyond that which is what we touched base on during our talk it's uh it's how it affects uh the neurotransmitter signals within the brain it these these Foods block certain Pathways the catecholinergic neurotransmitters within the brain um they block the co-factors like iron zinc and vitamin B12 which we need to synthesize things like serotonin epinephrine um do you want to go into a little bit more about that in regards to how these foods that we consume are blocking the absorption of these cold factors and and the production of of these these these neurotransmitters because when our brains when we're not receiving these signals you know we go chasing dopamine for example don't we we're hard why yet to chase dopamine and I think you know this is a massive contributing factor to to this addiction and it isn't that person's fault it's about understanding that the food that they are consuming is contributing it is this vicious cycle isn't it where you need you need to understand what's causing in the first place to remove one or two of these offending Foods then our neurotransmitter signals um the catecholam and neurogic neurotransmitter synthesis began you know begins to to ramp back up and and we feel a lot better but we went into a lot of detail in this didn't we do then doing that talk do you want to find a little bit more yeah it certainly can do and someone's just made the comment haven't they the common denominator in alcohol and food is is often is often sugar and all of these things are operating in the same part of the the brain so whether it's alcohol sugar cigarettes you know it's it's all to do with these neurotransmitters and um um yeah you you're absolutely right that dopamine is is a big part of it and we're hearing more and more about dopamine aren't we people are sort of you know yeah dopamine that's kind of interesting and we know it's also involved in things like um mobile phone you know addiction addiction to kind of scrolling as well that you know we we we're all very we wouldn't be here today if we weren't sort of motivated to get certain things and Achieve certain things that's how we've thrived it's been really motivated to find the food that we needed or to you know to to do the jobs that we needed to do during the day to survive so when we have um old processed foods or you know even just simple sugar sugars and and carbohydrates um one of the things that happens is we do get a nice a nice sort of dopamine boost and kind of we love that but what goes up must come down like all like all things and the brain doesn't really like these high levels like everything in biology there's a kind of balance in the body you know one thing's going to sort of interact with another thing so um when the dopamine goes high for a long period of time the brain thinks oh there's a lot of dopamine slushing around here we'll just um we'll just knock out a few we don't need so many dopamine receptors in the brain um but of course the problem then is that um when you don't have as many dopamine receptors in the brain in the normal course of your life when you're not eating sugar you're feeling a little bit flat because it doesn't feel that you know this there's there's enough dopamine so then you're looking for the next hip to sort of give you another boost and then the brain thinks oh you know there's another bit of high dopamine we'll knock out a few more receptors and it's a really bad idea to not have enough dopamine receptors because we start to feel more and more depressed and more and more anxious and it's been shown in studies that you know these high sugared diets do leave you genuinely feeling more depressed and more anxious so um so that's one thing and then there's a similar path that goes on with with serotonin um when if you have um sugars are high then obviously insulin is my um to deal with the sugars but when insulin is High um tryptophan can cross into the blood brain barrier more easily than normal and tryptophan gets converted into serotonin so you get big nicer tone in how you feel great but what goes up must come down and again so so it's um it's a vicious cycle going in a bad way that you know it's a trap that's difficult to get out of because you do get withdrawal symptoms not visible withdrawal symptoms but um psychological withdrawal symptoms of feeling more low feeling more anxious Etc um and you have to get through that and out the other side to to start to feel better which is what I experienced all those all those many years ago um but at that time I was just thinking of it as a sort of physical withdrawal if you like um which it which it is it is to some extent but it's it's also psychological so yeah yeah for sure and just to go back to something you just said about um the tryptophan I mean the opposite is also true in a state of insulin resistance insulin resistance and inflammation would block um the dopamine Pathways and we're hardwired to chase these dopamine hits so we we end up searching for other ways to stimulate you know these uh these daunting hits and we get this through sweet Foods sweet Foods really stop coming into the measly pathway so we Chase these sweet foods and it can't even be carbohydrate from bread or anything but you know another factor that is that these Foods we are consuming are incredibly High not just in carbohydrate but in lectins and phytic acid which are blocking these cone factors the iron magnesium vitamin B12 which we need to synthesize uh you know the the um tryptophan yes as well absorption of nutrients when they're back caffeine I'm I I don't know that much about that whether whether that is the case or not um but but then definitely yeah there does seem to be a factor that when you start chasing this High then then people start focusing on chasing that and of course the other Foods drop out of their diet I mean I remember this happening to me where I would just eat pasta and ice cream and pizza and I wasn't having any foods with with nutrients in because they they weren't giving me that kind of buzz so then then you're crowding out the The Good Foods in in your diet and then people become they are literally deficient and they're craving stuff which you know they're craving real foods but then that all gets confused and you end up just chasing these uh dopamine highs nourished 100 yeah overfed and undernourished and it's worth thinking about the nutrient density of food it gives you a new A New Perspective on what nourishment means because it really is not about calories anymore now um the I'm just thinking about the vitamin deficiencies we're getting the practice so uh vitamin D deficiency very common folic acid deficiency uh I've stopped measuring that it's so very very common and then iron deficiency itself um internationally that's a very big one yeah and again from there it um we know that processed foods and these sweet treats are bad for us but then there there are groups of people out there who are actively trying to improve their health and well-being they're eating lots of fruits and vegetables thinking they're doing the right thing while neglecting yes uh animal protein so the issue with this is and this isn't a star but vegans and vegetarians I've repeated this you know multiple times today I work with vegans and vegetarians I respect anybody's decision uh in regards to diet nutrition but unfortunately vegans and vegetarians like a young we can't get Ayan from from spinach Popeye was was incorrect uh the human body needs Hemi and we need this from animal proteins uh a vegan or vegetarian diet is lacking in vitamin B12 you cannot get B12 cabalamin from from Plants um and zinc were lacking so these these these standard uh you know healthy diets that people are going on who are consciously making an effort to improve their health and well-being these are the encounter intuitive in regards to this this production of the capicola Moto transmitters because these are again missing the cold factors of iron zinc and b12 so even the vegans and vegetarians who are actively trying to be fit and healthier um are causing issues and I think did you and IGN or was it another podcast we referenced I think a study where um vegans are vegetarians have a higher rate of depression and suicide so I mean it comes base all comes back to this food business so it's not just these sweet treats it comes back down to even the foods that we believe are highly nutrient dense in regards to to fruits and vegetables animal proteins and I think you guys will agree are the most nutrient dense foods on the planet and this is what's missing you know predominantly from you know from from a healthy diet yeah that I mean certainly the people that that we see when we so we we sometimes do weekends where actually with people and we've obviously done all the catering and we're watching people you know to choose what to eat and um they they so so often um you know don't choose enough protein they don't prioritize prioritize protein oh yeah see that's a lovely comment yeah that's why that's why you want carbs yeah because you your brain feels like you're searching for something aren't you you just kind of feel flat you want you want to boost and um because the other side of um of treating this is not just that you focus on the right foods to eat that's the foundation you know people should eat yeah high quality proteins and fats as a basis if they want to add in a bit of this and that then you know that that's fine as well um but it's not just about it's not just about that it has to be about how how in your life in your Modern Life are you going to get your dopamine serotonin oxytocin and endorphins in um in a good way in a way that isn't going to cause problems like getting it from multiprocessed food or smoking or alcohol or binge watching Netflix or what you know whatever it is how how in your life you going to kind of Dave and I like to think of it like going back like if you were in the tribe back in the day what would you have been doing you know to to to feel good like you know natural things like singing gardening walking um I mean there's so many different hobbies that people could have that would help them and these are the sorts of things that we've given up in modern life because we're you know we're too busy at work or you know we were too tired or you know whatever it is and we need to you know really make these things habits throughout the day to to balance the brain chemistry and to keep us feeling good so that we're not falling back into feeling bad feeling stressed feeling tired you know sleep so important because all of those things will trigger us back into the these food problems or or other behavioral problems that are that are bad for our health so it's really important to to work on those daily habits that that keep you keep your brain well direct sunlight is really important sunlight um for serotonin I think the last lady was talking about serotonin and melatonin we need to get outside we need to walk you know we'd need to plug our dogs and talk to the family there's all kinds of things that we can do to kind of feel better that that aren't going to be about relying on food pass it over to you um really quickly I mean obviously um expert in insulin resistance and inflammation so we've covered uh the psychological effects out of food addiction um and again I mean Jen I don't think that gets anywhere near the air time that it should um you know this is a massive thing that we should be plugging and pushing a lot more this this you know this is a massive addiction but coming from the other side now David when we're consuming these Foods we're suffering with insulin resistance and information how can you explain to them this is how this is damage into the body and what we can do to to repair this yeah yeah I think the first thing remember the whole thing is that a high blood sugar damages the lining of your arteries in hours we've got a non-stick lining of the artist to your brain and your eyes and your kidneys and that is called the glycocalyx and only a few of a high blood sugar damages the glycocalyx and then against that let's think about insulin and once it's there boy it's there to protect you and me uh from high blood sugar so insulin reacts quickly to get out of your stream where it can do damage and it actually it's a good question is where does the sugar go and I'm often asking patients where do you think that Sugar goes and it actually gets turned into fat inside the cells so some of the sugar is used up obviously for running around but give us consume more carbohydrates than we need to run around and the extra is turned into fat inside your cells gives you your tummy which Richard it sounds as if you had a bigger tomato point but more importantly the um the fat increases in your liver and this is real important this is the work of Professor Roy Taylor from Newcastle University where you continue to eat breakfast cereals rice potatoes biscuits and your liver is filling with fat and unfortunately the fat in the liver interferes the work of insulin so that you become less sensitive so your insulin doesn't work as well and that means that you're less able to deal with blood sugars so for a while you're only if if your insulin doesn't work well you are forced to produce more insulin you become hyper insulinemic you produce more insulin but unfortunately there's a double whammy here because the pancreas the gland that produces insulin is also filling with fat so your ability to produce more insulin is compromised and this is absolutely at the heart of how millions of people become type 2 diabetic so the two problems one is your insulin doesn't work as well the other is producing insulin is a problem so that after a while you actually have type 2 diabetes which means you cannot anymore regulate your blood sugar to within safe levels and those high blood sugars can damage the lining of your artery as I told you at the beginning it's got to a point now I think it's 38 percent of the entire uh of the developed world have fatty liver so that's more than one in three of everybody we know and I know in the practice um the number of people with abnormal live function and fatty liver there are thousands and thousands of patients and they're getting younger and younger so one of the main effects of too much carbohydrate in your diet is that that all has to go somewhere and it becomes fat in your belly it also uh becomes fat in your pancreas and uh can somebody just point put in the point yes there is a connection between um hyper insulinemia and pancreatic cancer and actually there is a link between hyperinyl anemia and eight cancers so I have seen um an increase in certainly colorectal cancer in deep low very heavy that's definitely happening and of course insulin we talk about insulin and glucose but it does lots of other things insulin is a growth factor and so this would make sense really around cancer and Insulin so if insulin is a growth factor you need it for puberty to grow but it's also part of how tumors uh can grow and I'm afraid it doesn't even stop there um in our early work together were really confused and surprised by the improvements in blood pressure that our patients were showing and I personally found my blood pressure improved and it took me two years to find out what is the link between giving up carbs and improving your blood pressure and this is it the answer so we've known since 1932 it's a high carb diet is a high insulin diet and Insulin causes your kidneys to hoard salt so high carb is high insulin your kidneys don't we out salt properly and that puts your blood pressure up and significant improvements in blood pressure for people when they go uh local I expect most of you notice when you first went low carb you weed a lot you're actually weighing out lots of salt and it's why if you go keto particularly you might need more salt at the beginning of the diet because otherwise get headaches and keto flu because suddenly you're weeing out adult you've been hoarding for a while and I Jen and I both have a lot more uh salt than we used to I think I've probably said enough now it's time Jen yeah not fantastic love that I spot on I mean high blood pressure is an insulin dependent State um instead of elevated insulin insulin will pull sodium from four points in the nephrons and the kidneys back into the blood wherever sodium gauze water follows this is why we get high blood pressure um uh a lot of research into the rent around in Andrew attention aldosterone system uh you know reveals several mechanisms in regards to why we retain um uh elevated uh sodium levels but we shouldn't fear sodium it's not the source of of high blood pressure and unfortunately it's something else that's been demonized within Society sodium is in fact essential for life we cannot live without dead um there's a study that I met us in one of the talks that shows when we go below 1500 milligrams of sodium per day uh all cause mortality increases massively so sodium is another thing that's been demonized within society and it's another thing that we shouldn't be feeling we should be consuming lot of sodium particularly from natural sources like pink Himalayan organic C sorts of a fantastic point there on on blood pressure and again coming back a true causes of illness that I made at the very beginning that again for 25 years I'm just giving out drugs for high blood pressure without thinking why do they have high blood pressure and this demonization of salt is unfortunate salt is dangerous in a high carb environment so it's true carbs and salt together um give you prop and of course just as Jen was talking about how were we designed we weren't designed to do in a high carb environment because that didn't exist for okay this is a situation by saying we we're just aiming the wrong crystals we're always blaming salt for what the sugar did can I answer should I answered on this about uh so Rose says um how do you feel about being absent from sugar flat mobs is it necessary and is it possible so it's definitely possible so there's absolutely no need for us to ingest any carbohydrate because your liver is just gonna make the right amount that you need of glucose the little bit that your brain needs and there's one or two other needs that we have it's about a teaspoon of sugar in your entire bloodstream at any one time so you can see that if you eat a banana that has about five teaspoons of sugar you've already got too much sugar and people think things like bananas are incredibly healthy and necessary if you go to the gym well um as you can see that rich it's done very well going to the gym without any carbohydrate and I do my little old lady boot camp four or five times a week and I I'll seem to do okay um without without any carbohydrates at all now whether it's necessary is is more of a kind of individual question I'd say it's it's probably a good idea I don't know why any yeah uh it's probably a good idea to give up sugar if you if you can um that's it's a basically a poison so it's never never gonna do much for you um in terms of how low you have to go in terms of carbohydrate depends on your goals and also your reaction so you know if you're type 2 diabetic good idea to to go low but obviously if you're on medication check that out first because we don't want people uh falling over with low blood pressure or low blood sugars if you're on particular kinds of medication um but from an addiction point of view again it's really individual the foods that people have to give up and it depends which foods to you are a little bit like drugs so for many of us with food addiction we end up giving up all all carbohydrate type foods apart from maybe some you know Green vegans and stuff like that other people who perhaps aren't quite as far along the journey or who who may be the metabolism and their you know they've not they've not got so far they're not so so damaged they can sometimes cope with a little bit of sweet potato or you know maybe some some you know some some things like that um but but a lot of us find that we just feel better cutting out um all sugars and carbohydrates so it's a bit of a long-winded question but it's kind of an individual thing and it depends what your personal problems are really um how how far you want to go and and see see how you feel um does the liver make sugar in type 1 diabetes um yes I think the answer to that is yes it would would have to wouldn't it David because you yeah you need it your brain needs a certain amount so that's part of the problem for them is they make sugar but they can't deal with it because they haven't got any insulin so they have to they have to inject a certain amount of insulin to deal with the sugar that the liver's making although I'm I'm kind of answering I'm answering David's questions here I love it love it just to add on to the back end of that as well I mean coming back to the insulin resistance um you know we all know someone who has actively tried to abstain from eating um or at least tells us that they're doing so and they don't lose any weight and we think that they are up in the middle of the night stuff in their face with pies and pasties when in fact they may be telling the truth because this weight loss is controlled by the endocrine system it's not uh calories in versus calories out and it comes down to predominantly insulin and insulin's role within the body cream back this insulin resistance um that while insulin is elevated insulin upright Glitz uh light bulb protein like Biz which signals the body to store fat doesn't it um and why didn't sing is elevated is biologically impossible for us to burn that fat for fuel we need another enzyme called hormone sensitive light base to break those bonds and the glycerol backbone to put those fatty acids back into the bloodstream now the issue with someone who is a highly insulin resistant is insulin is elevated but for such a long time they may go hours and hours and hours though you didn't but insulin is still elevated they are not burning any fat for that entire time so someone coming from a state of high insulin resistance is going to take a little bit longer to reverse that that's why it is critically important to go low carbohydrate um and you know everybody is individual so if you're coming from that state of severe insulin resistance it may take a little bit longer um but this isn't a diet is it you know we're not teaching about this is a lifestyle this is where eating real foods that are having low impact on on insulin response keeping that insulin low keeping um the glucagon to insulin reassure low so we're able to utilize that fat for fuel but that's an important fact that I think with the Curve without insulin resistance because insulin resistance um you know we we associate that with type 2 diabetes um but type 2 diabetes so if you go to be tested with yourselves in regards to type 2 diabetes um a person may come back as not being type 2 diabetic because you're testing blood glucose and not insulin isn't it so um the reality is that insulin may be increased behind the scenes and you are in fact insulin resistance because the point that you would diagnosed with diabetes began 10 to 15 years prior to that so if you have been tested for diabetes through um you know glucose a glucose intestine it's it's probable that you are insulin resistant and away tell his Central adiposity skin tags skin irritations I think that most of us on the High Street were highly insulin resistant and that you know this is why we need to actively look at carbohydrates foods that are listed in this insulin response and foods that are high in lectins as well also because I think lectins um they they tend to get uh they don't get the air time they deserve but lectins are carbohydrate binding proteins refined to insulin receptors and Signal the body to slow five times more fat than insulin does itself and then we've got seed oils which are high in oxidized omega-6 linoleic acid which causes insulin resistance I believe around six percent higher than carbohydrates or the effect of insulin does so there's all of these contributing factors I've thrown a lot at you there to do either one of you want to jump in and add or or anything well I just wanted to say Rose I think a little bit better than hunger go on then yeah I'll go first then and then okay there's a delay so it's been difficult I wanted to talk homego uh in the context of what you were saying really so I'd I'd summarize it we are actually a dual fuel engine so it's genius it can burn fat or we can burn glucose problem uh The Sting in the tail for insulin is because of insulin's um priority to deal with sugar it bits you from being able to burn fat so in a carb environment with insulin resistance it's very unlikely that you'll be able to burn your fat and this explains why somebody might be very overweight but they're genuinely hungry so they are genuinely hungry and hunger actually is that's the problem people eat because they they might be addicted but they're hungry they say they're hungry and they are and this is just a point that might interest some people so if you get your insulin down low enough then after an adaption period which can take up to two weeks you start burn the fat and then again in every Clinic that I do people tell me they're suddenly surprised not to be hungry and they're saying things like do I have to eat breakfast because I just don't feel I have to and I'm saying hooray no you're burning fat now you've got fat to burn and that's what you're about and I think uh I know myself if I'm feeling really hungry I've used a some things wrong somewhere in my system if I'm um I'm really hungry so I just wanted to underline what you said around the dual fuel engine and around hunger and uh we're talking about keto and keto is really that's when you're burning fat and you tend to be less hungry so I'll shut up now and it's Jen's turn I was just gonna go back rose yeah Rose was saying it's so hard isn't it I've really really sympathized Rose it is it is it is really hard for those of us who's uh I've got this you know this real struggle and probably I don't know like me you've probably had it since you were born I can't remember a time when I didn't you know just love sugary carbohydrating stuff um and was kind of thinking about it a lot of the time you know some of us are kind of really really born with that so it is really hard um and you've got a support group so that's superb that's great yeah just keep trying don't don't be dieting don't be sort of thinking that it's about restricting what you eat have plenty of your protein and your good fats eat eat on a eat on a regular basis don't be trying to sort of think of it like a like a diet that's that's my main advice and then also work on this other stuff in life that you know gonna gonna give you that feel good Factor that's that's not to do with food those of us that are food addicts just obsessed with food and it's all we think about and we need to force ourselves to exercise and do all the things and have other hobbies and um uh you know get get all of that going in life so I'm just really sympathizing with anyone on here who who's uh who's struggling with the with the food addiction and um you know we're going to be setting up some groups and support groups as well through the PHD so maybe you can join us as well you can never have too many support groups just brilliant I think we'll put a link to the public health collaboration in the description on YouTube and then when we put the clips out from this as well we do exactly the same thing um we're gonna have to wrap up this section because stream Yard can't do 24 hours in a row so we're gonna have to say goodbye to Dr David Unwin and Dr Jen and then spend about five minutes telling people how to follow us for the next uh next 10 hours wow so this is the end of this section but I've learned so much I love listening to you both I think you're sort of like a yin and yang it's quite nice to to see your different approaches exactly it's excellent um wrap up because you yeah thank you both so much for coming on I don't think the time that we've had is anywhere near long enough um I I'd love to do this again with both of you uh maybe we could do a joint thing Stephen maybe you know for another podcast but there's lots of information to put out there I think we've only just scratched the surface but thank you both so much for taking the time on a Sunday especially as you celebrate in a wedding anniversary I believe you said it was um but yeah thank you both so much um Steve can we pop the links when we post this uh obviously this is live but we're gonna post this moving forward we can pop links to their their uh yeah what's going to happen is is YouTube will have 10 hours uh which I am going to edit down to to hours um but there will be one version of this which will be 10 hours um so just give me a couple of weeks to edit it all down and I'm it will take a bit of time but it'll be worth doing and you'll have all the links and then I'll try and do some clips of you like you know the main points if I can but it's going to be a bit of a task anyway I want to thank you just for turning out but it'll all be out there soon by the end of July hopefully it'll be there yeah fantastic thank you both massively appreciate appreciated thank you both so

bear with me I don't want to um get this wrong so what's going to happen with it basically with the live stream stream yard could not um do 24 hours in a row so if you want to carry on watching uh you're gonna have to go for to a different YouTube Let me just come back to where we are uh I'll post it in the comments that's where you would go to watch the next the next well it's gonna be seven hours actually because I split it 10. uh hours and then we're gonna do seven and then we're gonna do seven so so stream yard couldn't do 24 I'm not knocking streaming up by the way um the difference in price was incredible for those that want to know what goes on behind the scenes I pay 25 pounds a month to you stream yard and I can record 50 hours but you can't recall 24 hours in a row if I wanted 24 hours in a row that 25 pound a month goes up to five grand uh so we just had to split it into three which I'm sure you'll understand so there's 208 people currently watching hopefully your flip over to um watch the next seven hours and we should have Sean Baker it's starting us off we've got Kevin stock we've got Judy Cho we've got some really great guests um if you're watching on the playback exactly the same thing on my channel on Richie's Channel you'll be able to watch the playbacks in that full entirety if if YouTube are up to it of 10 hours or seven hours and then I will be
