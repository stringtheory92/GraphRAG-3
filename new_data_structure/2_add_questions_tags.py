        You are given an excerpt of a video transcript (YouTube live Ask Me Anything) in which a doctor is reading questions or comments from the carnivore diet community and then responding to the best of his ability. 
        The transcript contains both the community member's question or comment first (as read by the doctor), followed by his response.
        Due to the context of the AMA format with Super Chats, etc, the question or comment as presented may be fragmented or unclear.
        Your tasks fall into two categories: 
        1. Generate a complete and comprehensive question.
        2. Generate a list of tags as a subset of a provided list of available tags that represent any portion content in the excerpt - be reasonably thorough here.

    Questions:
    1. Infer the most relevant question being answered in the transcript. Use both the question at the beginning of the excerpt (if it exists) and the context of the entire response to help determine the complete question. 
    2. Only return the question portion of your response. DO NOT ADD ANY ADDITIONAL TEXT BEFORE OR AFTER THE QUESTION. 
    3. DO NOT PREPEND WITH 'QUESTION: ' OR 'INFERRED QUESTION: ' OR ANY OTHER TEXT. ONLY PROVIDE THE QUESTION.

    Tags:
    1. Only return the list of tags as strings.
    2. Do not include any numbers, symbols, or extra words like "Sure!", "Here are", "Keywords:", or other similar phrases.
    3. Each tag must be from the provided TAGS_LIST without additional formatting.
    4. Include all tags within TAGS_LIST that represent topics touched on within the excerpt.
    5. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY NUMERATION, ADDITIONAL COMMENTS, OR ANY OTHER TEXT AT ALL. ONLY 1 KEYWORD PER INDEX AND NOTHING MORE
    6. DO NOT PREPEND WITH 'KEYWORDS: ' OR ANY OTHER TEXT. ONLY PROVIDE THE LIST OF KEYWORDS.

    The inferred question should be a complete sentence, as if someone had asked it directly, ending in a ?
    The tags must exist in TAGS_LIST to be included in your response, and representative of some portion of the excerpt. 
    Consider each tag in TAGS_LIST and carefully select the ones that represent some portion of information in the excerpt.
    If a portion of the excerpt touches on a topic represented in TAGS_LIST, it must be included in the list.

    Excerpt: {excerpt}
    TAGS_LIST: {TAGS}

    Please respond with the inferred question first, followed by a list (python list - []) of tags.

    You are an expert assistant tasked with processing excerpts of video transcripts. These transcripts come from a YouTube live "Ask Me Anything" session where a doctor reads questions or comments from the carnivore diet community and responds to them. Your responsibility is to:
    1. Accurately infer and generate a complete, coherent question based on the fragmented or unclear input at the beginning of the excerpt and the context provided by the doctorâ€™s full response.
    2. Identify relevant topics from the provided tags list that are representative of the content in the excerpt.

    To achieve this:
    1. Focus on reconstructing the most relevant question. The question must be complete, coherent, and inferred from the entirety of the transcript excerpt.
    2. When producing the question, **only** output the inferred question as a standalone sentence. Do not include any additional text, explanation, labels, or preambles such as "Question:".
    3. In the second task, output **only** a list of tags relevant to the excerpt. Each tag must be directly selected from the provided TAGS_LIST. Do not add any additional words, symbols, numeration, or explanations in your response.
    4. Your responses must be formatted as follows:
    - First, provide the inferred question.
    - Immediately after, provide a list of tags (one per line) relevant to the excerpt, without any added text or comments.
    5. Ensure that both the inferred question and the tags are based solely on the transcript excerpt provided and strictly adhere to the instructions.
