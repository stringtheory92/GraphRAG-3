    "title": "Dr Robert Kiltz, Fertility Expert and Long Term Carnivore!",
    "transcript": "[Music] hey everyone this is uh dr anthony chafee i'm here with a very special guest today dr robert kiltz he is a fertility endocrinologist specializing in uh women's health and fertility health especially dr kilts thank you so much for coming on well dr chaffee thank you for inviting me i'm really a pleasure the pleasure is all mine um for for those of us those of the people in the audience that don't know your work can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you do well i'm a fertility specialist at cny fertility in the united states and globally really i've been doing uh women's healthcare reproduction for 30 years prior to that i studied as an ob gyn doc a reproductive endocrinologist which is specializing in ivf and other reproductive issues uh miscarriages failed pregnancy other genetic disorders and that's kind of been my focus but i talk a lot about carnivore and keto and health and wellness and mindfulness so that's kind of like my focus in life is healing both on the natural side and also the medical side uh and integrating against some some complementary medicine and spirituality at the same time yeah nice and and so you talk about obviously the diet side of things in carnivore and i understand you're practicing carnivore as well uh what how did you come across this like this isn't uh obviously something that's all that widespread and you've been there for a while so how did you how did you come about it well about 20 years i kind of started getting into the integrated medical side in my practice integrating yoga meditation spirituality and things like that and some of my patients were getting pregnant on something called paleo and i'm like what is paleo diet because you know we were generally trained the diet doesn't matter and it doesn't matter what you're doing and i used to think celiac disease was kind of made up in things and as i began to read about paleo diet and uh uh let's see and then then i kind of found this thing called keto diet and um you know i was i was always into exercise and fitness and um i did weight watchers for a while atkins and did all those things uh working to stay healthy and yet i had bleeding in my bowels arthritis psoriasis migraines kidney stones and and so as i i i don't know remember who i came across but i was watching another one of those either uh uh diet doctor or uh uh low carb high fat uh uh uh experts and i saw this this this guy about my age i'm 66 now so it was about 15 10 or 15 years ago he was fit and he said i eat only meat and i don't exercise and i said that sounds like something for me so i did it personally in one month so keto made me feel better but it wasn't until i did carnivore did my bowel bleeding hemorrhoids kidney stones migraines eczema psoriasis gone and so i figured if it's working for me and my patients getting made our paleo that's when i started talking about paleo and keto but carnivore is one of those things that is just off-putting so you know it's like oh i can i can i'll give everyone this but you know i don't want to scare them away but um now i'm i talk about carnivore as like the top of the line and i still intersperse keto and paleo for those that just kind of aren't quite ready for the carnivore craziness yeah well that yeah it's totally understandable i mean people don't even know what what carnivore was a few years ago now at least it's a it's a term that people bandy around whereas like when i when i first moved to australia people had no idea what the hell i was doing you know i would say you know i only eat meat and they they literally look at me like i had three heads i had to explain myself basically almost violently uh like two three times a day be like you do what exactly yeah and i mean i i am not a hundred percent all the time uh because at 66 i mean i've been feeling great for over 10 years and occasionally with my friends or family i might have some french fries i might do i'd make an ice cream but you add no sugar to it and it's still good and um i occasionally sip a wine or a martini but that sips and it's rare if you've got a problem and you want to heal it it's carnivore is this the top notch and i also believe that fasting in one meal a day is like the critical component to this okay so so you you incorporate fasting along with carnivore as well i do one meal a day at night and i personally think that is the very best thing um if you can do more than a day all power to you but you know as a human being it's you know where daily routine i think is really critical in life but i think fasting if you can't do carnivore or keto but you can fast on a regular basis it'll help you tremendously for sure yeah you know i totally agree with that like it's um you know there's tons of evidence for that and what i find interesting is a lot of these studies show similar efficacy with fasting and a fasting mimicking diet which is essentially just keto and um do you find that there's there's an added benefit on carnivore to fasting as well yes because i i've um see some of our theories on medicine are completely wrong in health and wellness so the the bowels are a digesting uh bucket that you want fasting means you have an empty bowels well no one has an empty bowels unless they go on significant fasts and so by eating only one time a day uh you're you're more likely to to maximize the empty bowel syndrome which ultimately you want an empty bowel because as long as the bowels are full of mostly carbohydrates you're always secreting sugar and the other plant products into the bloodstream yeah all the blood from the bowels goes to the liver so as long as you have sugar again a complex carbohydrate plant-based diet always secretes sugar into the bowels or into the bloodstream yeah all the blood goes to the liver and the liver does what it's meant to do with sugar and amino acids which is make fat and so glycation is the leading cause of all disease yeah that means our bodies our bloodstream has excess sugar a tremendous long time basically the day you're born to the day you die and so i actually believe insulin is not the culprit in any of this it's only sugar along with the other plant phytochemicals poisons the antigens and then the fermentation of the carbs in the bowels due to a an inc to a the microbiome uh which is fermenting and and killing us essentially so if you can fast even though you like to eat carbs if you could go on a two to three day fast but no one can do that of any real regularity and and i think that you want to get rid of the antigens and the fermentation yeah no absolutely yeah um so have you how have you incorporated this in with your patients or well well i i started off because i write a lot and if i don't write something that i can understand and they can understand but i i kind of write downloadable easy to read and understand about keto which it really incorporates keto carnivore our our next version has carnivore as sort of like this is it i mean it's in here but you know keto is that buzzword so if i i give them these things the family building guide for fertility and my keto is really for fertility uh you can buy these on amazon or download them for free from my websites but uh you know i talk about it incessantly because of you know so much of medicine is out of control cost wise you know in america it's out of control and so um i speak about it i write it about it and i do my blogs about it um and i offer literature uh and then i share your website and all the others that are in this keto carnivore space that i think is really really radical nice yeah and then um and how are you seeing this you know be affected in in just the fertility world how is this helping uh your patients well there are so many people on our instagram youtube and facebook that are sharing their stories that you know either keto and carnivore really reduce their inflammation and or suddenly they delivered a baby naturally and didn't miscarry so you know i'm not a i'm not a i'm not a big data data to me sometimes can be uh uh distracting uh lies damn lies and statistics and science you know really what i've found is like you you're telling your story uh and so many other experts are telling their personal story and and we're sharing those personal stories and i just time and time and time again all of their diseases go away but in our case fertility which is the foundation of life is reproduction you know people tell me oh i'm healthy but i just can't get pregnant or stay pregnant well if you're not getting pregnant or staying pregnant you're not healthy and health and wellness is in the success of the human body in what it's here to do which is to create and reproduce and pcos and metabolic disorder endometriosis adenomyosis and fibroids uh are are so common pelvic pain you know pcos starts in the early years now you know 13 12 11 i think the damage happens in utero because you know we're all eating a standard diet which is getting through the placenta damaging the reproductive organs at a very early age but it's all about stories the more people tell the story you know that's where i'm seeing the big change in this in this field you know the more we the more we complain and blame about others the the least we're gonna have of of really making a change here but now it's about we're all sharing the stories it's crowd and community sourced healthcare that's what we need in the fertility world and and the neurologic and cardiovascular and you know infinite areas yeah yeah absolutely like um you you see some people detracting from these things you know people saying like well i've reversed this i've done this i've done these sorts of things you'll get man is like well that's just anecdotal it's like okay so i guess it didn't happen then you know i guess this person didn't actually reverse their crohn's and get pregnant and um you know what i think of that is more that's that's actually running the experiment you can have all the studies you have all the the the literature but are you when you run a real world experiment when you try this with your own life does it work or not and you know as richard feynman uh physicist said it doesn't matter how brilliant your theory is and it doesn't matter how smart you are if it doesn't agree with experiment it's wrong and so you know people can tell me all day that oh yeah you're you're gonna die you're gonna do this and yet and yeah and yeah and yet i'm not and and so you know it's wrong i i uh i think you know it was william davis david perlmutter it was uh it was gary tobbs that was sort of like the book that changed i kept on reading it and listening it and there was another gal a world turned upside down by by richard feynman um and it's so many books out there but i recently found a book by dr salisbury yeah yeah dr salisbury salisbury steak yeah like in the 1800's the guy figured out that all of his men were dying of dysentery due to plants yeah he fed them steak and coffee and they all got better yeah and and so you know i think with with you know i started doing uh videos about 20 years ago and i was kind of mostly focusing on meditation and prayer and positive intentions uh rhonda byrne i think from australia uh the i don't know if you've ever read the secret and understand the concepts of the mind in all of this but i focused on that and then as i i said learn more but this is now the source for medical health and wellness yeah uh in the patients or we're following everyone's following everyone and the more we can share what you did to get to the health and wellness and all of us are you are responsible for our own health care no one no no doctor can really be responsible for my health care i am and so i think that you know we're finding someone that that we're learning from and as i went you know weight watchers atkins paleo keto carnivore you know i i had to personally experiment with those things even though you know this stuff has been around by salisbury and you know it goes banting and way before that you know our ancient our ancient heritage as tribal hunters yeah is really really what you are but you know i still we all still you still get you know comments like what what yeah yeah where's the paper if you wait for the paper that's gonna solve your medical problem today you're dead yeah yeah and that's um that was someone said um i'm sure you're familiar with uh atul gawandi who wrote like complications and better and things like that and one of the one of the lines and better he uh was talking to this guy who who dealt with cystic fibrosis they had the best numbers out of everyone and he was you know he did things in a very particular way and he did things differently than than the you know the normal guidelines and gawandi asked him about this and he just sort of laughed and said you know if you if you practice evidence-based medicine you're always going to be two years behind the curve and or more or more yeah yeah you know it's evidence-based medicine is just a model that we've been sold as doctors and so we've missed so much that's available in in health and wellness and again it's the scientific studies are all funded by a mission yeah and it's it you know it's the funding a carnivore diet well you know diets are hard to come by uh anyway because you know it's like what did you eat last week i'm telling you i asked everyone what'd you eat i eat healthy well i eat clean i i like i don't know what did you eat well i i ate um i ate meat or or vegetables and but no no what did you eat exactly that's hard for all of us i can only remember what i eat for the last five ten years because i eat the same thing yeah yeah but but it's it is um the science of getting your papers published it must meet the mission of the publishers unfortunately and so you know people ask me to participate in science and research i'm saying listen i already know what the answer is you don't have to believe me don't do it if you don't want but we're meant to eat fatty meat probably once a week because food was hard to come by drink water and breathe air and we likely didn't run on a treadmill and go for a walk in nature because you were going to be taken down by the wild beast quite readily and you know why did we eat plants or figure it out well i mean basically if you couldn't kill the wildebeest and you were like starving you're gonna eat a mushroom or you're gonna eat a fruit and a vegetable and god bless you if you survived it you know you were able to maybe reproduce but plants are the cause of all disease and humanity unfortunately yeah i 100 agree with that i think that you know and salisbury you know already nailed it you know in the 1800s you know which i think is amazing and uh you know that's like sort of what i'm trying to write now basically is just arguing that that the so-called chronic diseases that we face nowadays are not diseases per se but toxicities toxic buildup of species inappropriate diet and a lack of species-specific nutrition you know in plain terms too many plants not enough meat and you know and this can you obviously there are genetic issues and there's trauma and childbirth and delivery and there's problems that come and and that was the mainstay of medicine for thousands of years and now it's chronic disease management and it's well i i went to medical school uc davis um uh i did not get into my ob gyn residency so i took a year of internal medicine and i really loved it and i was going to stay it but then i realized you know what this is like all i'm doing is writing a prescription for i and i have no idea so my sister died of diabetes at age 52 and one of my best friends from medical school dave died in lymphoma at 52. those two events about 15 years ago 10 to 15 years ago said okay now wait a minute why did these healthy people why did dave die healthy yeah and why did my doc my sister die of diabetes since age four and her diet was plant-based and take insulin and um i i don't remember who said it it might have been sarah holberg who just passed with cancer by the way and and she she is uh uh virta health with peter otia but but i it was the same reason my friend dave died and my sister died is because plants are poisonous and vegetables fruit fiber seeds and nuts cause cancer three meals a day of that same stuff is the deadliest thing we do but it is so radical i'm italian my family i mean i'm a you know i'm a foodie we love food i mean of course we do if you don't love food you're dead so so but ultimately our dna is amazing our diseases are not due to dysfunctional dna or genetics by the way um i have cystic fibrosis genetically predisposed people that don't have cf yeah wow huntington's and i'll go down the list of every genetic disorder even huntington's even huntington's it's an environment due to eating a deadly diet because remember when inflammation damages your dna it damages it damages and i don't know if you've ever heard of the glycobiome and glycobiology no i haven't seen that but yeah so so this is just one of these things now the glycobiome is the muco-polysaccharide layer that protects every epithelial lining of your body yeah it's a sugar layer mucin negatively charged sulfates it's sugar when you eat a lot of sugar what happens to a sugar layer it dissolves it yeah like dissolves length so our thousands of years of eating a plant-based diet now it's like plant-based diet is like heaven it destroys the glycobiome which now allows the microbiome to attack you one plus glycation so glycation ultimately damages what part of your body well when it gets in yeah well your your blood and your um well but every single particle of your body is damaged by glucose now do you know that glucose here's the interesting part glucose is just another glycan and glucose is not the energy of the mitochondria acetyl coa is yeah so here because again everyone says that glucose is energy for the mitochondria and keto is the conversion of burning sugar to burning fat i will bet you that's wrong and the reason you know that is because number one is do you know anyone who has no fat in their bloodstream no how about has no fat in their cells no absolutely not so why would the body burn sugar when acetyl coa from fatty acids is there fast as you know yeah can you explain it yeah yeah okay so anorexia nervosa are they at risk of dying quickly and suddenly yep big time because they do not have what yeah no fat yeah so now what's the purpose of glucose in the bloodstream that's the question glycosylation okay so again you and i know nothing about this but i can tell you this is the game changer see everyone's focused on the microbiome microbiome is [\u00a0__\u00a0] sorry the microbiome sells people to take bacteria and yeast it's kind of like spread it all over your skin and all over your eyes would you recommend that to anyone no so the bowels are like the most sensitive protective layer of your body but but what what actual layer is protecting us the muco polysaccharide glycobiome which is negatively sulfated and heparinized to protect you from the microbes so when that layer gets damaged so think of it as as a lipid layer with proteins and glycans spreading all all over it which are the finger projections to tell you your hla your dna your immune system your adhesion systems even sperm and eggs and embryos and endometrium contains the glycobiome which is critical for the sperm and egg interactions okay so the bowels i mean as a kid i had bowel problems and migraines couldn't figure it out i was dyslexia dyslexic adhd ocd which you could probably understand but i didn't understand why again until i was 55 i discovered all this at 50 really went hardcore carnivore at 55. 55 all of it gone and so you and i think insulin resistance is a real thing don't you it's not okay it's impossible insulin resistance is what is the seller to sell you more drugs and insulin like the cholesterol drugs because you and i know cholesterol listen my family is high cholesterol they lived in 90 and over 100 right and i have high cholesterol but i will tell you that insulin doesn't cause disease but insulin actually is the most valuable hormone of your body okay what does it help you become fat yeah and if you're not fat and there's a famine or you're you get pregnant in a famine you're dead yeah and so the idea so glucose is the poison now if i inject the bolus of glucose in someone 10 times the amount of glucose that they need what will happen to them yeah they will become in a coma but their heart will not stop beating but my theory is glucose as another glycan like many other glycans is critical for the neurotransmitters remember neurotransmitters are glycosylated proteins and they are created so fast yeah without that happening that we we cannot exist so all the chronic diseases als ms uh even huntington's is a neuro degenerative disorder due to constant damage from glucose and other glycans in excess of amounts in our body which aren't supposed to be there okay yeah interesting it's a hard one this took me a while to figure out because i couldn't figure out well if you look at the metabolic the metabolic pathways sugar goes to fat in the liver and amino acids go to all the precursors that essentially make fat but remember amino acids and simple sugars go into the hepatic portal system that go directly to the liver when you eat fat where does it go right just through your lymphatics that's it yeah so why would it go to the lymphatics but amino acids and sugars must go to the liver yeah because they need to be because yeah because they need to be processed the liver is the only organ in the body that responds to insulin and makes fat because liver failure patients are all diabetic they have high insulin and they have high glucose levels but they are emaciated they have paper thin skin and no fat on them yeah so my theory is and i'm you know i'm talking in theory but i'll bet a billion dollars on this the liver's number one function is to make fat and it does really well at that but you cannot name a disorder where the liver doesn't detoxify of any significance can you no i mean everyone says the liver detoxifies correct yeah what does it detoxify alcohol tylenol well those are all modern made constructs i mean i don't know how much alcohol we made fifty thousand hundred thousand years ago yeah did we i don't think so i think like oldest records go back like 6 000 years you know that beer like 6 000 years ago or something like that i don't know of any anything further than that the the colon cancer um colon diseases uh all all gastrointestinal diseases lung cancer brain cancers are all on the rise in people uh uh i mean i'm 66 but in in my daughter's age in the 30s and it's sad and as a fertility specialist i see many young people working to preserve their fertility or they've already gone through cancer therapy and i talked to an oncologist two days ago um and and these concepts we're talking about are foreign and so foreign and and again when when um people don't know that vegetables ferment in our gi tract and what do they ferment from bacteria and yeast yeah and so when you eat bacteria and yeast because they tell you to but the plants come with the bacteria in yeast that ferments makes alcohol aldehydes heat gas and methane there's no wonder that all of us are suffering in a very very very young age and too many people are suffering and to me the answer is is carnivore one meal a day but when we say carnivore it's not lean meat it's fatty meat yeah yeah yeah i always try to try to emphasize that with people as well because most people think that you know just eating more fat than they're they usually eat that's eating a lot a lot of fat or enough fat uh and you know generally they're they're having you know clear um you know issues that say you need you need more fat no no i'm definitely eating enough fat i was like well no if you were then you wouldn't be having this problem and uh but yeah but that people don't realize just how much fat that you need to eat they you know because we're just just drilled in that just any any amount of fat is bad i mean so see we i tell people no matter their size they're beautiful and perfect if you're fat and there's a famine you survive if you're skinny in a famine you die the genetics that actually get us fat are actually the best genes ever created by the human line all right now again it's it's counter oh you've got to lose weight i never tell a patient to lose weight ever because see everyone thinks that the fat is the cause of inflammation yeah it's not when you feel when you fill the bowels with carbohydrates remember you're fueling the digester to ferment if you look at the farms around the world they have these digesters they they throw all the waste in it and water and they they come with the bacteria and yeast that make heat gas methane right and and and the idea is that we're just not open to so if you're fat and you go carnivore keto one meal a day in one week i'll bet you a billion dollars you feel amazing yeah in a month it's a game changer yeah but the moment you see the three meals a day especially it's a high protein low-fat diet remember protein must be converted to fat in the liver via insulin you know occam's razor is the simple answer is the one you know i i you know mtor and all these ideas of ages and you know again we're we're creating a story that for most of us idiots like me that i i i didn't understand even as a doctor right and i read these papers and not like simplicity please and and if you haven't i mean there's so many blogs of people doing this it's simple i eat steak and eggs and butter and cream and i don't eat vegetables fruit or fiber anymore and i feel like a billion bucks and and so the cause of disease is really simple yeah we don't eat fatty meat anymore because you and i have been convinced is the cause of disease and i i you know i hate to be the bearer i mean i take care of many vegans and vegetarians and mediterraneans and if you can see vegetarians are easy cream butter eggs cheese one meal a day that's the way now as a vegan coconut i mean coconut fat coconut oil because fats from an animal oils from a plant let's not con you know be confused here that if we could use some terminology but plants make phytochemicals that are in the oils to benefit the plant yeah and and it's there in some way to see i see plants are actually the predators of the universe and we're just to pray we smoke them we drink them we inject them and listen here's what i say the masters the masters eat the the wagyu a5 and the meat eat the mush and the masses are convinced to eat the mush while the masters eat the a5 wago steak and they tell us oh an impo impossibility of eating a a plant-based burger and there's only one reason we want to eat a plant-based burger because it's a burger and your brain wants a burger and yet you know now we're making man-made food out of dna or whatever the particles are in the lab i mean is that really where we want to go in this world you know yeah i hope not you know i i mean but that's really up to those who recognize that we have to do you know uh uh uh agriculture and grazing in a way that is truly sustainable i mean everyone's blaming the cows for like global warming i'm sorry last i looked i think human beings are the blame and not the cows yeah well also i mean just you know animals are part of the environment this is symbiosis you know and so you know when we when we first came to when europeans first came to america you know there was hundreds of millions of buffalo running around a bunch of antelope and deer so you know there were actually more animals and more cows in in the us than than there were before and and the great plains were some of the most fertile land in the world the grass was nine feet tall and that's because the animals were replenishing these nutrients and you know and these things evolved with the grasslands the plants evolved with the animals and when you start screwing with these complex systems you get complex uh problems as a result of that you know i think we've done a darn uh uh uh amount of damage to this beautiful world and and you know it's not gonna be be healed overnight but the the global heal it does all the time and you know whether we're here or not you know it's just it's going to do what it does and and uh i think it is important for us to continue the conversation of how we get back to a true uh proper human diet as ken berry likes to say uh and and you know it's i i the word diet is so deadly to me you know we're really what's our nutritional solution for a human being you know i say what whether it's three million or two million how many millions of years you and i came out of the trees maybe but we didn't get down on all fours to eat the grass we ate the grass eaters and you and i were hunting i don't know 10 50 100 000 years ago and we're not looking from the top of the mountain and saying hey let's go eat the grass with the cows we're gonna go hunt the the big beast and that was really the pride of what we did but uh you know exactly what happened in the world to take us to where we're at it's all a great story but whether we're plant eaters or animal eaters or a mixture but if you're sick a carnivore one meal a day is the kick-ass way yeah and that's the thing you know obviously you know we do come from a reverse past and more recently than say canines and felines we have some of these defenses still in the mix and then obviously the different populations that have that have been exposed to agriculture you know further back than than others we're going to have a little more defenses as well and that made us you know very very uh robust species we were able to survive during lean time towards the line if it can't get meat it's going to die and whereas we can sort of figure out we can sort of eat a yam or something like that and you sort of get by long enough to then get a kill and so you know we become very successful in that but there's a difference between you know being able to eat something to survive and what is optimal to thrive and so i completely agree with you that that would be just you know meet in the exclusion of everything else well it's again this is so fascinating to me because i'm a little neurotic on talking about this but i i i say what you put in the mind in the mouth and the motion of the miracle machine is critical in life uh and fat turns out to be the only fuel for the human body and that's it and that's why type 1 diabetics become skinny because they simply can't make fat because they don't have insulin and why liver failure patients become uh become cachectic is because they can't make fat in the liver and and and the the standard diet around the globe is actually a low-fat diet that's it and and and it turns out if you simply up the animal fat you and eat one meal a day you'll heal significantly and i take care of a lot of women in early pregnancy where they have a significant nausea and vomiting and i tell them do not eat you want to rest you want to drink water sips or ice many many mammals actually hibernate the and there's actually many great studies on on on bearers that they hibernate they neither drink piss poop or eat they gestate and deliver a club and they lose no muscle mass and no bone mass see everyone thinks i'm going to lose bone mass i better eat i mean muscle mass or bone that's i've got to eat calcium and protein it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] sorry and and and again i i i know that there's so much protein sparing i'm telling you it's a low fat diet is deadly but so is a high carb plant-based variety and spices in my opinion are deadly onions garlic spice tomatoes are all part of the deadly particles because you wouldn't grind up garlic and put it in your eyes the silent diseases happen inside the gut and the rest of the body and when these these spices even pepper like i do salt butter cream fat and and to me it's it's beef and beef liver bone broth but when you you you eat a low-fat diet uh you're you're not protecting the glycobiome we give intra-lipids which is which is not the best it's it's a fat of a oil plant-based oil that helps to reduce inflammation you know this is why cod liver oil uh was likely helpful or chicken soup was likely helpful because it it contained a lot of fat but you know ancient but now modern chicken soup you skim off the fat yeah which and you add onions and garlic which which is is deadly but i know it sounds crazy to tell a pregnant woman with nausea vomiting to not eat but number one they must be fat and they must rest because the baby the baby is saying do not put those poisons in my body because plants contain the poisons to make you infertile and or make you fertilizer because the plants are live organisms that are smarter than you and i because ultimately our brains aren't the smartness it's our dna that drives all the function in the body that happens in the background so you know again our smartness thinks it's it's it's all the science that is the answer but it really is an ancient ancient concepts and ideas that are built into our dna and so is it built in the plant's dna and you know this there are plants that are carnivores yeah and and uh plants like you and i don't want to die yet but we know we're going to yeah like um yeah that i mean that's that's very true we think about all the biochemical processes that go on our body and perfectly regulated uh you know like just just ph for for example i mean this is this is just so exacting uh how our body takes care of these things and you know our sodium and potassium and magnesium all these things is kept in exacting degrees and you know we don't have any control of that we don't have any upper upper control over that and then we think that we're so smart we should micromanage these things you know people eating you know drinking uh um you know basic water like oh this is what i need to do is i need to keep my my ph in balance be like buddy you are not that smart and if you were smart you just leave your body to it yeah theranose the company that went bankrupt and and the issues that with testing we we overly test everyone and there's really no evidence that preventive medicine helps anyone uh in the sense of standard medicine and testing so i i kind of say listen you can do a test you're gonna have 50 million different answers by you know every clinician um and many of the tests are driven and they're the norms are within the standard american unhealthy diet so you know when my friend got cancer dave kilmer and then died three to six months later and we're trying to figure out why or sarah holberg dies of cancer and she's got a healthy diet it's simply the testing that we recommend to everyone is is is strictly a false premise based on the the idea is that you know sugar is the energy and you have to eat lots of plants and fat is the deadly culprit of everything yeah um you did mention something that you know when when women are pregnant they're obviously getting nausea this is a normal thing i've uh several friends and people that i've spoken to that have gone through pregnancy on a carnivore diet and felt next to no morning sickness and did it had a great job but then there are some that actually had a very big aversion to meat and actually one friend of mine she was trying to do a carnival pregnancy but just the smell of meat just just really put her off and i i sort of theorized that there's a butter you know if meat doesn't taste good that means your body doesn't want you to eat at all and you just chill out for a bit um and if they sort of waited long enough then that that hunger response and would come back but you know i i never have gotten a chance to test that have you run into that well you know it's our food aversions are are psychologically fixed in so many ways so it's hard to separate out the why part of this because you know from an early age you've been told well you don't eat that or you only have a little bit and the the amygdala and the and the brain is like powerful and so my sense is is that however we ate lived thousands of years ago and many animals you know they're not getting up on a treadmill saying i gotta work out to stay healthy you know fat is like a very very uh valuable asset on your body and likely you got pregnant and you're hanging around in your cave you're staying low and and you know your nausea vomiting is says do not put anything in this body how is the bear doesn't eat drink piss or poop and yet a beautiful baby gestates because listen all of our all of our concepts are wrong even the amount of water we're supposed to eat is wrong and so if you hibernate my bet is we probably had a hibernating existence in some way that you know in the winter you know how much energy i mean everyone tries to lose weight and how easy is it it's not well why not because it's not meant to be easy to lose weight you know we spend all this money on three meals a day and then all this money and trying to lose weight but we don't it's saying guys like if you have nausea and vomiting pregnancy it says don't eat i mean was a cracker around 10 to 100 000 years ago and remember salisbury basically told us they were feed i mean even if you look at all the the armies of the world they were eating biscuits for for hundreds if not thousands of years and bread bread and water was it but the portuguese right and if you look at the books by kolansky on cod and of salt i mean without cod and salt you and even the the mongols like these armies they were fueled with the food we were meant to eat but but nausea vomiting in pregnancy is a protective mechanism and hibernation is the very best thing i tell people don't exercise my theory is in general the five causes of all disease sugar not just glucose by the way all sugars uh phytochemicals the plant antigens lectins oxalates phytates and more fermentation of fiber in your gut all gut and then the fifth one is exercise exercise in general is harmful and deadly again it's it look at we all like to look like gladiators and show off and it's all reproductively defined and i get up and i move i do things right but when my knee hurts what do i do with that i rest and so this idea that we're convincing everyone somehow the the food industry made a deal with the government we're gonna create a healthy lifestyle and we're going to fund the healthy lifestyle so you don't come after my sugary drinks right right and so remember the food industry we you know get i love food and this is not a blame but all the marketers are convincing us that your problem is you're too sedentary and you're slothful right but yet we've shown that excess more exercise is just about making us fatter and fatter and better but remember being fat is not the problem it's the food that got you fat yeah that's the problem and keeps you unhealthy because even if you're 300 pounds if you go carnivore in two to four weeks you will feel like a billion dollars and if a famine hits guess what you survive because that's what we're meant to do so i know it's counter i mean look at i used to be a maniac triathlete but i my back like even back aches and back neurologic problems are due to inflammation in the bowels remember the if you look at the anatomy the nervous system is intraperitoneal and then it goes out and the the discs are highly inflamed by the gi tract that is highly inflamed what's the temperature of a digesting bowels compared to a a week of empty bowels different isn't it and so these ideas are are a little radical and by simply going keto carnivore one meal a day and again i i like the keto is still a word but what does keto mean keto means high fat low to no carbs that's what it means right that's what we we've labeled it's made up by the way and acetyl acetyl acetyl-coa acetoacetate beta hydroxybutyrate and acetone are all in equilibrium this idea that ass of ketones are the fuel is incorrect acetyl-coa is and and basically i think it was thomas seifried that coined the keto glucose ratio right ketones and glucose now i don't recommend i don't measure anything personally if you feel great you know you're doing the right thing in general but not always but basically a ketogenic diet means your glucose levels are low but remember if you eat three to six plant-based diets and protein diets a day you're always keeping your glucose and likely other glycans remember fructose sucrose glucose galactose are all uh lactose are all glycans essentially mono uh dye and polysaccharides which are in our bloodstream higher than ever that causes glycation for some reason some people are more susceptible to glycation than others maybe those at higher cholesterol levels have a protection but but but maybe there's some people again you know as an italian mediterranean my family's family's family tended to live longer higher cholesterol um and and uh you know we all know the ansel key story was all made up because scientists are no different than anyone else you know fame and fortune is what we're all seeking rather than fertility and health for all of us so um i hope i'm not going too much on you know here and there but but but it the occam's razor says the simple answer is the one yeah fat is the only fuel for your body in mitochondria never sugar you do convert amino acids and sugars to fat in the liver but ultimately low fat is deadly for you whether you don't carry it when there's a famine or you don't eat it on a routine basis it's going to kill you yeah absolutely um you know you were saying about you know exercise and and that the reason that people are fat or they're overweight or they're having problems because they don't exercise enough but you know that doesn't uh you know people say i don't remember looking at you know animals in the wild they're just like ripped you know i was wondering i was like you know why why are those they're so ripped why are we just you know the only squishy animal on earth how to become so so dominant and people just said oh exercise are always running around but you know that doesn't explain animals in the zoo you know i've never seen a fat lion or a fat giraffe and certainly haven't seen a fat zebra and they live in cages in their entire life there's definition of a sedentary lifestyle but they're eating what they're supposed to eat so they look like you know they're ripped they look like they're on steroids and you know and they look fairly similar to a zebra in the wild it's not that much different you know for 10 years i have not exercised about uh eight months ago ish time goes away it zips by i had gained 20 over covid and i'm like you know okay i got on my bike uh i i do i bike down in florida i stay off the roads up in upstate new york i do i do some resistance stuff which i you know i think uh and i got down my 15 20 and i'm back to where i've been for 15 10 years and more and and literally i do a little bit i think that stretching and light again resistance stuff i do pottery uh you know the more we do yoga tai chi and things like that or we work in the yard we build things we make things we're creative i mean animals you know they're making a nest or or they're they're hunting for food i mean when was the last time you went hunting for food and you man the number of people that i i know uh keto savage and and a lot of others are hunters and uh i'm not a hunter you know i either i either you know nowadays it's just you order it online i mean i get snake river farm uh ribeyes uh delivered uh frozen uh you know it's liver from from uh hudson farms uh duck liver butter uh cream and ace i mean that's my my my nutrition but you know too many people are getting knee replacements hip replacements and interesting there was a story i can't remember where it was of a orthopedic surgeon i think up in alaska or something that got a hip replacement and he had a he had a psychiatric breakdown they found out it was toxicity from the hip replacement so so if at georgia eid i don't know if you've interviewed her yet but she's rocking i've learned to learn a lot from georgia uh eid that that plant-based diet contains the poisons and basically anxiety depression of all these diseases that were were medicating for even psychologically get better on a carnivore uh one meal a day plan uh and again high fat is where it's at because it's what your body requires you know i sell some supplement lines uh we do a liver and a and a uh beef organ supplement through kiltz's nutritional solutions but you don't need those things you know i say if you could you know really we're supposed to eat real food drink water you know maybe from time to time you have a sip of alcohol you know in a celebration you know i mean i once you know my friends like to smoke cigars and i sit there and you know you do this but but it's it's rare and and really it's it's minimal if you if you're addicted to these things then you know you shouldn't touch it do not you know i i my i do coffee with occasional butter uh is coughing from a plant damn right it is it doesn't want to control us damn right it does and uh you know not to say oh this is good for us uh i i think interesting enough when you add the fat to your carbs or your protein you you coat and protect the glycobiome which minimizes the the the proliferation of the microbiome which again the you know bowel pain ulcers uh is all breakdown of the of the glycobiome and if we could minimize that that would that would be better and yeah so you know i always say if you're gonna exercise do it light and easy and and uh you know a little bit you know a little bit of resistance and i often i don't put anything added on this stuff because you know as i get older i notice that if i try to do too much uh it it does it it hurts me i want to protect you know the miracle machine you know you can choose to kind of look like you know you're younger sean baker i mean again this is what i'm trying to help for so many people that don't look like us how do we inspire them to be happy with where they're at uh zach bitter always says you know start with where you're at and and by being happy with the beautiful body even if it's 300 or 400 or 500 pounds be happy with that miracle machine that's the mindset as you begin to understand that you know if there's a famine you're you're in rock in amazing shape but by going carnivore keto one meal a day i mean you're like i eat so much less that i buy they're 140 for a steak right but it lasts me five days you know i own one meal a day now again i'm post reproductive years although you know 66 20 people having babies but you need a lot less calories i mean i don't even you know someone says well how many calories do i need i have no idea but if you're gaining weight you're either eating too much food or you're not exercising enough but now why would you spend money on food and try to exercise more when you could just simply eat less food that's why this one meal a day at night before you go to bed because when you rest that's when you want the blood flow to the bowels when you exercise where's the blood going yeah periphery is that good for our digestion no way and and i i personally recommend napping uh i do one if i could get three in like i think i think at any age napping is really you know as kindergartners you know psycho preschoolers it's time for a nap but what do we now do it's time for a snack and lunch and a snack if you simply did meditation and prayer and went for a light walk and eliminated those meals even if you okay i'm gonna eat a little something for breakfast but you know it's i say one meal maybe a snack which i sometimes will do a little ch a little salami and parmesan or my leftover rib eye which is always black and blue always black and blue nice yeah like um i mean you look at different cultures that would they actually follow that exact model like the siesta in uh in mediterranean countries yes you take a break you take a nap you know you have uh you have a bit of a nap you park under a tree and you just pass out for an hour or two and then get back to work yeah i wish i could nap well we can't see are you are you in residency you're in residency yeah yeah so i i left my original program for a family emergency so i took a few years off and was doing humanitarian work in bangladesh and so i'm just back into it again so it's all the on calls and misery of all that and what's your current residency in neurosurgery and and uh which is amazing amazing uh uh specialty and i'm sure you're you know so you're in this like me i'm in traditional i'm a i'm a surgeon uh reproductive endocrinologist uh and i and i still operate a lot but at this and i know but i still talk about all this stuff you know so that once we've done the surgical correction uh they're able to heal uh and then maybe help prevent these things but even you know i can now i will i will sometimes put my headset on i will i listen to uh either some music or a small book story of positivity i go through my prayer list gratitude list and i might just sit back in a chair and close my eyes and i say okay give me five minutes and it really see uh i i can't remember who it was and i apologize some of these really great amazing uh keto carnivore experts talking on this see our atp uh have you ever measured atp in the blood nope have you ever measured glycogen i don't know no have you ever like where is glycogen do you know i don't know yeah so my thought is is that by resting we likely rebuild some of our atp stores glycogen is a glycogen storage is a glycoprotein which is critical for re uh uh adding back to the glycobiome that it's critical to have those glycans ready for glycosylation so so gr rest actually rejuvenates our atp stores and also rejuvenates our glycogen stores but remember glycogen and glucose is made in the human body yeah right so when i learned i think it was david feynman i know how many years ago over 10 years ago and i read and it was it was like um or richard feynman actually that that um carbohydrates are not required in the human diet yeah i'm like well wait a minute that's not that's not what they teach us right so so uh nuclear nucleic acids fatty acids amino acids and glycans are actually the building blocks for the human body and the fuel for the mitochondria is atp from fat glucose in the cytoplasm of the liver makes pyruvate but remember that also makes lactate and this is why cancer cells exist so otto warburg hundred years ago with hans krebs uh sort of created this pathway remember if you believe the science is true here you're always led down the path here but guess what if the science was incorrect here and the answer was actually over here but we're so far off the path remember glucose is the primary energy of the cell and once you've used up your glucose who do you know that has zero glucose in the bloodstream no that one no one no one so who do you know has no fat in their bloodstream nobody again that that there are acetoacetate beta hydroxybutyrate acetone uh uh or and uh acetoacetate are are the main culprits in this but if you draw blood in a standard eater are you going to find zero ketones shouldn't no no no there's not zero they're always there yeah there's always ketones so so if you always have ketones why would it use glucose for energy if our theory is ketones are the energy right the rate limiting factor is actually oxygen okay so you know when we get when we run and run and run and use our burst of atp right you need you need enough oxygen so the the capillaries you know we're trying to use all these muscles and trying to gain the the the oxygen to deliver in order to you know take the the the electron uh over to water and and and make co2 um and so you know as you build your stamina you can build your your atp and your oxygen carrying capacity uh i was watching peter uh atiyah with with um with a lance uh uh armstrong right and he was my hero uh and you know they're doping ultimately by adding red blood cells to add to the care oxygen carrying capacity which allowed you to do more right had nothing to do with sugar by the way yeah it only had to do with oxygen yeah if you could deliver more oxygen to the mitochondria guess what you can do anything so we always forget remember glycation my sister was blind uh her kidneys didn't function and she went heart failure at 52 almost lost a limb why microvascular capillary damage remember 98 of your vessels are capillaries and they're damaged because what's the normal human glucose a hundred thousand years ago compared to today do you know well we don't yeah no well because if you don't if you if and this is where uh stefansson uh you know back a 120 years ago uh in in his work uh where he was hospitalized for two years and they'd only meet and you know look we already know the story you don't need another prospective randomized study it's already there right you can live on only you know meat uh but you gotta eat the blubber by the way but the simple answer is that we were taught that sugar becomes our fuel right we were taught that amino acids not so much right and that fat right and so but we forget that an ottoman basically proved that glucose was the cause of cancer glucose through glycation damages your mitochondria if a cell no longer has enough functional mitochondria to survive it either dies or if it's able to utilize enough atp made in the cytoplasm via pyruvate to lactate then it becomes a cancer cell now why do cancer cells metastasize because they're in the wrong environment like all us humans when you feel like you're in the wrong environment what do you want to do you want to move so this the cancer cell is ultimately every cell your body contains all the knowledge of the universe it's going to say what are you guys doing to me i'm going to get out of here it wants to thrive and survive and proliferate but the problem is the dietary environment that we have given it is deadly for many of us now why why do only 10 percent of people who smoke cigarettes get lung cancer i don't know why did sarah hallberg get lung cancer and she was a non-smoker my theory is is because we're still eating a high plant-based diet even if it's keto keto unfortunately is a phrase that could be confusing and and fasting i call it intermittently feasting when you intermittently fast it means you intermittently don't eat well you want to fast for 23 and feast for one that is the very best one now if you can go two three four five and you're going to build your autophagy and i mean these are these are great scientific concepts but i think they're confusing for most simple people like me the simple answer is your body only burns fat and you need only one meal a day or less never more than that but if you're getting too skinny on that one meal add fat because fat is twice the calories and no one's gonna say can i have that salad instead of that porterhouse ribeye fatty steak if you really need the right fuel for a human ferrari yeah absolutely um i was going to ask you you mentioned obviously you're still doing surgeries as well you mentioned endometriosis um i've had i've had a number of people ask me if you know carnivore diet can can help with this i i just don't know the answer is that something that you uh had had success with in from a dietary perspective or is it still just the traditional methods of treating that well we all still do our traditional methods of surgery of lupron or letrozole but but the the here's the simplest if the bowels are damaged then lectins oxalates phytates and all inflammatory microbes plus the chemicals get into your body the colon and the and the small intestine they they they cover over the uterus pelvis of the ovaries and the peritoneal cavity and so when you damage the the glycobiome you absolutely cause endometriosis you cause pelvic scar tissue you cause damage or loss of tubes you cause adenomyosis endometriosis fibrosis you cause dysfunctional labor and and early pregnancy loss and later losses and fetal demises so endometriosis is just another disease in the whole bucket of diseases caused by the predatory plants so i've seen so many car carnivores like uh dr kilts i have no more pain my menstrual cycles i'm not bleeding and my endometriosis goes away so you know if you think about it like chemotherapy we give chemotherapy to kill your cancer cells now where does most chemotherapy come from plants plants yeah okay so the plants we give a drug to kill you but just before you're dead we take it away and we pray that your body's able to heal okay so what if we stop feeding the fuel for the cancer which is glucose antigens phytochemicals and fermentation and remember what's one of the best ways to damage dna is to heat it up see fermentation in the colon and small intestine is simply an exothermic reaction it makes beer and it makes heat why do some people get damaged and diseases other people don't i don't know but everyone gets something because smokers if you don't get cancer you're going to get heart disease strokes or something that's going to damage you and and so ultimately all the things neurologists neurosurgeons deal with fertility gynecologists uh primary cares all of us deal with gastroenterologists remember uh you know it's it's this story i i was talking to an oncologist who's suffering from infertility at age 32 right and she's an oncologist but where the struggle is emotionally we've learned all these things and our patients are required rely on us for the knowledge that the the the health care system has given us but now i'm failing and now i'm going to tell them to eat steak and heal i mean you know my medical school here in syracuse told me exhibit you talk about this and i was reported to the office of professional misconduct in new york for discussing keto carnivore right you know my job and like i believe all doctors jobs in life we're we're we're consultants and counselors and we're coaches and cheerleaders we're working together and and our job is to discuss options your job is decide what you want to do and we will do our very best to carry that out so you know it's kind of but so all the common reproductive problems are due to you know cherry oats uh seeds nuts vegetables fruit fiber and all things made from plants perfect yeah so like that's um yeah when i was looking into you know pms pmdd pcos things like that i just found just endless endless connections to uh you know diet nutrition and these sorts of things and and um and certainly with pcos that that seemed to just go away pmdd i didn't see as much uh information but like i did find some things that really suggested that that that's exactly what was going on you know i mean there are very i mean when i when i see patients with the double cystic fibrosis of dna genetic modification mutation and they don't have cystic fibrosis and then when i was i was talking to a uh huntington's she's been diagnosed with huntington's disease now she has the double markers but she has no symptoms okay so now i've already told you you've got the disease and you're gonna you're gonna die of it right yeah now that's already a negative that we told people but you know when you hear about sickle cell and and and all the genetic varieties we have likely were developed in some environmental uh uh area milieu that was beneficial to have this dna right and so she told me that you know it's it's a 50 to 75 percent chance that i'm gonna get that i'm gonna get huntington's or die of it i said well you know my sister died of diabetes and my best friend died of cancer and you know my bed is now we're doing you know like unique individual personalized medicine we're going to look at all your dna and then we're going to tell you you know you're going to get this this this and this and you better get your babies down and take out your ovaries or your breasts and but that's built on a standard dietary regimen yeah not understanding that heat is the best way to denature dna and so are the chemicals that we use and remember chemotherapy and radiation therapy both have secondary cancers that they cause so you know these ideas are really radical and and um uh thomas seifig wrote a book that cancer is a metabolic disorder and taught me about otto warburg yeah and uh the basically you can attach glucose to a radioactive nucleotide injected and it goes to cancer well why does go to cancer because cancer cells have dysfunctional mitochondria and they utilize glucose in their cytoplasm to make atp no other cell in your body does that why because again it's it's damaged damaged mitochondria due to hyper glycemia or hype elevated glycans that you and i are born with remember you're born with it you you are bathed in a in a high sugar environment in your mother's womb and you're eating now everyone's eating eating a formula even my daughter i hate to say i have federal formula uh which is all made of plants yeah and you know she well she argues with me but she's smart as [\u00a0__\u00a0] and she's supposed to uh but but it really is an amazing concept now we have a shortage of baby formulas well what happened to the breast and the reason the breasts aren't working today do you know why because the micro the glycobiome is damaged by glycosylation glycation and so the cells of the mammary glands can't make milk because we're bathing ourselves we're marinating our bodies in glucose yeah your glucose should be 40 to 60 all day long it should not be now the reason i i i'm going to use the word i eat sugar a cane i love it with my ice cream is because a simple sugar is far better than a complex sugar now why because you eat a simple sugar it goes quickly into your hepatic portal system it quickly goes to your liver insulin quickly chimes in and converts you to fat your glucose level lowers your insulin level lowers remember if you're a faster so remember insulin resistance if i'm always have complex carbs in my bowels always remember it takes three days for most complex carbs to go from your mouth to in your toilet right maybe right and if i'm eating three caramel carbohydrate meals a day the bucket always has guess what digesting in it yeah sugar yeah so sugar into the bloodstream what's your insulin gonna do is that insulin resistance nope it's it's it's false insulin resistance is false the deadliest deadliest thing is an insulin pump i'm going to pump you full of insulin if you're always on a pump of insulin what must you always eat carbohydrates that's right yeah and remember lettuce kale vegetables fruit fiber avocados and seeds and nuts are carbs i'm sorry an avocado is not a fat it's a fruit last i looked it's a sugar and it has fiber fiber f sauce up and it's deadly deadly i see all these you know these co you need your fiber like if you want cancer please chime in it's like steel wool and sandpaper to damage them the glycol biome glycobiome glycocalyx is the teflon shield that is the only thing we are damaging that causes all disease that's that's really really the concept and idea here nice yeah um so you're saying you yourself you're really just eating just the meat and the butter and some cream you have some coffee is that is that just so you're fairly strict i would say and you say and then sometimes you have a bit of a treat or something like that okay so treats and rewards are natural to human beings don't ever use the word uh uh um uh you know what am i thinking the opposite of treat and reward is punishment right yeah and because you never want to punish this human being and and so you know again it's i have i have water and coffee i sometimes add the butter i like to a month ago i was off coffee for six weeks up for a week last year six months i'd come and go i love it but you know it and raymond from steak and butter uh uh gal coaching is you know he called me on it that i am addicted right but we're all addicted to something so but but yeah uh rib eye steak every day but it's i never measure it but literally i might cook this much but i only eat that much i'm like okay tonight i literally take it i cut it up in pieces and i'll eat it i i i cook it in a pan under the broiler i i make it black and blue i add maldon salt and butter sometimes some blue cheese i i i pour the fat right back over it because you see the problem of barbecuing you lose all the fat yeah that's bad and so that's my meal at like five or six o'clock sometimes four you know i i i get up at like 3 30 to 4 o'clock or somewhere in there every day i go to bed at eight or nine um you know early to bed early to rise i you know i i watch and interact with all of this this content in this health and wellness space regarding keto carnivore um and and uh i read or listen to books a lot um and i go to bed early yeah and i i do a little bit of you know i i'm i'm as vain as anyone else and and you know in some way uh i know that um you know i carry a little fat but i don't i don't you know i'm not trying to lose it recognizing that you know if i get sick and i need to fast for a week and i don't have any you know it's not it's not good for us but yeah and then i make an ice cream [Music] all right i lost you sir about that that's right bob i i i um i uh so there where i don't eat uh i eat ice cream that i make it's cream an egg a pinch of salt i do a little vanilla bean and i add a teaspoon or two of cane sugar now again it's my treat from time to time not every day once a week the other day i literally made my ice cream with no sugar and it's still awesome and great to eat and so reminding all of us right uh you know you go to a party and you go hang out with friends and family you know some people on they can't touch that well if you have strength and power over you know all of this um you know you'll get whatever your habit is you'll learn but you know i'm pretty strict i rarely will eat chicken uh some some salami and cheese but that's my night i never eat salad uh uh kale brussels broccoli i love garlic and onions and salsa it's deadly for us of any frequency or any amount yeah yeah and then you um you talk about your facebook community as well you know talking about obviously having this support structure and having this sort of sense of community um can you tell us a bit more about that as well well you know i mean i do this because i i my mother was loved to talk to people my father just liked to hang out at home and i got my mom's jeans but i as a physician what i realized is that we can help so many more people by sharing our ideas and content but it's because we do it you know our standard doctors were doing this you know don't smoke and you know you got to be skinny and all this stuff and they they're not the models right and so uh the community in the village is critical you know we have facebook groups i mean many of them are just uh just um de novo created uh but there are a lot more groups developing for support counseling coaching but um you know between instagram youtube facebook and whatever they are but uh i i and i'm on i i joined uh uh a bella's steak and butter gang where i'm just a regular uh participant but i like you know we all participate as coaches and and things like that but it's we have to the problem with medicine it's sort of like it's it's a you know that's up here right but you know you're you're probably in your 20s or 30s i'm 42 man okay all right so so interesting enough at 41 i lost a job fired had no money and i was like okay i can't do this standard [\u00a0__\u00a0] anymore so i started cmy fertility and i integrated all this but you know but but now with with all this medallion social media medicine is a new world and and really the the you know you don't have to sell or write a book you simply create uh ideas and people will stick around when you're honest when you care uh and you know i don't monetize i mean i sell some of these things on amazon we sell some nutritional solutions but my intent is not like how can i monetize it it's really wow if if i can help people that i never see and if i see on my blogs hey dr kiltz never never met you but i did this and i had a baby and you know that were my ibs or arthritis all but gone so you know it's is the more people like you especially starting off in medicine uh it's a game changer my mom at my mom and dad lived in 93. uh her mother my father's mother did 103. nice my mother fell she loved to climb and do things and like in about 85 she was in the garage and she fell and got a got a intracranial image best thing that ever happened to her and and and i say that in a way because we have to always imagine that whatever happens is part of the the gift of the gods in our our life but you know she didn't need neural surgery but you know they were going to do it but the people that took care of her were amazing and my mother through the journey got better she gained her strength but over time her body whittled and at 1993 she said adios my dad a year later said adios and and but um the the connections that we have to do anything you fight will fight back anything you foster with faith and creativity and sharing in a way that just adds to more people on this journey and again even in the standard medical profession i was invited to give a debate uh as a fertility doctor i train non-reis to do fertility uh and it's like well how can you do that so i i said i won't do it but then i said you know what listen if you want me to come and discuss how we can all help inspire and and help more people that are suffering from infertility naturally or uh train more people because nowadays you know it's not just doctors mds do's it's rns nps uh pas and and you know all you have to do is be a live human being with a pulse and you could start you know coaching people which is again uh how you know between like maria emrick by the way is something someone i learned about keto also and and uh again it's through social media that is the the new way of health and wellness and when you need a surgeon thankfully there are some well-qualified and trained people that can do these things yeah true and uh yeah that's i think that would be great to get medicine back to what it was you know for thousands of years just dealing with pregnancy and childbirth and you know congenital disorders traumas and and you know infectious disease and then poisonings and i think it'd be great to get back to that and and make a lot of doctors uh have a lot more time on their hands and uh you know i think they'll be better i do pottery i do pottery and painting so it gives me more time to be in the studio yeah awesome yeah um great well dr kills thank you so much for coming on i had absolutely great time talking to you i learned quite a lot from that um how uh best to get a content a hold of you and see your content and and uh uh yeah just see your stuff drkiltz.com and cnyfertility.com and you are our best places you can go to youtube instagram facebook uh hey you dr kilts uh and there's books on amazon uh you can download a lot of these books for free on our websites uh and and i think it's it's really that you know we're in a new new era of crowd sourcing community sourcing health and wellness and we are integrating the the new sciences with the ancient sciences and i think that's important we're not here to say modern science is wrong we're here to say well hey maybe you know these things we can do something different because i too utilize modern science i think it's really amazing but our ancient nature that again what you're sharing is really critical and important so uh thank you for inviting me on today i think we're gonna do something uh in the near future i look forward to that conversation too so do i yeah thank you so much dr kelsey we'll uh have to do this again very soon oh absolutely absolutely dr jaffe thank you thank you
