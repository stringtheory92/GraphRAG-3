    "transcript": "okay hello everyone thank you for joining sorry for uh getting a bit of a late start today but today is uh November 2nd 2023 in the US and November 3rd in Australia so thank you everyone for joining good to see some of the regular guys here like Rick um and yeah good to see everyone so sort of pop in here um to some of the questions um question from Joe the other night I had extreme painting in the region where the liver gallbladder sits assume it was an issue with gallbladder with gallstone uh because of my high amounts of cholesterol on Carnivore yeah I don't I don't believe uh for a second that um having high cholesterol actually causes gall stones I don't think that's true I think it's actually the opposite I think it's the you know avoiding fat avoiding eating um meat and fat is what actually gives you gall stones because you build up bile in your gallbladder um in order to await a time when you actually get fat you know because like Predators like humans don't eat six times a day they don't have three meals and three snacks you know that's that's not how that works in nature so the gallbladder stores bile and then concentrates it that's its job it concentrates the the bile so it has two two major functions which is to store the bile and to concentrate the bile so your liver keeps making this and it gets in there and obviously it's not that big it's it's pretty small organ and and it will you know it has to concentrate in order to to fit more bile in there because you need to store up some sometimes a few of um of bile in there so that's or several days you know if you don't eat for a week you're going to need a lot of energy in that one go so um that's that's what it's doing that's what it's designed to do and so if you're not eating fat that means that your bile is going to sit there and get more concentrated more concentrated more concentrated textbooks say gets up to about 20 times more concentrated okay well what if what happens to any hyperconcentrated solution at rest it builds up forms precipitate it forms crystals which is what bile Sledge is and what gallstones are I believe I think that's just basic chemistry and if we think about our physiology properly that that is what is going on and when you talk to people who have had gallstones it's it's generally those who went on a diet to try to lose fat and lose weight and they say oh if you want to lose weight if you want to lose fat you got to stop eating fat and so they stop eating fat and all of a sudden they you know they get gallstones um after you know a few months of this so many people do that as well and don't get gallstones so I think it might be something to do with you know if if someone concentrates more than other people maybe they build it up and others don't but either way if you are if you are eating enough fat if you're eating a lot of fat then you're going to be using that B all the time it's never going to get concentrated it's never going to be able to form a stone and so hey no no and sorry frantic cat so if you if you never um if you just keep eating fat you're never going to build up um the bile in the first place to form a stone so you know I mean cholesterol is just a scapegoat you know they just started looking for everything oh look there's a little bit of cholesterol here in these arteries must be because you're high cholesterol there's you know gall stones bile is made out of of cholesterol which used to make bile and so gallstones must be from too much cholesterol that doesn't make any damn sense you know why aren't our our you know all of our cells just breaking down and dying because of all the cholesterol all all your cells are made out of cholesterol your brain is has a large P portion of it made out of cholesterol so no I don't I don't believe that for a second and um you know and and people that are carnivore I mean you know we we're not getting uh gall stones if you're eating enough fat in fact I've seen people go the other way and and have bile sludge and gall stones and feel um very uncomfortable and it seems to resolve it now if you have big enough stones and those get caught like you're you're going to need a procedure to get those out I mean there's no sort of dodging that um you know that's sort of you know horses out of The Barn at that point but you know if if you're not yet at that point then um you know then then this could potentially resolve potentially you know we don't have proof of that yet but there are people that have reported their symptoms have gone away and if your stones are small enough those could potentially just pass safely because now you're eating fat you're just squishing this stuff out and you're moving things along or it could be that they sort of start dissolving now when you start moving out this super concentrated bile but if you talk to people that's what happens when they get G Stones is that they is that they um generally you know so four FS 5 FS really female fertile 40s fat fair so like you know Caucasians um women get it more and so you know what is that that could be a thing you know maybe maybe in other other you know ethnic you know backgrounds they you know they're they still have more of genics like hey we it's longer between meals whereas like in Europeans maybe have had agriculture longer so that they had you know more steady meals or something like that who knows but um either way you know what what is that commonality there you know someone you know woman in her 40s probably had a couple kids hasn't some extra baby weight metabolism slowing down and they want to lose weight they want to lose fat and so what do they do they go in on a lowfat diet or no fat diet and all of a sudden their Bales building up turns into gall stones and then all of a sudden oh they got this pain when they try to eat fat again um because it's miserable not eating fat and uh and you go to the doctor and say like o like you know he's like oh you got gallstones that's because you eat too much fat and it's like they haven't eaten fat in six months like what are you talking about so that I I talk so many people I've spoken to and I've sort of laid that out like this is what I you know this is what I would predict this looks like if this physiological phenomenon were true and I can't tell you how many people told me that that's exactly what happened that's exactly what happened to me maybe people here have had the same experience can comment and and uh and let us know no but that's that's been my experience with it um I have quote unquote high cholesterol I don't ever have problems with my gallbladder um so you know you can get pain in that area so the upper right quadrant for other reasons could be your gallbladder gallbladder can get inflamed for other reasons and again if you have uh gall stones and you go on a corner or diet and that starts moving these things around you know those can get stuck be a problem and you you may need an intervention surgery to help with that but that's not the carnivore diet the high fat diet that that caused that certainly not your high cholesterol that caused that that's a problem that that you've had for a long time and now this is sort of bringing it out because you're eating more fat and you're stimulating your your G however um it's if you are having gallbladder pain because there's something getting stuck that happens after meal you eat a fatty meal and that triggers your gallbladder to go so if you're not getting that then I wouldn't expect this to be your gallbladder or gall stone if it's happening just in you know um just in the middle of the night not you know around you know at a meal time or after a meal then I I wouldn't really expect that to be so it can be a lot of things but if you're worried about it and it's ongoing you can see your doctor about it but um no I wouldn't say cholesterol and carnivore would cause that at all um I have actually really no doubt of that in my mind hope that helps uh Dez thank you for the Super Chat I often have low appetite on Carnivore and I'm afraid that I'm not eating enough protein uh to avoid muscle loss or bone health issues recommendations on minimum macro ratios on protein it's hard to say because the thing is is that everyone's different we need different amounts of you know protein and fat at different stages um you know if you're if you're smaller than you know you want to be or smaller than um you probably should be like sort of unhealth Healy um weight you're going to need a lot more you're going to need a lot more protein and fat and everything like that so it really just goes by uh what your body's asking for and so you need to listen to your body and um and uh and give it what it needs so the um the the way I do it is is go by taste and yes it's very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet so it's um it's very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet diet and so you have to relearn your hunger signals because your hunger signals are going to be very muted when you're eating carbohydrates and um sugar and things like that it actually actually makes your body think you're starving in a way and I talked about this in different videos the mechanisms of insulin and leptin doing this and so when you when you go on a carnivore diet you cut out you know all the carbs and sugar and things like that that goes away and so now your hunger signals are much more muted and so it's easy to undereat uh so what you do is you go by taste so if it tastes good keep eating if meat tastes good your body's telling you that it wants those nutrients and so you keep eating until it stops tasting good because it has negative feedback so every every time you eat a little you know meat it just tastes a little less good and a little less good and a little less good until eventually it doesn't really particularly taste good at all and um and then you go that's it you know you're you're uh you're you're done you don't need to eat anymore so that's what I would do um as far as the only macro ratio I'm looking at is is generally you try to hit around one gram of fat to one gram of protein up to two grams of fat to one gram of protein and um somewhere in that range most people will fall you might need a little more protein you might need a little more fat than other people so just aim for that see how you do I have I have um podcasts that I've done short ones uh carnivore for beginners and um fiber constipation and diet that sort of tell you how to figure that out on on how much your body needs so I would just go by that and ultimately go by taste and just keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you'll be fine but you know I should say the reason that I I I harp on this about undereating is because I did it you know 23 years ago when I was doing this I I never felt hungry I would go literally four days without eating working out from we start training it 3:30 in the afternoon for my myh for University team and then I'd play you know the the you know the premier men's team straight after that and I go to the gym sometimes and so I could be done at 10 or 11 o'clock at night and it'd be from 3:30 to 10 or 11 every day and then i' played at least two if not three or four games on a weekend and so and I was I was not eating like four days in a row and it eventually got to the point where I was just was way too lean and I was just wearing my body down and I was like okay what the hell's going on I mean I why am I feeling worse when I work out and like it must be eating I just not eating enough you know I'm going like sometimes two days at least one day you know at a time like it would be it's common for me not to eat on a daily basis and sometimes it be much longer than that because I just never felt hungry and I was thinking I was like well it it must be I'm not eating enough but I am just not hungry and so I just said okay doesn't matter just you just got to eat just eat every day just got to eat and every time I ate it tasted amazing so it was just like okay so I could do that but I had to tell myself to do this now I I I know this consciously because it's been five years doing that and um now I know my Hunger signal so I know what hunger feels like so you have to relearn that to re relearn those hunger signals and um and just go by taste try to eat every day eat until fatty meat stops tasting good and and try to look for these more subtle signals of of hunger okay what are your thoughts on sardines I've been eating a can daily for the last week but heard that Joe Rogan had arsenic poisoning after three cans a night I have no idea there really really shouldn't be that much arsenic in any food food product um I haven't looked into to sardines I would I'm very surprised that there would be that much arsenic or any arsenic um in sardines if there is I would not eat it there there are people doing like the sardin sort of fast where they just eat sardines for you know several days or a week or whatever I haven't really heard of them getting uh sick from it um I mean I don't I don't see any problems with sardines generally I mean I don't there's anybody who find out if yours in particular has any sort of contamination with arsenic um really I mean three cans is very small I mean so if there's that much arsing I mean that's a contaminated batch that would need to be recalled for Public Safety and I would hope that it would um but if you're feeling fine um and not AR snicky then should be okay um but uh I I don't know I would look into it maybe look into what kind of what brand that Joe Rogan was had an issue with and see if any anyone else is getting problems and look up look at the symptoms of poisoning and and if you're feeling bad at all just cut them you know having sardines every now and then you know good source of Omega-3s other fat other other fish are as well they're low down on the food chain so you don't have a buildup of heavy metals um so I wouldn't really expect him to be too bad but um I don't know that that's a bit scary but if you're feeling okay and you're feeling fine wouldn't worry too much about it but maybe yeah maybe just try to check for the brand and see if there's some sort of recall call or something like that if there was um you would hope you would heard about it heard about it but maybe just look that up just to be safe uh thank you ni for the Super Chat 68y old breast cancer survivor finished chemo 13 months ago well that's great on an asol for eight months carnivore diet for six months still fatigued no weight loss poor sleep could issues be hormonal due to an asol yes they could I mean you know at 68 you're not going to have much estrogen anyway so an asrol is a Bally an estrogen blockers so um Jesus blanking um anyway blocks of conversion testosterone into estrogen and women make testosterone first then that converts into estrogen but you know past menopause women make very little estrogen but you do get you do still have some uh generally um it could it could be you know some some women that go on like HRT find that this helps with weight loss and how they feel and everything like that probably not a probably not an option for you uh given your history um but there are there are other things as well that can that can be at at play here um what you should do is is probably just dive into the your Bloods get your thyroid thyroid checks your TSH your free T4 your free T3 and a reverse T3 see if there's anything going on there obviously that's a major um major component of your metabolism major hormone for your metabolism you can certainly check your high sensitivity um estrogen will probably extremely low or maybe undetectable testosterone women need testosterone just like men need estrogen just in smaller amounts and um and having too little can can cause problems as well and vitamins minerals all these other sorts of things you know so B12 folate vitamin D zinc magnesium and leptin and fasting insulin and fasting glucose I would check those those are all going to be markers of your metabolism to see what's going on um there are people that take a long time to lose weight some people don't lose as much weight as they want to sometimes you just stabilize it so the main thing you need to focus on is your health how you feel how your energy levels are how you're sleeping all these sorts of things so you're still fatigued and poor sleep so that's not good try to maybe focus on those as well you know what's what's keeping you from sleeping properly you know optimizing your sleep turning off lights getting blue blocking glasses putting a sleep mask going to sleep at the same time every night you could even try um a bit of melatonin depending on where you are it might be prescription might be over the counter and um you can try that melatonin only works if lights are off you know so you need to turn off lights turn off screens get off phones um at least an hour before you want to be asleep okay [Music] and even if you take melatonin the light's going to drive that out if you don't take melatonin your brain's not going to make the melatonin in the first place or not much of it so that all can that all can have a have an effect as well and you can even get um your igf1 and your igf uh bp3 your binding protein checked as well um all these things can can affect weight loss especially things like leptin people that have higher leptin leptin resistance from years of of insulin resistance blocking leptin and and screwing up your metabolism years of that you can get leptin resistance it's very difficult to lose weight uh when you have left in resistance but the good thing about is is that on a carnivore Di or or really any just dropping carbs General your insulin comes down your leptin starts to come down but until that come if it's very high until that comes down to like a reasonable level uh it's you're going to find it very difficult to lose weight and so you look at Kelly Hogan she actually put on weight for six months or so and then just something snapped and she started dumping off weight but the fatigue and the poor sleep you know that could be something else going on as well um even though you're eating a carnivore diet I don't know exactly what kind of carnivore diet you're eating I don't know exactly what nutritional background you're coming from and and some people need a bit more help maybe they need a bit more liver a couple times a week maybe they you know are still going to be a bit lacking in in nutrients and they need some more new nutrient dense sources like liver heart kidney things like that adding in some new organs and um check your blood to see what's going on you could have the npfr gene mutation have low folate and B12 as a result of that you could have absorption issues have pernicious anemia have other autoimmune issues that are causing uh an issue with your absorption and so you need to get checked for those things so I would check it just check those and um there's one gentleman I was speaking to uh just recently and he had very very low energy and brain fog and all these sorts of things and he was doing everything right from a diet perspective he was doing for about 3 months was like it really should be through this by now we took a look at all his Bloods and there were a couple things a little off but his B12 was actually quite low and that could be an absorption issue again and uh he got a B12 shot and he said just boom there's like lights came on and you're just like all his energy problems and brain fog just went away so uh you need to check so I would check all those things don't just leave it a chance you know if you're having problems check your Bloods um most people if you're just doing fine checking your blood is sort of academic but uh but if you if you're if you're not doing your best then you definitely want to check so that's what I would do Bloom uh thank you very much for the Super Chat question carnivore on day 120 I did a few water fasts recently and noticed elevated mental Clarity better sleep more creativity among other benefits why does this happen thank you very much um that is likely due to just increased Ketone levels probably so you know when you're when even with you're eating a carnivore diet I mean your ketones will be you know elevated they'll be at a good level but a lot of people find that when they just don't eat at all they're not bringing anything in so even the amount of protein you get a bit of a rise in blood sugar bit of a rise in insulin so you might reduce your Ketone levels a bit and keep you in sort of a lower grade ketosis which I I don't think there's anything wrong with that at all I mean you know we're designed to eat meat and our body's going to work the way it's supposed to work uh when we do that but we're also you know designed to to not eat every day necessarily it's not that was bad for us to eat every day I don't think but it's certainly not required for us to eat every day um and we're designed to to weather that and so your Ketone levels are going to go up because you're you're just you're you're keeping your insulin really low blood sugar really low as your ketones go up so I would expect that to be what it is a lot of people do notice that when they fast even on a cornivore diet that their ketones really go up and that's why I talk about you know people with cancer and they need to modulate their gki glucose Ketone index that they might need to incorporate fasting and refeeding as well just to keep that gka nice and low blood sugar nice and low and the ketones nice and high so that that is what I would expect is happening there your ketones are higher your brain runs primarily on ketones that's your brain bra's optimal fuel source and so you have more of it brain turns on even more so I would say that's what that's going on that's what that is carnivore Joe uh thanks for the Super Chat hello Doc and other carnivores hashtag meet heals absolutely thanks Joe good to see you Josh hbin hibbon thank you very much for the Super Chat sorry if I Mis sorry if I'm sure I mispronounced your name Dr chaffy would carnivore help my grandpa who has very severe Alzheimer's what kind of improvements would be realistic for a severe case would keto be just as beneficial or just have it uh just have to be carnivore thank you so I think any ketogenic diet is going to help I think a carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet and I think it's the best ketogenic diet um but ketosis is the key with this one because that's when the brain turns on and um and so so your brain like I just said runs primarily on ketones Alzheimer's being called type 3 diabetes so this is insulin resistance and you get insulin resistance of the brain now blood sugar can't get in brain can't run properly and um and uh it just starts slowing down and degrading probably doing a lowfat so-called heart healthy diet and now you are maybe taking you know some sort of medication you know like statins that lower cholester ol some of these can cross in the blood blood grain barrier and get into the brain stop your brain from making cholesterol which is a major structural component of the brain there are cases in the literature of people having reversible Alzheimer's because they've been on a Statin like torist Statin lipor that can cross the bloodb brain barrier and they take them off the Statin six weeks later all of a sudden they don't have Alzheimer's anymore put them back on the Statin six weeks later all of a sudden they have Alzheimer's again so you know your brain needs cholesterol and these drugs can stop your brain from making cholesterol so something to consider when people are you know considering whether or not they want to go on a medication or have a family member go on a medication also again because of the insulin resistance if you switch over to ketosis you have high ketones all of a sudden that bypasses that you don't need insulin for ketones they go straight into your brain and and they your brain lights up and uh your brain always runs on ketones always any ketones that are available your brain's running on them and this is why I call the pref your your brain's preferred energy source and people say it's glucose because they say our primary met metabolic state is is H the FED State and on the FED State we're running more on glucose than ketones but that's just that's just you're assuming a fact that's not in evidence you're assuming that they named that correctly they're assuming that that is our primary metabolic State it's not not I I don't think I don't think it is at all I think that so-call fasting state is our primary metabolic State that's where all of our heavy machinery comes to bear and our that's our metabolic State when we anything except carbohydrates like our natural diet carnivore diet and so when you look at your brain this I learned this in Biochemistry 20 years ago your brain's always running on some ketones so it runs on any ketones that are there and it fills in the gaps with with glucose and so if you have a little bit of ketones your brain's running on those ketones has to fill up the rest with blood sugar right and so but as you get more and more ketones your brain you runs on those ketones and you start lessening the amount of glucose coming in until the point that it gets to a threshold that it can only run on ketones doesn't run on sugar at all at least for you know most of the brain cortex things there's some parts that still will take in some glucose good good news you have blood sugar when you're in ketosis so that's why I say it prefers it right because even in the the presence of high blood sugar or normal blood sugar if you have ketones your brain is running on ketones that's the preference right so when you do that when you go on to ketosis most people with Alzheimer's even severe Alzheimers will see significant Improvement in their cognition within a couple days right just because the energy source is different on their brain right so their brain is now running on its optimal fuel source right so that's very significant I think and then you all of a sudden now your brain is starting to can recover can repair it's not going to it's not going to go back to what he was when he was 20 but I it can make a significant Improvement if he's really really bad I don't know where that that ends up but I can I can tell you that it will improve because the the brain is going to be running on different different energy and better energy and a better energy source that doesn't require insulin and also those ketones can cross blood brain barrier and they actually reconstitute into fatty acids which then are get used as the structural components of the brain you can actually rebuild the brain potentially right and so there are people doing this and reversing Alzheimer's and rehabbing people like your father I don't know how serious this case is but I've seen very serious cases significantly help where people are in nursing homes you know that's end stage Alzheimer's and they're and they're getting to the point where they can go home right that's amazing and the fact that Alzheimer's wasn't described until the early 1900s and there was no disease before that that by that name or any other that described Alzheimer's tells you something significant this did not come naturally this is not a genetic issue this is an environmental issue something in our environment did this to us right we all we just didn't live that long you know if you if you made it past early adulthood certainly childhood the infant mortality rate was very high in the you know before the the 20th century very high and so you know that brought down the average life expectancy from birth people weren't just dying of old age in their 30s that's that's ignorant you know that that's just simply just not understanding basic math and statistics this is an average for birth and so when kids when three out of five kids die in infancy the other two people have to live a long time and probably one of those other ones died at 14 in the Civil War so you know this is this is um uh not true that we just didn't have any old people we just don't know what aging looks like of course we do Socrates was 76 or 78 when they killed him they had to kill him you know he was still out there causing trouble in Athens Alexander the Great dude was in his 20s but his generals were in their 70s one of his generals was like I believe 78 leading from the front he led his caval and so a 78y old man in full armor hacking with a sword and everything like that 78 you know right that's not when people were dying people lived a hell of a lot longer and and much more healthy than um than we do now um people are just turning into dust now so there's a guy named Hal cranmer very nice guy um and I interviewed him he has he has a number of nursing homes in Arizona and he's doing this he's apply these principles so there's a study that showed that putting Alzheimer's patients on a ketogenic diet and it's like high fat meat-based diet with no carbohydrates and being in ketosis that this was a better treatment for Alzheimer's than every medication ever trial for Alzheimer's so he took those principles he saw how carnivore was helpful and he said okay I want to feed my my patients the best thing that they can get started putting them you know talking to the family talking to them hey can you do this this these are the principles this is this is what I'm trying to accomplish here some are on board some are not some are just on board with keto some are on board with carnivore but at least keto makes it makes the difference it's that energy change in the brain and he's rehabbing people he's they're getting better one person you know just in just lifeless in the bed all day and now is out there tending the garden you know you know planting uh you know roses and things like that and others are are able to go home with their family so you know that's something I'm going to be putting out in the next um sort of week or two uh I might try to get it out this Sunday or possibly next Wednesday um stay tuned so keep keeping keep uh keep an eye out for for my YouTube premieres because I'll try to get that one out in the next week or so but uh that I would absolutely say it would be it would be beneficial I have no doubt in my mind it will be beneficial how much he can improve I don't know I hope a lot I hope to the point of gaining his independence back I can't say for sure every everyone's at a different stage and everyone responds a bit differently um but I I really hope so there are people who have been able to go home and to rehab and to get their independence back or at least a large part of their independence or enough of it that the family can take care of them at home and at least they can enjoy their life with their family at home so I really hope that that's the case with your your grandfather and I hope you can convince him to do it um plant sparing carnivore thank you very much for the super chat some say there's a difference in glycogen levels between glucose molecules converted from dietary carbs and glucogenesis um thank you Dr chaffy you're awesome [Music] um difference in glycation level between glucose molecules and dietary carbs I wonder about that so glycation being you know when when glucose molecules physically fuse to other molecules and this is what your hba1c is that's a that's a glycation end product from glucose and hemoglobin and there are other ones so like fructose has a different end product right so that's like so you know if you're getting you and and it can be more have more gly glycative action than than um glucose right so uh but you can't measure that with hb1c it's a different end product so that's specifically with glucose there's going to be ones with galactose and and and ribos and all these other sorts of things probably um but the glycation but I don't know um the glucose I mean glucose is glucose it's just the same molecule we are making that same molecule so I would expect that it's it is the same molecule and probably has the same um properties of glycation the difference being that when you're bringing in dietary carbohydrates you're also bringing in fructose you know we don't make an abundance of fructose right so we don't um we don't necessarily see that um as an issue so if you're taking in dietary carbs you're just getting in different carbohydrates not just glucose and those have different glycation properties and and fructose certainly does it's supposed to I don't know how exactly but if I if I remember correctly something like four times more um uh potent and G glycating so you know that could be what's that's being referred to is that you're just is you're just getting different different molecules that that have more uh glycative properties um but uh I would expect the glucose and the glucose you know glucose we make and the glucose you eat to be the same because it's still the same molecule but your but sugar is half fructose and that's definitely going to be worse so I think that's probably what that's referring to but the glucose molecules should be the same I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't know why they would be different but yeah you get other stuff in with with this dietary carbs my Apex Odyssey thank you very much for the Super Chat a relative uh 20-year-old male um has had essential tremor since age seven no underlying cause also ADHD anxiety depression any indication that cornor might help I trying to convince him to try well it definitely can help ADHD anxiety and depression you know so that's that's work done from Dr Georgie Eid and Professor Chris Palmer um he's a professor of Psychiatry over at Harvard they've both been doing Yen's work on um on this subject and showing that this is a mitochondrial metabolic mitochondrial disease and that you fix the mitochondria and you go on a ketogenic diet like a cornivore diet and I think that's the best ketogenic diet it also elates out all the different plant toxins which can affect your brain chemistry I've certainly noticed it myself you know I I can get depressed with the exposure to like leafy greens and things like that they I don't know I mean you're a kid you just like you get depressed eating vegetables and like now as an adult I'm like no I actually get depressed eating vegetables so um so that that that's what I I prefer just nothing um and I would and I I see know people like Jordan Peterson I've seen other people that have still have anxiety and depression problems and they're doing keto like strong meat-based keto just some salads and then they dump the salad they dump the greens and anxiety significantly improves but specifically with the and a lot of these plant toxins can damage the mitochondria as well so it all it can still comes down to the mitochondria but being on a ketogenic diet we see that people after several months or a few months they have four times the number of mitochondria and they are four times as effective so they these are in your brain as well and this is making your brain work better and um so you can watch uh and maybe even try to get him to watch um the episode I did with Dr Palmer so um it was called like the best diet for mental health or something like that but anyway it's on my channel where I interviewed Professor Palmer and we go through this and he talk specifically about specifically about ADHD depression anxiety essential tremor I have seen that improve that I don't I'll have to look it up I'm sure there probably are stud in ketogenic diets um with essential tremor um there are a lot of studies with with ketogenic diets and a caral diet is a ketogenic diet any sort of neurological issue can be helped by this potentially and so I would I would expect that um he'd probably get some improvements from that as well nerves take a long time but I've seen very crazy uh differences in uh in people neurologically I did just have a patient this week who had essential tremor that has has been improving um quite significantly still minorly there but they've only been doing this for a couple months so you know very very early days for them and but yes it did help so I would uh I would definitely give it a try and it was also going to help him 20 I mean he's just got he's he's got to turn into a superhero going on a carnivore diet so I don't know if he plays sports but he's gonna play them a lot better he's going to turn into a badass he's going to get into great shape and uh feel great all the time have amazing energy at work or college or whatever he's doing and you know him being healthy he's going to have this this healthier glow around him which is going to you know be very attractive to people around him which is going to help with his social life and and his experience of of everything and that probably help reduce his anxiety and depression there as well um just being more confident and healthy so yes this would definitely help him um it will help the mental health issues I would expect it will help the essential tremor and it'll turn them into a badass I'm like what what's not what's not the like about that I mean I started this when I was 20 I turned into a God you know I mean it was just like like i' I that's that's very you know um that's very uh you know Silly of me to say but I literally felt just just superum on on a carnivore diet playing rugby I couldn't get tired I couldn't run out of energy I couldn't wear myself out I just I was a superhero you know on the field and then training like it was just like there really wasn't anyone who could who could touch me in uh Fitness or or anything like that or the amount of exertion that I was putting out on the field um you know good friend of mine who was a you know professional player from Ireland played you know professionally all over Europe played for the London Irish um then came to America was playing with us now he's the like the president of of The Sea Wolves when I broke my leg at 22 he said you know you need to rehab your your leg is quickly as possible and get back out there because you are the most explosive player in North America right now and that was a huge compliment coming from him but that was that was because of how I put in a lot of work I worked my ass off I had that thing was like I'm GNA work harder than everybody I'm gonna be a first in every drill every Sprint every race everything every time and and on the field I'm GNA be first one there to everything every time everything's a dead Sprint not going to dog it on any play everything's a dead Sprint and um but because of my diet I was able to do that and and do it better and better and better and better and I started that when I was 2021 and so he's right there and he's just yeah like his life will change dramatically so I don't know maybe show him this bit and uh maybe that'll convince him and show him that the the interview with Professor Palmer it will it will absolutely change his life I have no doubt in my mind and you know maybe hear about it in a couple months on how he's doing emotional support paintbrush thank you for the Super Chat I know only meat is best but what are the less bad condiments for transitioning mustard herbs vinegar I have CRPS trying carnivore for more relief um anything with a strong flavor is going to probably have more of these sort of Defense chemicals that's why we put them on there if you put a mouthful of you know mustard seed in your mouth I mean you're just got you're just going to be spitting it up vomiting all that sort of stuff because your brain is just like Jesus no get it out out and so you know maybe a bit of vinegar vinegar is sort of an oxidation product of alcohol so I'm a bit wary of that and what that does I haven't really looked in exactly uh into what that does um as well but um you know you just try you can try you know white pepper white pepper is better than black pepper and um you can just see what small amounts of things work for you see how you feel with them if one makes you feel a bit worse then don't use it but if you can tolerate some spices and some seasonings and it helps you succeed at this then then you'll do it you know eventually when you get used to just eating meat and your taste for meat starts improving it will you just you'll just love the taste of meat and you really won't want spices after a while then you know just try 30 days without them and see how you feel you're going to feel better and so you can just try that but you know in the meantime if you if you need a bit of seasonings and and sauces or whatever I would avoid more of the sauces because just going have a lot of stuff in there gener have a lot of soy or sugar and all that sort of stuff that you would want to avoid so nothing with sugar nothing with soy and um you know just try little bits see how you go and uh and then just see how you feel like if you if you if you tolerate something and you feel okay with it you know that's fine I would try at some point um you know not uh you know not having any and see how you feel but you know for now if you need it then you know just trial and error start with some white pepper and go from there Damien Williams thank you for the Super Chat doing Sprint workouts awesome five by 100 MERS um at 50% to 80% then 5 100 meters at 100% walk back to start occasionally get hamstring strain during Max set plenty of water and electrolytes one to two weeks to recover uh with no pain help okay so we're talking about hamstring strain okay so you maybe just you're just not quite there where you can really Max it out at 100 so you know keep it at top it at like 80% so you're not pulling any muscles um if you're doing carnivore that should be less so you didn't mention in there if you're doing that as well so because you're here I assume that you probably are lean meaning that way but if if you're not all the way there get all the way there and um and 100% carnivore high fat meat only don't eat before you work out like for at least five hours hopefully just nothing at all that day and um and just don't don't Max it out at 100 if you're if you're sort of pulling hamstrings and it takes you two weeks to recover so you just you just need to build it up you need to sort of build up the muscles and just get more used to it so keep it a or maybe not 100% for 100 meters you know drop it down maybe 40 MERS and um if you if you can do that without pulling a muscle start with that build up then build it up to 100 meters 100 meters is a long Sprint you know that's a that's a long way to go maximally and so you know just cut it down do 40 or or 50 and um and and you know if you're doing a 100 and you can't do it maximally you know do it at 80% see if you can do a shorter distance maximally without hurting yourself so you can do those um I would personally would um preference the shorter distance with maximal effort but if you can't even do that if you can't even do 40 meters at 100% without sort of hurting yourself you could go down to 20 but you know it could be that you just need to build up your muscles and you need to just uh sort of do you know sort of 80% and then build up but it it would likely be that you could do you know 30 40 50 meters max out and without hurting yourself then you can build up and do 60 meters and then 70 and 80 and 90 and 100 and eventually you'll be able to just just Sprint hard as hell for a long time also Sharon thank you for the the Super Chat oh also guys um I have a hard stop at 12 today um so that's in two hours so that's 12 my time and that'll be 9 Pacific Standard Time middle of the night for other people so you probably won't care but um but uh in two hours anyway and so Russell says gallbladder refills fully every four to six hours right um do we digest saturated fats that the gallbladder couldn't get to do you know uh the number of grams it can digest no I'm not sure exactly how much how much grams of fat um per of of bile but that's also going to be different because it it concentrates and so it it it concentrates more and more and more so it can fit more and more bile so you're not just spilling over and losing it um we we don't take in much fat um if we don't have bile for it so it's it depends on the types of fats midchain fatty acids are easier to absorb without without bile but they're still not 100% And so like overall it's it's you know down 10 15% something like that I don't know the exact percent off the top of my head but it's also going to it's also going to well when I looked at it it I I remember about 10 15% but that's going to that's going to change based on the the complement of FS like like I said MCTS are going to be easier for your body to absorb without bile so there's more MCTS you're going to you're going to absorb more than than 10 15% so uh you can absorb fat very little you generally have this overflow that's why I say you can't really overeat fat because all you don't want to eat too much fat I don't think that's a thing your B your body's making bile because it wants fat that's an essential nutrient with essential vitamins and minerals in it and so your body wants it your body needs it and so you know if it's if it didn't want it it's not going to make bile for you to absorb it I don't think it's making a random amount of bile so it can get a random amount of fat that that doesn't make sense to me that would be the one one process in your body that that were the case if it were to be true and so I I don't I I don't believe that and so I I think that your body I think I can trust my body maybe some people make an odd amount of bile could happen but I think for most people that's not going to be the case and so that's why there's that spill over so your body's just you know your body's going to be um your body's going to to not be able to absorb past a certain point says okay this is how much we want and then rest of it goes out some will absorb um but most of it most of the rest will go out and this is how you know if your stools are soft then you're getting enough fat because you're getting you're getting past that threshold and you're getting a bit of spill over and if you're getting diarrhea it can be a lot more fat or you can be taking magnesium or drinking coffee or tea or artificial sweeteners all of those things can can cause diarrhea or metformin or other sorts of medications that can that can cause this sort of thing now and uh but yeah hope that helps okay um fractal beans thank you for the Super Chat good timing uh for two weeks plus no break uh night shifts at a time on omad PKD format so it's um the Paleo ketogenic diet that's so the Paleo Menina format which is very high fat like sort of two to one um grams of fat to protein wake up at 5:00 pm shift at 7 P.M to 7 a.m. MCT oil okay as doping I guess um you know I guess it's it sort of depends where you come from but you know it's um so you have yeah so you're basically on on night shifts for two weeks and no breaks um you could you can bring MCT oil but you can also bring Tallow or butter or dried meat or carnivore bars or make your own pkin and just have that and sort of snack on it as a bar so you can you can do those things as well if you wanted some MCT oil you know people put in coffee and things like that or you can put butter in coffee uh or just butter and hot water and blend that up drink that um but you can also fast 12 hours is is fine um if you wanted to if you wanted to do that if you're getting enough fatty meat um and you're okay doing one meal a day or even two meals a day you could eat before you go in after you're done um that should be fine I mean I I find that that one of the best things about this diet is that you know I don't have to keep eating or snacking I I just do fine you know as long as I'm getting enough other times that I can do fine and so if I'm I'm working all day and then I'm working all night and I'm working all day the next day I go 36 hours I don't eat and I feel fine just drink water so plenty of options you can do yes you can take some MCT oil or other animal fats which I would probably prefer um and uh or dried meat and um just a box of meat you just sit there sort of eating it more it needs to be sort of dried sort of snack or whatever you can do that or you just fast you know I mean 12 hours is is is a decent amount of time you know it's not an unreasonable amount of time to to not eat so just see how you feel but you have options anyway pure pure blooded Patriot thank you for the Super Chat hi amazing YouTube channel thank you very much question what argument would you offer a Doctor Who challenged a 56- yearold male patient about doing going full carnivore well it certainly depends on on the challenges generally they're going to they're going to say um you know that you shouldn't do it because of your your cholesteral and this is going to cause heart disease there's no evidence for that you know I mean there there's there's circumstantial evidence that now looks like it's a fraud not everything looks like it's fraud there's hard documentation and evidence to show it was fraud that these people were frauds um you can watch my video on called the truth about um cholesterol and heart disease that gives a lot of information and background there uh you can also watch my interview with cardiologist Dr C mahotra who wrote a book called statin-free life and um he doesn't do full carnivore but he's you know very high fat meat-based keto at the very least and um or predominantly so and um and uh so you can look at that as well it really does depend on on on the questions and the challenges that your doctor has so um whatever those are I probably have a video on it and so or someone does Barry does uh Dr Baker does you know um Paul saladino or um Paul Mason amazing so a lot of these things because Paul Mason comes to this from a very technical medical perspective and so he has you know he he has things directed to because he gives these talks at medical conferences and so he's directing this towards clinicians who are treating their patients and so um you know you have a problem and they're talking about cholesterol and these sorts of things you know watch my videos on on cholesterol watch uh Paul Mason video on on cholesterol and heart disease and all these sorts of things and just arm yourself with the facts and if it's if it's about kidneys high protein Dives do not cause kidney issue in fact the opposite and I've seen people reverse um you know stage four kidney kidney failure and um a lot a lot of people do that and so I've never seen anyone drop their kidney function now you can dehydrate yourself and that can raise your creatinine if you're drinking enough water that's going to stay nice and low your Ura might go up but that's not that's not the problem the creatin is staying low Ura is going up and that's one of your body's best um your one of your best um antioxidants so not a bad thing that that thing goes up right so it just depends so whatever their challenges are whatever their their questions are whatever their concerns are there there will be a video on it either by myself or someone else and so just write down what he wants write down what he's worried about it's usually cholesterol possibly kidney um and so just hit those and and then go with it or you know do you need or you have to you're going to have these nutrients and you have to have them do you um people in in the ice ages didn't they did just fine in fact became we became the most dominant species that has ever lived during the ice ages when we could only eat meat well what about all these these phytonutrients that you need okay well there are studies out showing that actually grass-fed um grass-fed uh meat and dairy have as much or more of these beneficial phytonutrients from plants in them because they want them too and they come into their body and they hey doing good things for them and they concentrate them in because they're eating a lot of them and so now you know grass-fed meat has more of these phytonutrients and none of the phytotoxins right so that's a benefit so depends on what um what uh he's worried about if he's worried about ketosis have a whole video on his ketosis harmful um it's two and a half hours long the answer is no it's not so all right hope that helps but yeah just just look into what he does and then find videos based on that um sorry just trying to call people to Arms here on um getting uh putting it on Instagram sorry there we go all right so question from Josh Morris um for NC thank you for the Super Chat to start how to start how many grams of fat and protein as a baseline a gram per pound a gram per pound of body weight thoughts on Creatine caline uh malite and glycerol so look I I think as far as the the um you know the the creatine and caline and all that stuff everything you're going to get you should get in meat if if it's good quality meat especially grass-fed and finished is going to be the ideal but however grain finish is still going to be very good it's going to be better than than anything else um and there's tons of creatine in meat and especially in red meat so red meat is is your is your best source of creatine and um you you'll get you know the amounts of people supplement with creatine you'll just get if you're eating red meat red meat uh regularly or as a as a staple of your diet um as far as grams of fat and protein it depends I don't go by grams per body weight I don't uh I don't think that's a good metric because it changes you know and it's different for different people like if your body if you're undernourished and people coming from you know plant-based diet and undernourished diet under muscle diet a sarcopenic DI um State then uh you're going to need a lot more you're going to need need way more grams of protein than I would need to just stay where I'm at and um and then when I'm working out I need more and my body just naturally tells me that so you just go by your taste again so eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good try for about one gram of fat or one gram of protein or even up to two grams of fat or one gram of protein somewhere in that range and see where you land up um and where your body needs and uh you go by how much how much fat you know if you're getting constipated you need more fat I'm already eating so much fat so much more fat that I've ever eaten doesn't matter you're not eating enough fat if you're constipated that's a definition so you know there are other things that can influence this but you can eat fat to the point that it will not absorb and enough of it will go out and it will give you diarrhea so if you're getting constipated then you're not eating enough fat to spill over to keep that soft okay so eat enough fat and eat enough protein and that's the thing you just eat fatty meat with about that ratio until it stops tasting good and your body will tell you if you're working out if you're lifting weights that will increase your your your taste and and um demand for food will naturally increase so when I'm working out and I'm lifting weights my my my appetite doubles literally doubles I'll eat like two plus pounds of meat a day at at rest just sedentary and then if I'm working out a lot that goes up to four pounds easy right and so a fatty meat very fatty meat and so you know that's uh that's that's very normal for me and there are other people that are much skinnier than me and much lighter than me and smaller than me that eat twice that because their bodies want to build up maybe they've been on a vegan diet before many have and they need a lot more or they've been anorexic and they need a lot more may both and they really need a lot more so it just depends on your body go by taste so I don't go by grams per body weight um you just need to get enough for what your body's asking you you're not going to figure out through a formula how much your body needs you just need as much you need to satisfy and saturate your body's desire for these nutrients your body will tell you you know the thing is these you're never going to find a grams per pound is not complex enough to describe our biochemistry ever there isn't an equation on Earth that's long enough to describe our biochemistry perfectly the Earth is not long enough to you right one 22,000 mile long equation is not going to be enough you're never going to find an equation complex enough to describe all the things that are going on with the 10 trillion cells that we have in our body and the you know just the quintilian interactions that are going on all the time between those cells and all the different gradients and ratios of chemicals and things like that through but you're just never GNA never ever going to do it good news is you don't have to your body tells you that's part of the crazy complex mechanisms that we have at our at our um at our fingertips here is that your body does it for you if you allow it if you don't get in its way and screw it up by eating the wrong things if you eat the right things you can listen to your body so just do that eat fatty meat till it stops tasting good try to get that ratio that I talked about and um you'll be fine Dan V thanks for the Super Chat hi doc I'm 6 weeks into a carnivore diet lost 15 pounds tons of energy and feeling relative good the last few days have been experiencing kidney and back pain add a little carbs and better any thoughts on why um no I don't I don't know why your your back pain would be better with carbs normally people get back pain with carbs you know it increases uh inflammation drops your ketones which also increases inflammation um if your you know kidneys you know sort of under the under the rib cage here on your back is where your kidneys are um could be your kidneys could be just something in that area that's a bit bothersome I couldn't really see how carbohydrates are really going to help that in general um if your kidneys are are being a bit of an issue first thing to do is drink more water um you know if your kidney are trining for something I don't know what carbs you ate you know is this um an oxalate issue which is um you know something that can happen it's hard to say for sure what happens because it's diagnosis for it sort of a diagnosis of exclusion or trial and error and so if you had some carbs that had some oxalates in it and that suppressed your oxalate dumping could that have been an issue potentially um but yeah no nor normally people when they eat carbs especially grains and things like that their back hurts more mine does you I have any of that stuff my back kills me for like four days and um can't see any reason why it would why it would improve kidney pain obviously depends on what's causing the kidney pain or if it even is kidney pain or just pain in that region so I don't know I would chalk it up to one of those things and um and just drink a lot more water keep keep doing a cornivore diet and if you think of something like oxalates or something like that you know you can look into like the celling Norton protocol on having a bit of oxalates like 50 to 100 milligrams of oxalates to sort of damping down your body dumping it out um but but without carbs you don't need to do it with carbs um not not that carbs or the end all be all but it does put you into a different metabolic state that I don't think is optimal and you know you're raising your insulin and all that sort of stuff if you're doing that once a day you're not really raising all that much and you know then you can think of it as like intermittent fasting where you're it goes up but then it sort of comes down eventually you can do that I don't think is as beneficial as as just eating meat though but uh see how you go that's it's a bit interesting a lot of these things you know people get these weird sort of Sensations and feelings and um generally just go away you won't know exactly what they are sometimes oxy dumping sometimes other another toxic dumping right so you have different toxins in your fat those can come out they can cause rashes they can cause pain they can cause weird symptoms you eat carbohydrates your insulin goes up it shuts that down now you're not taking out these fat soluble toxins anymore that could be an issue but purely uh supposition I don't have proof of any of that but these are some some things that do happen and so that could be potentially what's happening in your case but you know eventually those things go away you get the you fat soluble toxins get out of your system and they go and they don't come back unless you put them there so that's the whole idea of this is you're not putting bad things in your body so I would I I still stick to it and um most most of these things just just work themselves through and you feel fine Jose Carn carnivoro thank you for the Super Chat hey Doc uh question what about iodine and meat and water only uh yeah there's I mean there is iodine and meat depending on where you're getting it from you can have varying amounts of iodine if you're worried about iodine um you know Dr Barry does a good um video on and it's not um you know it's not uh very pretty safe to take and so it's um it's fine um and uh and um sorry so and the um so if you wanted to take it I don't think it's too big of a deal if people have things like Hashimoto you should not take um iodine that can actually make it worse so people shouldn't just blindly take iodine um actually thyroiditis and um but also you can just check you know if if you're worried about your idon content and ion levels just check check your idon levels if it's low well the meat that you're getting is is a bit deficient great take a supplement uh if you're not low you don't need a supplement so that's what I would do I I don't think you need to supplement unless unless you actually have have a have a diagnos sort deficiency so that that's what I would do Dakota berlinsky thank you very much for the Super Chat Dr chaffy I'm a 44 year old male with stiff person syndrome I take IVIG infusions I want to stop taking them I feel amazing on Carnivore diet what are your thoughts thank you so much for all your input uh well I haven't really come across that before um with um General but also in terms of a carnivore diet um the thing is is that carnivore can significantly help quite a lot of issues that we had no idea there was any sort of fix for so you never know um I I can't say anything specifically with this because I just haven't I haven't seen anybody with it um who has tried carnivore so I don't really know and it's not something I have too much um experience with but any neurological issue has a potential to get better because you're just giving your brain and your and your nervous system ketones proper energy and proper fuel I think that ketones are primary fuel for our brain and [Music] um and if I understand correctly especially with the IVIG that's an autoimmune issue if I'm not mistaken so if that is I would I would actually think there's a a good chance it would help because I have yet to see an autoimmune issue that doesn't improve on a carnivore diet or a complete Elimination Diet because that's what we're talking about here we I think that that that it's that it holds through a number of different for a number of different reasons from a number of different studies that autoimmune issues are your body reacting negatively to something that you're eating making antibodies towards them and there's cross reaction called molecular mimicry to the rest of your body and then it doesn't sensitize to your body and then just kill your body it because it actually goes away and we see when people eliminate these things out of their diet that the antibody levels go down too because your body stops reacting to that thing and you get stop getting cross reaction with your body and so if that's the case here as well and if it is an autoimmune issue it's very likely that that's the case you should see an improvement and because of you know being on a carnivore diet keto carnivore diet important um you're that can that can potentially help rebuild the damage to your nervous system as well so I would be very hopeful I haven't I haven't come across anyone who has done that though who has had stiff person syndrome um but I've seen a lot of people with neurological issues and um certainly autoimmune issues improved like Ms right I I had a lady on my podcast Dr Sarah who had multiple sclerosis she was in wheelchairs she was becoming paralyzed and really she was dying in her early 30s from multiple sclerosis autoimmune disease attacking the nervous system and she sort of came across it she's a PhD in biostatistics she knows how to read studies in literature and she came across carnivore the idea and she started looking into it started looking at studies and doing research and she just went yeah there there is something to this and so she she tried it herself in six months she was not only out of her wheelchair but she was walking and and not only walking but doing ballet crazy and on MRI she had her her her lesions were resolving right so it was actually healing it wasn't just she felt better so she could walk again though her nervous system was actually repairing and so I would I would expect uh that could happen with you as well I haven't seen it though I haven't I haven't seen that particular condition but I would expect it I would expect the same thing and I think it's very probable that You' have that so I would just go hardcore on that uh red meat and water only it's really important for people with autoimmune issues to be very very very very very strict on this because anything else can kick you off a pork chop can be a problem because they're feeding that pig a lot of crap that it's not supposed to have either and so you can have um oh Jesus what did I do there we go and so you can have a reaction to something that the pig ate and got into its tissue because it's not being able to detoxify this stuff normally so that's what I would do i' would stick to red meat and water and even um even uh uh red meat and water and even um you know grass-fed and finished beef and lamb uh if you can get it and I think that that would be that would be the best chance you had at um at fixing this and I really hope it does and let me know if it does that's something that would be good to know about in case you know other people come up with the same problems and we can sort of at least let them know that other people have been helped by it as well but there are plenty of neurological autoimmune issues like Ms that are significantly helped yeah okay let me see here sorry okay and Reigns thank you very much for the Super Chat is it advisable for kids uh the age of two and up to only eat meat and no veggies fruits or carbs and if so how will the kid develop well the kid will develop better the kid will develop to its genetic potential because that's that's what it was designed to to um develop with and on and um yes I think it is I think it is advisable I think that is what kids should be weaned on I think that is what kids should be raised on and there are a lot of people in the cornivore community who have had 100% carnivore pregnancies breastfeeding and kids and they've only eaten meet their entire existence since they were a you know a single cell so uh and they're developing far past the um you know the averages not even the averages I mean they're they're off the charts you know they're well like friend of mine um in Ireland um she had uh well two and a half pregnancies as carnivore and um the second two where she did the full pregnancy is carnivore she found that they kept bumping up her expected due date because they kept staying on ult like yeah this kid's developing way faster than we would expect so we're actually G to push it up push it up a week and then push it up a week and then push it up a week it's like this is crazy these kids developing way faster so that's good right not getting too big right it's because that's carbs and gestational diabetes and things like that but developing and developing properly kids boring and they you know start growing off the charts heads are way off the charts you know like well over uh 99th percentile well over so they say like one was like 105th percentile so so I thought it was 99th percentile you're above the whole percentile Dynamic is that you're you're you're above 99% of people so you're in that top 1% so how are you how are you you know how are you better than 105% of people right so um you know that's where funny concept but of course that just means that you're you're that much higher so this is the people in 99% and you're another you know standard deviation above that so you know that's that's sort of what that means but no you do get better you know the vegetables vegetables are toxic for kids as they are for adults um fruits sugar toxic for kids just like they're toxic for adults in fact they are more so because kids are developing we're already developed it's not going to change um as much as it will when it changes when we're developing you know kids you you you only get one chance to develop and you don't get proper nutrition and you get these things that can that can damage you and curtail your development that's it you will never be as tall as smart or as athletic as as you would have been you know I you'll still be great you'll still be a wonderful person but it's it's going to change you it's going to change your development and we see this in in the in the fossil record 10,000 years ago there's a hard line in the F record right before agriculture people were 5 in taller um you know much healthier better teeth better Jaws different skull structure uh longer femurs no signs of poor wound healing or or um you know infections and right after post agriculture um you know during agriculture 10,000 years ago this wasn't thousands hundreds thousands of years of development it was just bang right there all of a sudden and then onwards you you know five inches shorter crooked teeth smaller jaw smaller skull different shaped skull as well we're the same species and yet our skulls and bones are different shapes now that's Developmental and so if your kid is eating veggies and fruits and carbs they're not going to develop properly kids have to be in ketosis they have to be because that's that's what gets the building blocks to build your brain and so kids are very quick even drinking breast milk nursing kids are in ketosis in the in in utero as a fetus kids are in ketosis when breastfeeding drinking milk with carbs they're in ketosis they have to be because that's how their brain grows it's how your brain properly operates and so yes you definitely want them just eating meat and certainly not eating carbs or vegetables and all that other toxic stuff you know that kid you give them a piece of broccoli and they spit it out let them right their bodies and biology are telling them this is poison don't eat this so don't eat eat it don't make them eat it it's it's not good for them it is bad for them the meat gives you everything that you need and they will develop to their genetic potential and much better than they would have otherwise none of us develop to our genetic potential none of us because our mothers weren't carnivores and uh during pregnancy and and uh breastfeeding and weaning and all that sort of stuff and we weren't carnivore with all our upbringing none of us are as tall as we should be none of us as as big a as they should be none of us are as intelligent as we should be none of us are as athletic as we could be right and in fact we probably go generationally because probably going to take you know if you look at pottinger's cats they fed the cats you know cooked meat instead of raw meat and they just got smaller and sicker and and weaker generation after generation and then they couldn't even breed after three generations and then on the third generation they started giving them raw meat and they were able to breed again but it took four generations to breed back to you know the cats that were just eating raw meat so probably the same thing you have this epigenetic generational KnockOn effect from Bad nutrition and so we're probably there and so our kids are going to be if we raise them as carnivores and their pregnancies as car carnivore pregnancies our kids are probably going to be better they will be better than us which is great their kids are going to be even better than them their kids are probably going to be better than them and then you're going to keep it there so you know you pass things down you know people have have legacies in their in their families and things like that you know jobs money businesses whatever houses um you can pass down carnivalism as a as a legacy in your family and generation after generation after generation your kids and their kids will get better and better and better and better and better and they will be much better off facing the world and dealing with the problems that come with life when they're as healthy and developed as they can be be big tall bastards big tall smart bastards you know you're G to be doing well so that's that's a good advantage to have and go into the world with big gelato thank you very much for the super chat um hey Dr chaffy I had Swiss chart and kale a few days ago and my right side is in pain okay it's good good information to know started carnivore 30 days ago I have high fat animal meals but the pain started the day I had green so I mean look you know I mean that that's a that's a you know direct relationship you know um you know if you're if you're experiencing that you know it's um you know I would I would listen to it you get rid of it you know you have pain you feel worse when you eat these things don't eat them that's why I don't eat these things because when they have slipped in or I had trial them early on say oh what does this do to me it made me feel worse it made me feel bad I don't want to feel bad I want to feel good I want to feel good all the time and so it's um you know it's uh it's it's you know it's very different when you're just eating meat and you add something back in but that's good it's a good test you test that and you just say hey that didn't make me feel good I'm not gonna I'm not going to eat that and so it also makes it very easy you know people say well you have you have a lot of self-control just eating meat I'm I have no self-control I am only eating the exact thing I want to eat right there's no self-control involved um you know it's uh I have no interest in eating any of these things because they make me feel bad and I don't want to feel bad and they will change my body in ways and make him work in pretty awful ways and I know those ways and I know what it does to my body I have no interest I have no interest in doing that so yeah so that's good you know it's good to to sort of have that piece of information now you know you know people think like oh I just had some TR off can't be you know that can't be that these things are that bad and you try like Jesus that actually it actually physically hurts me you know and so you you can um you know you can just get rid of that and now you know that's that's not a good thing for your body Lena thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy I'm a 47-year-old female carnivore for 10 months and never felt better that's great um down 55 lbs but my LDL is 182 HDL is 44 triglyceride is 87 apple b is 146 I'm having a calcium score test next week should I worry I wouldn't um you know your triglycerides are in in a nice low level your HDL could be higher but I'm sure it will be things that raise HDL things like saturated fat meat um and um uh high intensity exercise so sprinting and uh resistance training especially resistance training to failure even just push-ups sit-ups uh squats those things are you know body weight doing body weight exercises or using lighter lighter weights if that's too much um so that can help improve your HDL as well but your triglycerides are nice and low so the re what you look at with HDL and triglycerides is triglycerides low yes you likely have patterna a LDL so there's over 100 different kinds of LDL you know ones you make like the large Point LDL they're good they're good for you they have they have a biological purpose in your body and they and they're important um and in fact higher LDL and higher cholesterol in general is actually associated with longer life so I don't I don't get worried about that and again cholesterol was a scapegoat for heart disease um for for sugar you know the sugar companies used it as a scapegoat this is this is a matter of historical record this is a fact so you look it up Journal American Medical Association 2016 they published internal memos from the sugar companies detailing how they paid off three Harvard professors to falsify data and publish fraudulent studies to make it appear as if cholesterol caused heart disease when he was really sugar and that that's and there's tons of other people that they bribed and paid off like anel keys and and many many more and one of those Harvard professors in that in that U publication from those papers in 2016 he became the head of the USDA and he was the one who authored and published the 1977 USDA declaration saying cholesterol causes heart disas it changed everything this was hotly contested for 50 years before that at least 40 I mean I saw I saw papers in um jamama um Journal American Medical Association in 56 talking about it's generally accepted that cholesterol causes heart disease however this is based on very weak evidence very flimsy you know correlational studies and this thing the other it just went through and just excoriated the entire proposal but that's the thing they were very influential and they just paid a lot of money to a lot of influential people to sell their their um sell their integrity and and sell everything that they' worked their entire life to build up and it was for nothing you know it wasn't even for 30 pieces of silver it was just for pittance you know it's worth $6,500 that's the equivalent of $50,000 now it's nothing is nothing you know 50 Grand that's what your that's where your entire career and life's work and integrity is worth to you that's pretty pathetic um and so those people are pretty pathetic and um and and more so because they' destroyed the lives of billions of people and we've spent trillions of dollars a year every year treating the conditions that don't need to exist because you know if you don't eat the wrong things you don't you just don't get them you don't get these problems so we're spending trillions of dollars a year on sugar and processed  and then we're spending double that triple that treating the problems that come about about from eating that crap and so it's just disgusting and then how many billions of dollars a year are being spent on nutritional and medical research to push these products that are that are completely bogus you know the I did a post about this on Instagram but the um the editor-in chief of the Lancet as well as editor-in chief of of the Jour of um New England Journal of Medicine for 20 years said that probably around 50% of the studies even in those top journals are completely false fraudulent and um and corrupt and um it's just that's just the nature of of um of science now and that's why you have to you have to understand this and you have to understand that studies aren't science they're a tool that you can use scientifically you can apply the scientific method to developing a study to try to describe reality but studies don't Trump reality and so if you see people say oh this study says you get diabetes if you eat more red meat and you see everyone who just eats red meat and nothing else reverses their diabetes well you have to be an to think that that study's correct you know or a fraud you know or someone who's deliberately trying to mislead people you know but if you really believe that in the face of that evidence now maybe you just haven't seen that evidence and that's fair but if you have you can't unsee it and so you know I have hundreds of patients who have reversed diabetes P face-to-face patients not even on on the internet on the internet that you're talking tens of thousands hundreds of thousands probably Millions at this point around the world that that have that have improved or reversed their diabetes going on a on a cornivore diet you know you just it's it's nonsense it's just nonsense and so that's what you have to do you have to look at first principles you have to look at reality okay this is what Einstein did he had had a mathematical equation I proved this you go and look at it goes like nope that was wrong you know because you The observed fact are in Conflict so if your study is in conflict with the observed facts it's wrong you did it wrong you intentionally did it wrong you accidentally did it wrong or it's just a shitty study most epidemiology is but you can do it right but you can also do it wrong you can you can purposefully manipulate end points and purposefully manipulate data to saying whatever the hell you want so if it doesn't agree with reality it's wrong it doesn't agree with experiment it's wrong they say well if you eat more more red meat you get diabetes and yet people with diabetes eating only red meat reverse their diabetes so that's an experimental that's an experiment you tried it it did the opposite it's wrong okay so as far as your LDL I wouldn't worry about it as far as your Apple B also wouldn't worry about it because we have no idea what that apple b is there's a lot of things that can raise your Apple B and um there's a there's a great short clip from uh one of Dr Paul Mason's talks on Appo so you can look that up on YouTube Just Paul Mason Appo it should be like a f minute clip just tells you like this is this isn't actually a useful marker so um your calcium score may be elevated it may not but calcium scores go up over decades you you build atherosclerosis over decades not 10 months of a new diet any diet I mean if you're smoking and drinking and eating crap for 10 months you are going to cause a lot of problems but um even then you're not going to build up 50% blockages unless you have some you know really horrific you know genetic uh predispositions for it people smoke and drink and E crap for decades and those are the ones getting peripheral vascular disease and and serious you know blockages in their in their arteries so you know 10 months on Carnivore isn't going to do that so always remember that you that these tests are a snapshot in time you don't know where they're going up and down and you don't know about soft plaque either your calcium score is raised does that mean you have a whole bunch of soft plaque or not much small plaque and vice versa like if you have Cal sh of zero you may still have some soft plaque it's just not calcified so always take these things into account and also remember that you're getting this tested now you didn't get it tested a year ago before you started carnivore so you don't know the change and so just take that for what it is right and remember that if you do have an elevated calcium score and they say well you need to be on a Statin ask them why they would want to put you on a stat Statin for raised cholesterol or raised calcium score when statins raise your your your calcium score not everyone knows that but statins increase your your CAC score because they they calcify these plaques they say oh that's a good thing it's it's calcifying these these soft plaques okay well I thought that was bad you just said it was bad you know so we need to be this medication but that doesn't make it better it actually makes it worse so what's going on there and um you know so you just ask those questions and uh yeah well good luck to you um that was probably more than you needed for your answer but I hope it was helpful to to you and others pure blooded Patriot thank you for the Super Chat uh one more question is grass finished red meat okay it's it's the best grassfed and finished obviously you know don't let people trick trick you with words but uh yeah grass-fed and finished uh red meat is is is the best so grass-fed and finished you know if the cow is eating what it's supposed to eat it's going to be as healthy as it can be that's going to be more nutritious for you as well and so yes that's definitely definitely okay but if you can't get it and you can only get grain finish that's still better than than the Alternatives you know basically anything else you know so uh don't if you if you you can't have if you don't have access to grass finished or you can't afford grass finished grain finished is is totally fine from the vast majority of people maybe add in a bit of liver just to make sure you're getting nutrients you know once or twice a week just little bit not much uh Andrew thank you for the Super Chat 30-year-old male 6'2 210 pounds 10y year history of weight training two months on Carnivore two to three pounds of 8020 ground beef with butter daily do you have a rough idea on how long to fully optimize still inconsistent energy performance at the gym uh yeah you I mean you should should be pretty well keto adapted at this point going be some further epigenetic sort of effects that that you might see benefit from later on um that's probably an okay amount of fat but um quite often fat comes is your energy source so 8020 ground beef is probably leaner than I would go you can get like the 7030 I would do that you're adding butter I don't know how much butter but it may be enough um if you're getting constipated without coffee tea caffeine um artificial sweeteners or magnesium supplements um you know you you you you're definitely not eating enough fat so make sure you're not constipated you're not having hard stools make sure you're not taking any of those things I just mentioned that can be laxatives that can mask constipation because if you are taking the one or multiple of those things and you are constipated it's just you're going to have normal stools right so it's G to just help get this stuff out a bit quicker and and that mass that whereas if you take all that stuff away if all of a sudden it uncovers that you actually are constipated then you're definitely not eating enough fat so make sure you're getting enough fat make sure you're getting enough food um make sure you're not eating before you work out you have terrible workouts if you if you eat before you you go in there I always train fast I always play fasted um I've always told um players around me you know you know play hungry always play hungry you know because it there just get that bit more of an edge when you're doing that and and if you eat a lot especially if you eat a lot of fatty meat your body just going no more so if people eat a lot during the day they can get tired from that two months should be okay from a from a keto adaption point of view make sure you're getting enough fat make sure you're not eating um really within five hours of of training so if you have to eat during the day or before you work out make sure it's five hours plus before um before you work out and if you can do it after and uh yeah that's usually that's usually it and if your energy levels are still pretty low you should get your blood checked you know like I said um you know that can happen if people are just a bit off you know sometimes they can have absorption issues um if you're on certain medications and can reduce your absorption B12 like metformin don't know if you're on Metformin but some people are at 30 I wouldn't expect you to be but some people are and there's other ones and so you know other people have absorption issues for other reasons like pernicious anemia where your body you know attacks the areas of their stomach that release intrinsic factor which binds to B12 which allows you to absorb that you can't absorb B12 without that um and then some people just have strangely low B12 anyway so it could be a genetic issue that they just need more and um and so I would just check I just check your Bloods check your nutrients check your B12 check your thyroid check your androgens and um and uh you know if there's something a little off then you might might adjust it you know adding in a bit more liver maybe getting a B12 shot to bump you up and get you going all those sorts of things but you know so there's there's a list there's a differential that you run down and that's that's how I I would approach it um top to [Music] bottom s Thank you very much for the Super Chat regarding one: one fat to protein ratio 1 kg of meat has approximately 200 grams of protein 20 grams and 100 20 grams per 100 grams so in real life terms is it's 200 grams of fat um if eating 200 grams of protein a day thank you yes that's exactly right so yeah so it's not it's not um grams of fat tissue and to grams of lean tissue so it's not like 5050 gram beef it's more 6540 or 6535 ground beef that's about 2 gram of fat to one gram of protein so that that's what you look for so um that's what that ends up being I don't know exactly so 7030 is closer to 1: one grams of fat to protein I think and um if I remember correctly but you know just going off like paleo medicina you know they talk about that um 35 gram of fatty tissue to 65 grams of lean tissue and that that ends up being I believe that's two to one it's it's in that range and so you you you aim for that range and then you you adjust up and down if your body needs more fat it needs more fat if it doesn't it doesn't so I go by your stools um you know as as I mentioned but yeah that's what that is so yeah because all the lean tissue isn't 100% protein all the fat tissue isn't 100% fat so yeah that's that's correct there's there's a specific amount of grams of fat in there and fat and protein so yes you so that's that's that one to one gram of fat to Protein that's talking about the actual grams of fat and protein not fat tissue so that's a good distinction thank you Tanya Butner thank you for the Super Chat why do I crave sweets after three months on Carnivore could be a lot of reasons a lot of things are um you know psychological we just miss them um some people have problems with addiction they feel that they feel addicted to it longer term also if you have cravings quite often you're just hungry and you're not eating enough it's very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet and so do you find yourself going to like a grocery store and and the bakery section the donuts are that smells amazing you're hungry like that's all there is to it you know even if you don't feel hungry you're hungry and so try eating meat if it tastes good that confirms that you're definitely hungry keep eating it until um it's stops tasting good generally if you're keeping yourself uh well fed you won't be uh you won't be getting Cravings um if you're having artificial sweeteners even every now and then that will kick off your Cravings again if you have alcohol even every now and then that will kick off your Cravings again so if you are pure 100% carnivore meat and water only no additives no sweeteners no Stevia no nothing no electrolytes with stevia no electrolytes with um a ru T and monk fruit sugar and all these sorts of things nothing besides meat and water those Cravings will go away from a from an addiction point of view and if you're getting the like I really want some sweets you're hungry eat food until you are not getting those cravings and uh and just make sure you're getting getting enough salty Texas trucker thank you for the Super Chat uh caveman two months awesome energy levels have returned very good push-up squats and burpees um gave strength back how do you attain 80% fat 20% protein um as far as calories so that's that's calories of fat to calories of protein and that relates to grams of fat to grams of protein so if you're just eating meat no carbs and you're eating two grams of fat per one gram of protein that's % calories from fat 20% calories from protein and that then that's what that shakes out to so round 65% lean ground beef right so 65 35 6040 call it that should get you in that in that area of of 80% calories from fat that may not be what you need it may be that that you need a slightly different amount of fat the point is you need enough fat and you need enough protein generally speaking quite often people need about the same amount of grams of fat and protein so um it's um it's uh you know so that that's but you need certain amount and that usually what it shakes out to be is about that and that's usually what it sort of breaks down to but you might be different you might need a little more protein you might need a little more fat so just balance it out on how your body feels go by taste go by your stools go by your energy levels and how you're feeling and what what makes you feel the best um let me see here just need to check this okay so from YouTube user uh no name involved uh question is have very high beta cytool and and campesterol eliminated carbs in 2014 oxalate seed oils in 2019 80% carnivore for one month uh 557 pounds glucose you know 83 to 115 HDL 92 triglyceride 62 highish lipids but not worried um I don't know what the beta cyto stero and campest stero is um let just try to see with that what that is there just like a plant sterile I guess um so you have high levels of those plant steril I'm assuming you're saying that's in in your in your body plant steril mimic cholesterol that's so he's saying you should get you know if you eat almonds and things like that has these these plant steriles and they and they will basically your body thinks you have enough cholesterol so it doesn't make its own cholesterol that's actually not good these are these are used in in in lie of that and they don't work they don't you can't make pro hormones out of it you can't make vitamin D out of it can't make proper cells and and brain out of it so um it's not great [Music] um and so I'm if I'm reading this correctly it looks like you're saying that that you have higher levels of those I don't even know you could test for those um but you know I would just continue to eliminate any any animal or any uh plant fats and oils don't use anything besides plant oils don't eat nuts and seeds and all that sort of stuff um saying seed oils out in 2019 but if you're eating seeds and you're eating these other sorts of things they're going to have plant steril they're going to have plant fat fats that have that so um you know I don't see anything wrong your glucose going bit above 100 occasionally it's fine it matters more of the average um HDL is fantastic 92 um you know above 40 for a man above 50 for a woman is is excellent triglycerides are 62 which is also fantastic so that's not that's not deranged at all I think that that's excellent your htl is higher than triglycerides which means you're very metabolically healthy you very likely have pattern a LL cholesterol so whatever your LDL is it's good for you and it's associated with longevity so bonus um and plant sterols should hopefully get out of your system eventually you know the seed oils and things like that you know Omega 6 is always so they have long half life they could take a while to get out of there I had no idea you could test for that I don't I may be misreading that but that's what it seems like you're saying is that you've tested for and you have high levels but um they should eventually go away but it could take years if there's a long halflife to these things so just just keep doing what you're doing don't eat plants don't eat any plants that have any oils and any fats in them and like seeds nuts you know and um and hopefully this will just eventually get out of your system and that's the thing we're which is all we all have room for improvement you know we're all just getting better and better and better and um you know there's and that's the thing you don't just get all the benefits just overnight you have months that your body is improving and adapting and changing epigenetic changes and effects you have hormonal improvements those hormones have effects that take months and years to manifest fully and then you're getting rid of all these toxins that can take years too so you actually keep getting better as you go you get a lot of benefit in the beginning just stop eating point it's never a bad time to stop eating poison but it keeps getting better after [Music] that [Music] okay Pam Barnes I'm 64 been on Carnivore for 3 months and lost 20 lbs great it's great uh my first blood work shows better cholesterol but my bu bu creatinine is high uh 2831 uh my phosphorus is low at 2.6 doctor says to drink more water is this common um well if your cranny is high then you need to drink more water and that's that's good that they um didn't freak out are are bunged up UA will go up Ura is just going to be from eating more protein and you make more Ura from protein which is good you like Ura Ura is good for us it's a it's a very strong antioxidant and so if your Ura goes up but your creatinine stays down kidneys are fine so you go by your egfr right so you're estimating GL GL I can never say this word GL GL filtration rate Jesus that was the worst time I've ever had with it uh egfr I'm just going to stick with that now and um that's H that that's just the filtration filtration rate so just how much liquid's going through your your kidneys and um and if that's high doesn't matter what your your bu and your Ura and all that sort of stuff is but if you creatinine is high then that's water you need to drink more water and that's that's exactly right so um it is common for Ura to go up it is common for bu to go up um but it will not raise your creatinine going carnivore will not raise your creatinine dehydration will raise your creatinine a lot of people don't drink enough water so uh yeah so that's what I would do but it looks like you're doing great you're losing weight Bloods are improving and just need a bit more water most people do John Day thank you for the Super Chat uh love you well thank you very much I appreciate that you advise someone with gut issues to avoid sulfurane uh yeah I avoid I would recommend everyone avoid sulfur vein I'm on trt P pellets they make you take dim sulfate to avoid um estimated AG to oh they make you take that to okay so estimated age 30s testosterone's 150 um B4 trt 850 5 months ago line for three months no recent uh te test thank you uh yeah okay look so if if I don't know why they want you to take that stuff um you can also you can take different kinds of of trt first of all you can uh take transdermal and that's probably better um if you take it right and you don't contaminate other people because if you're putting it on your skin and you you know hug your children they're going to get a big dose of testosterone you hug your wife or or or a loved one they're going to get it on their on their skin and so um you need to you need to do it right you need to do it in the right areas the right locations and the right way and then you need to wash your hands thoroughly soap and water and then you know not let that part of your body that suffers on touch touch other people but for at least an hour usually okay after that um so you can do that and that that really fits with your your daily p patterns of testosterone because testosterone is a morning hormone it secretes out maximally in the morning and and then it rises up causes a lot of action and it starts coming down but it has those knock on effects because it's triggering other things and so you want that you want that sort of up and down throughout the day right those are normal patterns if you're if you're um taking like injections and things like that they can sort of last for a long time you just Wham and you're up here and then you just sort of coming down over the course of a couple weeks or a month so so um so that that's something anyway there are other things you can take it doesn't have to be uh taken orally um and uh but if you do and that's how you take it you know I guess that that's sort of you know sort of where you're at but um you know I don't I don't I don't know much about like the pellet side of things um you know I yeah I seen that I don't really do much of that stuff so I don't I don't as part of my practice but um as far as where you're at now though you may not even need trt like I've had I've had patients come off trt in their 60s and 70s and still maintain youthful levels you know not levels were they were 25 actually some did you know there was I've told the story before but there was a 72y old man who um went carnivore literally tripled his testosterone got back into a level that you'd expect uh someone in their you know Young adulthood like you know in their 20s to be at and he was just bouncing off the walls he was like feel amazing I feel like I'm a kid again I feel like I'm a teenager again you all I want to do is like work out and you know and do stuff with my wife you know and he he used more graphic language than that but it was it was um it was great to see because he was doing so well and he was he on no no trt so you know we we completely derange our body's ability to make hormones normally by eating crap and even eating just vegetables they disrupt our hormones there are phyto hormone that and hormone mimickers and and detractors that damage your hormonal ability and just carbohydrates in general will drop your testosterone and your growth hormone for men and and will actually raise testosterone in women and lower estrogen and cause PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome so it's really bad stuff is really bad sunch is a little bad it's a lot bad and you know I think it's the the main issue with disease in the world right now this this is the main epidemic that we're treating is just eating the wrong thing and so it could very well be that you don't even need to come on be on this stuff and you could you could sort of wean yourself off you can always take a blood test see where your testosterone is if you're taking exogenous testosterone your body's just going to be like okay great we don't need to make as much we like this level um but you could see about weaning off and see how your body does I have had patience actually have a reactive rise in their testosterone because people don't realize this they think that if you go on trt you can never come off that's not true because you're you're actually resting the gonad you're resting that organ so you're making it not work as hard right so if you're taking like thyroid hormon something like that your thyroid is not working as hard doesn't just turn off and never and go away in fact overworking it can burn it out so if you're if you're taking exogenous testosterone that can actually rest the gonads and then when it comes back they can actually come back better and I've actually seen that in practice I've actually seen people come off trt and their levels are like 400 450 and you know when they're on trt and there different levels so this is in the US are slightly different different levels so in in Australia you know the reference range is like 250 to 750 but like an optimal range for a 25y old would be 600 to 900 this guy was 450 on trt right so he wasn't even up in that youthful level came off trt and sort of 6 weeks two months later he was up at 650 so he had a reactive rise so probably presumably you're going to have a bit of a dip but then your body kicks back in gear and starts going again because you're not taking you know steroid crazy levels of you know of like know someone going for like a fitness competition or the Mr Olympia where you can really suppress your your body's hormone you know Capa producing capacity it takes longer to come back from that um so as long as you're you're taking more normal physiological levels it can actually rest and have a a reactive rise in your testosterone so uh just be aware of that and if you you want you can always try you may be able to come off may not even need it may come off and maybe your levels be slightly lower but you feel great and you don't you don't care about it so you know just just something to think about and bki thank you very much for the Super Chat both my parents de developed dementia and died in their 80s I'm so sorry to hear that at 67 what do you recommend I do to hopefully Go a different path don't eat with a AA uh eat fatty meat don't eat any carbs don't drink alcohol don't smoke cigarettes don't take drugs not that I I expect that you do um but really just go just just eat what you're designed to eat eat a high fat cornivore diet red meats the best a lot of fat brain is Fat Brain needs fat excuse me you know especially these these Omega-3s not the plant Omega-3s that's ala not DHA or EPA ala is great for your heart it's not good for you it doesn't do anything for your brain 20% of your brain is DHA right it's a lot so you need those those Omega-3s and that only comes from animal fats we don't really make much of it ourselves you have to get it from from meat and animal fats so do that don't eat carbohydrates that's going to shut off your body's ability to make ketones it's going to shut off your brain you know and then you're going to build up insulin resistance you're going to build up um type three diabetes which is Alzheimer's that is dementia so that's what I would do I get rid of all these things you're going to damage you out eat a high fat cornivore diet that is what I I've seen this this reverse people's uh dementia you know they they're going home from nursing homes right so that's amazing so this you know if if it can fix those people and reverse their condition to the point that they can go home and live independently again rebuild their brain this can definitely stop it from happening in the first place and that's obviously to be desired to have it not be an issue in the first place so that that is what exactly what I would do eat a lot of fatty red meat with a lot of nice healthy Omega-3s don't take official supplement or an omega-3 supplement most of those turn rancid because the Omega-3s are actually monounsaturated and they that that that unsaturated double bond is actually a point of of oxidation that can get damaged and turn into nasty things so get it from meat you know have a bit of fish don't have to have it every day especially if you're worried about you know heavy metal mercury buildup so you know um you have a bit of fish every now and then fatty fish um you know but whole fish f farm fish is no good has to be wild caught because the farm fish is fed a bunch of pellets and Grains and crap like that they don't have any Omega-3s because the omega-3 comes from their diet their natural diet you know wheat pellets are not their natural diet there's no Omega-3s in there so you need to get real wild cotton fish and you know beef lamb grassfed and finished to be prefer that has a better complement of Omega-3s Annabella the happy carnivore good to see you thank you Dr Anthony for what you do uh to our Comm for our community well thank you I appreciate that and you're very welcome I'm glad I could help um I had a runin with a dietitian today uh what about about what true health is I'm day 126 car I bet you did uh well I hopefully hopefully you made them at least think about things you know some people because this is their profession they are the expert um they're the expert in the room and every room room they go to and especially when they're with a patient um that it's hard for them you know um it's hard for people in that position of expertise that they are the expert to listen to anything that anyone says but you know a major part of of medicine is is listening to people and seeing what they're experiencing and understanding where they're coming from and you know if you have a patient and you're just saying hey we have this treatment well this treatment is making me feel bad it's making me do this making me do that you listen to that no I'm the expert it's not going to do that okay but you know you need to listen to that you know because you you know you need to actually understand that their experiences could be legitimate and so even though you think that this treatment is safe and the right thing to do and all that sort of stuff there if you're getting patients reporting back that there's something wrong here something's wrong and you need to at least entertain that thought so hopefully they were open-minded enough um but um but um you know you never know you know but uh you know maybe you you sort of uh open their mind a bit and just say well okay well what about this what about this have you looked at this have you looked at this actually really it's really interesting you should take it out you know it might if you do it soft enough um or convincing enough it can be um you know it can be eye opening they can take a look at it and then come back to you like you know what I think you're on to something I've looked into it more and you know I think there's there's something to this and I've certainly had a lot of conversations with dietitians and one of them even just said to me I they just said that my entire education was a lie like you proved that you know you showed me you showed me the studies you showed me the evidence like my entire education was a lie this was all like I don't know how I'm going to do my job because in the hospital setting in the clinic setting you have to go by the book you go off the book you know you can lose your license you can lose your job and they're like I I don't know what I'm going to do now so I sort of feel bad in a way because now they you know they're sort of at this existential crisis where they didn't know what they were going to do with their life and had to sort of look for a different career path but you know ultimately it's probably better for them and their patients that they did that because now they can go into a field of nutrition that they can you know really help people and help them in with the right with the right nutrition so um hopefully yours uh comes to similar conclusions Gabriel Lincoln thank you so much for the Super Chat I've been carnivore omad one meal a day for two months and I've lost 37 pounds that's awesome great job uh previously I had gout caused by beef according to doctors but not now your thought so well that's funny isn't it so they said that beef causes your gout and yet when you only eat beef and nothing else gout goes away okay so it's not the beef obviously it's not the meat it's sugar carbs really fructose and alcohol those are the main the main culprits um people I've seen with gout um some people will report they'll get like a flare up or two and then it'll tend to go away not everyone does quite a lot of the time gout just goes away and the thing is this has been in the literature for gosh going on 150 years now I mean Salsbury Dr Salsbury in the 1800s that was one thing one of the things he was he was documented he was curing was gout uh by putting people on a pure red meat and water diet so you know 150 years we treating people with with gout without a pure red meat and water diet and then all of a sudden you flip and just say yeah red meat causes gout don't know about that one Chief but you know it's just guil by association so you're eating a bunch of red meat it's rich food with um other sorts of things such as alcohol and all that sort of stuff [Music] umone say asking for I turned off Super Chat no I did not um let's see looks like there's a [Music] um there's another Super Chat here um by Justin mcy thank you very much for the super chat but it didn't get a a question attached looks like it's lowered down um so thank you Melissa for for sending that um question is my grandmother has had and still has polycystic kidney disease for over 15 years has no kidneys on dialysis many days a week still has stools uh just no more peeing uh any help so if your kidneys are gone gone I mean there's nothing probably that can bring that back unfortunately a polycystic kidney disease is really damaging unfortunately most people do go dialysis eventually there is new research coming out with polycystic kidney disease and ketogenic diet showing it actually does improve so could be the past the point of no return but it's I mean it's going to help her anyway it's not going to hurt her you know we know that you know it's not going to make her kidney function worse if she has no kidney function right so it's going to make everything else better um can I bring her off dialysis I have no idea it's very unlikely there are three cases that I know of of people coming off dialysis um going on a carnivore diet that took like a year long time and um but either way their health improved dramatically the whole time and uh there's one gentleman now who was vegan and very sick a lot of neurolog he so malnourished that he like destroyed his neurological system and he actually couldn't use his phone at one point that's when he realized I can't I'm killing myself with my my diet's killing me and and he started eating meat again everything changed but it's been a you know long slow process of rebuilding his body but it is which is amazing he's on dialysis he's in his 30s he's on dialysis he destroyed his kidneys with this vegan diet you know it's is so sad you people pushing this vegan diet is the best thing best thing for health and nutrition all they killing people it pisses me off and um you know thankfully this didn't kill this young man but it it came very very damn close you know 30-year-old shouldn't be on dialysis you know you know for any damn reason so anyway he's starting to make more urine on a carnivore diet so I'm very hopeful that he can actually regain his his independence from dialysis if your if your grandmother is if they're just gone you don't know how much is going to going to come back I mean you're saying has no kidneys I would I would imagine I mean if they've been removed then that's obviously they're gone but generally you don't remove them without replacing usually it's a kidney replacement kidney transplant but but if they're just they're just not working completely could they come back maybe I I would hope that they would there's no guarantee for that but it does improve kidney function in general and more protein in particular that's been shown to increase improve kidney function and so if you you know and and it will improve her health in Thousand other ways anyway it'll make her life much better in many many other ways and it's not going to make it make her worse anyway so I would um I would still definitely uh try it with her I I can't say that it's G to get her off dialysis it probably won't if she's if she's really far gone but you you never know and it will help her in so many other ways as well I still think it's very very much advisable that she that she try this anybody tries it it's going to be so good for her her her um cognition her you know mental health in general but also her um neurological Health going forward very will prevent her or at least diminish her chances of developing dementia and Alzheimer's and um so you know I mean study showing that years ago that higher LDL cholesterol levels lowers your risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's why why are we trying to lower that stuff you know and um you know you eat a bunch of cholesterol dietary cholesterol doesn't really affect serum cholesterol fasting does you stop eating entirely your your LDL will go up your total cholesterol will go up is fasting bad for us now no of course it's not um but just not eating carbohydrates makes it go up so you go on a carnivore diet slams up it's metabolic it's not because you're eating more cholesterol and saturated fat there have been plenty of studies looking at that one that they fed people 36 eggs a day for weeks didn't change their cholesterol at all right so you know dietary cholesterol is is has nothing to do really with well has very little to do I should say with serum cholesterol it's more metabolic you stop eating you stop eating carbs goes up why is that okay so I I would that's what I would do that's what I you know um my parents did it on their own I didn't push it on them but I'm very glad they did and they've improved countless ways and so I would expect the same I know the same will happen with your grandmother as well I know she'll improve will she come off to house us I have no idea um odar she won't but you never know and it will help her in many other ways so so good luck with that and there are studies with K polycystic kidney disease improving on ketogenic diets and cornivore is a ketogenic diet uh big gelato good to see you again buddy thanks for the Super Chat I thought you were crazy when I saw plants were trying to kill you uh my mother and I were open-minded to listen to you well thank you I you know just trying to open up conversations really with these uh and 28 Days Later down 20 pounds completely done with sugar and carbs thanks and mil that's awesome that's so good to hear you know and uh and that's 20 pounds in a month I mean that's F fantastic um so yeah it does sound crazy it does sound crazy I thought my professor was crazy I thought this was well he I thought he was messing with us um and I thought it was a crazy idea but I was blown away when I heard him saying that that plants are trying to kill you and almost the sight but it made sense because I knew botney you know and I knew biology I like yeah well that is that is right you know they they do make these defense chemicals and most plants will kill you um yeah they have no problem with you dying if they get to live no animal in the wild has a problem with you dying if it or its child gets to live you know these beautiful herbivores they're just so Majestic and lovely get close to one of them they'll stomp you out all right domesticated animals even can can uh kill farmers and things like that even though they've raised them from birth and then treated them very well it's just you know it's an animal and it's huge you get near a wild animal where their life is constantly endangered and being threatened you get too close it's like you're a threat going to stomp you out you know so that happens you people get killed by these things you know some of the major killers in Africa you know like the big five are herbivores you know elephants rhinos k Buffalo those major kill hippos right lions are only one of the five four of those are herbivores they're not trying to eat you they're just trying to kill you so you can't eat them you can't kill them first so you know obviously the same is going to be true of plants right so plants have to live too and um yeah that's just how that goes so obviously it's the case that they they're going to defend themselves and you know just recognizing that has you know literally changed my life and the lives of Many Many people around the world and uh a lot of my patients too so uh thank you for having an open mind thank you to your mom for having an open mind and at least entertaining the idea and seeing if it works for you because again if it you know it doesn't matter what your study says if you experiment and you try and you get the exact opposite results study sucks that's all there is to it John W thank you for the Super Chat hi doctor my family doctor says if I eat so much red meat it will cause me to get colon cancer where does this come from what is my counter argument uh yeah um so look there's a there's um can't remember what video would I have this on I have some on my cancer videos like with with Professor Thomas SE freed should be down there there should be uh some things on on on on red meat and not causing colon cancer there's one from the University of Washington that just came out sort of last year may have up I'll have to go back and update make sure that that's on on the cancer ones but anyway you look up go go to Google Scholar um look up um University of Washington Seattle uh study on on red meat and um not causing colon cancer um they did a massive massive study looking at over 800 studies and they found that the ones that even had a weak association with me they're very poor junk St they call them junk science junk studies junk science have all these confounding factors you know people that ate more red meat they were counting pizza and and hamburgers and lasagna and other sorts of things sandwiches um as uh as red meat right was a lot of other things in there too so you're eating junk food you're going to McDonald's they're like oh you eat red meat what you know what if you got the what if you got just a McFlurry you know there's no red meat in there but it doesn't matter you go to fast food that counts as red meat so it's and the people that that eat that way are more likely to smoke and drink and do other sorts of behaviors that will increase their risk for for cancers of all descriptions and so uh they're junk they're junk crap studies the ones that that corrected for those compounder found there's no association between even processed meat and cancer and certainly nothing with unprocessed red meat so unfortunately this is just one of those myths in in medicine that just gets keeps going around um it was made worse by The Who in 2015 putting processed uh meat on the causes cancer list and the red meat on the likely cause probably causes cancer risk uh sheet uh but that was complete  you know these that that that um panel that decided that was majority people by vegans vegetarians and sday Adventists who are vegans vegetarians by religion because they think that that that meat is sinful okay there were other people of not of that description on the panel and they came out and said that that was the hardest thing they've ever had to do professionally uh in their professional career because they saw countless high level good quality well-designed study showing no association at all between meat and especially red meat and cancer or colon cancer or any other cancers um being thrown away and and really poor crappy junk science with all these confounding factors that we talked about being included because it had a very slight incre like literally 18% if it's not if it's epidemiological study if it's not above 200% it's it's it's a it's a bad signal you don't even listen to it it's just 18% it's nothing it's background noise right but they're saying that makes it a carcinogen not even maybe a carcinogen this is a car this causes cancer it's um so find that that University of Washington study on on cancer and red meat that just came out last year I believe last year or the year before recent anyway very recent and they went through all the studies and so you just come at it come at it like that and you can probably try and find I can't remember the guy's name but if you look up uh Belinda fety ft ke um she did a whole talk on Seventh Day Adventist and their control from the beginning on our nutrition guidelines and control and and founding and inventing the processed food industry like Kelloggs and sanitarian foods and 20 other cereal manufacturers um so she she names the guy I can't remember the guy's name off hand but she she references that so go to her YouTube channel she just has I think she just has the one YouTube video on that channel and that it's fantastic you know I did a talk about this all that stuff I I learned from her and other sort of sources but 90% of what I I I talked about was stuff that I learned from her on that video so that's that's a better Source she goes into better detail and greater detail um than I did so um I mean I talk about some different things but she gets she she really hammers it home it's it's excellent it's an excellent talk and she talks about that how that guy on that that who panel was just like this is the worst experience in my life uh this was this was complete crap um so uh watch that and maybe get your doctor to watch that too so you can understand what he's recommending to people is is is uh biased and corrupted and um and find that guy's name and you can find that that story about him talking about that and and then get that study from from University of Washington from udub and uh and just bring it to him and say hey look I don't agree and um I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing and if you and you know watch the SE freed my interview with Thomas C freed SE y f r i d um on cancer and you learn about cancer biology and how cancer actually works how it's actually fed by um how it's actually fed by um carbohydrates and glutamine there's glutamine in every every protein source and you make it and you can cook it out of your food as well so um you know that's not that's not going to be a problem for most people and um you know and and understand exactly how cancer works and Hope hopefully get or a doctor to look at that too because people are are helping their cancer by eating red meat you know so you know it's just it needs to be changed but I don't you know I don't fault your doctor for saying that that's that's a commonly held misconception but it is a misconception it's not based on good science it's it's based on a theory it's based on accusation and it's based on propaganda and um you know that's that's a matter of record okay all right guys we have about 30 minutes to go and then I'm going to have to um I'm going to have to take off let me just set a timer here just so we don't uh we don't go over okay ominous uh hello Dr cha I have episodic cluster headaches and Horn syndrome I have spent a fortune and nothing has helped I'm considering carnivore but know very little can you speak on this subject thank you very much so cluster headaches there a lot of things that can cause headaches pretty complex field but there are a lot of people that improve their headaches dramatically with a carnivore diet and a ketogenic diet in general you're removing different toxins and inflammatory factors that improve headaches also there's about a hundred years of uh clinical data on migraines in particular being helped by ketogenic diets as well as epilepsy and a lot of things that help epilepsy help migraines and vice versa and so I would expect that to help you know get rid of everything get rid of coffee drink a lot of water water's very important for headaches just eating meat fatty meat your brain running on ketones and um and horer syndrome depends on what call the Horner syndrome J that's a that's a you know pressure you're pushing on the sympathetic chain and you're getting um a horer syndrome so it depends on what's causing that um I don't know how long you've had the Horner syndrome or or what's causing that but your doctor should look into that and see like why why do you have Horner syndrome sometimes you have some you pressing sort of an apical lung um pressing on on that chain that sympathetic chain and and causing that that Horner syndrome so if you don't have a diagnosis for why the Horner syndrome is there get that checked um but uh definitely the cluster headaches can help I I don't I don't know what's causing your Horner syndrome so I I can't I can't speak to that but I can say for sure that it will help you in so many other ways that the horer syndrome will be much less of a problem and if it helps with the cluster headaches you know that that's a that's a big bonus too but your life will improve a lot your health will improve a lot you will get to a point where you feel better than you ever have in your entire life and so that's always going to be good even if it doesn't doesn't fix all the all the problems you set out to fix if it's helping you in so many other ways it's improving your life it's improving your life and that's the main thing so I would definitely try it I mean give it give it 30 days just you know just pure red meat and water or just pure meat and water for 30 days red meat's going to give you better outcomes fatty lot of fat you'll feel better you'll feel a lot better and so just see how you feel see see what your body's doing and give it 30 days and if that's good and you feel better keep going you know because this is a lifelong thing you know you don't you know you stop drinking lead leaded water and you stop having lead poisoning and you go back to drinking the same water you're going to get the same problem right so um you know this is something that is sort of a lifestyle you know and if that if it's helping your life life and you're feeling better it's help is helping your lifestyle giving you improving your lifestyle then just keep doing it um but yeah try for 30 days see how you go I would expect you to to have significant improvements and good luck with that let let let me know how that goes Debbie Lee thank you so much for the Super Chat very generous of you um I love the carnivore diet good first month was amazing as I turned the corner leading into the second month I started getting headaches and muscle aches I've been pretty strict on the diet except for eggs some raw milk and bacon in the morning um okay well I'm sorry I'm sorry to hear that you know if you think about if anything you've added in if you've added in anything if you added in the milk or you added in the eggs or anything El even bacon I mean I I don't most people won't have a problem with bacon I don't have a problem with nitrates or nitrites you make them your saliva makes it's in your saliva the studies that vilified it in first place were pretty bogus um Dr Barry does a great video on this he it's like five years ago or something like that that he did it and it just what's it called it just say it's like eat your bacon or something like that um but it basically tell shows the LIE uh about about nitrates you know and like vegetables have way more nitrates than bacon does and we've been using nitrates to preserve meat 3,000 years something like that so you know why is it causing a problem now and and not before you know so um but either way if you react you react some people do and so you can try eliminating those things out try just being um to strict meat and water get rid of the milk uh that can be very inflammatory for people and especially if you've added in the raw milk definitely get rid of it so anything you've changed in that second month try to get rid of that um headaches muscle aches is a bit strange generally that has to do with with something you're bringing in your body that you're reacting to and you're building up inflammation and so you know you want to try to identify that um as well but that that's that's really it I mean from what you're telling me I don't have much else to go on but any sort of supplements no don't drink coffee don't drink tea no artificial sweeteners definitely those can cause problems um and yeah the headaches is a bit weird headaches and muscle AES are very weird unless you're unless you're bringing in something so you know if you're you know I don't I don't I can't say for sure just from reading this if you've added in the eggs and the raw milk and the bacon in that second month if you have get rid of them um and either way get rid of them just go back to your Baseline just go back to to just red meat and water fatty red meat and water make sure you're eating enough make sure you're getting enough water and just eliminate out anything that you could be putting in your body that that could be giving you reaction of of headaches and muscle soreness and aches because that's that's very strange us usually those go away um and uh and give that give it another couple weeks with just just the the meat and water and uh hopefully that that resolves um headaches muscle aches could be actually being exposed to some sort of virus as well it happens we feel very different when we get sick I sort of just feel a bit tired and just bit out of it I can get a bit of you know stiffness and soreness I got a headache one when I had I had you know um the vid I had uh I had you know pretty bad headaches for a few days was pretty much it that was that was really my main symptom I was tired and I had headaches you know so that's another possibility as well just go back down to Baseline fatty red meat and water and hopefully this will pass I would expect it to pass you know because there's nothing in there that's causing Pro problems so if you're if you're sick or you're fighting something off that will pass if it's something that you've been eating like the eggs and raw milk or bacon or whatever something in the bacon A lot of times they add sugar things like that then getting rid of that will help as well and sort of work your way out of the system so hopefully that that does resolve that if it doesn't you're just red meat and water and all those sort of things you and and you don't think it's an illness you going on for a month you know get your blood work check see if there's some sort of weird deficiency that you're getting um and just make sure that that you aren't low on something else and maybe add in a bit of liver once or twice a week to head that off now just in case but if that persists I would I would then turn to blood tests and uh and see if your your doctor has any idea of why you're having so many headaches and muscle aches and things like that good luck with that uh question from Robin dad is a 79y old carnivore great for one month diabetic off insulin now whoa awesome from one month that's that's great uh fasting glucose is 100 to 130 so maybe a bit early to come off an um does protein cause it keep injecting insulin with reduced dose a andc was n A1C is nine um one month average six great um yeah so look you know you can't come off your medications right away a lot of people do come off their insulin um but in that carnivore study 100% of diabetics came off of all injectables fantastic um but it takes time it take more than one month so um you know if your if your flasting glucose is that high then you still need some some medication uh to help with that protein yes can can cause a bit of a bump and if you don't have enough insulin and your insulin resist resistant and all these sorts of things you're going to get a bigger bump and your body's not going to be able to compensate for it so uh I wouldn't I wouldn't come off the insulin altogether you still need to take enough insulin to control the blood sugars and and eventually uh it's most most likely that he will be able to come off of that completely but you can't you can't just jump into it you know if he still needs insulin he still needs insulin so keep that blood sugar below 100 you know um between 80 and 100 60 and 100 or something like that you know just in that range you know good range and uh and and just use the amount of insulin that he needs generally be like a background does like antis or whatever long acting that he takes generally don't need fast acting for meals um in general but just see how it goes so you have to you have to treat these things on a case-by Case basis and so and give him the amount of medications that he needs and then eventually he should be able to come off and hopefully he does good luck with that good luck to him GF 89 thank you very much for the Super Chat hello I am currently two days postspinal Fusion big surgery hope you're doing well uh in preop tests my creatine levels uh or creatinine levels sorry um showed quite High I believe 16.5 milligrams per deciliter can this be caused by heavy lift weight lifting they advise this was borderline and to proceed with the operation yeah so that I mean that's just to do with your kidney function uh yes if you're lifting heavy you're going to have muscle breakdown and you can you can build up creatinine um you run a marathon or something like that you can really build up your creatinine you get something called rabdomiolisis if you really overwhelm your kidneys um treatment that just water hen water fluids right and so um I had this guy um in the ER once uh when I was in my second year and he he ran a marathon he had he had you know low-grade rabdom my Isis and so cring his way up and was just like okay so suggest we need to hydrate you you know we just need to get water and he just like well I'm definitely hydrated enough I'm like well buddy you're not it's just that's why you're here so you know the thing is you can overwhelm you know even good hydration you know if you really overdo it so for you and your effort level and what you're doing you weren't hydrated enough and you your kidneys you know got bogged down and and uh you got an acute kidney injury sorry you know treatment for that guess what water so um you know same same thing so if you're lifting heavy doing a lot of heavy uh weights and things like that yes that can raise your creatinine um but again the treatment is water just get a lot of water and get and get that in you and you should be fine um carnivore D won't cause that um ra raise your Ura won't won't raise your creatinine um not enough water heavy exercises heavy workouts you know marathons things like that that will raise your creatinine so just you need to make sure that you're that you're hydrated and properly hydrated for what you're doing and good luck in your recovery if you're doing carnivore I think you're going to recover a lot faster than you would otherwise and so good luck with that I hope it goes well Michael Jackson back from the dead H good to see you buddy um thanks for the Super Chat I notice um on a lot of these forums that a lot of people don't talk about carnivore being really the only treatment for viseral fat organ fat yeah fat on organs is that a real Japanese Katana on the bookshelf uh yeah so that that actually came from uh the Tokyo um Samurai Museum so they make they make these replicas so that was a replica of a of a shogun's um sword from I think the 1400s so that's a yeah that's a that's a replica of of a real sword so it's a replica you know haven't got it sharpened I don't know if it's legal to get them sharpened but you know you probably could but yeah so that that's that's real that came from um the official Samurai Museum in in Japan where they they make these things which which is really cool it it was actually a gift which is very nice um uh yeah carnivore being really the only treatment for visceral fat so it's it's a major one it's a major major treatment for visceral fat and visceral fat is that fat around the organs this a this is something went into detail with with Dr Shan omaro who sort of the expert on viseral fat and reducing it and he he came to carnivore from that direction I came to it from plants are trying to kill you and this is our biological Origins and he came from it from this is the best way to get rid of visceral fat visceral fat is really bad for you and so he did a study with the National Institutes of science with over 6,000 patients doing MRIs looking at visceral fat and founds directly related with metabolic disease and that targeting that and reducing visceral fat eliminated metabolic disease and so fantastic and he found that the carnivore diet was the best diet to eliminate visceral fat but there are other things as well that that's high intensity exercise like the sprinting and the and the weightlifting to failure even if it's just push-ups you do a set of push-ups to failure that's it one set to failure three times a week set of squats one set to failure three times a week you know set of Sprints you know to failure you know three times a week you're going to really improve your your life your metabolism your health your hormones and your visceral fat and uh yes I think that's a very important thing so spread it around cornor diet is a really really important tool for eliminating visceral fat it's really the best diet for that ketogenic diets would probably work pretty well as well um just getting rid of alcohol and fructose and low low in your insulin and cortisol is going to help with that as well and that's going to obviously have huge knock on effects to your overall metabolic Health as well but carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet it's the best ketogenic diet because you're eliminating everything that you don't want not just carbohydrates so yes very good point visual fat is is um best treated with a carnivore diet I'm going to see here um so I'm GNA see if I can turn off the super chats because I think we're I think we have enough time to get [Music] through but don't want to have people let me see where we go I'm not seeing where I can turn off super chats a bit annoying participants time stamps okay well I can't see where to turn off super chats I don't know how to do that um so well all right we'll just we'll just announce I'm trying not to put any more Super chats in if somebody knows how to uh turn off super chats maybe tell me um but otherwise I'll get through these super chats but I've got about uh sort of 10 15 minutes max to get through these so we're going to we're going to cut off um sort of looks like there's um one two three four more Super chats we're going to do those and uh and then we'll call it a night or a day or an evening or whatever it is for you uh Edison Twain thank you for the Super Chat uh I don't know what MX is that's interesting though is that maybe Mexico I don't know um is pork lard good alternative to beef Talon ghee yes it is it does depend on what the pigs being fed if they're fed a bunch of horrible things they're not not um supposed to eat as well um then they'll have actually higher levels of linolic acid they're going to be getting these plant oils and you know bad things that we don't want from the seed oils they're going to get those they can't process them right that goes in their fat and so uh you know pork and chicken will have higher levels of linolic acid Omega sixes so it does depend on where the pig pork Lord comes from it is a good alternative it is still going it should be I mean it's going to be better than any cooking oil it's going to be better than any any other um vegetable oils but it could uh very well be from one of these Factory farmed processes where they have a lot of linic acid and things like that so do try to source that from a somewhere that that doesn't have um you know that it's not being fed a whole bunch of crap as well but in general it should be better yes okay X Red Demon thank you so much for the Super Chat uh thank you chaffy for spreading the truth there are zero studies on the carnivore diet when are we going to get some studies on the carnivore diet the results will be too staggering to be ignored well there's one study it's you know it's a it's at Harvard it's the carnivore study it's and it's just a um you know a dietary um you know person dietary review sort of survey Ary survey uh which people then say Oh that's a ter terrible survey like well that's what that's what you do for all the other nutritional surveys that's that was sort of invented by Walter Willet who's like the Head nutritional researcher at Harvard and um you know no one's complaining about it when when it's U used to do a study that fits their narrative so you don't really get to complain about it you know after the fact um but there are more and more um pieces of information coming together and I I agree we should have things that adjust on Carnivore but the thing is the carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet and what do you do when you take away carbohydrates you have to replace it with fat and protein what's the best source of that meat and so we have thousands and thousands and thousands of studies showing clinical studies clinical trials in humans Interventional trials right in humans with showing high fat meat-based ketogenic diets dramatically improve health outcomes and can even reverse different diseases like diabetes which is why that that you know you know the the the epidemiology report from Harvard uh saying that red meat causes diabetes um is wrong on its face because we have clinical data experimental data which is much higher level of evidence in humans show showing that putting somebody on a high fat meat-based ketogenic diet reverses diabetes so it goes away so the meat is not causing it f is not causing red meat in particular is not causing it so you can clean a lot of information from there literally thousands of studies on ketogenic diets and high fat meat-based ketogenic diets showing marked improvements in people's health so that's what we have for now but the good thing about that the the carnivore study at Harvard and the good thing about this gaining population now is I talk to researchers I talk to nutritionists I talk to people going through medical school now I talk to people who are doctors who are going through getting their nutrition PhD right now and they're really interested in this and they're saying we need more studies on this we should do this I'm a researcher I'm going to do the research which is amazing and so it will come I I guarante you there there are things in the works right now um and hopefully those just start coming out and coming out and coming out I think there's enough evidence here um more than enough evidence to apply this to my practice and certainly to my life and to my practice and and I've seen the benefits of that so I'm happy you know with the amount of evidence that there is and I'm happy to treat patients that way and I'm seeing the direct results of that and that's just reinforcing um you know my beliefs in this uh but yeah I think studies are great and maybe you know I was thinking of of doing something you know tracking some of my patients you know publishing you know uh case series analyses on on my patients who've gone carnivore and the dramatic improvements that they've had um see if I can I can put that together but uh an Interventional trial would be great wouldn't it you know get people on you know different cohorts you have have patients that are trying to lose weight or doing whatever or they have health issues and you put them on a bed vegetarian diet plant-based diet you know whatever one you put it on it'll be the wrong one if it doesn't win right there's always going to be someone oh that's not the one I would do right well there are 340,000 plants in the world which ones are the right ones it doesn't matter if it doesn't come out with the way they want that not the right one right always you know because this is an ideology that they're trying to push and they're trying to sell something then you know it should sell itself carnivore sells itself you don't have to sell it you just try it it works you get better people around you are coming out of nursing homes getting rid of of chronic diseases getting rid of autoimmune issues getting rid of major major issues and it works you don't you don't need to you don't need to like you know convince anyone of that it is convincing you know and then you people going plant-based for those same reasons they get a honeymoon period where they're they're just getting us processed garbage and alcohol and things like that out of their system and they're eating a more Whole Food approach they have a healthy user bias they're working out more they're feeling better because of all those other things that they're doing as well and then it starts catching up and they get worse and you know that that poor kid um you know I was speaking about earlier on on dialysis in his 30s and almost died you know that happens and that that kid's life was taken away from him um thankfully not completely he's regaining it but he's that guy lost years you know he's never going to be as healthy as he would have been but he can be a lot healthier than he than than even if he was eating a normal diet and just not a vegan diet so you can still get better than um than the norm for sure but you know that mean that causes serious damage I mean you know put him on dialysis will he come off dialysis I hope so but can't can't can't say that it's that it's it's you ask you ask a nephologist can you come off dialysis no absolutely not can't happen well you know that's because it's very unlikely but no one's ever tried this before and I've seen three people well maybe you know people watching this you know have you do you know someone who's come off dialysis have you come off dialysis I've seen it three times now in six years but those are the only ones that I've heard of you know so it could be happening more than that and there's this this young man and another one who are actually improving they're you know increasing the amount of urine that they're making so there there's something coming back to life there can it come all the way back I don't know but you know there is something there so um but yeah I agree it would be great to get some some bigger studies on this more well-designed you know controlled trials on this Interventional trials higher levels of evidence not epidemiology that's exactly what I want as well and uh but yeah that would be great it' be great to to get that out there because I agree it's GNA be nuts Tina Stokes thanks you for the Super Chat my grandma has been on Carnival for 3 weeks and she's so weak and is going to stop um she thinks she's too old at 89 so really need to make sure that she's eating the right thing she needs to make sure she's eating enough so easy to undereat on a carnivore diet and so she's not going to feel hungry so she have you have to get her to eat try three times a day bacon and eggs in the morning you know some some fatty steak or ground beef at lunch fatty though has a lot of fat you know as fatty as you can get it from the store like 70 30 or greater if you can get it from the butcher um and melt butter into it you know tastes amazing don't don't cook it all the way through have it still be a bit soft and pink or or red in the middle as long as it's not contaminated and um and then you know and something else for dinner as well make sure she's trying to eat at least three times a day most people just need to eat once a day but you need to know how much you need to eat and most elderly people like an ' 89 definitely undereating almost all of them are they're all sarcopenic they're all completely skinny and very very very fragile so she's probably under eating anyway she's definitely undernourished she needs to eat a lot she needs a lot more her hunger signal is going to be very different she's not going to feel hungry well I just eat when I'm hungry as much as I'm hungry for no eat three times a day and eat until fatty meat eggs or bacon stop tasting good so she had a piece of bacon said that was a nice piece of bacon make more bacon right she should get to the point that she doesn't want to continue that she takes a bite and goes hm didn't really enjoy that she shouldn't stop because she thinks she should stop because she doesn't feel hungry if it tastes good she's hungry she needs to understand that and she needs to eat that also if she's coming from a poor nutritional background she could be deficient in other things as well namely B12 you can get these things checked you check her B12 or folet if those are low supplement get her a B12 shot most people her age and in her situation will be um a low B12 and uh cholester low low B12 um so you know you need to you need to make sure that she's got enough of that you know at 89 people have um absorption issues which is another reason why you really want to eat just red meat because it's the most bioavailable stuff out there but even then even if you're getting most bioavailable stuff and adding a bit of liver have a bit of liver mixed in there as well um that that is um that that's that that can help as well with absorption it's more more nutrient dense so check all those things make sure she's getting enough food make sure she's getting enough fat make sure she has enough B12 make sure her Bloods aren't aren't out of whack for another reason um she might feel a bit more tired and lethargic after a fatty meal make sure you you sort of she sees that and recognizes that it might not be um uh may just be nothing more than that um and then you can just sort of recognize that and adjust that as possible she's not too old for this she's a perfect age for this it's never too late to stop eating poison and to get this stuff out of her system and get proper nutrition for her brain and her body she will get better you know just need to make sure she has enough nutrients enough fat enough meat enough water sleeping properly things like that and and um and uh and b12 that's one that will just just wake up your brain and your energy energy like if you have really low B12 and you have trouble absorbing it and and most elderly people have problems absorbing everything including B12 um she she's G to have horrible energy and so I would definitely um check her B12 or even just get her B12 shot with a doctor they may not want to to different nutritionists or health food stores ores or something like that will give out B12 shots but I mean check the B12 anyway and get a B 12 shots he's definitely low everyone's low unless they're on a carnivore diet with you know with proper nutrition and liver and some people on Carnivore diet still need to have a bit of liver so I would do that good luck with that okay very last question that I've got to run uh FJ thank you very much for the Super Chat uh my brother's 39 years old has severe psorasis for 25 plus years and was recently diagnosed with Scout doctor has him on the Mediterranean diet to save his heart Mediterranean diet is uh meat by the way read The Odyssey see what they ate in the Mediterranean it was meat um I'm telling him to go carnivore who should he listen to he should listen to you he should listen to um history he should listen to biology the Mediterranean diet doesn't mean anything which Mediterranean diet south of France Italy Morocco Egypt these are all these are all um these are all in the Mediterranean so the real Mediterranean diet is very strongly meat-based watch my um interview with Dr Bill Schindler called the you know what they really eat in the blue zones because he was just in the blue zon studying these people they predominantly eat meat they he said that they eat more meat than him right um they eat some plants they're not 100% carnivore but it's like you know it's like fresh tomatoes basil and some olives and that's pretty much it the rest of it's meat it's just a bunch of meat and they all have pigs they all have Lambs they you know like cows all these sorts of things it's just it's just meat all over the place and so and then every week they they have a big whole All Day barbecue with a whole lamb on a spit and the whole family comes and enjoys the day so it's a the Mediterranean diet is is is a meat-based diet and um so that's what you should do um psoriasis um and gout I mean all they go away they go away with with uh carnivore diet so you know check the um you know check the different forums check different Facebook groups with tens of thousands of people and say hey anyone here with psorasis you know found benefit from from carnivore diet you will find hundreds of people that have that have helped out and um same with gout so that's what I would recommend okay all right guys thank you so much um I have to end it there because I have a I have a a meeting that I have to jump to um right now so really appreciate it thank you all for coming thank you all for for submitting questions thank you all for the super chats it's very kind of you and um hopefully that was helpful to people and hopefully you all liked it and got something out of it and I will see you uh next week for the suit for the another live same time same channel and um we'll have another uh YouTube Premiere I'm going to do these twice a week on Sundays and Wednesdays um Pacific Standard time so in America and then Monday mornings Thursday mornings for me here in Australia and um yeah and I'll try to do the the Hal's one with the the getting people home from nursing homes try to do that this week as well so please everyone if you can make it out to those if you make it out to those um uh premieres that's really helpful and um because it really drives up the the algorithms and everything like that and uh gets it out to more and more people and uh yeah great hope to see you guys there and have a great weekend [Music]"
