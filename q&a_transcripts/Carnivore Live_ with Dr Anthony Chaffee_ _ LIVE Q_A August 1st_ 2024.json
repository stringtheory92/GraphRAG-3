    "transcript": "all right hello everyone thank you and welcome back to another YouTube live uh with me um thanks everyone for for coming on it's really nice to see everybody here um just wanted to give another special shout out to my friend uh Christopher brand e e e e e e e okay I think we're back very sorry about that my interet my internet just decided to just completely die uh right in the middle of my sentence so uh very sorry about that I now had to connect through my phone so the house internet just completely died um but anyway just wanted to to give a special shout out to my friend Christopher Brandin who goes by the cornivore lawyer for all of his help and support uh in helping me uh patent my episodes which has been a huge ordeal and um uh because you have to like patent each and every one individually so it's a bit of a monster so he's been very helpful with that and so I want to give him a special shout out as a special sponsor of this episode and uh for those who don't know he provides free legal advice uh and help to the cornivore community and can be reached on his website at brandlin law.com uh that's b r n d l n law.com all right so um oh goodness it looks like because when I when it died all my starred messages got erased so um I'm going to start with the one that um that I can see here and maybe we can restar the other ones and and uh see them again uh but starting with the one that that's just just here now is from Derek Johnson thank you very much Derek for the super chat um hi Anthony my biopsy was positive for cancer of the thyroid and lymph those I'm very sorry to hear that surgery scheduled to remove thyroid besides keeping gki low you recommend Sprints or walking uh St fre says walk Omar says Sprint thanks and go kangs um so there's you know there there's different evidence you know um if you look at some of the evidence and some of the studies you when you're doing like sort of more high-intensity exercise it uh can show a benefit sometimes similar to that of like hyperbaric oxygen therapy for cancer treatment things like that just sort of getting your heart rate up and and and working hard um I you know I don't know exactly what because I haven't like dug into that research but it's something that um I know that uh Dr Paul Mason uh has has spoken about and talked about because you know he's an exercise physiologist and sports uh sports medicine doctor and he uh he I remember in one of his talks he did say that that exercise was um was actually beneficial and so I would still imagine that that uh sprinting would be uh good you know you're stimulating your body in very positive ways um and I I hadn't heard uh Professor seed's sort of opinion on on any of those on what he um on any of those on on what the best sort of exercise would be so I would just say whatever whatever you're capable of doing um if you you know if you're if you're up for doing sprints and and um pushing yourself I think that that would probably be beneficial at walk at the least you know staying active keeping your body moving is going to be um you know it's just going to be helpful to your overall health and if your overall health is better then you're going to be able to deal with any sort of situation better in any case but um you know from memory U but this is sort of you know look going off of what uh Dr Mason was saying uh that you know that hard workouts can be actually very beneficial so uh maybe try to find uh Dr Mason's um lecture on that where he talks about that and you can see exactly which uh studies he's referencing and uh and see exactly what kind of exercise they're they're talking about there but my my memory of it was that you know was it was strenuous exercise I don't remember specifically you know long drawn out cardio or or sprinting but I you know I wouldn't think that it's going to harm you anyway to do sprinting as long as you're you're up for it and you're you're capable of that you know some people that have cancer are extremely infirm and they just they really can't do anything more than walking and so just getting them out walking is going to be is going to be a huge Improvement as well so uh that could be that could be the distinction there as well but if you're feeling good and and you're able to do more and do Sprints then you know that uh is uh I would expect to be better but again I don't know all the research on that so take a look okay all right all right looks like we got most of these starred back up so thank you very much Melissa for helping out with that okay um and then uh very generous Super Chat from Terry thank you so much Terry hi Dr chaffy supporting you tonight thanks for all your work well thank you uh that's very very kind of you very sweet of you thank you very much for coming on and um I'm glad that you like my videos nice to see you uh Pingu the penguin thank you very much for the Super Chat and the name uh hi doctor I am in recovery from anorexia and I wanted to know if this diet could help with my low testosterone any advice would be appreciated as my doctor wants me to eat carbs thank you uh yeah I mean you know anytime you're coming from from you know disordered eating especially you know things like anorexy where you're eating very small amounts are just like look you just need to eat everything well that was sort of the problem in the first place wasn't it you know you were eating everything and that wasn't working and people were feeling sick and they were gaining weight they were like well that's not going to work and then so went sort of on the other end so you know just going back is is sort of disordered in the other direction you know you're just telling yourself it's okay even though you're getting you know results that you you may not uh find favorable so I I think it's I think it's uh a very good solution to be on Carnivore in this situation I've seen a lot of people who formerly had anorexia fix their condition and and feel a lot better obviously physically but also mentally that they didn't have to to worry about um you know limiting and restricting because they they could just you know eat a lot of meat and and and feel great doing it and so you know they were they they were happy to do that um as far as low testosterone yeah absolutely I mean that's the only thing that's going to help your testosterone carbs are not going to help your testosterone uh you know going ketogenic can help your testosterone and getting enough meat and fat and cholesterol is what's going to help your testosterone because testosterone is from cholesterol all your your sex steroids hormones are made out of cholesterol and um you know it's like it's the major portion of it you know 95% of the of testosterone molecule is cholesterol you know so it's just a couple little additions that that change it up so cholesterol is extremely important and uh and you get that from from eating meat and being and being healthy and eating a proper human diet so I would absolutely do that so my patient that that go onto a carnivore diet with a lot of fat you know the Fat's very important for your overall health and in particularly your hormonal Health that they uh they improve their their testosterone dramatically and um you know incl you know eggs are great in there too eggs have a lot of cholesterol and saturated fat and those sorts of things which are surprise surprise good for you that's why they're in eggs because they're good for animals and that's why they make up building blocks in the physical structures of a baby right and that's why you know eggs have a lot of saturated fat and cholesterol because the body needs saturated fat and cholesterol and that's why uh breast milk is has the highest concentration of saturated fat and cholesterol of any food in nature because you need it and babies in in particular because their brains are growing their bodies are growing it's very very important so um yeah I would uh I would just keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good just like just like uh everybody would in other situations and um and uh yeah and and then just see how you go I would I would be shocked if your body didn't start improving uh your uh from from all standpoints but especially your your testosterone as well that'll come up sometimes it takes a while for your body to turn on you know so give it a few months uh always check it in the morning first thing in the morning is when you're going to have highest levels of testosterone so always check it at the same time every morning because if you check it at different times you know check once later in the day you're you're always going to have relatively less testosterone than you would have otherwise and so you check it first thing in the morning fasting from the night before 9:00 p.m. only water after that only water in the morning no coffee tea vitamin supplements medications until after you take that blood test between 8 and 9:00 a.m. uh get a good night's sleep for several days before no stress no exercise and no sexual activity for 48 hours before your test you do that in that way and that and don't take biotin don't take B vitamins that contain biotin biotin is a B vitamin so any um any B multivitamin or B complex or multivitamin will have Biotin in it and so just don't take that don't take that for uh you know five days before really and um and then you'll you'll get very consistent numbers you'll be able to track what you're doing and and be able to do that more accurately if you do that inconsistently you'll get inconsistent results and it may be that your numbers are changing that and it doesn't have anything to do with your actual production of testosterone Etc so that's what I would do and um you know you check Baseline and then and you do carnivore and then three months later into carnivore you check it again and you and you see how you feel that's the most important thing and you can check that against your Bloods and they'll get better they will absolutely get better good luck with that that Lively lonus thank you very much for the Super Chat uh tips from me to stop zoning out and getting tonal Vision um had this all my life can't see objects at in peripherals at times uh causes accident oh goodness that's not good uh so I don't drive anymore I want to fix this started line diet in June uh 30th well you know unfortunately um I I don't have a a great answer for you because that's not something that I you know I typically treat hopefully you're you're working with your doctor I'm sure you have if this has been going on for years uh or your whole life one thing that um I'm glad you're starting the lion diet though because one thing that fixing your your diet can do is it fixes problems that we didn't even realize were problems for a lot a lot of the time and also fix problems that no one else had any answer for and and an ability to fix otherwise so uh it could very well be that this helps that a lot of people find that their concentration focus and brain fog improve um tunnel vision there can be a lot of different meanings of the word of of saying that you have tunnel vision if you actually don't have peripheral vision then that's something that needs to get checked out thoroughly um you know if you've had that your whole life then you know maybe it's not as you know something something that's that's more acute but if you really actually don't have visual fields on your peripheral vision you know that that can be something more serious like um you know not to not to you know put any any scary thoughts in your head but when someone gets that La that loss of peripheral vision quickly like over the course of weeks and months that can be from a pituitary tumor pushing on the optic kaym which sort of blocks out the peripheral vision so you end up getting tunnel vision you can only see here and then you're you're walking all of a sudden someone's next to you you're like oh God I didn't see how how'd you get there because you don't see them coming up because you don't have any peripheral vision and you know if you've had that your whole life then it's it's unlikely that's what's going on or maybe you had something that that affected that you know part of your brain previously and then it's just stable um if you'd had something growing there you know since you were a kid and it didn't get addressed it would have probably caused more and more problems however if you have a visual Fields test and you really don't have any peripheral vision you know you know your doctor needs to investigate why the hell that is and so you know I would I would do that I would talk to your doctor get a visual Fields test um and if that is knocking out you know you knocked out sort of your peripheral vision on both sides like that you know you need an MRI and you need to get um you know see an opthalmologists and other sort of people to see you know get that tested properly and to see what the hell is going on and if there's any sort of particular reason that that's happening that can be reversed or fixed or addressed um because that's that's very important to find out so but again you know this has been going on your whole life it's less likely that something like that but it's still very important to investigate maybe you've already had those investigations done but if not I would highly recommend you do that um you know quickly I I just go and to see your doctor you know straight away just get get the next appointment and um and talk to them about it and say Hey you know I want to get my visual fuels test I can't see out of my peripheral vision and get that tested and maybe it's just a a lack of awareness and that's that's important to know about you because that can be that can uh be other sorts of neurological issues if you just are um you know sort of neglecting certain sides of your body and things like that even though the visual fields are there uh and intact and the retin is intact and the optic kazm is intact and all that sort of stuff so uh all good information but needs to be thoroughly checked out by a doctor um and you know line diet hopefully can help with with um some of this as well but you know it's it's not going to fix everything um it's going to fix a lot of things because a lot of things are being caused by eating a really poor diet and so when you fix your diet it fixes a lot of problems so I think that's great and it's um I just encourage you to keep going with that a lot of fat high fat and cut out everything else you know that's the idea with Lion it's just red meat and water but you know really really staying with it for for at least a few months you know do 100% red meat and water for a 100 days 100% for 100 days and uh and see how you go and it'll improve a lot of other things as well hopefully it improves this also but um you if you are actually getting to the point you you don't have peripheral vision like just holding your finger out here like I'm looking straight ahead and I can see my finger moving if you can't do that you need to get it checked out as to as to why that is okay so live says I do think it's neurological it happens when I have something on my mind it's like my peripherals go away okay yeah so so you have pereral Vision at one point and then it goes away it could just be that you're just so focused on something that you Zone everything else out um but if it's if it if it just happens on its own and when you're not doing anything else it could be something else but if it's more that you have something on your mind you're just sort of focused on it you get you know very heavily distracted away from everything else you know that's uh that's more reassuring that there isn't anything else going on but um you there's no harm in in just getting it run by your doctor and just having them do a proper exam and make sure everything's okay and and then yeah and then just doing a line diet and uh and seeing how that can help um you know sometimes like uh you know if everything else is is going well and you're healthy and the doctors do think there's anything that um is particularly wrong that they can help with then um you know like different occupational therapist something like that maybe can help you you know um you know with different sort of exercises and tools to um you know sort of stay more in the moment and be more aware around you um that can be something that that can be helpful as well but hopefully diet helps and hopefully there's nothing else going on but you know still we getting checked out uh let's see savine thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr C I talked to a co-worker today regarding one of her relatives um having stage four breast cancer I'm very sorry to hear that they told her she would have less than five years to live would carnivore help I think that it it would there are a ketogenic carnivore diet there there is a growing body of evidence in the literature showing that ketogenic animal-based diets like a carnivore diet it doesn't have to necessarily be a carnivore diet but just a ketogenic animal fat diet because it's the animal fats that are good for you and the plant oils are not so good for you and the studies that that show the best results are the ones using meat they're eating animal fats and things like that to get into ketosis and then other other studies on ketogenics you know generally in mice you know giving a bunch of like Crisco and and hydrogenated vegetable oil which does not exist in nature and yet we're giving them to to animals and people and saying hm you know we're getting we're getting strange uh and POS possibly bad you know blood markers and biomarkers from this ketogenic diet it's just like yeah well no kidding you're giving them poison and so they're in ketosis but they're also giving them poison and so I I'm not surprised that they're getting bad results the ones that that are getting the best results are the high fat animal-based ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet um and depending on the breast cancer too that that's been more studed as well I you remember seeing a study on triple negative breast cancer responding very well to ketogenic metabolic therapy um always remember that U you know Dr OT warberg showed nearly 100 years ago that cancer is a mitochondrial metabolic disease it's not a genetic disorder uh and then Watson and CRI came along and discovered DNA and everyone just went everything's DNA well every most things are stored in the DNA but that doesn't mean that the DNA is the brain and the PowerHouse the mitochondria of the PowerHouse they're actually moving around in the cell and actually uh um you know turning things on and off and running the cell as if it were a ship the DNA and the that information that codes for is very important but it's it's um it's sort of the blueprints it's not the architect and the and the builders right the mitochondria or the workers and The Architects they're using that information and the proteins that it's producing to go and do work elsewhere in the cell now it's a bit more complex than that because the the DNA can actually you know self-control which proteins get expressed and so and so on uh but the but that's like like a chemical Dynamic and um based on gradients and other sorts of signals that that the DNA is getting uh the mitochondria actually moving around doing work and so they're very very very important and excuse me and so we have something called a warberg effect which is that cancer cells require 400 times the amount of glucose as normal cells do and so it has um you know has been shown that when you restrict glucose and sugar and you go into a ketogenic State you get your gki low your glucose Ketone index your blood sugar is low and your ketones are high that actually shows uh survival benefit in in cancers of you know all different forms I mean there's there's dozens and dozens of studies in multiple different cancers uh like dozens in each dozens of studies in in in each of these different cancers including breast cancer showing significant improvement with ketogenic metabolic therapy all the studies that show the most benefit are the ones that have the least carbohydrates so I have some that have sort of middling like is it all that much better uh whether they're having you know low carbohydrate what the hell does low carbohydrate mean it's it's ambiguous so some of them like you know below 200 grams of carbohydrates that's a low carbohydrate diet well that's intensely high from my standpoint because I don't have any carbohydrates outside of the glycogen that shows up in in meat and organs um and I don't even have them many organs you know it's really much it's really just meat um so then there's other ones about 50 grams or you know 20 grams and 10 grams and zero grams as you go down you know people tend to have better outcomes and so you keep that GK under 2.0 that's considered therapeutic and you do that from a combination of a ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet and uh potentially restricted eating you need to include organs if you're going to do that because you still need the same amount of nutrients you just want less energy coming in and and potentially fasting you know if you can't get your gki under two or even under one is is preferable uh for periods of time at least so that you can sort of have um this sort of constant pressure of of low access to energy then um you know fasting can can sometimes help that help sort of tip the balance and get you uh into that more ketogenic state so good luck to your friend um maybe show her my my interview with Professor Thomas SE freed SE YF r i d where we talk about cancer and cancer biology and it's it's pretty amazing it's it's a you know hour and 40 minutes uh long talking about you know cancer biology and it's it's my most watched long video it's like two million views nearly or maybe even hit it but that was 1.9 last time I checked and uh and then my my my lecture at uh there was a medical conference in San Diego last year uh and it was just called uh ketogenic metabolic therapy as a novel adjunct to standard of care and cancer bit of a mouthful probably not a Punchy enough name to really make it go crazy on the algorithm uh but it's a good talk and it has good good information in it anyway and um and so I would I would recommend taking a look at those and and um and seeing what she thinks and at the very least it's not going to hurt um it can help actually make chemo and radiation uh more successful by sensitizing the cancer cells to the chemone radiation and uh protecting her healthy cells from the chimone radiation as well so I would take a look at those and um and maybe show them to her and see how she does because it's it's you know cancer is really nasty and um and you have to throw the kitchen sink at it um otherwise you know you're just sort of giving into fate and that's not it's not a good fate to give into so uh I would definitely try that it's not going to hurt her at the very least and I think it would help yes that's what the that's what the data shows anyway you know and and the thing is to you know you can talk to your doctor if your doctor has a particular feeling on oh my God don't do that you know that's a that's a discussion she can have but the vast majority of doctors that that or an oncologist that I speak to and that um patients speak to they say is there anything I can do with my diet should I change anything they say no don't worry about it eat whatever you want okay well then eat what you want and and if you feel that this is going to help you um along with that then uh you know it's worth a try and that's what more and more studies are showing to be helpful and uh and and increase survival and that's that's what we're trying to do here with things like cancer so good luck to to your friend B Roker good to see you thank you for the Super Chat why is meat the healthiest and best compared to other proteins like eggs uh what to look for when buying eggs and butter thanks for always uh answering our questions well no problem you're very welcome so uh well just you know eggs are great it's just that some people have U you know a bit of a sensitivity with them particularly with the egg whites they can cause a bit of a reaction in some people other people don't have a problem with them so eggs are great eggs have a lot of wonderful nutrients in them especially pasture raised eggs if the chicken's eating what it's supposed to eat it's going to have you know the nutrients that that are optimal for um for it and the eggs and uh and then just sometimes there's there's different proteins in egg whites that protect it from bacteria and fungus and things getting into the egg and and destroying the yolk and the and the baby chicken so that's uh that's the issu is that some people just have a problem with some of those and and particularly raw egg yolks or sorry raw egg whites the yolks seem to be fine and especially people with autoimmune issues you know they're they're much more likely to react to eggs um and so it's just just to be mindful of that but I I sort of consider eggs honorary meat you know because it's all the it's all the nutrients that you need to then turn into meat right it's going to turn into a baby chicken so it's it's all the nutrients that that are needed for that uh new new life to come into existence so obviously it's a lot of really good nutrients for us to continue our lives U because that's the unfortunate reality of this uh you know world we live in which is that we're animals are heterotrophs and something has we have to eat other things to uh get the nutrients and energy that we need we can't get it from you know mineral sources and sunlight it would be pretty cool if we could you know that would make space travel a lot easier wouldn't it but um unfortunately we something's got to die for us to live and that's just life you know you know the cycle of death and rebirth and this is something that people have been in tune with for as long as humans have been humans and so it's um uh yeah so a bit of a bit of a tangent there but uh eggs are great um you know red meat you know is the ruminant meat they typically well they they are able to ferment and break down and uh the different toxins and extract more nutrients than other animals are and so they they tend to be have a higher concentration of nutrients especially grass-fed and finished ones they just have a higher concentration of these nutrients but it doesn't mean but so objectively there's a difference there but that doesn't necessarily mean the others are bad it's just some are just the best and some are really really good but you know eggs are really really good and so I wouldn't worry about that um for when you're looking for buying eggs you want pasture raised eggs that should is supposed to mean that they're actually out on grass eating whatever they eat now they could be given corn and feed and all that sort of stuff but they're supposed to be giving that out on the grass where they could be eating worms and bugs and things like that and and hopefully they are they uh if they're done right and that sort of regenerative fashion where they're out eating bugs and things like that um they're much more nutritious and I think Joel salad talked about his eggs uh done that way um compared to USD eggs so there was like a USDA egg had something like 41 milligrams of folate in it but his eggs had over a thousand so there's a big difference in the amount of nutrients there so you look for pasture raised eggs um you get them from a farm that you know how they raise their chickens preferably or have your own chickens that are just eating whatever the hell they find preferably and um and then butter grass-fed butter you want to get grass-fed butter and um it usually going to be a deep dark yellow and that's going to have a better complement of nutrients as well and DHA EPA and and the other fats and cholesterols that you want in a good ratio as well so that's what you look for Gage Scott thank you very much for the Super Chat should I push past the hunger pings or should I always eat when I'm hungry well it depends on your situation you know if you're stuck at work you don't really have access to something you know it's it's fine to wait until later as long as you're getting enough if you're getting a lot of hunger pangs could be that you're just going through withdrawals and your and your body is just going hey what's going on here and it's just sort of a bit of a Readjustment period um and that that should go away or could be that you're not eating enough at the times that you are eating so when you do eat just make sure you're eating very fatty meat and you keep eating until it stops tasting good and um then typically you won't be at uh very hungry for you know 24 hours sometimes I often will if I'm eating enough I will often eat just once a day if I'm not eating enough in one go then that's usually twice a day but if I if I get enough it's it's just just once a day uh as long as I'm I'm sedentary if I'm if I'm working out and more active then that goes up you know then I I'll eat two big meals and um as opposed to one big meal and that's and then I I put on muscle very very easily doing that so you know if it's if it's in the middle of the day it's not really convenient to eat then you know you can wait until you get home or or to a situation that's more convenient but if your body's really telling you to eat meat you know you should eat meat if it if you get a bit tired and lethargic after you eat a big meal then just try to eat about you know you know half of that just sort of take the edge off and um you know get you through to when you can finish your day and finish your workout if you're working out and then and then uh get to a point where you can you know eat your fil and not worry about feeling uh tired or lethargic and um yeah that's pretty much it you know but uh yeah if you're if you're working out and your body's saying hey you know we need more food or you know you were a bit underweight to start and your body wants to put on weight you typically will need to eat twice a day and and you know a decent amount um I mean I know people that were recovering from anorexia uh you know small women that were recovering from anorexia that were eating like 8,000 calories a day and there were still small women at the end of it but they had put on you know good healthy weight lean body mass uh muscle and and bone density which is very important because um this lady that I interviewed um she uh named Claire and people can find that you know she was recovering from anorexia and she was she had a BMI of six you know she was extremely malnourished she was vegan and um used veganism to hide her anorexia she said oh oh it's not vegan I can't eat so I just won't eat and um you know so she used that to hide it um and she was uh very sick and very very sick and um excuse me she's very sick and when she was recovering she was eating like 8,000 calories a day and um that's just what her body needed so just listen to your body eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and when you're hungry you can eat um if it's if it's inconvenient and you need to eat sometime later it's okay you know just drink water and um you know you should be should be fine but uh no if your body's asking for food I would give it food give it the right food give it meat Lena thank you very much for the Super Chat carnivore for six months uh but still see uh rosacea any tips um okay so it well yeah different sort of skin issues can take can take a while you really want to be try Li and diet just fatty red meat and water try to get a lot of fat you know like two grams of fat to one gram of protein I see that more and more when people are having sort of skin issues even like you know acne breakouts you know even just like a little spot here and there and they they really up the fat it it actually can help clear up their their um skin issues so um try that and try tallow as a moisturizer just a straight up cooking towel or you can get you know ones that are that are prepared and have you a bit of other stuff in it to make it easier to spread and so on uh from you know my sponsor for this show is H Stone and spear Tallow and uh and skincare so that should be a link for that in here and um and and you can buy things there or you just you you know just straight up cooking Tallow but uh they have a lot of good products that are that are quite clean I use like they have I use their soap and their and their skin care sort of stuff it's just straight up Tallow it's like unscented um soap Tallow soap and you know Tallow skin moisturizer body and face and all that sort of stuff so that can help I've certainly seen a lot of people with psoriasis improve that dramatically um by putting on Tallow just just using towels or moisturizer either way like you will never have better skin than uh when you use tow as a moist moisturizer it is amazing for the skin and so you know whether you just use cooking Tallow or you you you do stone and spear or whatever uh you know just use animal fat on your skin and you'll you will be uh you'll be very happy you did so there's another question from Lena uh thank you again for the Super Chat what's your take on the Sun or sunburns on aging skin well I think it's actually important to get out in the sun you know we're not we're not trog IES we didn't grow up in caves you know like we're terrestrial animals and just like other terrestrial animals we were you know made to be out in the sun you can definitely overdo it you can damage your skin and that can cause uh you know Burns and all that sort of stuff but it's it's so much harder to get burned uh when you're on a carnivore diet because he you're just bringing a lot less inflammation you have ketones that are up that reduce inflammation even more most importantly you are not eating plant toxin that expressly make you more sensitive to UV light there are different kinds of toxins that do this there's an entire class of plant toxin called furano cumerin that the entire body of plant toxins they they all they do is just damage your body in the Sun and they when UV light hits them they irreversibly bind to proteins and DNA and Destroy them and damage them and this is when you get permanent damage and you get burned and your skin has to peel off because body's like nope these cells are destroyed we got to get rid of them and so that's that's from Fano cumerin I mean you can overdo it and and and damage your skin to the point that of no return and it just has to Slough off but it's much more difficult when you're eating things with fanin and you're eating other plant toxins increase inflammation but you know make you light sensitive in particular uh you will just burn much more easily because you get much more permanent damage much more easily and so this is something this is not just this is did not just come out of of of nowhere um this this is actually recognized in dermatology it's called phy photo dermat dermatitis so phyto coming from Plants photo and the sun dermatitis skin damage right so you get these plant toxins that combine with the sun to damage your skin and cause a dermatitis there's celery dermatitis um and um so celery has e fanic cumarin par SS do all citrus do so the idea that well fruit don't have any toxins is not true uh they particularly have particularly heavy in 3on or cumin this is why you can't take certain medications with grapefruit because the fanin in those grapefruit will have to get detoxified by the liver so hey there's is that word toxin it's getting detoxified therefore it is a toxin right that's just a definition in terms and that takes up enzymes that also metabolize certain medications and so then you run out of that enzyme and you can't metabolize your medications properly you get problems uh to do with that and so uh and you know thinking about you know grapes and U avocados just on the fruit topic you know we eat these things okay well those obviously are good for you well actually they'll kill cats and dogs why do they kill cats and dogs because there's toxins in them that are toxic and life-threatening to cats and dogs so that means there toxins in it it just means that we're better able to weather those toxins than dogs and cats are but there's still toxins in there so I I think it's really important to get out in the sun I think it's still important to understand what your limits are but I I I get I did a a video on um YouTube and and um and Instagram talking about the Sun and getting out in the sun and all the different benefits of it you know the UVA UV B they stimulate different biochemical processes in your body they're actually really important and um and so it's uh it's good to get out in the sun and uh and so many people other people say hey I'm I'm a natural red head and I've never been able to T I've only freckled and burned and now for the first time I'm actually getting tan and not freckling or burning amazing and so you know it's it's a very different story when you're eating a proper diet which again sort of is further evidence that this is a proper diet you know our body just works better and you can go out in the sun and you can you can um get much more use out of it but the idea that we just we just walk in the stun we just Scorch and burn like vampires it makes no damn sense you know we should be should be able to be out in the sun and be very healthy because we need to be in the sun where you get um you know vitamin D uh you UVA actually stimulates nitric oxide stimulates that goes into your retina stimulates your brain to grow and make new new connections and can improve our blood pressure our blood flow reduce clotting I mean this is is amazing what the sun can do real important tip your bre your body and UVB stimulates um vitamin D right vitamin D gets made on the surface of your skin as a UV protectant that's your own body's natural UV blocking and that's another thing too when you're eating properly and you have a proper and you actually have cholesterol in your body you can actually make vitamin D and your other hormones right vitamin D is a hormone and so you make vitamin D on the surface of your skin as a UV protectant and uh and then you actually it actually takes hours and hours and hours for this to soak in because you're going out in the morning okay we're going to make some vitamin D now to protect us from the Sun all day because it's expecting you to be in the sun all day and then sort of six eight 10 hours later it starts absorbing into your skin and into your body and you actually start using it as a hormone and if you go in the sun and you get sweaty and you go take a shower and you wash it off you'll wash off all that vitamin D and we've actually known that since the 1920s we did studies in humans in 1927 where I scraped off the sebum that um the oils on the skin that body naturally produces where the vitamin D is in it's fat soluble and scraped that off and gave that to mice with rickets which is a vitamin D deficiency cured the mice with rickets cured the rickets right and so it's just like okay so that's on the surface of the skin in the sebum right so it takes a while to absorb and and some Studies have suggested that for full absorption it can take up to 48 hours to absorb all of that in so I'm not saying that you don't shower uh for 48 hours after you go in the Sun but I am saying uh to try not to shower for a good six to8 hours after you go in the sun and and that can help as well and but you know you can overdo it for me overdoing it was two weeks straight uh near the equator in Australia uh in the summer with my shirt off all day every day from dawn to dusk and um and uh at the end of it I was pretty damn red and um and I turned into a tan but I got a bit of flaking on my nose and on my shoulder tips that's it you know I put Tallow on I always you because if you if your Skin's dry it's it can actually get damaged more easily but I put you know Tallow on every single day I was just glowing and then I kept putting Tallow on after that to keep my skin uh more moist and healthy and I did bit of flaking dry skin bit on my shoulder tips bit on my nose no sunscreen no sunblock anything like that just Tallow and that was that was you know that was being up in X mouth and Kini uh which you know Parts up in Northern Western Australia uh in the blazing sun in the middle of the summer and for two weeks solid solid and and that's all that's all that happened so you know it's um it's dramatically different okay let me see here okay A little hello from Little Ellie Melly very nice to see you Ellie and thank you for the Super Chat very sweet of you uh El says uh hello thank you for everything you do uh to help me and many others you're very generous at your time we all appreciate you the best well you're very sweet and I appreciate that and I'm glad that that's helpful and I'm always glad to help you and everybody else so thank you very much for that very sweet and polish Mike good to see you Mike um plats are trying to kill us uh government is trying to starve us animals are trying to feed us well there that yes that's true uh shortage of meat and eggs at the Olympics thoughts yeah absolutely it's um you know they're trying to push this you know sort of agenda you know on people and it's um you know and and you know game changers can can say whatever they say all the elite athletes just but you know the all the elite athletes in the world I'm sure they're some that are plant-based or eat more plants and veggies and all that sort of stuff um at the Olympics you know there's always exceptions to the rule but um you even just eating more cleanly and not eating a bunch of junk food is going to be benefit um I think there's like a fencer that's like plant-based you know but that that's that's a skilled position that some the person's been doing uh you know working on that skill for their whole life you know that's um you know diet has a lot to do with how much dedication and concentration can go into that but how long have they been plant-based how long have they been uh doing that and how long um have they been fencing you know some people are just you know very skilled at that you know but doing you know long drawn out intensive exercises it's different and so a lot of people at the Olympics they were just saying absolutely not you know we're not doing this and so I think the Australian um tennis team just said screw it we're leaving the Olympic Village we're not we're not staying here and they actually went out to you know just get hotels and and get their own food like we're not we're not eating this and um you know like the heavyweight uh boxer I think from Australia as well does like 6'8 and like 110 kilos and which is like 240 pounds so you know trim taller guy you know I'm I'm 105 kilos I'm 63 so um you know it's uh but that's a big guy that's a big guy and they're saying no you're limited to two chops that's it that's all you get and he's just like um no I need more than that and so you know the Olympics are getting a lot of backlash for that and they started uh you know drawing in like thousands of pounds of meat uh more a day is is so because the the athletes are just leaving they're like we're not staying here we're not dealing with these conditions and apparently like the beds are like made out of Styrofoam or something like that they're just like completely uncomfortable and horrible so they're just like yeah we're not we're not we're not living under these conditions like you know these These are these are the the best athletes in the world in their in their um sport trying to compete against all the other best athletes in the world to see who is the best um in this competition and uh you can't do that in um really crappy situations you know you're trying to get the best performance of your life under you know very subpar conditions so um they're getting a lot of backlash for that and I think that's good I think it's good that they're getting public backlash and people are just saying No this doesn't work like we need meat like meat is is uh important and they're not getting the performance uh that they wanted apparently like the swimming um they've been getting uh pretty you know average sort of times and people are just not having good performances they're saying like yeah we don't think it's a slow pool it's like you it's thick water or something like that uh it's just that you know people aren't uh able to to perform at their to their best ability because they're getting substandard nutrition they're getting this ideology foed on them and they're they're not able to perform and they're just and they're pushing back and they're saying no you know we're not doing this anymore and they're having they're having their own meals brought in and uh and sometimes they're leaving the Olympic Village and just saying screw this you know we're not we're not staying here you know I mean you look at you look at uh you know lonel Messi you know when Argentina when they won the you know the World Cup uh he he had shipped in to the World Cup 6,000 lbs of beef right um because it was just like no we're not we're not taking a chance on not having the right amount of food 6,000 pounds I mean that's a massive amount I I I I wonder how much of that they used I you know but you you go back you go back to um um oh God what was his name just you know one of the world's best soccer players um god what the hell is his name I was after p and they say oh this is the next p he's like I don't want to be the next p i want to be the next me um damn it but he anyway he was he was um captain of Argentina I think they won a couple World Cups and uh the same thing you they they just brought in thousands of pounds of meat and they were just grilling up and barbecuing just tons of meat um and that that's what they did I mean this is the original Olympic games that's what they would do they would just eat tons and tons of meat leading up to it and then you the games you you You' win You' win cows and sheep and that that was part of the prizes was more meat so you know it's um it's very strange that they're doing this but it's actually I think it's I think it's probably a net positive for the world to see that try to push this ideology and have it fall flat on its face so people can just be like yeah that doesn't work and so you know hopefully some good will come out of that but I feel bad for the athletes that have worked their entire life for this and and are having their their performance uh you know lessened by the um or nutrition that they're being provided at the uh the uh at the Olympics so I feel bad for them but hopefully they they sort that out and people can get back on track Matt sherlin thank you very much for the super chat um hold on sorry I'm just G to see something here um meridana yeah that's what it is yeah thank you for that uh meridana yeah meridana um was captain of Argentina I think for like three World Cups maybe and he was just a brilliant player and that's what they hate you know you watch the the documentary on on meridon and like when they were they were going to um world cup and everything like that that's what they're doing they just had big chunks of meat on the grill and they just Grill these things up they just have a team Grill session you know um every every meal and um you know they they did great and Messi followed suit and had the same result you know that's obviously there's a lot more that goes into winning a World Cup but um that's a big part you know if you're not if you're not properly nourished and your body's not working properly you're not recovering you're not able to perform at your best you know you're not going to do as well as you could have and that's that's important when you're playing at that level so Matt sherlin thank you thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat I appreciate it h thank you what is the connection between carnivore and reducing heart attack risk I'm a 50-year-old male strict carnivore for 6 months and keep hearing about men younger than me having heart attacks yeah it's it's very concerning isn't it and um you know when you consider the fact that the first heart attack diagnosed and confirmed on autopsy in America was in 1912 and there wasn't a single case reported in the literature uh confirmed on autopsy of someone dying from a heart attack that and uh you have to sort of wonder why the hell that is and why 10 years later became one of the biggest killers and then few years after that became the number one killer in America even though we're eating the least amount of meat in America than we were in 200 years before or since and so in the 1800s we're eating far more meat oh people are only living to their 30s well people in their 30s have heart attacks now people in their 20s have heart attacks now my friend Dr Anor Verma is an ER physician in India and they eat three kilos of meat per person per year on average and he's seeing 17-year-old vegetarian kids coming into the hospital with a heart attack the hell is that so people just 17's not old enough I guess um it's it's it's pretty wild uh what people the mental gymnastics that people can do to deny reality in front of their faces the average like expectancy from birth in 1850 was 38 but the average life expectancy from Agee 10 years old if you made it to 10 was 56 so and when you get to 20 at 66 and so on so if you get into adulthood and middle age you lived as long or longer than people do now and so it's just that the childhood mortality rate was very high and and early early deaths were high because it's you know it was a hard life you know we have it pretty piss easy now in the west you know you go out go to Bangladesh and uh you know go go see how they live not even in the refugee camps where I was working just go see rural Bangladesh or even Urban Bangladesh the vast majority of people are living under very different conditions than than we are and they have a life expectancy to uh compare that to India their average life expectancy from birth is around 60 60 something right and they're all vegetarians well wouldn't that mean that you know uh that uh you know being vegetarian is BET all well but there's infant morality and there's this and there's oh okay so now now there's a distinction but not when it goes the other way so um why does you know what's the connection between carnivore and reducing heart attacks where well the simple thing is is that you're you're removing out things that can be causative you know I mean cigarettes smoking um nicotine can cause damage to the artery lining diabetes causes Dam damage to the lining of your arteries through glycation you're going to keep your blood sugar down you're going to keep your insulin down and high fat meat-based ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet have been shown in clinical trials in humans to reverse type 2 diabetes that's one the biggest risk factors for developing heart attack and heart disease and stroke and um so that would be diabetes metabolic syndrome both of which have been shown to be reversible with ketogenic um high fat ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet and people all around the world are reversing their diabetes with by going on a high fat carnivore diet uh that is ketogenic and getting rid of seed oils and these things these Industrial Products that have never existed in nature ever and um then you when you cook with them they can make uh trans fats they can they can partially hydrogenate and you make um trans fats that are extremely toxic they don't exist in nature either and um you know that's why these things are illegal now because it's such a high risk of developing heart disease and and other sorts of health issues and when you cook with these plant oils they you know uh they can turn into uh trans fats so that's not good you don't want those but I mean the the the plant oils themselves um can be harmful as well so you're just eliminating out all these different things and so it's an Elimination Diet you're just just cutting out things that are bad for you so it's like you know what what is the connection between you know um not drinking alcohol and doing drugs and certain Health outcomes well you're just not doing drugs and drinking alcohol which damage your body and can precipitate these health issues same thing with cornivore you're just eating what humans have been eating since humans have been humans and so your body's just going to work normally and you're not bringing in all these other sorts of harmful additives um and for those who said that you know people died in their 30s you know before the 20th century just remind them that since the 1700s the minimum required age to run for president of the United States was 35 minimum right and you look at all the founding fathers all these like white-haired old men usually wearing wigs because they lost all their hair right so tell me again how we only living to be uh 35 again so um you know John Adams was born in the mid 1700s and he uh was 92 years old when he died Jefferson I think was 6 was 84 and um uh Washington was in his late 60s and then he you know caught pneumonia working out in the field and just getting soaked wet and um and decided not to change because he didn't want to be late to dinner he was very punctual it was just all about gent gentlemanly manners and and um that was very important to him and um you know it costed him he got bad pneumonia and um pneumonia and he got very sick and he ended up dying probably from all the things that they were doing at the time you know all the blood letting and cupping and all that sort of stuff and it was weeks and weeks and weeks before he died uh but yeah he unfortunately died so you know unless something killed them they they lived to be in their 80s and 90s for you know centuries you know and so and yet there were no heart attacks and strokes confirmed on autopsy in America before 1912 and then in the 1920s it's massively increased in the 1930s it's the number one killer in America and it stayed that way and it just sort of kept going up and um you know now the prevalence and incidence the new heart attacks people having their first heart attack is getting more and more um common so you know in the in the 19 you know so you know liars and people that are trying to purposefully mislead you will use this line um that uh that the cardiovascular mortality rate peaked in the 60s and 70s and then started coming down right when we started you know going away from eating meat and fat cholesterol and and putting people on statins but that's not what we said said the rate the incidence the the you know the how common heart disease was and how common heart attacks was went up and increased dramatically actually and worldwide deaths have increased dramatically as well uh just in America the mortality and these are age adjusted numbers always remember that age adjusted means they've changed the numbers and you you know you have to you have to sort of say well what did you change them to what are the raw numbers so don't age adjust them why the hell you age adjusting them just tell me how many people have had a heart attack how many people have died from a heart attack they don't tell you that they only tell you the age adjust it is almost impossible to find the un uh unage adjusted numbers I actually haven't been able to find the non-age adjusted um mortality cardiovascular mortality I have not been able to find them and I've had um you know research assistants and and other people that have not been able to find them either it's very difficult it's almost as if someone doesn't want you to see them um so but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the prevalence we're talking about the incidence we're talking about the percentage of people in society that have heart disease we're talking about the the how many people a year get diagnosed with heart disease well that's just screening that's just better Diagnostics okay what about first-time heart attacks that's going up too so the number of people having their first heart attack and surviving is going up we have better interventions we have better access to Medical Care we have way lower smoking rates in the 1920s and before when heart heart disease almost didn't exist 80% of men smoked right and so now it's far less than that and yet we have a far higher rate of heart disease and uh and deaths from heart disease actually then in the 1920s when it was 80% uh male smoking rate so you me this is back when they were like telling athletes you should smoke because it opens up your lungs and gets your your cardiovascular system going uh just crazy but it um it it is the case that the first people having their first heart attacks is going up so why is that since we're reducing we've reduced red meat by over a third reduced fat saturated fat and cholesterol by the same in increased fruits and vegetables by 30 and 40% increased heart healthy grains increased um heart healthy uh unsaturated vegetable oils by over threefold and um and replaced uh you know these calories that you're you're missing out from animal fats with uh plant oils and sugar you know and sugar is supposed to be not bad for it's not supposed to cause heart disease but then why the hell is heart disease increasing why are people having more heart attacks why are people all around the world dying of heart attacks and strokes more than they ever were before and that that and those worldwide statistics you can get and those are increasing and the deaths from cardiovascular disease is increasing beyond the rate of population growth around the world right so you're out stripping just how how how many people are out there right so it's not just wrong numbers it's percentage of the population is going up and up and up and like I said in India there are some of the sickest people and most metabolically sick people they have some of the highest rates of diabetes they're all plant-based right and the traditional you know vegetarian Indian diet like I said you know my my friend Dr anchor Verma he's treating 17-year-old kids vegetarians that are having heart attacks 26-year-old lady came in had stroke this is crazy I mean you're destroying the potential that this person had for their whole life you're just destroying an entire life and um and and then people are just try oh it's the meat it can't be the meat because um or not not the meat alone anyway because these people don't eat meat you know three three kilos of meat per year and 20 years ago they were eating five kilos of meat per year and they were healthier they're worse now the the the you know diabetes rates in India for these vegetarian population is 25% and that's in urban and rural areas right and that's published in top journals a recent studies published in top journals um 25% of the population uh is type two diabetic contrast that with America when everybody says oh America they're all fat and slobby and junk food and this and that and blah blah blah and America's are just the least healthy people on Earth the diabetes rate in America is %. diabetes rate in India or they're vegetarian and all super healthy is 25% so why doesn't that show up in the blue zones right why why don't we make a movie called the anti-blue zones you have all these places that go strictly against that Blue Zone ideology and blue zones are anti-blue zones too because they they disprove their own Theory because most of them eat way more meat than they said they did um and um and they they lied on a lot of other different fronts as well but um you know you have the entire subcontinent of India oh look at this little population this how about you look at 1.4 billion people who are largely vegetarian and only eat three kilos of meat per year and see that they are the sickest people on Earth how would you look at that and um and and tell me what you think Lena thank you very much for the super chat if you eat 2,000 calories usually but burn 2,000 calories as well because you run would you have to eat uh some of that back to keep your body healthy or no you know the thing is is that your your body is way more complex than any simple um formula ever going to figure out you know you have hormonal um you have hormonal inputs you have metabolic inputs depending on what you eat you will influence your your metabolism in different ways if you eat glucose that um is you know you can use that as energy and that can stimulate your mitochondria and it gets used for energy and stored into glycogen can get stored into fat if you eat fructose that largely gets turned into fat and is actually toxic to the mitochondria so they well carbohydrates they both have four calories per gram kilo calories per gram but they have very different effects fructose blocks leptin upregulates gin those are your hunger signals makes you overeat has other sort of hormonal disruptions as well glucose will raise insulin fructose will raise insulin but actually it has a lower glycemic index so it doesn't raise your blood sugar quite as much as fast and so it won't have as much of an insulin respond as fast but it has other individual hormonal um responses as well and again blocks leptin which is ctiy hormone upregulates gillin which is the hunger hormone and uh will turn into fat largely and and causes other sorts of problems as well so a calorie is not a calorie is not a calorie so you know we just saying 2,000 calories and you're burning 2,000 calories first of all it's it's almost impossible to see exactly how much you're you're burning a day because you don't know what your basil metabolic rate is you don't know exactly how much your body is burning if you're in a ketogenic diet or in a state of ketosis you actually Studies have shown that you can actually increase your basil metabolic rate by 350 kilo calories so just by being in a state of ketosis you will you will burn energy more efficiently and you go into you increase your metabolism so you're burning more energy as opposed to raising your insulin which actually depresses your metabolism it slows your metabolism so you end up storing more than you would otherwise and so your basil metabolic rate goes down and so you're not using as much energy so it really depends on what you're eating and just like every animal in the wild we should be able to instinctually know how much to eat I have never counted calories and um even when I wasn't cardor I just didn't do it um but I tried to you know maybe restrict or something like that if I was trying to lose weight but you know just not eat as much as I was hungry for if I wasn't working out all that much and uh didn't want to put on weight or was putting on weight but if you're eating what your body's designed to eat you should be able to listen to your body signals and just like every animal if you look at every animal on Earth you know for some reason when they're eating their natural diet they just know exactly how much to eat you know so you don't see koalas uh you when they're just eating eucalyptus you know some are just like fat bloated with diabetes and like well that one just doesn't have any self-control um or willpower you know he just needs to understand whether their calories and their macros and all that sort of you know they don't have calculators not pulling out calculators to figure out what they're supposed to eat they just eat something tells them to start eating something tells them to stop eating and I find that goes by taste for us if you eat fatty meat if you're eating the right stuff and you eat which is fatty meat if you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you don't have to count calories and you're never going to be able to figure out exactly how much you you burning or doing or using or not using on a day-to-day basis how much you're actually getting in how much that that is usable and what that's doing in different ways you know protein is largely used for structural components it's not used to build energy so all that protein uh calories there aren't calories they're not getting energy from that so okay so how does that work with the equation you know so you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and your body will figure out the rest and um and you'll be fine um you know if you're taking if you're eating other things if you're eating dairy that can increase uh your hunger signals if you're eating carbs that will definitely increase your hunger signals if you're eting fructose it will even great more greatly increase your hunger signals if you're on medications such as prazone or prenolone or hydrocortisone that will increase your hunger signals so in you know in special circumstances you may need to sort of play with this maybe not eat as much as your body's telling you to but for the vast majority of people when only eating fatty meat and only drinking water you should be able to listen to your your body and just eat until it stops tasting good and uh you really need to go until you get a bite and it just goes like that kind of just tastes like cardboard I'm not too interested in this anymore and and see how you you see how you go and if you're not if you're losing more body mass than you want or you're trying to put on weight and muscle mass um you know just make sure you're eating enough throughout the day it's very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet it's very difficult to overeat because you physically don't want to do it because it starts tasting bad you're just going no I don't want to do this so it's um it's important to at least eat enough and and uh and listen to that and sort of you have to relearn your hunger signals so if you're sort of feeling a bit off or low energy or this or something okay am I hunger or getting Cravings especially for carbs or sugar say like oh am I hungry is this what hunger feels like try eating some meat or eggs if it tastes good yes you're hungry keep eating until it stops tasting good and go from there and you'll do great um vom Hondas Shepherds cool uh thank you very much for the super chat um I'm just going to see how many super chats we have here um okay maybe we'll we'll um if anybody has any sort of last minute questions they want to get you I'll stay until we finish but maybe we'll close um the super chats in about 15 minutes and um 10 15 minutes yeah and we'll close it off in yeah maybe maybe 10 minutes and so anybody has a question get them in now uh and then I'll stay till uh stay till we finish them up but then we'll cap them with that because I still have a number to go through um but any any uh questions that people want to get answered on this session just put them in now and um and we'll we'll try to get to him and but we'll cap it uh in sort of 15 minutes and um and and not do anymore after that so uh because I have to have to get finish up at some point anyway okay so question from vom thank you very much for the Super Chat 63y old female with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis was in a walker terrible pain on methat trexate and Penzone stopped all meds um pres Zone stopped all meds went carnivore on um July 1 and in remission that's amazing great job really happy to hear that um triglycerides I'm assuming 60 HDL 85 LDL uh 290 CSC score is five drct freaks out and wants me on a Statin where CSC scores five I mean that's basically nothing um so there's there's nothing really to get overly concerned about there you can always check that again in in a year or two and see what that's doing LDL is not a disease atherosclerosis is a disease and your CAC score five shows that you don't really have a burden of atherosclerosis at least not calcified now that doesn't show Soft plaque that only shows hard plaque uh but your triglycerides are very low which is great you know high triglycerides that that can cause disease that actually actually cause pancreatitis so you know that is a problem if it gets too high yours is perfect and your HDL is higher than your triglycerides which is perfect and your LDL actually shows that uh we're just seeing more and more data showing that higher LDL higher total cholesterol longer life and so this is just a just a an absolute con you know you're you've just reversed lupus and rheumatoid arthritis which I guarantee you your doctor would say is impossible and you've done it just by changing your diet and you're off medications that can cause serious damage to your body body as well so obviously our Paradigm and understanding is wrong and so you've done something very simple and you completely revolutionize your health why are we assuming that that's going to kill you by some other means those medications can those medications can cause serious disruption to your to your health and Metabolism they they can kill you eventually um you know but that's not what this is you're just eating real food and you're and these diseases are going away so why are we assuming that you know doing this and just naturally getting rid of the causes of your lupus and rheumatoid arthritis why are we saying that that is going to then cause heart disease you're improving all your health markers are improving and I would say your LDL is improving as well because that is that has never been proven never been shown in a positive to have a positive relationship with heart disease and you see it right there your LDL is 290 which is about you know three times what your doctor probably wants you to be at and your CAC score is five it's nothing you know you really don't start worrying about a CAC score until it goes over a 100 so you know if you're if you're really worried you get a get a kateed Doppler you know get a an ultrasound of your kateed that takes decades to build up you know so if you had anything there it's not just within the last year that's been there for a long time but you check that you check it again in a year or two see what happens it's getting worse okay you know then then we need to figure out what the hell's going on you know stress bad sleep other sorts of environmental toxins is it your diet you know it's not but um you know that's something that can be then then addressed you know I mean that's that's something that's worth addressing at that point right now you have one data point you have a c score of five which is you know nothing to write home about and you're feeling great and you've reversed very serious diseases that are debilitating and can be fatal and so what's the problem you know you're doing great and so um you can use this as a baseline you can check your actual objective markers your CAC score or uh you know crowed Doppler and see what's going on I have a number of patients that have been reversing their atherosclerosis this is all anecdotal but this is It's they are reversing it at a gentleman in my my patreon uh ship who had 100% uh stenosis blockage of his right cored artery and a year before he started u you know a year ago he was on Carnivore for a year and now it's pton again there's blood moving through it so it's recanalized it's actually you know passing blood now so that is reversing right so that's amazing and um you know and so and Statin you have to wonder about Statin because they've never never shown a cause and effect relationship between cholesterol and atherosclerosis so you know why are we why are we treating something that's never been proven to be an issue uh ever it's never been proven and in fact the only five studies that have ever been done they randomized control Tri it could show a cause and effect relationship when they lower saturated fat by replacing it with um unsaturated vegetable oils margarine and lowered LDL cholesterol they actually found no benefit by doing this or in two of the larger studies there were better designed more people died of heart attacks and strokes by doing that okay so they and they buried them because they knew what that showed they knew that it showed that the uh uh the cholesterol uh theory of cholesterol heart hypothesis was complete they disproved their own Theory anel Keys was involved in in the the Minnesota uh coronary experiment uh that was the largest and and best designed one of these and they buried it for 40 years it was only uncovered because the children of one of the original researchers found a box with his old stuff in it and they found the old data and so that's the only reason that we have this data there is in there isn't a single experimental study ever showing a cause and effect relationship between cholesterol and heart disease and so why are we treating it as if there were there isn't a single cause and effect relationship and maybe bring that up to your doctor and just say how do we know that there's a cause and effect relationship ship have there ever been any causitive studies that show a cause and effect relationship experimental trials randomized control trials showing a cause and effect relationship he will say yes of course there are because it would be crazy for them to be doing this sort of uh stuff if it if that weren't the case but it's not the case and um but because we've been taught to treat these numbers in the way that we are we assume that there must be a good reason for that but there's that old saying you know if you when you make an assumption you make an ass out of you and me and that that's exactly what they're doing and so you ask them is this like can you show me any any cause and effect you know randomized control trials to show a cause and effect relationship between high LDL and total cholesterol and heart disease because you know you haven't been able to find them and the only ones you found actually showed the opposite like the Minnesota coronary heart exp coronary experiment uh actually showed the opposite they had 10,000 patients uh perfectly controlled because they were in they were in institutions and so they controlled their meals you know so it's not like you just go home and Report like the nurse's study and just say hey what' you eat last year absolutely useless study and it's designed to be useless so that they can manipulate the data and say whatever the hell they want but when you do a controlled experimental trial with people that you control the meals on it dead opposite results and so it's um it is uh it is the case that there there isn't a single piece of hard evidence to show that cholesterol causes heart disease and in fact there are tons and tons and tons of larger and larger studies showing that higher LDL you live longer you you you don't die of cancer as much you don't die of infectious disease as much and U and you don't die of heart attacks as much so this is just is just a Flatout lie uh that has been perpetrated and just repeated so many times that uh it's just it's just in the Dogma but you know you ask them for evidence you say can you show me a cause and effect study a randomized control trial that shows a cause and effect relationship between LDL cholesterol total cholesterol and um or yeah LDL or total cholesterol and uh heart disease they can't do it because they don't exist the only ones that have been done showed the opposite so your doctor is very well-meaning I'm sure is and just hasn't seen the data because you know we don't get taught this in medical school uh which is which is a bit of a of a fraud honestly but um but that's that's the uh that's what the actual experimental studies show is that this is uh this is so good luck with that you're doing great keep it up keep up the good work um nav thank you very much for the Super Chat hi doc any tips for teeth grinding during sleep I think I might also have sleep apnea which could cause it well a lot of people reverse a lot of their sleep acne or improve it improve their um snoring and sleep apnea by going carnivore so you know you probably already know that and probably have gotten some benefits from that already uh the grinding of the teeth you I don't know um maybe the you just need like a mouth guard when you sleep so you're not grinding down your teeth and that can protect your teeth as well other than that other than just doing cornivore and and avoiding other things that maybe make things worse than uh you know just throwing a little mouth guard something like that sleep apnea you need a sleep study test to check that out and when people go carnivore it typically reduces a lot of inflammation in the soft tissue and the soft pallet and so there there's more uh open Airways uh that they can breath through and um and this uh generally sorts out sleep apne within a few weeks actually of going carnivore so if that hasn't happened yet or that has improved but only to a certain degree then it's um it's possible you could have deviated septum and other sorts of things that could be potentially fixed surgically that could help you breathe better U but uh sleep uh sleep study will show that too so that that might be worth getting Alice Furs thank you very much for the Super Chat uh trying to go carnivore to combat severe histamine intolerance having allergic reactions to meat eggs and dairy can you recommend an allergy specialist whose carnivore informed that's a good question um there are lists of doctors that do ketogenic stuff um like on Dr Kilts website so k l TZ so his website they have a list of doctors I mean they have to sort of self sign up so there's different doctors that sort of sign themselves up I'm pretty sure I've signed up on that one but I'm not sure I've signed up on others and um and so you can you can hopefully find someone on that um it may be that there's an allergist in your area but yeah that's sort of quite a specific field um but you might be able to find like a like a Prem care physician like a GP or family practice doctor in your area who is carnivore ketom minded and uh and and the good thing about that is that they generally have networks of people they refer to and so if they're if they're of that sort of way of thinking they're going to sort of come up with other sort of people around them in their area like you know around Perth like you know I know certain doctors that that um you know are of that way of thinking there's there's there's something called low carb Down Under you know the website low carb down under.com has a a big list of of doctors in Australia that are sort of Keto minded and uh and a lot of those would be carnivore and or at least carnivore friendly carnivore adjacent and um and so you can you could you know find different databases like that if you're in um it looks like you're in Australia so I think that's probably the best way is the low carb down under.com and look for a doctor in your area if there isn't an allergist specifically in your area try to find a GP and then uh talk to them and say hey do you know any allergists that that um you know are on board with what we're doing here and and and they might be able to point you in the right direction or at least help you help you uh search that out um as far as reactions to meat eggs and dairy I would probably start by cutting out the eggs and dairy first and foremost try going to red meat try to go to a meat that has not been aged and um yeah and start try to stick with like beef and lamb sometimes lamb is a little better for the histamine side of things they don't they don't you know hang them um uh after they you know slaughter them to sort of age them a bit uh for lambs they're usually just left and then just um uh butchered fresh and so that can be helpful as well and then you just try different different you know different meats that um that you think you can tolerate and you just stick with the ones that you can tolerate and you avoid the ones that you don't tolerate and so just a bit of self-experiment and self- selection is um is uh is pretty helpful there as well and uh yeah that's pretty much it and then you know getting um you know a doctor on the low carb down on your website that uh that you can uh go to and hopefully help you find an allergist um but I I don't personally know any allergists in Australia unfortunately or maybe anywhere yeah it's a very it's a very it's a very um Niche uh part of medicine uh but hopefully um there will be one that you can find on the low carb down under or on um or or one of the GPS can help you so hopefully but you can also do just the self experiment and I would do that too most people react um if they're reacting to things they they will often react to eggs and dairy and then the other non ruminant Meats so things besides beef and lamb and goat so I just try try doing that cut out everything except beef lamb and goat if you can get it I haven't eaten too much goat around here but you never know and um and just go with the meat that you you do the best with and hopefully you can find what works for you and uh and and don't need um yeah don't even need to get an allergist but you know hopefully hopefully you'll find one anyway all right good luck with that hopefully that helped okay easy mode RL thank you for the Super Chat took me over a year to stop craving tobacco I think ice cream is going to be the same eight months carnivore mostly red meat and seafood thanks doctor well no well you're very welcome yeah it can be you know sugar is sugar is a drug and uh really don't care what anybody says it's is 100% a drug and by the strictest medical definition of a drug [Music] and uh you know and obviously you you can keep those cravings and the addiction for quite some time um most people find that the the Cravings go away in uh two weeks or so but others it can take longer and then you're just remembering you really enjoyed this thing and that's that's uh The Habit side of it um that can be quite compelling if you getting those Cravings at eight months then it's almost always the fact that you're not eating enough and so if you're getting those Cravings just eat more fatty meat and uh and you'll feel a lot better and you'll have much less Cravings as well so um yeah very high fat eat until it stops tasting good if you ever get a carb craving or sugar craving do the same uh eat more eat more meat eat more fatty meat and and hopefully that helps okay so U Mark uh trevathan thank you very much for the Super Chat hey Doc love all that you do just wanted to swing by and say you're helping thousands well thank you very much I appreciate that been meet only for eight months been watching you the whole way thanks a lot for your hard work well thank you very much Mark I really appreciate that and I'm really glad that you're that you're doing well it's just sort you know you get a lot of you know grief from people um you know there's always this weird bizarre ass rumor that I'm not I'm not actually a doctor or an MD which is patently false and that's a Flatout lie and defamation and uh and I'm actually speaking to lores about that and uh bringing uh some suits against uh certain particular offenders who are saying this and trying to push that around because it's a lie it's a Flatout lie and it's a demonstrable lie um so uh yeah it's ridiculous you know it's like I have uh you know MD from the Royal College of Surgeons this is a a post-graduate medical degree uh that is internationally recognized and uh and accredited and and it says right there on it you know you have different letters that go with different uh with the same degree in different countries because that's that's what they do but it is an MD you know it's it's the equivalent of an MD in America in Canada and Australia and um you know it says that so the Australian government considers an MD and the American government considers an MD and the Canadian government considers an MD um so who the hell are these people to say nope nope NOP it's not it's like well you're not a governing body and you're not on the medical board and you're no one you know and so you know this particular person you know um Dr ID like the guy just barely finished intering year he only just graduated medical school in 2021 and only finished his intering year in December of 2022 and hasn't had a medical license since 2023 so he's not even a practicing doctor um he barely out of intern year immediately sold out and started doing just Tik toks and things like that presumably because he couldn't get a real job and um is now badmouthing others and spreading misinformation and Flatout slander and lies so it's um it's pretty pretty ridiculous but it's it's always nice to see you know people uh like you mark who've actually been getting helped by this and it just doesn't it just you know makes these little idiots um meaningless you know they can you know they can talk all they want but you know them saying that I'm not a you know a doctor doesn't actually take away my medical license and anybody can look that up you go to Australian um you know APPA ahp it's the the licensing body here in Australia and you just look up I'm you know know registered medical practitioner with no uh with with no marks against me with an unrestricted license so there you go and I'm currently in practice and and he is not you know you go into UK onto the UK medical registry he is not licensed he does not have a medical license he's registered with the medical board he has no license and so you know he's going around you know think people in Glass Houses really shouldn't throw stones you know he's going around saying that other people aren't doctors and he literally is not a practicing physician and he barely finished his inuring year he's going around critiquing you know people like Andrew huberman who's professor of medicine at Stanford and saying that he shouldn't be going around um you know giving advice on Dermatology because he's not a dermatologist and I swear to God he said this uh it say just like you know even even in his with his years of experience you know he would never make a video like that because he's not a dermatologist what years of experience he hasn't had years of experience he's had one year of experience as an intern which I'm sorry is just a glorified secretary and FLOTUS especially in the UK all you're doing is just all the work that the that the nurses don't want to do and you get stuck with and um and you're you're you're not a practicing physician and you don't have years of experience as a practicing physician and if you're talking about your years of medical school sorry you don't get years of Dermatology in medical school it's like a twoe onewe sometimes module and um and and you're trying to say that you have years of experience more than Andrew huberman who is a professor of medicine at Stanford who teaches medicine to doctors and you have more experience than him probably not you know that that actually is his especially his things titled Andrew huberman going outside of his um his expertise or field of of uh expertise something like that no that that that is his his field he is a professor of medicine at Stanford he teaches medicine and that's exactly what he was doing and that's exactly what he does so it's um you know it's just it's you know narcissistic behavior with delusions of grandeur he thinks that he's the the authority on everything he he can talk about things that Andrew huberman can't and he can decide what Andrew huberman gets to talk about or not even though he's not even a practicing doctor and hasn't practi hasn't had a career as a doctor ever he just had an intern year and then who knows if he even practiced after that but he hasn't had a medical license since 2023 so he had a a medical license for less than a year after his internship and so you know now he's saying that you know who you know he gets to overrule uh the American Medical Association medical Medical Board the Canadian Medical Board the Australian Med I had I had that confirmed by um app by the Australian licensing body uh because someone else tried to say oh you're not allowed to use MD and and they they brought it up with APPA and APPA said yeah no he is go away and um and so that's been confirmed by the Australian Medical Board that uh that that that's perfectly fine and the suggestion that that I'm not an MD what people take that to me and is that I'm not a doctor that I didn't go to a medical program that I did like some you know uh some certificate course and and you know uh or like an EMT or something like that um that's what that's what um him saying that has led people to believe which is funny because he calls himself board certified in lifestyle medicine but lifestyle medicine isn't a board certified um is an a board certified specialty uh I spoke with the uh the British um Association of Lifestyle medicine and they said specifically they don't offer a board certification they offer a certificate right so this is like you know it's like anywhere from 20 to 40 hours of online independent uh work that you do sometimes you do a test sometimes you don't and um and I think the largest one was like 100 hours of online work so it was just it's you know it's nothing you can pound this out in a few weeks you know and um and as a result you know he's saying that he's board certified in something which is completely misrepresenting his CR credentials because what board certified means to the entire world is that you finished a specialty training program and and then you're a consultant or you're an attending and a specialist in a certain field he's saying he's board certified he's not board certified there's no board certification so he's letting people leading people to believe that he's a trained specialist when he's barely out of entering year and um and uh there are are no board certifications for lifestyle medicine so he's being extremely misleading and um and uh basically just did a certificate course in this is now trying to say that he's he's board certified so it's uh it's it's pretty pretty ridiculous U but thank you Mark for that it's nice to see um nice to see people actually being helped and uh you know that that definitely helps um helps you you know sort of ignore the idats out there and uh and just just work on what matters which is helping people so thank you for that miss an Thorp uh says my co-workers all think I'm nuts and going to die of a heart attack meanwhile 40 pounds gone BP meds gone anxiety and depression gone well that's fantastic and and um that's a perfect add on to to this thank you so much for that that's really good to see it's just you know this works and people actually get get helped by it and so who cares what anybody else has to say thank you for that uh Lynette um inas thank you for the Super Chat looks like your question is is down here um our daughter has suspected Ms and also on a waiting list for a gallbladder problems possible gallstone uh how does she start carnivore well specifically for the MS it's it's a good idea to get on a lion diet so just red meat and water anybody with an autoimmune issue like Ms is always going to do best on just red meat and water so beef lamb and water a lot of fat especially for Ms you me that's a that's a demina disease of the axons and the nerves that come down from the from the neurons and so that's really important those are made out of fat and cholesterol and so you need fat and cholesterol and you want to be in ketosis too because ketones cross the bloodb brain barrier reconstitute into fatty acids and they make up the physical structures of your brain and so you need enough fat you need enough Tes you need enough B12 almost everybody's low on B12 um I'm assuming that the New Zealand units are the same as Australian pretty damn sure and the and the reference range can go from anywhere from like 130 to 100 to 130 to like 650 700 800 sometimes a thousand but rarely um and uh so what the hell is it where where do you want to go well and uh it's way above that anything below 400 can actually cause nerve damage and dementing on its own even without Ms and so if you have MS and you're trying to recover from these lesions and and repair the physical structures and the and the myelination of your axons you need B12 you need folate so you need liver um to make sure that you're getting enough of this because you're you're just going to be low on this so for her I would go on a a ruminant diet so beef and lamb I'd have a bit of liver you know just you know 50 grams a day for several weeks and you can bring that down to three days a week if if you want to check the B12 check the folate you'll have plenty of B12 and folate on uh if you're having liver most people will have plenty of B12 and fet just on the on the red meat but make sure you know because the depending on the quality of meat that you're getting is going to have more or less B12 and folate in it so you want to make sure you get enough and there's definitely enough in in liver of all descriptions and so uh check it again what you want to aim for for B12 is between 800 and 12 00 that's what you know we typically use as a reference range for optimal in um in our patients so uh that's what I would look at and I would make sure that she I would just do fatty red meat and water lots of fat be and ketosis um just the red meat predominantly and um make sure you're getting up B12 and vitamin D you should be getting enough from the fatty meat grass-fed butter um I'd avoid other dairies though butter being this the only thing or grass-fed ghee um if she has a problem with butter and um Dairy can definitely trigger autoimmunity and Ms as well so avoid those and uh avoid eggs too just just red meat just red meat and and grass-fed butter and or grass-fed ghee is okay as long as it's okay with her and um and see here you go and just get a lot of fat a lot of vitamin D A lot of 12 check your B12 B12 and vitamin D vitamin D you want to be between 140 and 180 and um a little above that is is probably fine too um up to 250 I've seen studies saying that that's perfectly fine even in cancer patients you try to get that up to 220 for instance and that can help so that's what I would do good luck to her um and she can just sort of jump in she doesn't have to like ease into it unless it's unless it's hard for her and she wants to ease into it uh I'd go ketogenic straight away no sugar get some liver in her check the B12 uh and so on but if she if she's able to willing and able can just jump right in I just jump right in and just go straight into it just cut all the garbage out just go beef Lam and water with a bit of liver and uh and and she'll she'll do well there are a lot of people uh putting their Ms into remission we just heard from a lady who put her lupus in to arthritis into remission without medication which is astounding um there tons of people that do it with Ms in particular too maybe somebody in this in this chat watching this video has done that so if anybody has had their experience please do share your experience with the carnivore diet and Ms in particular but any autoimmune issues uh as well because that's very helpful and hopefully um let uh you and your daughter see that so good luck to with that and good luck to her I hope she does really well uh Jeff Hardy thank you for the Super Chat 48-year-old male no type two diabetes thanks carnivore um on the 1 of January this year triglycerides are high last week went to the ER with pancreatitis uh tric wow okay so triglycerides passed 4200 two days later 350 is carnivore safe for me carnivore is vital for you because carnivore is going to um is going to you know reduce your triglycerides your triglycerides can go up for other reasons but you're at least eliminating out some of the causitive factors of triglycerides like sugar things like that Sugar carbs alcohol these sorts of things and um so that those are major major issues with triglycerides stress can jack up your triglycerides poor sleep can jack up your triglycerides so those are very important to address as well you know 4200 that's that's abnormally high and so you know there's something there's probably something else going along there with it but um it's but Carnival yeah I I think it's it would be very important because you know then please people do you know share in the comments in the live chat and in the comments as well um what your tricer has done people you know invariably see you as long they get their stress and their sleep on point as well their triglycerides come down massively and their HDL go up as well when they go on a carnivore diet there are a few odd people that still have you know trigly of like 200 300 or something like that when they go on this but they have but these are the people that are super high stressed very poor sleep all that sort of stuff and then when they get out of that stressful situation be able to to you know fix their stress and their sleep that just comes right down so uh it's you know you're not going to get 4,200 uh from something like that I mean I I've never heard of anybody in in uh in extremely stressful situations or you know poor sleep getting that you know there's something else going on there too but it's it's not carnivore yeah I do think carnivore is safe uh in this circumstance I think it's actually probably going to really be helpful because it's going to eliminate out a lot of the causes of high triglycerides and should help lower your triglyceride level as well so good luck with that you know that's quite scary but I'm glad you're doing glad you're doing better good luck uh Lisa C thank you very much for the generous Super Chat it's very kind of you uh thank you Dr C in honor of your amazing sister rosn uh will you please say some encouraging words to my sister Amy who is five weeks into carnivore thanks again well thank you very much Lisa I appreciate that and you are welcome uh so well Amy congratulations you know good I'm I'm really glad that you started carnivore it's um you know it it takes a lot of uh courage to try to change um uh you know change your diet dramatically and try something new hopefully you're feeling better but you know like a so many other people know this is something that can really revolutionize your life and your health and improve things in many ways so um you know just keep going with it you're sort of getting into that really sweet SP spot where you're got all this garbage out of your system and you start feeling better and better and better and your body composition is going to start changing uh more rapidly you're going to start feeling better and better going to have less and less Cravings if you do have cravings just eat more fatty meat and and um yeah and so you're going to be getting into you know some of the more uh exciting times of going carnivore which is just just going to feel like a superhuman better than you ever have in your life so it's going to get better and better from here so you know that's something to look forward to make sure you're eating enough make sure you're getting enough sleep make sure you're addressing stress as as well as you can and um and you should be doing uh better and better as you go um just going to do one thing sorry the cat wants to go out just going to let him out real quick okay so yeah so hopefully that that's that's encouraging but you know but but seriously like you're you're getting into the most uh beneficial time or the most dramatically a different time where you to see these massive massive changes in your body and in your health and um and so it's a very exciting time so I'm sure you'll just get um uh you'll sort of be really excited with with um how you go I think there was something in the chat about I'm wanting a childhood story about me and rosin I can't really think of any right now um but probably need a subject like a to remind me of something but um yeah I I can't think of anything at the moment but if I think of something uh appropriate for to share with the public then I will I will do that but um but either way good luck with that and um I'm sure you do great so question from John Basset thank you for the Super Chat question is down here it says I was planning to ask how to reduce triglycerides on Carnivore uh two months in and they keep Rising uh A1C remains 5.5 so yeah so the the only times I really see that are when people are are not getting adequate sleep they're averaging you know less than you know seven hours of sleep at night you're doing that consistently um you know if you if you average four to five hours of sleep a night for just seven days in a row you will give yourself diabetes or pre-diabetes I should say um but getting 7 to eight hours of sleep after that for at least seven nights can actually verse that so sleep is extremely important also stress so your stress levels can be uh very important for your triglycerides as well and it can give you sort of a derangement to your cholesterol panel so you can get high triglycerides low htl and you get that pattern B type of LDL which isn't which isn't great is that causing a problem I doubt it uh but it's uh I think more of this is smoke and not the fire it's a it's a sign that something else is going wrong in your body and so um other other damage can happen so it's um it's uh important to to address all those things and um and if you're able to uh address the stress and and address the Sleep properly you should start to see your uh your trackless RS start to come down and again you know when when you're you can give you pre-diabetes if you're not sleeping properly you're getting stressed and that will affect your A1C uh I I wouldn't worry too much about the A1C because that that's sort of is really blunt instrument it's um you know you it presumes that your that your red blood cells before were living three months where they could have been living two two and a half months if you were less healthy and it's presuming that you're still living only they're still only living three months where they could be living three and a half four months because you're more healthy so you're you're just sort of comparing apples and oranges I would I would more go on your daily um blood prick levels and um and and see how your actual blood sugar is doing and um you know so hb1c is more of a marker for doctors to sort of see like are you really keeping your blood sugar and oh yeah know I check it all the time it's it's in the 80s and it's like is it though you know because you know compliance is an issue and and people you know misreporting what they um what they're finding their doctor is a real thing so it's uh it's important to uh sort of have something they can gauge this but you know for your purposes since you know you're only you don't need to lie to yourself and you're not going to fool yourself too far uh you want to check your blood sugar and if your blood sugar is just 75 75 75 75 75 your your hba1c is not indicating what what your blood sugar actually is on average so I wouldn't worry about it um but you know if you are stressed out and you are uh raising your cortisol you will be raising your blood sugar as well and that can raise your A1C and so just be mindful of that so that that's what I would address is is the uh stress and sleep those are most commonly uh the the problem when people have uh stubborn trag Lites um early on good luck with that um gu question from E so ear Dr chaffy I'm 43y old male with dysemia minor I lived uh with this my whole life haven't had much issues some fatigue sometimes new to carnivore 40 days in can go in carnivore help or hinder this it's not going to hurt it I have a number of patients with phemia various phcas um and they they all do fine it's um you know remains to be seen how much that affects it and uh from a positive manner I've certainly on serial Bloods I've never seen it get worse I have seen some of them get a bit better didn't I could just completely resolve it but they uh some of them were were you know less anemic or had you know you know some my borderline anemic now they're less borderline anemic those sorts of things um I I don't think it's going to completely do away with the phemia it's certainly not going to hurt it though and uh can can potentially help because you're just getting all the different sorts of things that you need you if you don't have enough B12 you're not going to be making uh your blood cells as well anyway almost everyone is low on B12 you don't have to have zero B12 to start getting uh to low blood levels you I see people that have you know their B12 level of of you know like you know 3400 and uh even 500 and uh and they're just sort of slightly lower on the on their blood numbers then you you fix their B12 all of a sudden just just pops right back up great you know so you know people weren't necessarily floridly anemic um but you you don't need to be you just need to have less than than um than your body actually wants and if you have something like phemia obviously you're working behind the eightball anyway and so you just need to optimize things so it's not going to hurt it definitely not going to hurt and it can definitely help as well and just by simply getting all the nutrients that you need even if it does nothing else that's still going to improve things so good luck with that um Lena thank you for the Super Chat what's the science behind more fat uh shaping women's body differently uh does this only happen if you gain weight in general um just trying to understand that question properly the size behind more fat shaping women's body differently I'm I'm ass I'm guessing what you're mean there's like different fat distributions on male and female bodies um and how that that affects things well you know there's different hormones that can affect that you know cortisol can affect things different you sort of get that that Central osity um you know and then if you have you know different amounts of you know testosterone or estrogen you can deposit fat in different areas and this is typically why um you see sort of different fat distributions on men versus women and that's for hormonal reasons um but um I'm trying to understand does this only happen if you gain weight in general I may not be understanding your question uh completely but you know there are different distributions fat distributions uh in in men and women and different sort of hormonal patterns and so you know if you see someone uh sort of depositing fat in a certain way could be because they have too high of cortisol could be that they have something else that's that's going wrong and um and so you know but the at the end of the story at the end of the day when you're just uh when you're just eating fatty meat and only drinking water your body's going to normalize your your hormones and um you know for for any person so men and women you'll just it's not just going to give you a whole bunch of testosterone it's not going to just give you whole bunch of estrogen it's G it's going to uh optimize your hormones uh for you as an individual whatever your your genes and genetics uh dictate is is optimal um and so that should go with weight weight loss and gain too you should you should sort of lose these you know stubborn areas of fat sometimes it takes a bit longer than others um and then exercising is uh is very important too okay so is saying because I hear the more butter you eat makes you have bigger proportions on a woman I haven't heard that um I I don't know why that would be one way or the other I mean if you're eating more fat in general you're going to improve your hormones in particular and so that could help you know the the different hormone distribution that we have um dictate our secondary sexual characteristics such as the sort of broader shoulders and men and the narrower waist for getting that vshape uh vitamin D is very important for that so if you don't have enough vitamin D during adolescence you'll have men will have more trout shoulders and uh and women will be more stick-like as well so they won't have that curvy hourglass figure that's the classical you know female form that's that's vitamin D that's that's in hormones you know so it's um vitamin D is a major part of that you know vitamin D is a hormone and so uh when you're eating enough fat and you're getting enough cholesterol and you're getting enough um you know hormones you're going to you're going to and vitamin D and then you're you're going to distinguish out into those into those forms how much does that help when we're an adult not as much as when you're an adolescent you know because your bones are solid now and so you might put on little bits of fatty deposits and muscles and this and the other but the hips and the structures the waist and all that sort of stuff are already formed and probably not going to to change all that much but you know you never know it could change a little bit anyway but the bones aren't going to really change if the growth plates are closed um but uh you know it's probably a hormonal thing you know with the butter but that's just going to be fat in general and you just want enough hormones and so you know as far as fat deposition I mean it's just got to help you just put on healthy weight in general and sometimes people are underweight and they don't have enough fat you do need some uh subcutaneous fat it's actually healthy and so eating those sorts of things can can just get you the right amount and the right proportions hopefully and getting enough butter and enough fat is um is important to do that so hopefully that sort of answered your question um but still feel that it probably didn't but hopefully it did and then uh to Joe um seven again uh thank you for the Super Chat donation you get uh send by chaffy um meet directorate sure M7 mv7 and Mike uh yeah I'll I'll look into that thank you for that Hugh Thomas thank you for the super chat um potassium on Carnivore how can one get uh 400 uh 4500 milligrams in the RDA well first of all is the RDA actually um you know something that we need to worry all that much about probably not um the rdas came up at a time when when everyone was um eating a mixed diet and so you don't actually know because you get all these anti-nutrients that bind to minerals and electrolytes and you have high ins um you have excessive uh insulin insulin resistance that's going to make you uh that's going to change the amount of of electrolytes that you uh that you need that you need to store on to all these different sorts of things so um you know you get you get plenty of potassium like I never seen anybody have consistently low potassium I had I saw one guy who checked his pottassium he was completely fine I had no symptoms and his potassium was just very slightly lower than the reference range I just said oh look just check it again it just could be a lab error checked it again right in the middle of the range so you know who knows what that was about but um it went away anyway and he was asymptomatic so I don't see people actually getting low potassium and so I don't think you necessarily need to chase that number what you need to do is check your own potassium and if you're low on potassium get more potassium um you know the different organs have more nutrient density and um and uh you know blood products have a lot of potassium electrolytes in them as well and you know for some reason you know like when you're first going on a carnivore diet or any sort of ketogenic diet and your insulin starts going down that can you can spill out more electrolytes than you would before and your body needs to readjust it so you know sometimes you get a bit of electrolyte disturbance early on that that typically normalizes and uh but just check you know if you're early on in the game and you're sort of spilling out a bit more electrolytes than you uh than your body wants then you know you might take some potassium salts and things like that and some of the electrolyte supplements but typically people don't need to do this long term I've never taken those things I know the majority of people don't take those things sometimes we'll get you know the keto flu some people think that that's you know sort of low electrolytes causing a bit of low blood pressure and feeling a bit bit gross because of it and it goes away I mean people talk about the keto flu last about two three weeks okay so if if that is an electric disturbance it's only lasting 2 3 weeks and uh so just check if you have normal potassium then however much much you're getting is how much you need because you know you're right in the right range so don't worry about it unless you are out of range supplement if you have to you know especially in that early those early days when your when your insulin is adjusting down and your kidneys are compensating for that now reduction in insulin which it will do because it had to compensate it for in the other Direction had to compensate it um uh when your insulin was going up we weren't born with high insulin we weren't born with insulin resistance and so over years and decades your your kidneys were able to adapt and adjust to the excessive amounts of insulin and um and uh that's why it's now overcompensating so then you you know you let the air out of the out of the tires with the insulin uh going down and now you're you're you're sort of overcompensating and your body has to readjust and it will and most people it takes about two weeks two three weeks and so yeah so don't don't worry about it unless there's something to worry about uh Shannon Thomas Trucking thank you very much for the super chats very generous of you my friend was told she has nons small cell lung cancer very sorry to hear that they've told her that it is terminal and have her on a prazone causing massive weight gain even when she doesn't eat can fasting and carnivore reverse all this well you know cancer is is an extremely dangerous and deadly and nasty disease even doing everything as best that we can and fasting and doing carnivore and ketogenics and things like that sometimes it's not enough and um you know there is there is a point of of no return but there are a lot of people finding that they are significantly improving their health issues there have been studies on non lung cancer and ketogenic diets I'm nearly 100% sure just going back to that lecture I gave I those was some of the studies I came across were for non-s small cell lung cancer and so it's definitely worth a shot the prazone is you know it's it's a double-edged sword because it's reducing the inflammation and allowing their their breathing to be easier but what it's doing also is causing diabetes massively increasing her blood sugar and feeding that cancer and making that cancer much more aggressive and it's also suppressing the immune system which fights the cancer so this is sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy is um you know that she's on those medications to sort of help her symptomatically but they're they're accelerating her demise unfortunately so it just depends on how how much left she has in her how how much she has in her to fight this you know if she comes off the the prazone to get her blood sugar under control and she can fast and eat carnivore and ketogenic um and you know potentially address the you know glutamine action with different sort of medications press pulse um method that Professor C freed has outlined in several of his papers and another paper that um I'm actually a part of that will be coming out shortly and um and that I talk about in the uh my uh talk on ketogenic metabolic therapy for cancer and in our our um interview my interview with Thomas seed uh we talk about all this I think it can definitely help and I think it can definitely help her feel better and get more out of this and uh and be healthier for longer and I can't say that it's going to reverse all this I can't say that it's going to fix her I can't say that um she's going to be able to put this into remission but I can tell you that others have um and that they are still fighting this you know I mean this you just have to sort of assume that this is always going to be going on in your body you really can't stop and so um you know if if she tries it I think it's well worth trying you know nothing else is really going to do much I mean they've already given up on her and said that she's terminal and so they're putting on paliative measures and just giving a whole bunch of penone which um is just going to jack up her her blood sugar and and accelerate this cancer cells require 400 times the amount of blood sugar as normal cells and so you know you want to do everything you can to keep that blood sugar levels down not up because you take do a pet scan you inject radio labeled glucose and you see where that goes you see dot dot dot dot dot oh that that's all the cancer cells are sucking up all that glucose so that's what's happening when our blood sugar's it's just feeding those Cancers and they're lighting up lighting up lighting up so remember that pet scan anytime you have a bagel or a piece of bread or or have your prazone jumps up your blood sugar you really want to keep that down uh because the you're just you're just stuffing energy into these cancer cells which is exactly the opposite of what you want to do so I'm really sorry for your friend that's a very difficult place to be in you know especially because sometimes you know the the breathing is is so hard that they really can't go off the the steroids and that's that that's really tough and you know it's like for for brain cancers brain tumors you get a lot of swelling in edema you have to go on steroids you have to because the edema can kill you then you do the surgery you cut out the tumor and then you have them on steroids for another you know several days in a weaning dose and uh and then you come off of them you know when that swelling's down you've taken out the tumor so now it's not causing swelling anymore so you can get them off the steroids you don't keep them on for very long if possible and then you do radiation that causes more swelling you're putting back on steroids and then you're sort of going down that rabbit hole but it's um it's something that in in certain circumstances when you have brain edema or you have so much edema in your lungs that you can't breathe that sometimes these are these are necessary evils and U you know the fasting and carnivore diet being at least ketogenic so you're not adding fuel to that I think is definitely going to be a net positive and hopefully it reduces the swelling down enough as well that she can come off the prazone and um and not be so horribly symptomatic that she's that she's miserable or or uh putting herself in danger of respiratory failure hopefully that's the case and and if it is and she can really attack this with you know getting her gki below two or below one if possible with with with um combination of a ketogenic carnivore diet liver organs um some restricted eating and some fasting hopefully that that um is enough to start turning the tide back the other way there are people who have done that and it's a growing body of them and there there are there's a growing body of experimental literature of randomized control trials and Interventional trials that um maybe you know controlled but not randomized um you know self- selected uh trials Etc that um that that are doing extremely well and there's a just there's more and more there are more and more of these study showing that so uh good luck to your friend hopefully she gets a lot of improvement by going carnivore hopefully she's able to get off the prazone and hopefully she's able to turn this around and um you know I think we're all you know we're all praying for her so um good luck with that good luck to her you know and and have her watch and you watch my videos on ketogenic metabolic therapy and my interview with Professor Thomas C freed s y f r i those are very important ones to know about good luck um Nick um buis bu Nick anyway thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr chafi thanks for all you do um what's your take on iodine supplements on a carnivore uh ketovore uh here's seaweed and herbal mate are good sources well seaweed probably is because it comes from the ocean I have no idea about herbal mate but uh fish just Seafood in general has a has a ton of iodine and depending on where your livestock RS and grazes have plenty of iodine in the soil there too they need iodine to they have thyroids as well so you know they need to to get this stuff in them also so it's um it's likely that you don't need it I think I think with any supplementation uh you only supplement if you if you you aren't getting enough from from your diet you know be it that you know you're eating grain finished Factory formed uh meat that isn't as nutritious as it could be or you have a particularly high demand for some of these things U or you know your animals that you're eating just come from a place that have low minerals uh in that area in the soil uh for whatever reason you know you just check so you just check your iodine iodine levels if you have if you have good iodine levels well you don't need to supplement if you are low then sure you know uh be more conscious of that add in Seafood you know just add in fish a couple times a week add in you know some oysters things like that some shrimp those S tons of iodine and shrimp and so you know just big buttery shrimp just a big tub of butter and put a whole bunch of you know fried shrimp in there great you know or or you know um you pan fry them you can boil them whatever however you like to cook shrimp um just put in a lot of butter and you'll get plenty of of uh good nut utri and and iodine you get tons of iodine in that um you can also just take the Lugal drops if you want to do any of that I wouldn't do the seaweed or the herbal mate because I don't do plants but um you could do that but you're going to get the bad with the good you're going to get all the other plant toxins that that go along with the seaweed and herbate along with the iodine and there are plenty of other sources of iodine just such as any other Seafood any other animal that lives in the ocean will have a ton of iodine in it because there's a ton of iodine in the ocean so that that'll be fine if you just do it that way Julie halabi thank you very much for the Super Chat uh hi should I cut out heavy cream will it make me gain weight thank you uh yeah dairy in general is a classic weight loss stall and can make you gain weight there's some people that um that you know add in Dairy add Dairy back in and they start seeing their weight sort of go up or or hit a weight loss stall so uh yeah I mean if you if you're concerned about weight gain pain and you and you want to continue weight loss then I would cut out all Dairy including heavy cream there are different chemicals and compounds in Dairy that uh just encourage baby mammals to eat more and uh and so that deranges your your hunger signals so you end up eating more than you need to and so you can overeat um you know when especially when you're deranging your hunger signals if you're just eating fatty meat you don't derange hunger signals and you can actually listen to them but you add in Dairy you add in heavy cream that can throw that off and so you can't really listen as as well to your to your hunger signals as you would be able to before uh so yeah it could you know it depends on how much heavy cream you're using if you're just using a little bit in a recipe or putting it in some eggs or something like that it's probably not that big of a deal uh but if you're you know responding negatively to it especially have autoimmune issues or INF issues probably good to avoid that and then um yeah and if you're if you're sort of hitting a weight loss stall or you know maybe putting on a bit of weight you know cutting out the cream is and and Dair is is definitely a good uh good thing to First Step anyway to try to see uh what difference that makes definitely so yeah give it a try see how you go and um I I I rarely rarely have any dairy it might be a bit of cheese melted onto meat or or mixed in with some you know melted in with some scrambled eggs or something like that uh you know but it's so rare that I do that anyway so I would just um yeah I would um try to cut that out and just see how you go with just fatty meat and water you'll always do best on just fatty meat and water butter usually people have are do fine with butter but you give you try that without and try adding it back in and see how you go as well just to see how you do and good luck with that Grace vanderen thank you very much for the Super Chat uh our 40-year-old friend died this week I'm oh God I'm very sorry obesity diabetes Etc could endstage diabetes affect behavior and personality what can people look out for and can it be reversed at the later stages it can definitely be reversed at the later stages I mean there's such thing as damage done and so you know if you're you if you've done serious damage to yourself can you undo all of that damage uh maybe maybe not depends um Can it affect your behavior your personality well yeah but in a lot of ways it can you know it can just make you feel unwell and tired and stressed out and when you when you're in that that that sort of scenario when you're when your just life is is pain you know that that changes your outlook and it changes how you respond to other people as well and so you know if if your friend died at 40 I mean they were they were in really bad in a really bad place for for quite some time and you know being in pain for that long can be very difficult and so that can definitely change your behavior and your personality there's also the case that it affects your brain chemistry as well and you can get insulin resistance of the brain uh this is now why Alzheimer's is being called type 3 diabetes and so if you're not getting enough energy to your brain your brain's not functioning the way as it should be you're not getting enough cholesterol and fats your brain is atrophying and not being able to rebuild and repair itself properly then um then yeah that that can change these you know uh your behavior as well and and your memory and cognition and all that sort of stuff so yeah you can definitely reverse diabetes you can definitely reverse type two diabetes and and even very serious uh end stage uh th of type two diabetes or or even type one diabetes when you get better control uh you know Dr Gary Fe he showed this he was an orthopedic surgeon and he did um uh you know amputations for diabetics and so he's you know cutting off feet and toes and legs and things like that which is really nasty surgery to do it's not it's not a fun surgery um you know for the for the doctor as well as the patient you know it's just it's it's pretty jarring to actually sever Limbs and have and and hear that limb just clunk Funk into to a trash can you know it's like goodness that's a it's it's a pretty startling thing to have to do and um but he found I mean that's why he found low carb carnivore diets as well is because he could reverse people's diabetes and he was and he was making it so people didn't need to get uh amputations anymore or at least significantly reduce the extent of their amputations so this can reverse a lot of serious endstage damage I speak to a lot of opthalmologists who uh are discovering ketogenic carnivore diets some who've been using it for well over a decade and reversing diabetic retinopathy reversing macular degeneration these are things that aren't that aren't supposed to be reversible and um and yet they are and even in some cases uh reversing or mitigating uh cataracts and improving cataracts that's not supposed to happen none of this is supposed to happen and yet it's happening and you know kidney disease your know diabetic um uh nephropathy that's one of the leading causes of of chronic kidney disease that's reversing people are reversing and improving their kidney function by going on a ketogenic carnivore diet so yes you can reverse a lot of damage that you do to your body um by by changing your diet like this um there's going to be some damage done you know I mean like Gary F key found um you could you know reverse some issues to the point that that you didn't need amputations and other times you needed some amputation but just not nearly as much okay so that that improved a lot but there was some permanent damage done so something to remember there can be permanent damage done but your body can heal from so much it can recover from so much if you give it the right materials and you put it in the right positions and you get rid of all this poison that we're dumping in our bodies I'm very sorry hear about your friend hopefully other people can can use his uh life and his unfortunate death as an example on how to not do that and how to improve their lives so that they don't have to go through and suffer the way that he did and I'm very sorry that that happened and I'm sorry that um they weren't able to you know come come around to this and and fix it before it was too late nav thank you very much for the Super Chat uh hi doc any tips for teeth grinding during sleep I might have sleep apnea which could be the cause I think we saw this earlier U maybe that that maybe that got repeated or maybe uh you just got impatient with me and and asked it again it happens um but I think we we already sort of addressed that so we go back to that answer basically wear a mouth guard and get check for sleep apne on a sleep study to see what's going on maybe get somebody to look up your nose and see if there's a a deviation in your septum to see if that might be able to be fixed and help your sleep apne or snoring as well and good luck with that Rick Diaz thank you very much for the Super Chat carnivore for 6 months down 35 pounds I'm 47 uh still high blood pressure 160 over 110 my doc wants to put me on am loine until root cause is f found uh should I fill and take it uh well first of all congratulations that's absolutely fantastic that's that's a huge amount of weight loss um and I'm sure a lot of other health issues have been improved as well um I I I would absolutely agree with your doctor on this that um you know and it is important you know to to take uh you know the advice of your doctor way uh more seriously than you do uh internet doctors right because I don't know your full history I haven't done physical exams we haven't spent hours and hours talking to each other over years to know you know your your specific details I I can only speak in generalities and I can only speak about you know what the data shows on the Aggregate and what my experience has shown in my individual patients and what we've seen and talk about different mechanisms but you know at the end of the day you know getting personalized Healthcare is really important but I would I would definitely agree with this high blood pressure is a major killer and it's a major cause of heart disease heart attacks Strokes um and so you you you do want to control that and and even when people go on a carnivore diet and they improve their diabetes and improve their blood pressure you can't just hop off medications you know you need to you can only do that in a you know as appropriate you know when your body when it's when it's um when it's time when your blood sugar is down it's oh now it's going too low okay adjust that up keep that in that right range with the you know combination of diet and and medications same with blood pressure if your blood pressure isn't being controlled uh then then blood pressure medication can be very helpful in keeping that down so couple things to check first of all there are there are causes of blood pressure uh issues that can be uh reversible call talking about these um secondary hypertension so there's something that's causing it you know like renal artery stenosis foch chromosoma you know different sorts of things that can that can be there that your doctor can check for and should check for it's very important to check for these things you don't just say ah well probably just n just high blood pressure is high blood pressure whatever no there there's some things that you can find that actually are reversible and be your high blood pressure being caused by something it's obviously it's all being caused by something but there some of these things we know the causes of in other words we have no idea um so you need to investigate that so work with your doctor to investigate those things and uh and reverse whatever is able to be reversible um but then the other things to think about high homocystine can irritate the arteries cause constriction increasing your B12 and folate that will reduce your homosysteine in fact High homy is a better indicator of low or inadequate uh B12 or B12 deficiency than even serum levels of B12 so check your B12 you want it to be on the high end of normal or even above the range for most reference ranges in America you want to be between 1100 and 1,600 the rest of the world you want when it's so America it's PE of grams so PG per ml pgml you want to be between 1100 and 1600 uh the rest of the world or most of the rest of the world uses peak of moles per liter so PML and you want to uh have between 800 and 1,200 if it's PE moles per liter and uh so that's what you aim for and if you do that and you check your homocysteine that comes down that can sometimes get your your blood pressure down also insulin insulin resistance you know it may it may just be that you're still dealing with a bit of insulin resistance test your fasting insulin first thing in the morning if that's above 10 that can also be an a reason why your blood pressure is a little high and if that comes down eventually that comes down that can help normalize your blood pressure as well the other one to not forget is why while I don't have a problem with salt in general uh I do have a problem with it in particular cases because um about 20% of people are salt sensitive and can actually get pretty labile blood pressure because they use salt and so I don't use salt at all anymore just because of taste it doesn't taste as good to me anymore um but it doesn't bother my my blood pressure um and other people it does and so you just need to be mindful that and maybe try cutting out salt as well as checking your insulin checking your homocysteine checking your B12 just cut out the salt see what happens check your blood pressure daily same time same conditions sitting down with feet flat on the floor don't cross your legs and uh deep breaths calm and relax chill out for about five minutes and then check your blood pressure there's also something called White Coat Syndrome where you know you just you're just anticipating getting your blood pressure so your blood pressure goes up and you're like oh my God I don't want high blood pressure it's going to be high every time every time you're worried about your blood pressure being high it's G to be high so just chill out relax Deep Thoughts Zen out or deep deep breaths Zen out and just chill and then get your blood pressure taken and that that that in itself can help and is more indicative of what your blood pressure is like throughout the day when you're not stressing out about your what what the hell your blood pressure is so give all those things a try and and investigate what's going on with your doctor and if all else fails you know I would take medication if I had high blood pressure I would take medication for it and I would recommend that to my patients as well because high blood pressure is a major killer and um and it's and it's a major risk factor for a lot of major Killers as well so um while you know 160 isn't a crisis you know you get over 180 and that is considered a hypertensive emergency that you should go to the emergency room for um you know if it's a true number you're not just freaking out because you're you're worried about something um like your blood pressure but if that's a real number then you know you need to go get that sorted out and quickly and so I would uh I would treat that I would definitely treat that and um you know in myself or in my patients I would make sure that they get on a on a better blood pressure regimen and then go through all those things that we talked about to try to get to the bottom of it and um and hopefully you can come off the medications but if you can't you know that's what medications are for that's like the only thing medications are for is for when you do all the diet and lifestyle and uh sort of interventions and there's still something a bit screwy that's what medicine are for that's what medicines are for you know we're just using these as a crutch like oh something happens hey you fix my bad habits you know I'm going to eat and drink and do whatever and just trash my body you give me a pill to fix it well there are no pills to fix that crap you can patch it up you can you can cover up some symptoms but you're not going to fix that so you you fix that first with your diet and lifestyle and then if there's something left over that's what medications are for um and so you know you're doing it the exact right way you're doing all the right things blood pressure is a little high great fine take some blood pressure medication as your doctor recommends and then investigate you know why it is up and see if there's something you can reverse and and hopefully it is hope you can you can come off the meds but uh until then probably a good idea the feral Grandma thank you very much for the Super Chat that's great uh sending some love from Texas well sending some love right back thank you very much for that uh big gelato thank you very much for the Super Chat WebMD says meat causes kidney stones that's funny I wonder why what they're basing that on it's probably some sort of epidemiological nonsense you look at the if you look at the actual physiology um gall stone or kidney stones um are uh typically calcium oxalate Stones so uh 75% ofal of kidney stones calcium oxalate stones and um and uh you know oxalates don't come from meat so don't know why WebMD is is saying something like that that's a bit that's a bit funny stink ass cat good to see you buddy uh thank you very much for the generous Super Chat uh carnivore Karate kicks at a ribey roast moon to to you Dr chaffy and all the wonderful mods and people on your channel well thank you very much it's great to see you it's um and appreciate the the sports very kind of you um okay we still got a few more here okay and great so Annabelle the happy carnivore thank you very much for the Super Chat uh hi doctor um I found out my dietitian thinks I'm still anorexic because I eat carnivore I now eat Tomahawk steaks knowing with am eats Tom sakes yeah I would I would Hazard to say that you're correct um and uh well you know you just you just you know the proof of the puddings in the eating you know you're if you're eating tomahawks you're eating fatty meat till it stops tasting good and you're putting on healthy weight and you're healthy then um you know well then then that proves them wrong doesn't it um maybe they're freaking out because maybe you know sometimes people with anorexia there's say like no you just have to eat anything you just have to food is all good it's all good there's no there's no bad there's no such thing as bad food well of course there is bad food and so I think that's a fundamental lapse in um the teaching that is done in in um uh you know eating disorder psychology and you know I have a suspicion that these probably funded by the processed food industry is oh no food is bad food uh yeah uh well no food is bad food but not everything you put in your mouth is food so uh and some things you put in your mouth are bad and so it's um it's I I would suspect that they they've got their hooks in there have their Hooks and everything but um that's probably where that comes from but uh yeah you know if if you got put on just eating junk oh just eat anything it's okay it's okay you put on weight it's okay that you put off that well to a certain extent yes but you know getting unhealthy in the other direction isn't isn't ideal either and so you know if somebody tells them to well you're anorexic so you just need to eat and and get fat and just and just love it and you know big is beautiful and all that sort of stuff um well you know it's it's you know better than dying of anorexia sure but it's um you know it's not the best that you can do and so if you're going carnivore now and you're losing weight they're like oh my God you're losing weight and it's say like well no I'm I'm losing unhealthy weight I'm putting on healthy weight get a dexa scan show your body composition and so that you know in three months time six months time you've lost excess body fat and uh to a healthy degree and you've put on lean body mass and bone density or if you're underweight and you're just putting on U lean body mass and bone density and just be like well look I'm not anorexic I'm eating big tomahawks I'm eating more calories a day than you are and so you know not anorexic but that's that's a bit yeah that's a bit unfortunate that they think that but hopefully you know just leading by example will um will show them that that maybe they're looking at well that they definitely are looking at this the wrong way so good luck with that I'm really glad to hear that you're you're doing so much better and recovering from anorex it's very difficult uh illness and uh and you're doing great you're eating big tomahawks so you know that's always um always an improvement so good job uh savine thank you very much for the Super Chat uh what's the difference between HDL and LDL and their role excellent question that's not um yeah I'm not probably not the best to answer that um but they you know they all have um the major roles of HDL and LDL is are transport molecules they're transporting fat lipids and cholesterol around the body and transporting them to and from the liver from your fat cells to your liver from your liver to somewhere else and then back to your liver again and so uh and there's there's a whole very complex biochemical U pathway and and um flowchart that you can sort of look at and you look at biochemistry books um and Physiology books you sort of see that you know you start with like you know vldl turn LDL and L and all these I and all these other sorts of things and and there's different sorts of you know when they're when they're picking up and dropping off different amounts of fat triglycerides and and uh lipids and cholesterol and things like that so it's it's quite complex um but that's the main role is they're just transporting fat around the body and so why would it be that you know when we're we just stop eating so they say well when you eat fatty meat you eat more saturated fat all the El Co goes up because oh there's more fat in your body well you know yes and no you know because when you just fast and you just don't eat at all for 5 days LDL will go up HDL will go up triglycerides will go down that's the exact same pattern that we see when people just eat meat and so why is that well it's a metabolic State change you're running on fat your body needs to move more fat you know fat can't just freely move around the body it has to be carried and transported in HDL and LDL and so now you're running on your fat so you need to move the fat from your fat to your liver to then turn that into glucose and ketones and glycogen and then you know you're sure you're moving more fat around the body pretty simple um and it actually does a lot of other things as well actually has has a part um part to play in the innate U immunity so people that have lower LDL uh actually have have worse outcomes with infectious disease and uh and die more from infection I disease than people with higher LDL they die more from cancer than people with high LDL so this has a a big role in your body it's not just moving lipids around your body it's actually involved in a lot of other processes and and where is it moving those lipids to maybe they're moving it to some damage side or some infection side and helping you know the body fight these infections and Cancers off so that certainly seems to be uh what is going on so it's very good question but it's it's one that you sort of need a whole chapter in a biochemistry book to answer so you know check that out you know you can go and check out you know those different things um uh those different processes and and Pathways um and what they do but that's the main the main thing that they do is they move fat and cholesterol around your body and that's important to do because we need fat and cholesterol all over our body and our brain and uh so yeah I your brain makes cholesterol if your brain doesn't have proper cholesterol there are tons of studies showing that if you disrupt the normal cholesterol metabolism of the brain you get serious neurodegenerative diseases and uh even neurodevelopmental issues as and diseases as well and now we're doing everything we can to disrupt and screw up our normal uh cholesterol metabolism of our brain by giving ourselves medications to cross the blood brain barrier and stop our brain from making cholesterol which is what our brain is made out of so that's frustrating uh especially when they're talking about giving this stuff to kids you're like oh my God they're they're they're cholesterol is high what you know you breast milk is has the highest concentration of saturated fat and cholesterol of any food in nature good I hope they have high cholesterol because it's not high cholesterol that's a value judgment that somebody put on and they're wrong cholesterol does not cause heart disease it never has it never will has never been proven to cause it it has been disproven to cause it but he well you know that's only showing that th those particular fats were worse than saturated fat well show me one fat that is better than saturated fat show me one example of any experimental data showing that saturated fat and cholesterol cause heart disease there isn't a single one in the entire body of literature anywhere on Earth anywhere in history so why are you saying that it's causitive when you have no reason to say it's causitive um it's pretty frustrating but um you know but that those are the facts and uh and that's just you know as long as we understand the facts we can at least uh use those facts to to help our lives and not be sucked into these uh megalomaniacs who just want control and money so bit of a tangent sorry about that but uh yeah hopefully that was helpful uh Annabella the happy carnivore thank you again for for another Super Chat I need surgery for skin cancer can I get some sunlight I have Fair English skin uh thank you for everything you do uh you're amazing well thank you that's very sweet of you um yeah well I mean certainly get the surgery um sunlight is still good for you as um you know this is this this is again a correlation it's not causation but as hours of sunlight have decreased over or in America over the past Century skin cancer rates have gone up it's reciprocal it's an X it's an x-shaped graph right and so uh that's not to say that skin damage can't contribute uh it is pretty clear evidence that it's not one to one that the sun is the only thing causing skin cancer um well you know you get cancer in other parts of your body as well is that from the sun too or is that from from what because you you're getting disruptions and damage to Cellular mechanisms and processes in your tissues and that can then precipitate itself as cancers you know from 100% of them are from of known cancers are from damaged mitochondria so you're getting damaged mitochondria in the skin you can get damaged mitochondria from the Sun but in fact being the sun actually improves mitochondrial function that's not something they tell you and so you know avoiding the sun typically avoid you have Fair English skin you probably have been avoiding Sun your whole life and yet you get skin cancer oh that damn Sun just trying to kill us all no uh could be that you avoiding the sun was uh was more detrimental than being in the sun because being in the sun you can actually improve your mitochondrial function whereas being out of the sun you're not getting that benefit but all these other sorts of things can damage your mitochondri as well so so uh I I'm fully uh on board with people going in the sun if you have skin cancer get it get it taken off um but uh sun is is uh very healthy as long as you're not burning yourself and you're going to burn much less easily on a carnivore diet so you know be cautious be careful you know but you can get red that's not a burn a burn is when the skin dies and it peels off and you get the flaking peel that's a burn red is just redness that's just blood going to the surface of the skin that's all that is and so that's not a burn that's not necessarily permanent damage it can be uh be indicate permanent damage but it's uh not necessarily permanent damage you know I get I can get red but that that will turn into a tan it will not it will not do a full body peel like it used to when I was just eating a very clean omnivorous diet and um so so you know just don't don't get so much sun that you're doing that that you're peeling uh put Tallow moisturizer on your skin keep it you know moist and healthy and uh yeah I think I think Sun's a very good idea it helps you know your your you nitric oxide vitamin D vitamin D is really important for cancer you really want your vitamin D up around 220 when you're treating cancer and how do you get that you get in the Sun and you get it from eating fatty meat and grass-fed butter those sorts of things so you're getting very good um uh nutrients from that you're also improving the mitochondrial function and health and when your mitochondria work better you don't get cancer this is something that AO wber um you know theorized really showed um you know in from the physiological standpoint that if you have healthy mitochondria you cannot get cancer and that's something that's been proven subsequently by replacing out the mitochondrian cancer cells and it suppresses the cancer cells stops them from being cancer if there's healthy mitochondria in there um that that's you know so that's what's going on so you're in the sun you're improving your mitochondrial Health you're actually less likely to get cancer you know as long as you're not burning yourself and and making things counterproductive uh so good luck with that hope uh the surgeries go well and um you keep up the good work you're doing great and we're sort of coming down on the last sort of few uh questions um but uh yeah this is one's from Andy Hall thank you very much Andy for the very generous Super Chat it's very kind of you um in your experience how long does it take for Crohn's to go into complete remission on Carnivore I'm a 52-year-old male carnivore for three months doctor started me on uh what is it skyzzy that's a cool name uh probably a horrible drug but a cool name um that's marketing that's that's all that matters uh but worried about taking biologics long term yeah well you know I mean that's that's the whole idea is that it they can have you know long lasting issues and effects but you know when you're dealing with something like croh is very debilitating very ill makes you very ill and can be very dangerous and um you know it's it's the lesser of two evils in that circumstance but you know in this circumstance not so much so you have to be really strict with with uh any autoimmune issue and you'll notice this on Chrome if you go off your biologics you go off prazone things like that um and you have uh some you really need to be like red meat and water so like beef lamb water high fat very high fat and you when you do that you know you'll you'll find that that Crohn's gets into remission very quickly um I when people do a strict lion diet I have I have yet to see it take longer than three months and in typically people do a biopsy of their colon like a colon oscopy and take a biopsy there's like no inflammation on um on biopsy as well there can be other things if you're really stressed out you're getting poor sleep you're having other sorts of things other negative inputs in your environment that can make things worse um if you're still having a bit of of issues with just beef and lamb go for grass-fed and finished beef and lamb that's going to be the best of the best that's always your Baseline that's always the best you can do and then you know you you adjust from there if uh if you feel that you can usually grass-fed butter is okay but I would probably avoid it until you're you're sort of putting this into remission and you're off the biologics and you can see how that affects you because you might find and you probably will find that you know you have this in remission and everything's fine and then you have a pork chop and then all of a sudden you know you have a bit of a flare up you're like okay get the hell away from that or some eggs and you have a flare up like okay screw that um and so you know you really need to be really strict red meat and water and usually people with crohn's do better because you know if you if you just eat a pork chop or a salad and all of a sudden you have bloody diarrhea for the next next three days like you're you're just never doing that again like yeah screw that I'm never doing that again that was horrible and um so it's very easy to to see whereas with things like Hashimoto you don't necessarily see it right away it you know increases antibodies that Dam damage your your thyroids start reducing thyroid function and then the coming days and weeks you start having less energy and feeling bit more leth lethargic and tired and you're like H that's weird why am I not feeling so good well it was from that stupid salad that you had you know a week ago uh or maybe added back in because you didn't think it was that big of a deal and so you've been having it every now and then and so they can be less strict uh with with something like Hashimoto whereas with crohn's you see it right then same with rumor arthritis like you're going to know about it if you eat something your body reacts negatively to and starts creating more antibodies for um so just go really pure pure pure red meat and water really high fat two grams of fat to one gram of protein if you can um and if you've been in you know remission and you haven't had a flare up and everything's been fine for for a few months you can absolutely uh think about you know having a trial off of the biologics and uh and see how you go and uh the you know actually I Haven really seen anybody have a flare up if they did that if they uh just stuck with red meat and water there are people that have been good for so long that they get complacent they think well I can sort of eat outside of that and then they have a big massive flare up and it takes a long time for them to get out of that flare up um but as long as they stay on just red meat and water they i' I've never seen anybody have a flare up otherwise um things can be a bit worse with stress and poor sleep so you know that's important to remember as well but um uh you know that aside just you know if you address that stuff and then just do red meat and water and you and you've had no symptoms you know for a month two months three months definitely uh you know definitely fair to try coming off the Skyy and see how you do and you have a flare up and things get go horrible you can always go back on the meds you know it's not going to it's not like a like playing rushing roulette it's not like a this could kill you sort of thing if you have a flar you go back on medication fine you know but uh you won't you know I mean the the vast majority of people are able to put this in termission very quickly with a pure red meat and water diet but it really does need to be strict um you slip outside of that and unfortunately you're just going to get things in your body and your body G to make antibodies towards them and react and damage uh your intestines and um you're going to have problems so do the best you can just to stick to just red meat and water and I think you do really well so good luck with that so Annabella the happy carnivore s a super sticker very kind of you I appreciate that um then bow and Nikki um Tessier I'm I'm gonna guess that's how that's pronounced been on um PD Dialysis that's um paranal dialysis uh for three years uh any worri starting carnivore tomorrow no not at all um you know thing is is like if you're already on dialysis I mean even even if it were true that meat and higher protein damage to kidneys which it is not um you're already on dialysis you you're not going to get more on dialysis right like it's like if your kidneys don't work they're not GNA you know they're not going to like get get any worse right you're already there right um is it going to reverse it and can you get off dialysis there have been a handful of isolated anecdotal cases that I've seen of people coming off uh dialysis um three that I've seen and there's one who is on um uh paranal um paranal dialysis um who's who's been on on here and and been in some of my groups and that he was vegan for a number of years and and and at the you know rip old age of 32 it destroyed his kidneys and um neurology and he was actually bedridden and couldn't walk and couldn't use his foone because his hands wouldn't work and he was on dialysis because of his vegan diet which has just destroyed his health and so anybody tells you the vegan diet is healthy you can tell them that um that uh they're out of their damn mind um and you know any diet that doesn't provide you even basic nutrients is a bad diet like there's there's no two ways about that um and oh but you can supp no no no no you don't you shouldn't have to supplement you know if your diet can't you know cannot provide basic nutrients it is a bad diet full stop so he actually is improving uh he's walking again he's working out he's exercising he's lifting weights and he's and he's back having noral life again he's still on dialysis but he's making he's still able to make urine he's making more urine and making more urine so he's actually on the transplant list to get new kidneys but he is uh giving it a year and seeing if he can you know seeing what he can do in there and it has been improving will improve all the way that he doesn't need the transplant we don't know but uh you know thing it's certainly not hurting him anyway and it's getting better and um I did an interview with uh Professor Thomas wimes who is a um a professor and research scientist um Prof Professor B biology and research scientist specifically in kidneys and kidney disease and chronic kidney disease and polycystic kidney disease and at um un University of California Santa Barbara and I just did an interview with him that you should definitely check out and and he's finding that that people are significantly improving their kidney function by going on key to enic diets high fat meat-based ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet and and so he's a big fan of the carnivore diet as well specifically for kidney disease and chronic kidney disease and damage so it's very very interesting and uh and great to see uh more and more data and and hard research coming out showing that this is this is an improvement and uh so no there's no worries on that make sure you're you're you know drinking water appropriately eating appropriately all these other sorts of things and and um and uh yeah and hopefully I mean you you'll do better in a thousand other ways but it's [Music] um you know it it remains to be seen how much benefit you get from your kidney function I hope it works I hope you get off dialysis and don't need a transplant or anything like that um just depends on how much damage is done depends on what was causing it in the first place if it was from polycystic kidney disease that absolutely has been shown to be uh extremely help in fact they um they they show that actually reversed a lot of the polycystic kidney disease and they they they tried to get another Grant um from the the NIH or whoever and um the the study design was amazing got the highest rating like all the people you know the peer rreview sort of things that looked at it said yeah this is a great study this is fantastic you should definitely approve funding for this and it went up to the higher higher ones that ended up denying it because they said these results are too good to be true no one's ever gotten results like that so they can't be true it's like it's like what you know it's too good therefore we're not going to do it um well that's why you test it isn't it you know you're not going to get anywhere if you just do the same if you do the same thing that that um people have always done you're going to get the results people have always gotten we're trying something new we're getting different results look at that let's test it let's study it that's why we want a grant and um no no no no couldn't possibly be goodness all right but that's that's what they're showing is that you know polycystic kidney disease is a major cause of kidney failure diab diabetes is the major cause of kidney failure they both get taken out and uh can be reversed actually reversed with a ketogenic high fat meat-based ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet so good luck with that I hope it goes really really well for you and then you just have nothing but um good results and hopefully your kidneys get better too fingers cross and my sister piping in saying that I'm using L's cup well you we live in the same house and we both use cups so there you go and um it's a big cup and I like big cups because I like to drink water but um she used my cups anyway she steals all my stuff anyway so I can get I can have the damn cup thank you very much low carb low drama thank you very much for the super sticker sort of um down into the the the thank you and the sticker so thank you all very much uh for the super stickers thank you low car low drama uh thank you very much Steve large for a very nice super sticker and uh um Ibrahim Barry thank you very much as well uh it's very nice to see you all here um Merck Hudson thank you very very generous super super sticker very kind of you thank you have a couple comments here from Roslin again what are you giving me grief for now I hope you say thank you to L for letting you use her special J woman cup yeah well I I'm sure I have and I'm I'll be sure to remind her to thank me for using all my things that she steals without my permission so thank you uh Cavin silven thank you very much uh for stopping by and just saying hi from X and so we're on X and Facebook and YouTube at the moment so uh yeah good to see everybody here and uh I wonder actually what what how many people are watching from where actually uh um just double check on thing here what is that okay and um interesting okay and um yeah and so we'll be in Ron of Vu City beef Roundup on the 23rd and the 24th of August um that'll be in Riverton Wyoming before that the week before that I will be speaking at the Symposium for metabolic Health in San Diego so this be the second year in a row that I'll be speaking there and and uh that's a great that's a great conference it's very interesting a lot of really really good speakers and interesting talks there um and um easy there and um uh and um so uh yeah so a lot of great talks there too so you know please do come down if you're in San Diego and you want to see some of those talks or do like a meet and greet I think probably think about doing like a you know some sort of some sort of meet up and you know go to like a steakhouse or something like that or one of those Brazilian places and see if if people are around in San Diego we might set that up and um and uh yeah and then I'll be uh the next week will'll be back in Wyoming and uh yeah so thank you all very much for coming on and uh there the last one there is yeah the superer from from Zeus so thank you all very much it's been an absolute pleasure as always uh thank you all for the wonderful comments and um and chats and uh hopefully people got a lot out of this um please do uh leave a comment like And subscribe if you haven't already if you like this sort of content and like my other videos and please do share that with people and uh and let them know um you know that there is a way that they can get get better naturally and they can just eat normal normal food for humans and uh and live a normal human life uh and please do leave a comment below if you you know you have and see your um your experience with a cornivore diet tell us about how this has affected you and how it has helped you as well or you know if you're struggling you know do leave a comment and people can help um I I try to answer questions when I can I don't see all the all the comments you know but if you're having an issue you you can just ask for help this is a wonderful Community there are a lot of people that that can help people through um you know different transition issues and and people having different sorts of problems there are so many people that have been through the exact same issue that uh you have been there's nothing new Under the Sun there are you know millions of people now that are doing this and have been doing this for a number of years and so there's a lot of very experienced people that can that can help you along the way so don't be afraid to ask and uh if you're having some troubles and you know people that are having uh that have improved a lot of issues please leave a comment and talk about the issues that you've improved because somebody else out there is going through exactly what you were going through and uh and will be helped by that and see that and go like okay maybe I'll give this a try and um and so you'll help a lot of people with that you your sphere of influence is what's doing this you know your personal Spirit of being INF you sharing this you talking about this you saying hey this is what's helped me this is what's what has has reversed in my life um people see that your family sees that your friends see that that people online see that and people see your comments and they say think like hey you know what that that's something that that I'm going through that's help them maybe it can help me too and that's how this that's how this grows and um you know it's not going to come from top down we're not there yet so it has to come from the bottom up and so uh that's what's going to grow this is everyone here sharing their experiences and so please do and um thank you all for joining and we'll see you next time"
