    "transcript": "just because we actually absorb red meat uh very well and so it's just like if you're just eating a lot of red meat like things don't really come out you're like oh it must be constipated because if it doesn't come out then that means it's you know stuck somewhere that's what people think but um yeah but you if you're on a carnivore diet you're not going to get constipated unless you're not eating enough fat that's what I found do you think different forms of carnivore could help heal type 1 diabetes and dupet contracture so okay so Deana has a question genuine question on Carnival diet if plants are bad then why do almost all medications come from plants or plant compounds this crossed my mind a few days ago and I love to understand more good question the the answer is that you know um we use things medicinally that we wouldn't use normally we don't use antibiotics for normal daily Health we use that for uh for certain specific circumstances where we want you know to attack something else that's attacking us or or or to to have something happen that uh we don't necessarily need to happen every day so we don't need antibiotics every day because we're not fighting off an infection every day our body can fight off that for us when our when a bacteria gets sort of overwhelms our our system then we might need some B antibiotics to help fight those off but they're actually not good for you if you just take them every day so you know a medicine is just a poison that does more good than harm under C certain circumstances but you know Methotrexate is useful in a lot of different disease processes but it will absolutely shred your body to pieces in the axe and so you certainly don't want to have that uh when you don't when you're not treating you know the problem that um when you're not treating a problem that uh um you know goes with that so you're not getting you're getting the the you know you sort of getting good with a bad when you're using something as a medicine but when it's um uh when you don't have that benefit then you're only getting the bed so that's that's the deal with plants is that it has these poisons in them they cause harm but in some cases those those things like you know like digitalis that comes from Fox Glove you get too much of that you're dead you have your heart just stops right and so uh that's not good but in cases of heart failure that can actually be better it can help your your heart beat stronger so that's a benefit in those cases in very select and specific doses so that's the answer to that oh thank you Mike appreciate it um so Lis Luis wants us wants me to talk about meat variety and grassfed versus grain fed uh his wife and he are on a budget so limited is variety and grain fed fine yeah grain fed is fine I mostly eat grain fed I you know I think grass-fed you know the healthier the animal is healthier more nutrients is going to have in it uh I think that that difference is not really appreciable when you're talking about the grand scheme of things in uh in in in the diet so I think of it sort of as um i' sort of used this this analogy before but it's like getting gold and silver at the Olympics right gold medal uh you know beat everyone silver medal lost to Gold but silver also beat everything else on Earth so that's what I think about with grain Fed so I mostly do grain fed if I can get grass-fed I prefer it but it's it's um it's totally fine just eat grain fed and you know grass-fed stuff is is uh can be a lot more expensive it can be prohibitively expensive so don't uh don't break the bank just chasing chasing gold okay silver is just fine um ask do you think different forms of carnivore could help heal type 1 diabetes and duperrin contracture dup contracture not not too convincing on that um you know that's just like sort of a scarring of your tendon um you know from different things but uh I I I would hesitate to guess if that's gonna if that's going to get better just with um just with uh dietary changes but it wouldn't get worse anyway which is a good thing it's a start anyway uh type 1 diabetes will certainly get helped out a carnivore diet that's actually what we use to treat uh type one and type two diabetics for for decades uh was was a ketogenic diet which is you know what a carnivore diet is and U there are animal model models that that look at fasting and and a ketogenic diet or fasting mimicking diet as they call it and um and type 1 diabetes and they found that the mice can actually regrow the areas of their pancreas called the beta eyet cells that actually create uh insulin so that's actually pretty good um and um I hate this when it skips around so Tommy asks I had an incomplete spinal cord injury 15 years ago anything else besides carnivore that will help with recovery or new cell growth we don't we don't have too much in the way of technology that will will help that you know there there are some interesting things being done that that they're trying to use electrodes it will sort of bridge that gap between like spinal cord injuries um it's um you know it's still in infancy stage you know maybe maybe one day we will be able to do that uh but at the moment it's not uh there's nothing nothing on the market anyway that that I know of so I think just um just uh do the best you can and and and be as healthy as you can and that's uh going to get you a lot further than than other other places but uh I would start with that anyway uh so's a question so uh charger Mopar says question as a 39-year meat-based eater I have never experienced constipation why do people think that eating red meat is going to cause constipation um yeah I don't know where that that that came from originally but I mean it's you know like in the 1980s everyone was getting constipated because they stopped eating fat and then they said oh you have to eat a bunch of fiber and I think it's probably just because we actually absorb red meat uh very well and so it's just like if you're just eating a lot of red meat like things don't really come out you're like oh I must be constipated because if it doesn't come out then that means it's you know stuck somewhere that's what people think um so that's wrong but um yeah but you if you're on a carnivore diet you're not going to get constipated unless you're not eating enough fat that's what I found [Music] um so thoughts on using certain plant extracts and concentrate ads medicine I think I know what you're going to say but I heard bar k saying it can be useful what is your take on it uh so I I sort of answered uh similar question earlier I mean things can be used medically and and a medicine uh can be helpful in certain circumstances but the the difference between allopathic medicine and like naturopathic medicine is that you know you you use like the plant in naturopathy which they say well well maybe there's things in there that are working uh synergistically with you know the the part that you're looking for like the digitalis to Jo in in in Fox club that makes it work better okay but you know you need to show what those are and if you can show what those are then you can put them together and have them work together Sy synergistically and you can get the doses right because if you're just giving someone to plant you don't know how much is there you don't know what conditions it needs to be grown in you don't know what conditions it needs to be kept in you don't know exactly what dose you're getting and it comes with all the other thousands and thousands of of things in there as well that you don't want that could cause harm so you know yes things can be used medically but it's better to actually use things that have been isolated and carefully controlled all right so I'm just going to do some of the do some of the the questions have been submitted um questions from eie May it seems like I read a post somewhere that said you have to make sure your anesthesiologist knows you are carnivore before going into surgery is that correct I may have to I may have to have rotated cup Sur surgery no I've never heard heard that and uh you know I just had surgery on my knee to clear out some loose cartilage and uh I didn't say a word and you know didn't come up so um no that doesn't matter uh what does matter is if you're if you're eating things that can interfere with with medication like or you know uh grapefruit juice grapefruit juice has furanic cumerin that um are toxic and your body has has to clear them with our cytochrome p450 um enzy s in your liver and you can use a lot of those up and then they aren't there to process and metabolize the different medications that uh that we give to people sometimes and so they work differently and sometimes they get uh they stop being useful or they become toxic you get toxic levels of these things so that's uh that that's a thing but uh eating carnivore that's not a thing it's just people trying to scare you so don't worry about that um Ry asks I have done some reading on how poor nutrition M mainly from Agricultural and processed food revolutions stunted people's jaw development leading to uh malocclusion jaw problems and Devi septums all of which I am now trying to get fixed to improve my health alongside carnivore I remember Dr chaffy mentioned tongue ties at some point as part of this and I actually had mine released earlier this year would love some discussion on this maybe a good idea for a future post or podcast yeah so um T tongue ties are something that I've U learned about more recently being associated with or attributed to um porn nutrition uh early on and so that's that's seen an increase in tongue ties which can be very very detrimental to a child's development it that's when the was it that the frenulum I think underneath the tongue is sort of stuck down so they can't really lift their their tongue up and they can't speak properly they can't pronounce words properly they can't nurse properly they can't do all sorts of things and and so you have to you know depending on how bad it is you need to get it get it released early on and it's um it's becoming a growing problem apparently so uh the I don't know too much about that but there are other people that that do um that I know some people that have have worked with that specifically and they said that this this is going up and up and up and and it's um has been shown to be uh caused by eating the wrong thing and and not having proper mouth development chewing all the right things and things like that have to do with jaw and teeth development as well as just the nutrition that you're getting in uh but yeah after the Agricultural Revolution the the fossil record is very clear that that our Jaws became smaller our teeth became more crowded they had a lot of cavities and plaque and tartar and Decay uh you did not see that before then you know think of animal teeth and they're just they're just you know white or maybe a bit yellowed but they're they're healthy and they don't have gum disease and they don't have tooth decay and things like that they never brush their teeth how how unnatural is brushing your teeth I'm all for brushing your teeth don't get me wrong I brush my teeth every day but you know it this isn't something that's normal in the wild right so our microbiome our oral biome um you know and our physiology protect our teeth from just rotting and decaying so if your teeth are going to rot and Decay that that means something's going wrong you know you're eating something that you shouldn't something's you're sick there's something happening that's bad right because that you lose your teeth in the wild you're done you can't eat you're dead right I mean we you know we see that now you have to have dentures and um you know those don't just show up out of nowhere so if animals were doing this uh they'd just be dying out you know within a few years of life and that's that's obviously not uh not going to happen not going to work oh well thank you very much Mike U for that um so he ask uh 26 uh under 15% body fat train five to six days a week uh high-intensity interval training have had higher blood pressure since I was 14 on uh blood pressure medication standard dose is 150 and low BP yeah okay and should I ditch the medication carnivore for six months no issues with kidney or heart heart Etc um You probably can you look there are other other causes of high blood pressure that you need to get checked out you know if you're having high blood pressure at 14 that that suggests that you're in that category of uh you know I mean you have things like foch chrom oyas that they're just pumping out adrenaline and um you you'll just have really high blood pressure it's generally not that well able to be controlled U but it's something that needs to be checked out and so uh going carnivore will help a lot of the causes of high blood pressure but there are others that you need to get checked out so see your doctor talk to them make sure that you've been checked for all the weird Wild Wonderful causes of high blood pressure which getting high blood pressure 14 is is uh makes me very suspicious that you're in that category or that just very sensitive to carbohydrates because carbohydrates raise your insulin you get insulin insensitivity and then you get um issues with your blood pressure that that's one of the early signs of uh of insulin resistance and um and so you get uh problems with your blood pressure not everyone does but there a very common cause of that um because uh insulin can help with the um relaxation of your arteries and when they get become insensitive to that then they don't don't respond and so they just stay tight and closed and and you get high blood pressure so being on a carnivore diet or even just keto diet for 3 to six months can certainly help that uh 130 you're sort of you know in in the good range but you're sort of at the upper end of the good range you can you can try uh coming off of it um but I would definitely check for those things first and check for those those causes of high blood pressure and uh and just see your doctor about that and then after that you can you can you know try coming off of it and uh and see what your blood pressure does I would check your blood pressure at sort of the same time of day and same conditions every day and just keep a track keep keep a log and then you'll be able to see okay um so from Ray uh oh no sorry we already did that one and from Kim I've been trying to gain extra weight and build muscle so I've added lunch each day okay I had been eating a huge or large breakfast and evening meal for the past 18 months would you agree with this or is it healthier to to eat twice per day I think you eat as much as your body is asking you to eat um I think it's good to eat until you're full I tend to get a bit lethargic if I eat until I'm full and so for me that works better if I do that later in the day uh even at night and then I just you know just tired and I just want to go to sleep if I do that during the working day it's difficult because you know I need to work I can't go to sleep so uh just play with it if but if you're finding you're eating sort of like three smaller meals throughout the day you know for me it's um I I tend to just eat like a big meal until like I'm full and I and meat doesn't taste good anymore and I naturally want to stop um and uh and so you know I I think that that's a good way of doing it quite often if you're getting fatty enough meat and you're and you're eating until you're satiated you you don't need to eat uh more than once a day if you're working out a lot that that will probably increase I find that if I'm working out heavily I'll I'll I'll do that twice a day sort of eat eat a lot twice a day but just be be mindful that you might get a bit lethargic and uh you know so if you're if you're doing that right at the beginning of the day you know that might be might be um holding you back a bit with your energy levels but just play with it and but I would definitely eat until just meat just does not taste good anymore at night and then see how you go throughout the day and then sometimes if you eat just sort of smaller meals in the day that you're not quite getting to the point that you're really exhausted then you can you can have more energy during the day uh John ask um speaking of isolation any chance of having Tim noes on your Channel he seems to be more meat heavy lately still keto though he has interesting takes on isolation as well I I I think Professor no is amazing I absolutely love that guy I would love to have him on um I've been meaning to sort of ask him um at some point but uh just I've just been absolutely slammed of you know speaking at different um couple different conferences and then doing some big presentations for my department and um which is pretty exciting we're going to get some new research going on um cancer and uh doing dietary measures of treat of adding on as an adjunct to uh brain cancers which is actually great work so I'll be working with uh Professor Thomas C freed over at Boston College and some of his colleagues there as well as other doctors in uh New Zealand Matthew Phillips and um and others as well and then trying to get a study trial going here uh at my department so um I just haven't been able to to uh to get on all the people that I want I've been able to do great interviews with like people like Nina Tel she was amazing and absolutely love talking to her and um and you know Sally Norton I just spoke to and a lot of others that are in the pipeline uh you know Dr Gabor somai who's an expert in dyum which is super interesting something I didn't really know about so it was fun to pick his brain on that and then um and others so those will be coming out but yeah I definitely plan on having Tim noes on if if he'll you know if he's interested in coming on um so sorry let's see read one of these so they ask um I'm 45-year-old female carnivore for seven months I started to add butter to my meat and chicken because I never felt like I am super full now I'm gaining weight I see more fat on me St the butter I mean you may have a problem with dairy some people do and um sometimes that's that's expressed as as weight gain uh so you can try that fat is really good for you though it's not the fat that's the problem it would be you know the problem with the the milk proteins that would be causing an issue uh because fat is actually very very beneficial and it triggers the release of fat in your fat cells as opposed to the deposition of fat in your fat cells so I would still try to eat until you're full still try to get a good fat content uh but you can try sub you know eating just eating fatty meat and just doing it that way uh or or supplementing with like beef Tallow grass-fed beef Tallow instead of butter and see how you go because it could be that you're reacting to the milk proteins [Music] um let's see okay uh another question from Kim can you talk about f again and maybe go deeper into explaining folate levels in blood B12 Etc also the intrinsic factor in digestive enzymes intrinsic the intrinsic factor in the digestive enzymes digested system sorry I assume carnivore will improve and possibly reverse issues well it'll do a lot for that um it will allow your body to absorb a lot more things you're not bringing in like the antinutrients and the and the different you know Proteus Inhibitors and things like that that come in plants so your body's GNA actually absorb what you need uh intrinsic factors is released in your stomach and that's what binds to B12 and allows your stomach to absorb it if you don't have if you don't have intrinsic factor then you can't absorb B12 and even though you're getting a lot of B12 in your diet you're still going to get uh pernicious anemia and so that's something to know about generally that's not a problem unless you've had some sort of like infection or surgery that has removed that part of your body and then you you can't absorb B12 and you have to get B12 shots for the rest of your life which is pretty um pretty tough but um folate folate uh testing is a bit difficult because uh the serum levels aren't very accurate and so you really have to check your red blood cell your arthrite folate levels because that's where it's active it's active in the cell and so you want to check the levels in the cell you know we think there if it's this level in the serum then it that equates to this level in the cells but not always some things you can test like that and it's and it's fairly accurate you know like sodium or potassium but other things uh not so much in Fage one of them um magnesium is also one of them as well as zinc you want you want to check the urethra site or red blood cell RBC zinc magnesium folate to get an accurate uh reading on that and also whenever you're taking lab test you you need to do it in a consistent manner um you need the best thing to do is have the same time of day same um fasting status same hydration level right so so what we recommend uh in our Clinic is first thing in the morning sort of between 9 and 11 in the morning fasting don't eat anything that morning and uh probably don't eat anything after 10 o'clock the night before and then drink at least two glasses of water and no more than four glasses of water okay so you're having consistent hydration fasting and timing that's going to give you more accurate tests and a a test is only as good as a retest you get one test and go oh my goodness this is this thing's off or this thing's whatever well it could be just a glitch it could be something just weird that day so in six to8 weeks you get a test again and you check it again if everything's accurate if or everything's consistent well then you know you have pretty good uh basis for saying that that's um that that's what your your levels are so I would do it that way and um and then you obviously have to look at um at how you're doing these tests as well because people just check for folate they don't realize you need to check it in the cells so Raymond thank you very much uh for the super chat um says Dr Smith says you need to need some soluble fiber to get rid of bile and that is the reason why long-term carnivore will not work what is your take on that um I I think that he is assuming a fact that's not in evidence as they say in law why do we need to get rid of V you know I mean he's he's he's saying that we we need need soluble fiber to get rid of bile okay well soluble fiber does bind bile and it we'll get rid of it why do we need to get rid of bile bile is not a waste product your body makes bile on purpose it expends energy and nutrition and resources to make bile so why are we just assuming that that bile is bad for us um if you the reason that people said that you should eat fiber to bind bile and to uh get rid of bile is because cholesterol is used in bi cholesterol is used in a lot of things every single cell in your body is made out of cholesterol the cell membrane in of every cell in your body is cholesterol nearly every hormone in your body is made out of cholesterol vitamin D is made out of cholesterol testosterone made out of cholesterol estrogens progestogens uh cortisol all the all the all the hormones made out of your uh in your adrenals and and all the steps in between they're like 27 steps between cholesterol and uh testosterone every single one of those steps is an active hormone in your body every single one is made out of cholesterol but we've said that cholesterol is bad for us let's do all these things to reduce our cholesterol and bile is made out of cholesterol that's one of the things that bile is made out of including your brain by the way and so the idea was that you should eat soluble fiber to bind the bile and this would lower your cholesterol and it does but is that a good thing well no actually because all those studies saying that cholesterol was bad for you uh have been shown to be fraudulent and that's you guys can look at my um my video that I did on YouTube and my podcast called uh the hard facts about cholesterol and heart dis and heart disease and I talk about all the studies and and the the hard evidence that shows that this was fraud and and I I I give the links in the description so you guys can you know you can check for yourself and see this is this is um uh just a matter of record now that this was this was fraud uh the USDA fraudulently claimed that cholesterol caus heart disease we know that and because we have the contract between the sugar companies and the head of the USDA he was a professor at Harvard and we know how much they got paid we know how much the sugar companies paid this absolute monster to lie and falsify records and data and studies to make it look as if cholesterol caused heart disease when is really sugar they paid him $6,500 back in the 1960s that's it that's worth that's worth $50,000 in today's valuation so that's that's what that's what his um his soul was worth and that's what the health of the of the uh the world was worth to him so um when you have things based on a false preposition you have to throw everything out and start from scratch and so that's one of them you say oh we need eat fiber so that you can bind bile so that you can reduce fat or reduce cholesterol but cholesterol is not actually was not actually the problem that it was throw it out so you know if you're if you're worried about your cholesterol uh then sure eat some Fiber you'll reduce your cholesterol I am not worried about my cholesterol in fact the only worry that I have is that I don't have enough cholesterol because it's actually super good for you you know all the studies are showing that people with higher LDL cholesterol live longer live healthier and so I'm just fine uh keeping my bile because it's physiological and it's there to absorb fat which is a necessary nutrient hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own question please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest of the Q&A um question uh what do you think about using coconut oil for its MCT and is there any MCT found in Amal products yeah there's a lot of MCT that's midchain medium chain fatty acid or medium chain TR glycerides so um medium chain fatty acids these are uh good these are are necessary for a lot of different things uh your body actually can absorb them pretty easily your body needs bile to absorb pretty much all fats except uh medium chain fatty acids a lot of medium chain fatty acids I don't know if it's all of them and um but it uh it does a good job at absorbing those um otherwise but the vast majority of fat goes out of your body um unless you have bile uh to absorb it uh I don't think you need coconut oil I don't think you need any plant oil at all I think that um that that you'll get everything you need from meat you just eat naturally and and your body will do the rest there are uh MCTS in meat um I I don't know the exact proportion versus coconut oil but I I don't much care um there are other things in coconut oil and the plant oils like um uh plant Esters that um or um what's it called um basically plant um plant cholesterols and they and they sort of bonding these same things and they and they replace some of the cholesterol you don't absorb this cholesterol and sort of um sort of is like a mimic or an antagonist so um this is what people say it's like oh you should eat these you should eat almonds because or or these other sort of plant um you know plant cholesterols because your body doesn't use them in the same way and it sort of displaces cholesterol but it's the same thing again cholesterol is not bad for you you don't want to lower it and um you know so so that's the thing so it it it may have MCTS in it but it's going to have things that you probably don't want it's going to screw with your cholesterol and other sorts of things as well um so I I don't have it anyway if you want to you know it's not it's not as bad as like you know other things like you know olive oils certain canola oil and all that sort of uh garbage but I just stick with meat meat fat lard all that stuff um from Jared Dr Kilts mentioned in his interview with you about the glycobiome and glycobiology do you have anything to say about this topic it was a bit over my head and the resources uh that I can understand and find myself uh find myself are rather scarce uh yeah no I I I think it's a very interesting uh point to make you do have a glycobiome and this is this is a a and it's um and you have and you have this in a lot of other areas of your body it's not it's not just in your GI tract and so this is sort of an intricate web of um of molecules that sort of have a sort of protective sheath en coating and I don't I don't know all the functions that it that it has I'm sure it's quite um quite a lot of them but it's not something I've studied in too much detail but it's it's an important part of your of your uh anatomy and your physiology and biology so uh you know when you damage that and you damage that structure like you know the glyx and things like that it's [Music] um it's uh it's going to you know it's just going to it's just going to mess with your your physiology and the way that your your body functions and that's going to have you know you know Untold sort of uh consequences as a result of that and um and he was talking about all these different things in plants that absolutely terrorize you know the glyx and your black biome and um so yeah no I I thought it was very interesting it's definitely something I need to look into more as well um and to get uh to get more familiar with but no I I I don't I don't um um yeah I don't I don't have too much to add to that because he he knows just so much more more than I do about that so uh just just check out his videos um on that and uh you know because that guy that guy uh knows his stuff uh um skipped again so question is any way to replace the fat in your body made from vegetable oils you ingested faster uh I heard half life of fat cells is around four to five years does this mean I have to wait tennish years to replace them you know yeah no I don't think so you know it's your body your body's replacing molecules all the time and so you know you're going to be you're going to be um you know you know churning through and getting rid of sort of that you the the unhealthy bits of bits of body and cell uh that you've had from before and replacing with more healthy tissue and and uh and ingredients and structure so uh no I don't I don't think it's going to take all that long um uh a lot of people you know are doing a lot better you know within within months you know you're you're gonna you're going to replace a lot of this stuff I don't I don't think you have to wait for your your fat cells to die to then then make u a make new ones I actually I'm not um I'm not too sure you actually your fat cells actually do die uh or I'm not too sure that you actually make them as well was my understanding that you you make as many fat cells as you're ever going to have uh after you know in your adolescence and then at after that they just grow bigger as opposed to multiplying hypert and um and uh dividing um you know may maybe they do uh but um it was my understand at a certain point they become pretty pretty permanent but in any case you know what whatever it's doing um I don't think that you need to wait for them to die and grow new ones you just need to you'll just replace those molecules and those fat stores that are in there that that'll be fine that'll do that on its own so just yeah just do your thing just do car eat what you're supposed to eat your body your body will do the rest your body's amazing I mean there's just billions of chemical interactions going on in your body you know every single millisecond and so you know just just just let it do its thing it'll be fine uh from Wendy I was talking to my mom about my hair loss and she said uh remember meat especially beef is high in alpha lupic acid um they say that the only bad thing it does is make your hair very thinned out this be a reason for hair loss I don't know uh myself I'm not familiar with that uh but I I don't know I I have noticed the exact opposite um I've notic a lot of people the exact opposite um you know most people when when they go cornival they come to me and go oh my God my hair has never been this good my nails have never been this strong my skin is so amazing uh so I I generally see the opposite of that um but that's not something that I've heard before that there was a problem specifically with beef um but if she has any articles or any papers or anything like that that um that talks about that I'd be uh very interested in uh reading them if you wanted to send them over and I can take a look uh what are my thoughts on using glycine as a sweetener I've never used it I don't um so I haven't really thought about it is a short answer um you know I mean I is glycine all that sweet I don't know maybe it is uh I don't I I just don't worry about sweeteners like um you know I think meat just tastes good and I think water tastes good and I think when you start chasing these sweet flavors and sweet tastes um you just you know you just start becoming sort of uh mentally addicted to these things again and and you want that flavor and you chase that taste and um you know it's always these um these saying like you know when when your expectations meet your reality that's where happiness is right and when you're you know when your reality exceeds your expectations that's that's when you're you're really living a good life but when your expectations far exceed your reality that's that's when people get very upset and so if you're constantly thinking like oh can I get something sweet can I get something this can use that as a sweetener this as a sweetener that you're constantly you know uh wanting something that isn't really going to be a good idea for you and and you're just you're just going to be unhappy with it uh I think that it's better to just really appreciate the food that's good for you and just you know just enjoy that and uh you know that that's what I do so I make meat taste as good as I can I you know I age it I prepare it I do things um in preparation to then have it be just unreal amazing steak and uh and so I don't I don't really worry about anything else so I can't I can't see anything Tech necessarily wrong with using glycine as a sweetener um so if you want to try it I guess but um I yeah just I would I would try to just e eat Whole Foods I think that's always the best way to go is just just eating food as it comes and drinking water um there's a general question how long before taking Bloods should you to stop taking any supplements to ensure that you get the picture of what you're naturally deficient in um well I mean there's sort of there's sort of a couple parts to that question first of all why are you taking the supplement if you're taking the supplement because you're you're deficient um you want to be taking the supplement like the day before um because that will give you that will tell you what your levels are at with the supplement if you want to just stop taking the supplement and see what you're doing normally um it depends on the supplement it depends on what you're doing if it's like like a vitamin or a mineral if it's fat soluble versus versus water soluble but you know giving it a good sort of six to eight weeks probably be perfectly fine for anything um and so that's what you could do um if it's sort of water soluble things you probably don't need to wait more than than a couple weeks but you can um uh if if that's what you want to do if you just want to if you want to come up the supplements to see if you actually even need to take the supplements which I think is a good idea I think that um you shouldn't take supplements unless you have a a diagnosed deficiency in something and um and uh so yeah you can try like six to eight weeks off of the supplements and then uh check it from there so here you go [Music] and let's see all right so bodybuilding on Carnivore under 2,000 calories a day will my body fat be used to build or do I need to eat more about 35% body fat uh I think I think you just well in in those sorts of areas I mean you need to make sure you're getting enough fat but you also need to make sure you're getting enough protein uh and so I would I I really uh hesitate when people are talking about like they eat this specific calorie they have this specific calor caloric intake because it's like is that because that's what your body's telling you to do or is that because that's what you're limiting yourself to uh I think that even if you have excess fat your body is still going to want a certain amount of nutrition and it yes it will prioritize using your your body fat first and the problem with that is that if you if you eat too little your body's GNA just say oh hey you know what we need to store this we need to pull this back because we're in a famine and you know we don't need we need to protect this or we're going to die uh of starvation if we if we sort of burn through all of our you um nutrition and our calories so uh yes you do need to take in uh adequate protein and adequate fat um and uh you know so you need to you need to get those amino acids in you need to get those proteins in to build muscle um but uh you also just need to eat enough or your body is not going to uh really burn the fat because it's not going to release the the fat because it's going to think that you're starving so you need to be careful with that and u i I would still just eat intuitively and just make sure you're getting enough protein and enough fat [Music] um yeah I I I agree with that Christian said um as long as you're eating enough macros fat and protein you don't need to worry about the number of calories I I agree with that so Andy asks uh any advice on introducing on inducing bowel movements please I have stopped getting them so it's hard to go due to my very sedentary lify style because of illness I eat high high fat meat and Eggs only um well I mean how long is it going between each ones like you know it's very normal to only go once a week and have not have there not be that much and if you're not eating like a lot of gristle then you know you're you're going to you're going to go even less you know because you're going to absorb basically everything that you eat if you're if you're not eating gr if you're only eating meat and you're not eating the gristle so you know I I would just be patient if you're getting enough fat and your stools are soft then you're not constipated so it doesn't matter how long it takes before they go I I think people get very caught up in oh I have to go I have to go I have to go why do you have to go are are you in pain is your stomach bloated you know are you vomiting have you stop passing passing wind because those are all signs that you have you know an obstruction and then oh my God you need to go and you need to take a LAX and get this thing unblocked but that's not happening if your stomach's flat and you're not bloated and you're not in pain why why do you need to go eat enough fat things will go trust me and um but I just I just don't worry about it is is basically what you should be um is is the long and short of that uh thank you thank you very much Luis for the Super Chat this very kind of you um one year on strict carnivore one year old onstay carnivore would long-term negative uh affect his insulin sensitivity that if he chose not to do carnivore anymore when he grows up uh would that be terrible for him absolutely not that' be the best thing that you ever did for him that is my my firm belief that you know humans really are carnivores this is how we are designed and when you eat what you're supposed to eat eat especially when you're developing you you going to develop better stronger larger more intelligent your brain will be bigger and it will work better right because it'll have Better Stronger Faster connections okay those are all benefits of a carnivore diet especially when you're developing it's so important and so um I would definitely do that and uh no it's not going to affect his insulin sensitivity th this is this is something that's been going around um that's a bit silly they think that they say well well you have to eat carbohydrates because you have to have this metabolic flexibility and you have to sort of go back and forth that's that's not the case you can um this is all derived from some studies that that showed that if you if you're not eating carbohydrates for a long period of time and then you do a glucose tolerance test which is how they test for diabetes and insulin resistance they that you um that you take that glucose tolerance uh glucose hit right big sugary drink and you all of a sudden your your glucose spikes right your blood sugar spikes because your body's not able to handle it you're oh my God this person's diabetic oh they just can't handle it uh keep doing it because in a couple days it's dead normal and in fact in fact they have better control because your body's more is more sensitive to the insulin the what's happening physiologically and this is something that Professor bman uh um relayed to me was that when you don't eat carbohydrate when you're eating carbohydrates your body actually preloads your pancreas with ready-made insulin because it's just it's expecting that next hit of sugar right of carbs and so it's just ready to go because car high blood sugar is deadly it's toxic and so your body's just like okay no we got to be ready for this you know attack is coming we got to be there and um and so when you're eating carbs it just hits it out there fine when you're not doing that your body's like oh thank God you know uh we're just we can just be normal and then all of a sudden a bunch of glucose comes in you're body okay all right so it makes the glucose and it takes a while for that to catch up um but then when you keep doing that then it just uh it will it will start pre-loading your your pancreas with insulin so after a couple days you're actually you're actually better off uh than than other people who that just eating carbs all the time no it's not bad for him no it will not screw with his his insulin sensitivity uh I think it's absolutely the best thing you could do for your kid and that's exactly what I will be doing with my kids when I have them 100% 100% there will not be a single plant product in my house and in a 10 mile radius if I can help it uh yamy asks and thank you very much yamy for the Super Chat I appreciate it uh any reason I'm getting bloated on a carnivore diet I eat omad after weight training then drink water how do I fix this that's a good question I mean I I need to know a few other things I need to know exactly what you're eating uh and um exactly when when you're eating it as well uh how long you've been doing this you know the the background you've come from previously if you're having any dairy if you're having any fruit or honey or any of those sorts of things any fiber at all will make you bloated coffee all these things will mess with your digestion um so generally people have the opposite issue with that or not even issue they have the opposite phenomena uh which is they they never get bloated and all of their bloating stops so I would I would start with that if you're eating anything besides just you know meat eggs and water um then uh then I would I would stop eating those things and just stick with meat and water and um and if you you know one another thing too is you could if you're eating a big meal and you're eating till you're full and then you drink a bunch of water you're just going to feel physically too full so I I tend to not drink water sort of within you know an hour or two before and after I eat because I want my stomach to be empty so that that you know my body says like this is how much food I want and then you let it digest and you keep the you keep the uh the stomach acids and and digestive enzymes in their in their true potency and then you get you get the the digestion that you want and uh and then after that you drink the water and things like that so I I would try that just sort of troubleshooting um but yeah I I would need to know a bit more about that to give you more specific advice [Music] um so I at deer meat and beef in the morning doing it since January no Dairy I do dry fast during the day H okay um and absolutely nothing else H well oh hey Claudia from Ventura very nice to see you yeah yeah I've um yeah that's awesome I love Ventura haven't been there in freaking years though um well yamy I don't uh yeah I don't know uh tried without water and haven't seen a difference really so the bloating is you you feel that you have a distended abdomen and that it's uncomfortable and you're getting you know gas and bloating and things like that is that what you're describing or or what sort of what are you what are you feeling what are you calling bloating is it is just sort of pain and discomfort um is it a sharp pain could you have an ulcer um things like that because it is quite uncommon and if you're just eating meat which it sounds like you're just you're doing everything right then um then it's uh it's a bit of a mystery there might be something else going on uh like stomach upset like gastritis or um or maybe an ulcer or something like that something that when you eat you you you end up bothering Yourself by doing that and Lis thank you very much Super Chat Lis my favorite carnivore guy thank you Anthony thank you I appreciate it um YY yes it's visually bloated and it feels very uncomfortable no pain just very tight that's very odd that is very very odd something's not agreeing with you right so um I just change up what you're eating try things that that aren't doing that to you um you can try eating later in the day uh I certainly feel better when I don't eat in the morning that's just me so maybe you could try that just or not eating as much um and eating different things I would just I would just play around with it because that that's abnormal um most people have the opposite issue so I would um I would try that obviously get rid of any any plant that exists in your life any dairy that exists in your life anything besides just raw or or you know whole meat and water and and then play around with it and try different meats and see see if something's not reacting hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I

Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys so JC Spade said I asked you a question on Twitter about sorry I'm not really on Twitter as much I'm trying to get more active there but it's it's I I find it a harder interface like you're trying to go into like the you you see that people have commented on your post and you try to go in there and it doesn't actually show you the comments that they made and it's like I'm sure there is a way of doing that but I haven't found it and uh and then it just goes down some weird other little rabbit hole and there's like threads on threads on threads and like this comment and then people comment on that comment but it doesn't stay in the same comment thread it just goes down as different track I just I think it's I'm sure there's an easy way of dealing with it that I just don't know about but for not knowing about it it's not as intuitive as I would like and it really kind of bugs me so I hav haven't used it that much um but he asks um I've been taking green tea tablets for over 25 years and feel it's been a GameChanger in my life is green tea okay for us I love everything carnivore I look it it may confer a benefit when you're eating other things uh I don't but it's also going to have things that are harmful to you you know that's just that's just the nature of plants and so I think it would it would probably benefit you to come off of it if you're on a cornivore diet maybe it makes you feel better when you're when you're eating other things and that sort of all mixes together and and on on the whole you feel better uh you know adding that in when you're in that situation but if you if you're just eating meat I don't think you need it and I think that it will have things with it that cause harm you know caffeine alone is you know that's an insecticide that's what that that plant designed that for millions and millions and millions of years ago long before humans came around so I just I would be hesitant to use that uh and so I don't I don't use that or any other plants and uh but you can try you just try try coming off it for a month and see how you go and if you think that you know it it adds something to your life then fine you know I think that it would Pro it will probably detract more than anything uh so Senator Maguire thank you very much um for the Super Chat I appreciate it um is that is that a real Senator I don't know tell me uh looking for recommendations on ending my Pepsi addiction drinking one liter a day uh everything else is water and beef carnivore for 12 months lost 60 pounds awesome very good uh weight is stable thank you for the vids um from Las Vegas awesome well thanks for for for joining in um yeah so I mean that you know it is an addiction right so like caffeine is addictive and sugar is very addictive so these are things that are going to um you know compound the problem and and work together to uh make it difficult to stop but you know that's a lot you know that's a lot of sugar it's a lot of caffeine and there's a lot of other chemical you know slop in there that you really don't want as well um I think just just I mean you could you could try weaning down and just you know limit yourself to sort of half a liter a day for a week or two and then down to you know just one Pepsi a day like a 12 oz can of Pepsi a day and then you just stop uh I'm I'm sort of like a you know I don't I don't really do things in half measures myself and so usually I feel better I just stop I made a decision you have it in your head I'm just going to stop another thing is that if you're having cravings like sugar Cravings carb Cravings that um if you just eat fatty meat sometimes that can help suppress the the urges and the um cravings and so just you know just like when you're like oh I really want a Pepsi have some eggs you know or have some beef really yeah beef usually do beef and water which is awesome that's that's definitely a way to go um and uh you know looks like you're doing great you've lost 60 pounds you're keeping your weight stable that's awesome I I think you'll you'll increase your um you your results and how good you feel by by getting rid of the Pepsi as well so make a plan and stick to it so it's one of one of the two ways either half a liter for the next uh week drop down to one can for a week and then stop or just stop right now and but mark it on your calendar whatever you do you know write it down write in your calendar say this is what I'm going to do these are the days I'm going to do it and then you just do it um and uh you know it's it it it's um it takes a bit of doing but all addictions will end and eventually that chemical addiction will go away it's usually about 2 weeks for for um caffeine you can get headaches and be symptomatic for a few days it generally doesn't last more than a week uh and then you don't even really get the Cravings after about two weeks sugar can be two to three weeks uh for me it was about two weeks that was about it uh most people find that as well some people have have cravings and and sort of really sort of want want it longer than that you know um and so you just have to be mindful of that but you you need to stay strong also remember if you're getting Cravings it could be your brain just telling you that you're hungry U especially after the chemical addiction after those sort of two weeks are gone because uh sometimes we just don't eat enough on a carnivore diet because our hunger singals are different and we haven't relearned them yet we haven't paid attention to them enough and so sometimes it just goes um uh your your hunger signals sort of come in as as Cravings your body your brain's just saying hey get energy you know and so just remember that and so if you're having sort if you're having cravings going forward just remember that that could be that what that is and just try eating meat first and uh and drinking water and things like that hopefully that helps so Charlie asks I've been suffering with chronic sinusitis for the last three years and I have had a number of surgeries I'm a month into carnivore still having a lot of issues with inflammation do I just give it time definitely give it time it takes a long time to to clear your body of all these problems you can have a problem with inflammation and um and like just reading that gave me a running notse um you can have problems with h inflammation but you know it goes away it does go away pathological inflammation goes away uh absolutely does but um you know all these all these issues take time and you know chronic custis is is an absolute Beast to get rid of it's um it it can you know get into the bone and just sort of just sit there and just keep coming back and keep coming back so you just need to be mindful of that and um uh but you know going carnivore is going to help your body it's going to help your immune system and if you need some extra help with like antibiotics and things like that to clear it then they'll work better anyway so yeah just keep doing what you're doing and just give it time and let your body heal and uh hello for from Texas hey how you doing American 1020 carniv four months in let's go awesome good job I bet you're feeling awesome at the moment that's like sort of like the sweet period where you're just coasting and feeling feeling your best so that's great uh Baro says no more diabetic no more hypertension no more migraines no more sinusitis the list goes on awesome that's that's absolutely fantastic um yeah so I I I love seeing that where just you know people's lives are just getting so much better and um that's really really good to see so I'm glad to see that [Music] um yeah so Nick says uh a few months ago I was having cravings so bad at night time that I would leave my house to go to the grocery store to get ice cream at 9:00 p.m. slamming meat at night was the only thing that helped so I think that's a very very useful comment um and and illustration that this can be um you know very benefited by just eating meat and that sometimes your brain's just saying you know get something and look I I've been there I I've actually I actually remember sort of my late teens early 20s uh thinking it's just like oh my God I just need something sweet I need some ice cream I need something and like going off and and getting something like that and uh it's it's weird you have this weird compulsion you just have to get it and then you just eat meat and it goes away um so I don't know if it's the the sugar addiction that's doing that or your body's just your brain is screaming at you to get some fat because everyone was eating low fat forever because that's just what we were told to do I always have the snipples doesn't the carnivore fix that I have the sniffles because I've broken my nose hundreds and hundreds of times in rugby over over the course of of two of a decade and a half um so you know that's just you know my face is broken unfortunately so um I've had I've had three surgeries just so I could breathe properly because the cartilage is just so broken and Tangled Up Inside My Face um because I just kept playing I kept playing with broken nose bone was split from here up to my eye eye socket and it was flat on the side of my face it just busted it back into place I had to do that you know I I did that on the side of the field a few times and I've gone to the ER and they've broken it back in stuck a tuning fork up my nose broke it back into place um and then had three surgeries to fix the cartilage and and the the bone because that is uh that's that's what I did to myself because I I wasn't willing to stop I wasn't willing to stop playing I just I just you know just wanted to you know get out there and do it and so because I had a fullon openly broken bone and broken cartilage and I just I was a very very very physical player like I live for the contact and the collisions like I just just tried to blow people up and um and so you know I figured out early on that if you hit someone harder than they hit you they take all the punishment and so it's just a matter of just intelligence you know just to be the hitter and not the hit e and when I was smaller than people and like playing in in you know you know senior leagues when I was you know 17 uh people were twice my size and so I had to I had to just really rev up the intensity and the velocity because think of think of your your K kinetic energy um equations it's 1 12 mass times velocity squared right well I didn't have the mass but velocity counts for a lot more so I I was like great all right I'll just crank up that velocity up to Absolute you know highest I can and just waste into somebody and so that's what I did and so people were twice my size I just just blow them blow them up and then when I started growing into my frame and getting bigger and getting heavier and being one of the bigger guys out there I still had that mentality of just trying to just destroy people and you know so it made for some big big collisions and um which was fun was fun to to do and fun for people to watch and uh but because of doing that you know I'm just shattering my faith you know all all over the place but yes I always do have the sniffles because it's not always always but if I get like a little bit of allergies or something like that it just it's very easy to do it because my nose just doesn't clear properly JB highlights I wish I had them I I have some highlight tapes um a lot of them Just Got U because it was like I was doing most of this like before things were really big on the internet putting a bunch of clips and things like that on there um and uh and a lot of games especially like the US games like they just didn't get uh recorded a lot of these games didn't get recorded and so um I there were there were a lot of things actually on the internet for a while um and uh and then I remember checking them you know a few years ago and I I couldn't find them for whatever sites they were on they just been taken off they weren't like on on I don't think they're on YouTube not but under my name anyway I don't think um but uh yeah so there used to be a lot more than there are now but yeah I don't know whatever websites were had them up they're not uh maybe not in use anymore I don't know [Music] um so keto Elite reversed uh their pre-diabetes arthritis carpal tunnel ttis and and tenus is getting better cognitive function is skyrocketing awesome and thanks to all your wonderful content I am sharing with everyone well thank you very much I really appreciate that I'm really glad that it's helping and that you're having such good results and I appreciate you sharing things up uh with people and hopefully it helps them as well which I'm sure it will um Carson has Hashimoto when to taper off the AL thyroxine that should be dictated by your blood tests so uh it will happen you know you will your hashimotos will get better hashimotos can take a little longer than other things takes longer than Crohn's and all of colitis however it does happen it does get better and um just be patient with it but check your check your Bloods and if you're feeling you know a bit jittery and and uh and uh you know like you're you're having too much uh thyroid medication then that's the time to get another blood test and say hey you know what what is this doing uh another good marker is uh reverse T3 you can get your doctor to ask for a reverse T3 that shows better um gives you a better idea of the intracellular uh function of of the thyroxin of the thyroid hormone so because that's again where this thing functions is inside the cell not in your not in your serum so um getting a reverse T3 can show you exactly how um functional the thyroid medication you're taking is um but yeah so that that should be that should be guided by your doctor and your blood tests um chargeing over so say responded to my request for an interview a couple of times but never got a response maybe the email systems have failed um that is interesting I do remember getting your email and I thought I replied so I'm sorry about that I will uh get on that right away and and reply but definitely want to get you on a podcast that would be awesome um one of my thoughts on egg whites um I don't have a problem with them a lot of people don't have a problem with them uh some people do and so especially people with autoimmune issues a lot of people with autoimmune issues for some reason have problems with egg whites and so if you're having a little issue you're having some little skin issues or rashes or you know fullon autoimmune issues uh take out the egg whites see how that does see what that does for you most people with autoimmune issues really just need to stick to like grass-fed red meat uh as close as they can anyway you know grain finished red meat uh being again silver metal but you know red me anyway so where do I announce these live chats normally I do these on uh well normally I do these for patreon um and so actually today was supposed to be a patreon one and uh it wasn't actually working um and so I had to like restart it and Rego and I actually meant to have it be just uh from people that had a link uh and not have it be a general one uh but I ended up not hitting the correct one because I am a useless person at at this sort of stuff because I'm just sort of trying to figure it out as I go um and this ended up being just a a general live so um that's how that happened but normally I I do these um every week for my patreon group which is just Anthony chaffy MD and people can sign up there and I do I do lives every week or twice a week really and uh and we do I I post my videos there early and we have um Discord groups and chat groups gr there uh just with our our community and uh we do like you know we start up like a book um book club and things like that to um to uh read different sorts of things that that help bring um more information to this space of health and nutrition and um I think the next next month we're going to be reading Nina Ty Schultz's book The Big Fat Surprise which is uh I think is very uh kind be very interesting I haven't read it yet myself U but it's uh from the bits of it I've seen it's absolutely packed with uh with information and studies and uh uh historical data on on how ridiculous this whole idea of fat being bad for us was um so CJ saying she's or they are I don't I don't know sorry CJ I don't know um if your guy or girl I apologize um they are obese high cholesterol HBP high blood pressure I'm assuming um type two diabetes and thyroid what do you advise I would advise eating nothing but uh red meat and only drinking water and letting your body heal because all of those issues are caused by having uh eating the wrong things uh high cholesterol in your case probably is bad because it's damaged cholesterol from the sugars and uh and other other toxins but um if your cholesterol sort of changes a bit as long as your HDL is going up and your triglycerides are going down then don't worry about anything else but you need to be strict strict strict red meat and water uh really for the rest of your life but at least for the next two years uh so that you can really just get rid of this stuff or at least the at least the next year and then you can make your decisions from there if you want to start eating the things that got you back in that place in the first place then that's your business but um that's how you get rid of that is you stop eating the things that put you there and you start eating the things that your body actually needs which is fatty meat fatty meat and water and Mad Max hey thank you uh Max I really appreciate the super chat um very generous of you thank you great info Doc and thank for your time well thank you I really appreciate it thank you guys all for uh for taking your time out to watch my live um if you want to do more of these then check out my patreon page it's just Anthony chaffy MD we do these every week we do these twice a week generally and uh and and we do a lot more than that as well and so hopefully um we can get a lot more of these lives going as well I can't do the public lives all that often uh just just for time commitments but I I always make it a point to do this with um with my patreon groups and answer all the questions that they that they have so [Music] um so yeah so all right thanks guys I I do have to wrap up because I've got um I've got another uh appointment I'm doing um sort of a live thing with um it's like a uh some it's like a sort of interview sort of thing with uh CrossFit USA we're doing like a project where we're doing working with sort of two groups of people and there's like a carnivore group they're exercising and checking their all their biomar um you know metabolic markers and things like that and um and I'm helping them coach that and then we're doing like a a thing tonight and so that starts in sort of the next sort of 101 15 minutes so I got to go get ready for that but people can go check that out if you go to to um uh what is it CrossFit USA on Instagram there's some links there and you can you can come check that out um and uh and then we'll we'll do some more lives another time and uh yeah hopefully everyone liked that I will answer this because because um hack KN sh night TI did sort of get this one in uh under the buzzer uh thank you very much for the Super Chat uh should we be worried about bacon my girlfriend thinks pork is poisoning me and I and I Source all my pork from a local Farm uh no pork is not poisoning you there there have been no um confirmed cases of drosis in uh the pig um farmed Pig in America in over 20 years and I I would imag imagine that's the same in other Western countries as well um bacon can have sugar added so just look at the packet and just see if it has any sugar added or you know maple bacon obviously that's that's kind of have sugar added but if it's just if it's just naturally C cured bacon without sugar like I know um peton Farms does uh you know sugarless bacon and um and so you can get that but yeah know you know the the pig and pig fat is not bad for you okay Wild Bill uh well thank you very much while bill um say thank you Anthony you've helped my anking spondilitis tremendously among other things cheers that's awesome that's something that I really like to see that that's a nasty nasty issue I actually have a friend of mine that I work with in in neurosurgery he suffers from that as well and I I was really I've been really hopeful that he sort of takes this on himself um and fixes his issues but um you know I don't want to I don't want to be pushy I don't want to like push this down Ram people's down throats you know you know they know what I think they know that that I think that eating meat is the best way to go and can reverse a lot of issues um and
