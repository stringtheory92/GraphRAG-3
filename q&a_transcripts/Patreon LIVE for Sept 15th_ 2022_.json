    "transcript": "here all right great so we'll just get going here and if people want to comment um and ask further questions or anything like that please feel free to and otherwise we people have sent in some questions which is uh very great thank you very much for the people that did that and uh we'll just start here from the top as a message this question is from Crystal she says I have come off nearly all of my supplements what are the chances of coming off my HRT now that I'm carnivore so that that depends that depends on you know how old you are and and what you need it for and how you're feeling um you know if you would Jack your hormones will balance better and they and they will uh and you will feel better better hormonally you know we all age and at a certain point our bodies aren't going to be making the same amount of of hormones as they were before and sometimes that's a problem for people and other times it's not um you know there's a very good chance that you would actually feel perfectly well and perfectly fine off HRT on a carnivore diet um so you can trial that I mean your hormones will certainly change and and you can just see how you feel I you know whenever you know someone comes in and they're talking about HRT I was and they always ask me that um I always sort of just say like maybe try carnivore for like three months first and see how you feel and see how it makes you feel and see if you even need it or want it after that because you may not and a lot of people feel really really good and you check their hormones and they're actually all fine so something to think about anyway um that uh you may just feel just fine without them but that's something that only you can decide if you if you feel that uh you you improved going on you know bioidentical hormones to a physiological level that you would have seen earlier in life and that makes you feel better and and and gives you benefits in certain ways then that's something that you can certainly consider but I think that everyone should should at least try carnivore for a few months and then and then just see just see for themselves so that's something that you can test out and hello carnivore veteran hello in Idaho uh question is from well actually and just go back to HRT thing I've I've actually seen people you know in their you know 50s and even 60s like actually just go back to you know Plum normal hormonal panel got you know men and women and well I mean you're not gonna you're not gonna necessarily gonna reverse out of menopause in your 60s but you know women in their 50s have so that's that's also something to be aware of you know uh Dr Barry talks about how uh when he was just getting people on onto a ketogenic diet that women in their 50s like mid 50s hadn't had their you know their uh menstrual cycle in five years all of a sudden they were coming back to him pregnant and they're like what the hell did you do to me and that's because they're just getting so healthy and their hormones were correctly themselves to such a degree just by getting rid of carbohydrates which is a big one for women uh carbohydrates really mess up your with your hormones because it blocks a conversion of testosterone to estrogen and so you'll have too much testosterone not enough estrogen and so you're just getting rid of the carbohydrates just does does wonders for that and all of a sudden these women are getting pregnant so that shows you how much of a change this can this can make and and how much uh you know we can it can you know fix or any hormonal issues and you may not even need HRT you know people in their 20s and 30s are taking hormonal uh fertility medications because they're not able to conceive and now you go just keto not even full carnivore and you know women in their 50s who haven't had a menstrual cycle in five years are now getting pregnant you know accidentally you know so that just shows you how significant this the this this plays in your uh how significant a role this plays so all right uh next question is from Melissa I have hemochromatosis but not problematic and I've treated it with maintenance blood donations to keep it in a healthy range since I was in my 20s every two to three months no additional treatments have been needed are there any special recommendations or things to avoid like organ meat which I don't eat or red meat I've mostly eaten beef venison pork and butter for the last year no I don't think there's anything that you need to avoid per se you know I mean people can have you know genetic conditions and you know other sorts of issues that they have to deal with but I don't think that that would make you I don't think that that would make you uh you know any worse and you know that and then you know what's the sort of the worst thing that can happen you know you you have to donate blood maybe a little more often if it were the case that you was going to spike up your iron levels and your and your hemoglobin levels which I'm not actually convinced that it will because you know there's you know with hemochromatosis you're sequestering um iron to such a degree that you're you're you're you're you're building up your blood levels to uh you know higher than normal levels quite high in some cases if you don't give blood donations but there's a process going on there it may it may be that that's just one to one and you just you know Iron comes in it just doesn't go out and uh without without bloodletting but not necessarily so that's something that I've been I've been curious about uh seeing is if if uh going carnivore and getting into a normal biochemical pattern and and uh nutritional habits will actually change that around so worst case scenario you just keep doing what you're doing maybe a little more frequently but you get a thousand other benefits on top of it all um and actually I would I would be interested to see if you actually needed to do it less you know so maybe let us know how you do but I definitely wouldn't avoid red meat eat organ meat if you want to you don't have to so the same sort of thing would apply I wouldn't do anything differently you know you have you have a different genetic condition but you're still a human and the proper human diet is is meat and especially red meat fatty bread meat so I would just keep doing that and then yeah and then please let me know how that goes and if you find that there's a difference in in your hemochromatosis because I'd be very interested in that right and and do feel free to ask questions in the in the chat box guys um there's uh there's always always happy to take take live questions um from Leandro I am a clinical nutritionist and have a patient on Carnivore to solve issues of ulcerative colitis and long-term antibiotic use for recurrent bacterial issues his liver markers went from normal to quite high in the last six months the last one was trending lower also while on a strict carnivore diet he kept losing weight he needs to gain weight what what should I look for uh as far as the liver markers are concerned you know sometimes you get a bit of an average jump you generally don't see that if you're if you're really eliminating out everything else um you know so I don't know exactly why it's happening in this in this gentleman's case or or this person yeah his liver yeah in this gentleman's case uh but you know like like you say sort of trending down so I would I would expect that I would just keep an eye on that and and just make sure that there's nothing else going on no medications or anything else that could be uh you know sort of uh you know doing something to his liver and and then just keep an eye on it and just and just see how that Trends and if he's not symptomatic and it's trending down then I wouldn't worry too much about that um and then the losing weight thing he needs to gain weight um it depends on what sort of weight he's losing you know I mean sometimes your body does lose a bit of water weight and you know but but you know after you know several months that that's you know it's not gonna have any more water water weight uh unless you know a unreasonable amount so anything is just it's just making sure he gets enough food he's eating enough food because that's very that's very important it's very easy to under eat on a carnivore diet and so that's that's something you have to be mindful of so just make sure that that he's eating to satiation because that's the thing everyone says well I'm just not hungry so I'm supposed to eat when I'm hungry but I'm not hungry but they don't actually realize they're hungry you know because your hunger signals change dramatically and so if he's if he's just saying oh well I'm just not hungry like my dad said this is like I haven't felt hungry in the last year and I was just like right but you know that's because you're not you know feeling experiencing hunger in the same way and so you have to relearn your hunger signal so you know if meat tastes good that means you're hungry if you're a little bit tired or or not really feeling um top you know Tip Top then you know you might be hungry so so ask yourself that and then go uh and eat something and try to try eating meat or eggs and see if that helps or see if that that tastes good really is is what you should do so if it tastes good that means that you're hungry your body's giving you a positive feedback to say hey get more of that in you I like that right and so you can you just you just eat to taste and then you sort of get to the point where you just go that doesn't really taste interesting anymore and you can just stop um if someone's working out a lot or you know for other reasons it may be that he needs to eat more than once a day or if he's eating um you know more lean meat and he's not getting very high fat meat then you have to you you will just have to eat more pounds of meat and you may not be able to fit it all in at one time so you may have to you know have have more meals during the day so think about that um and just try make sure that he's eating to satiation make sure he's eating until meat doesn't taste good and to try eating more than once a day if that's the case especially with athletes you know I talked to they're like well I'm losing weight I can't can't lose weight I've got I've got to maintain my melt my weight and it's just like right well first two weeks you're going to lose weight because it's just going to be water weight and glycogen you want that crap out of your system anyway that's not good weight um and then you'll start putting on lean muscle mass but if you're if you're still sort of you know losing weight losing weight that means you're not eating enough okay so you just you need to you need to eat more and you know I was talking to you know Ryan um Talbot who's uh you know All-American decathlete who went who went carnivore and um uh you know I had on my my podcast and and so I I was helping him short early on like he the reason I met him was he contacted me and just said that you know he you know was interested in my videos and he he was trying Carnival because of that he was feeling really good but you know I was helping him sort of through these things and that was one of the things he was losing a lot of weight because the dude was just training you know crazy amounts during the day right because these These are you know D1 uh decathlete and so you know I just say look you just need to eat you need to eat more it was and that was it you know he just you know wasn't really as as conscious of his hunger uh signals and he now he started to eat like more than once a day and uh because he had to because he's just like I mean I I only eat once a day normally if I start working out a lot I have to eat twice a day you know I just I'm not going to get in enough and when I do I I stack on muscle very easily but I have to I have to be able to get it in and it's difficult during the day because I don't like eating a big meal during the day because it makes me lethargic and sort of tired which is normal it puts you into rest and digest as opposed to you know hunt and kill sort of metabolism and so I find that eating like sort of like a half meal is just sort of I'm still sort of it sort of takes the edge off but you know I'm not uh I'm not just stuffed then um then that makes me feel better I have better energy during the day and then I can have a bigger meal at night so just some things to think about but definitely sounds like he's not eating enough if it's been six months and he's still losing weight I mean obviously if he's got if he's got extra fat to lose then that's you know good you know that's not a problem that he's losing weight but if he's you know slim and he's then he's losing weight then that's definitely because he's not eating enough so definitely definitely do that [Music] um so Les uh what is the just in the chats what is the physiology of weight gain and the you and the use of heavy cream um she says I've asked and been told there are carbs in it and that's why is it in the coffee or the cream probably well coffee coffee is going to cause some inflammation and some water retention but you know depending on how much you drink I mean maybe not all that much uh and but also you know caffeine is a bit of a of a suppressant like a a appetite suppressant uh and also like dehydrate you as well so there's a lot of crap going on there but with the heavy cream you know I there aren't really many carbs in heavy cream you know if any but it's um it is something that some people tend to see it may be an inflammation inflammatory sort of thing I mean I don't think it's just a calories thing because your body can only absorb a certain amount of fat and then there's just a spill over your body's not really not going to absorb any anymore and so I don't I don't think that you're going to be over eating fat so I think there's something else going on you know to be perfectly honest I know I don't know exactly but it is something that that some people see I don't have that same issue I don't really use heavy cream all that much but if I were to sort of put it in something I don't really notice too much of a difference um but there yeah there must be something going on there um with the types of proteins that are in in the dairy and you know that's the thing too is that you know you do see people when they sort of add in Dairy they will put on weight and it could be a number of different reasons could be something you know being being triggered by the by the inflammatory proteins that are in that are in uh Dairy which some people have problems with um but also you know you're not getting Complete Nutrition from the dairy you're getting some things that you want and but you're not getting everything and so you know maybe that your body's asking for uh you know more nutrients and it just wants actual nutrients that are in the meat so it say okay so you end up eating about and that's what I noticed too A lot of people when they sort of add in Dairy they end up eating the dairy and the exact same amount of meat that they would be eating otherwise you're just sort of adding in you know sort of more than your body necessarily wants but I don't think it's that really should do with the fat because your body can only absorb a certain amount of fat and so you know there's something else going on there but yeah it's a weird one that people have with that but I have noticed that sometimes when people add in Dairy especially when they're doing regular Dairy need a lot of dairy they they'll they'll put on some weight and um when I you know if I was like I were to drink milk or something like that and I go from being very very lean to getting a bit a bit fluffy I mean like I don't like that all right just come back to just go back to meat um so Ellie says she she has had it uh she doesn't drink it anymore she gained 13 pounds in 10 days okay so that that's gonna be more of an of an inflammatory um inflammatory response and with water weight so that's that's probably what's going on there so that's that's more likely to do with the proteins um if you're getting if you're you're slamming on 13 pounds in 10 days that's that's got to be uh most likely to do with inflam inflammation and water weight which is uh you know I mean uh you know a liter of water weighs a kilo you know so if you're just retaining you know a few extra leaders you know you're that that's you know a few kilos you know so it adds up really quick anyway so that's that's that's more uh likely what's happening there um from Maria uh she just wanted to get my thoughts on fermented foods is it necessary to introduce them EG sauerkraut yogurt sour cream and if so handmade only not the store-bought type it is no it's not necessary to introduce them you don't have to do that and I I wouldn't do sauerkraut you know like the the fermented vegetables fermented milk products um makes it better you know it's you know fermenting uh plants can be a way of reducing the toxicity and and bringing out more of the nutrients and the nutrition and that's and that's fine if you were if you were in a position where you know you were relying on plants to to survive but if you don't if you don't have to and if you're able to you know access and afford meat then just eat meat yogurt sour cream you know should only be used really as a condiment and and sparingly because you know again it's not it's not complete nutrition it's not as perfect as meat and so you know if you want it a bit a bit you know just for flavor make some yogurt or sour cream in with some like you know ground beef you know melt some cheese on on meat fine or eggs or whatever you know fine if that's if that's what you enjoy I would be careful obviously if you make it yourself it's always good you always got to be if you know how to make it obviously you can mess that up and and um and you know get get uh problems with that but if you know how to make it that's always better because you know you know exactly what's going into it you're not adding in a bunch of artificial ingredients or plants or sugar or whatever and and that's you're going to limit you know the what's coming in if you're going to get store-bought stuff or like the sour cream or the yogurt just just look at the ingredients you know if it has more than just milk and cultures don't buy it you know and uh and the sauerkraut I just I would just I would just leave that off completely okay and from Serena many of us like to exercise on an empty stomach or fasting what does Anthony think of a tablespoon of butter before exercise for energy on the carnivore diet and does it break a fast I use my bulletproof water and don't consider my overnight fast to be broken from it um if you if you like that and that's giving you energy and you feel better on it go for it I I like just not having anything besides water in my system when I'm working out especially when I'm playing like a game or you know even even when I'm doing like a presentation or at work like I really I'm much more focused and sharp if I'm if I'm just I just have an empty stomach and it's not about you know being in a fasting metabolism so-called Fast Metabolism or or you know a Fed metabolism it's it's about you know not having blood diverted to my intestines and and having that my metabolism is just like hey you need to go get a kill you need to go do something here's energy go get it whereas you know you eat something you get calories and get nutrition your body goes right take it easy conserve now and you go into a rest and digest mode um you know if you want to do some bulletproof water and you find that that helps with your workouts and you feel good then that's great I I don't like anything personally I just like I just like um just being a completely empty stomach and hungry I was I always told people like I always you know always to play hungry and when I would give advice to people um you know like new players coming through or other people you know they would ask me about things that you know they'd ask me well why aren't you eating what do you eat before a game I was like never never eat before a game always play hungry you know you want that edge that that Killer Instinct I mean like I need to go you know get this done and I got so I've noticed that too like even even at ketokon for instance you know I I was presenting in the afternoon um that for my my uh my big presentation and I was like I didn't eat the whole day because I was like you know I'm taking this I'm doing this the same as if it was game day you know this is that I have competition like go let's go kill this thing and and that's how I approached it so I did it in the same way and I felt much better for that then after that I was like okay that was a relief you know got you know did that it went well and and so I was a bit happier and a bit more relaxed about it and so then um on the Saturday there was the carnivore panel that I was on and I just was and then I was like going around the convention and like there was like you know steaks and snacks and all these sorts of different different things like you know just the meat ones I didn't I didn't go in for any of the ones with all the um artificial sort of stuff or the or the keto stuff I just stuck with just straight up meat um but you know I ate and I ate breakfast and things like that and I was I really regretted it like you know I got up on the stage and I was just like I was in the same mindset I didn't have that you know that edge that um that I like to have when I'm when I'm uh you know doing anything uh you know like competing or uh presenting or even even doing surgery like I like to just be that have that sharp edge on me where I'm hyper focused and and that's why that's how I feel better so but if you want to have a bit of the Bulletproof Coffee with the butter in it and that makes and that makes you feel better go for it you know just just see how you go um there's another question sort of ties in with some of the stuff we were talking about uh previously about you know sort of you know weight loss and diet and oral and hunger and things like that um what is the specific conditions under which you'd suggest priming how would someone know they should use it and do you need to do fasting alongside it so this was this was a question that Simon had in our last uh our last how-to carnivore thing he wanted to talk about priming because this was something he had learned about from like Bella uh steak and butter gang and so he was interested in that because you know several people that were in our how-to carnivore um you know uh 30-day challenge had said you know had been mentioning it and saying that it had actually really helped them sort of get On Track and like really figure out what their body wanted and and how much they needed to eat um it's not something that I that I necessarily do so I don't I don't know too much about it and you know I think that people will use this in different ways and and I I unders I I believe that um that you know like a in Bella's group they they will suggest this to people that are just starting to sort of gauge how much they need to eat and and I think they also do it if they're going to set up like a fast or something like that I I obviously don't don't think you need to fast I think that you get pretty you know I get I think you get all the the benefits of fasting is just from not eating all that other stuff and um and so you know it might there might be a benefit of just not physically not eating for a number of days versus eating carnivore but there aren't really any studies to show that and a lot of the studies that look at just a fasting mimicking diet which is just keto versus fasting actually so very similar results and actually sometimes the the keto diet actually is is a better has better outcomes than than just fasting alone so that that's something what I think about I even talked to Dr uh John jayquish about this and he's a big proponent of fasting and dry fasting and I asked him out I was like you know are there studies that look at like the difference between keto and and or carnivore and fasting do they show a difference he's like yeah we really we really don't have those studies you know so I would be interested in seeing that but at the moment I don't think that there that there's any you know strong evidence to suggest that you need to fast more you know when you're already on a carnivore diet I think that really the benefit comes from just not eating that garbage and and getting into the metabolism we are supposed to be in all the time which is called the fasting metabolism which you know obviously I don't think that that's named correctly I think that that's our primary uh metabolism so the conditions under which you would suggest priming I don't I you know I don't necessarily suggest priming I think that you know I was asked you know is this something that you could see a benefit from and you know sort of putting that context you know I could see that you know if people are first starting out and you know like you know the like the gentleman before who's just losing a bunch of weight and doesn't necessarily realize that he's not eating enough because he doesn't know what hunger really feels like that might having having a regimented approach to eating at least for the first you know sort of week or two might help with that but you could do that just as easily by what I suggested that guy did which is try eating more than once a day and and if it tastes good keep eating the idea of of primary I certainly don't think that you need to force feed yourself anything uh I certainly don't think that you have to eat three times a day if you're just body's just telling you gosh that sounds like a terrible idea no I don't think you need to do that at all I don't think that um uh certainly everyone doesn't need to do this it's just it's just a tool in the in the box that you can use to try and you know uh get down to an optimal um optimal way of eating for you so if if you're fine and you're you're getting good results and you're able to track your hunger signals and you're eating when you're hungry and things uh are tasting good and you're eating until they're not tasting good then then you're not someone that needs to do that um if you're someone that's losing weight you don't know why and you're not trying to and just don't feel hungry all the time and you're thinking like okay well maybe I'm not eating enough you know you can just again just try eating more than once a day and eating until things you know meat stops tasting interesting and because you should never be eating you should never be forcing meat you know when your body's telling you like good God this doesn't taste good if it says if it doesn't taste good that's your body giving you negative feedback saying don't eat this we're done now stop it so you shouldn't go against that I don't think anyway um you know maybe you're taking medications or sick or someone's you know chemo or whatever and their body's just telling them never to eat ever like that's a different situation but but normally normal uh hunger signals when eating carnivore that's your body telling you just to stop we don't need it anymore um but you can try that more than once a day it doesn't necessarily have to be three times a day and I don't think that you know and if you you start off and you sort of have a bite and your body just goes no I don't want it well then that's it you're done you're full you know like it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be any more than that um but just but it I could see it giving a benefit to people in that situation if they're if they're doing a region if they need a regimented approach to really uh um you know structure out exactly how much their body wants uh because it's difficult to tell sometimes I I really under eight when I first did this you know 20 22 years ago 23 years ago now 20 yeah probably still 22. and um you know so you know I I drastically under eight and I just and then months into it I'm like I was losing a ton of weight and I was just started like getting to the point where I'm like like I'm really like I probably need to eat more but I'm like I'm just not hungry uh and so someone told me hey why don't you try eating multiple times a day and see if food tastes good you know that would have changed my life that would have revolutionized my entire my entire being and I probably would have stayed on it um you know the whole time but um it's it's uh not necessarily so it's not necessary to do not everyone needs to do it so I think that it's a very individual and and it can be done in the same it's the same concept used that way as the same concept as just you know eating till you're full and trying to eat more than once a day if that's what you're about you know and see if your body wants any more if it doesn't then don't donate it's not a problem and I noticed that certainly when uh people are losing weight and losing you know fat tissue and when I was sometimes I didn't want to eat at all sometimes I was like I got home after like working out for like you know six hours you know or maybe even more and I was and it was like you know 11 o'clock at night 10 o'clock and I just thought like like oh I need to eat I have to eat because I need the energy because I'm doing I've worked out for six hours today I'm gonna work out for six hours tomorrow like I I have to eat because I need this energy like somehow I would die otherwise you know that you know not realizing um throughout you know my own stupidity that like I had weeks of energy stored in my fat that I could have you know gone on without without eating and without losing muscle mass and so my whole body was telling me don't eat you don't need it like just stop and but I was in that mindset oh I have to but I have to I have to and so I tried I tried sort of waiting and took like two hours to cook this steak like a reverse sear I just took my time with it watched a movie and at the end of it I was like oh well okay it doesn't sound as horrible now and I went and started eating it and I got like a quarter of the way through it I was just like I am just not enjoying this I really had to force myself and I said okay I'm not going to eat this it's just it's just not enjoyable and so I stopped and you know and that was my body telling me to stop and you know the next day you know did my big work I was working out all day you know playing rugby and uh and then got home and and I felt great I felt great doing it and then I got home and I put that stake and had put that steak in the fridge and now it's cold and dry and hard you know the fat is all like you know like hard now and it tasted amazing it was it was just absolutely fantastic and I was like okay that that is significant you know that's my body telling me you know when it's warm it's perfect it's like I have really really you know cooked this thing well you know and um and it tasted horrible right so that was my body saying hey look fatty you don't need to eat this stuff like you know stop stop doing it and so you had I had to get out of that that mindset and and just realize that I could I could listen to my body so I think that's the main the main thing is just listen to your body you know again just keep it simple you know if if you're hungry eat until it you're not and you but you may have to relearn that and so I think that that in in that in that context that priming or that idea of maybe eating more than once a day can be helpful and just realizing that and recognizing that um that you may not understand what hungry feels like yet and so you may have to sort of uh test and and just sort of say okay I'll try eating more but if you get to the point where like I'm really not enjoying this that's it you're done you're primed you know but you know you can but you can give it a shot if you suspect that you're not really eating enough okay so that's that's when I would suggest that I'm not I don't but I'm not really a you know uh you know the main proponent of priming so it's not it's not my thing it's just something that I was asked about so I've thought about it in in those contexts and I and I and that's where I could see it it uh benefiting people so that's um what I would say about that oh do you have any other question and yeah okay so um why so just some general questions why do we seem to need less sleep on Carnivore well because you're getting better quality sleep you know and your your hormones and your patterns are are improved you know and also you're going to have more energy during the day your body's gonna be working better so even if you didn't get enough sleep you're going to feel better anyway because your body's just going to be working better and your energy levels are going to be better but yet you will definitely get better quality sleep I was a terrible sleeper and it was very difficult for me to get to sleep it was difficult to stay asleep I was you know restless and I wouldn't get uh you know even if I had a full night's sleep I'd still wake up you know feeling you know not my best and uh now that's the opposite I feel fantastic and even getting just like a few hours of sleep a night even though that hurts my soul um if I have to do it I have to do it and I can and I can function and I can I can do fine so you know there are limits still like you know if I'm you know sometimes I'll I'll get like two hours of sleep one night and then no sleep the next night and then I'm like in clinic or something I got all the next day and I'm just like just very very uh uh tired and not feeling great but you know I uh most of the time it's uh it's manageable but that's because you're getting better quality sleep and and your energy levels and your body is just working optimally during the day anyway so even if you don't have enough sleep you're still going to be feel better than you would have otherwise uh not eating carnivore so I talked on my zoom about celery powder in bacon and that nitrates are fine but most bacon with nitrates also seem to have ascorbic acid is that okay uh well yeah I mean look as little additives as possible you know is really the way to go and so it's not that you want to go you know go seeking out nitrates it's just to point out that nitrates are in everything and so you know the reason they use celery powder as um you know natural curing is because there's a ton of nitrates in it you know and so you know say oh it's nitrate free but they they're you it's a lie you know they're saying well if it's a natural product it just comes from celery well then that doesn't count um not telling you that they're the reason they use silver powder is because there are more nitrates in it you also make you know nitrates and nitrates like in your in your saliva you know hundreds of times the the quantity that you'll find in in processed meats and bacon so I really wouldn't worry about that uh the ascorbic acid you know that's just another additive that you don't necessarily need uh is it okay probably not going to kill you but I like to keep things you know as as simple and as clean as possible and so I you know bacon is awesome but you know if I if I can't find bacon that doesn't have a bunch of additives and sugar and other things in it and I generally go for pork belly and then I salt that and put it on racks just the same way as I do my steaks and it actually tastes really good or you can smoke them and make your own bacon and that's probably the best thing to do and it's also cheaper um so yeah I just just as a rule of thumb you know is I would just uh you know avoid as much additives to meat as possible but you know ascorbic acid is probably not the end of the world um but again I just that just as a rule of thumb I just sort of avoid as much of that as possible and any up and coming interviews you're looking forward to doing yes absolutely um I'll be interviewing Nina Thai Schultz uh this Friday actually which I'm very excited about Nina is awesome and um I'm really really excited to speak to her and pick her brand I mean she she literally wrote the book on all this you know she wrote The Big Fat Surprise and and um has been really the Forefront of this for a very long time showing the the con that has been laid over people about you know fat being bad for us it just it just isn't it's just not bad for us you know if that makes the animal kingdom Go Round And so you know it's it's it's you know it never made a sense to me even as a kid you know that uh that Inuit would be literally eating blubber and you know just slim and healthy and I was just like well isn't that is that going to give you heart disease isn't that going to kill them and I remember thinking I was like it's okay put a pin in this you know you're a kid you don't know too much but remember this because this this seems important and uh you know and and just looking back you're like well yeah of course you know that's what I said like you know you know wisdom from the mouth of babes it's just because you know kids haven't been uh indoctrinated as as as as adult as adults have you know so they haven't they haven't been told the shape of the world they could actually just see what's there you know and and this is what the outside of the box thinking right the inside the boxes everything that you're um that you're told like well this is this is this is you know this is what it is you know just learn what's in here right and so you think outside the box you sort of assume like okay maybe that's not the limit maybe that's not the edge of of reality and human knowledge maybe there's actually more out here you know maybe I shouldn't stay confined in there and um and then you start start seeing uh you know things that other people don't and kids do that naturally because they don't know the limits they don't know what the box is and so they just look at that and go like well that doesn't make sense they eat blubber why why are they not getting heart disease does that really cause heart disease and you know in eighth grade you know biology you know learn that that every cell in your body is made out of cholesterol it was like why how is cholesterol bad for you if you're if we're made out of cholesterol you know never made sense to me um and so I think that that I may have been just you know primed and ready for this to it when it came out be like yeah no it's actually not a problem it's like yeah it makes sense okay you know and that that wasn't as hard for me to uh you know uh you know sort of undo that that learning and uh you know false education uh because I never I was a bit skeptical of it anyway you know so uh but yeah but Nina Thai Schultz has been has been really showing the evidence for that and and for that as as an actual fraud as opposed to like oh shoot we just got it wrong sorry guys you know I was like no no this this was this was deliberate fraud um so she so she um is uh definitely an interview I'm looking forward to doing um and uh and who else I have um I definitely have others that are coming up that I'm that I'm looking forward to doing as well that I'm just drawing a blank on I'm sorry um oh and um uh zofria Clemens from paleo medicine that you know she's someone that I heard first on Dr Baker's original podcast Human Performance outliers with uh Zach bitter um she was she came on sort of around the same time I I was on there so I think she was like in the 80s or something like that like my my episode with them was like 34 and hers was like 82 or something like that but in the 80s and and I was very impressed by that you know she'd been doing at that point she had already been using like a carnivore diet or at least a keto diet you know to treat cancer and autoimmune and other sorts of things for for like 10 years you know and that was in 2018 you know so that's that's really impressive and and so I'm uh very interested in talking to her and she was also saying that you know they had like you know glioblastoma patients you know these brain cancer patients that she said that that's the only cancer that they don't see that just you know uh really you know regresses uh very well on a carnivore diet that that one but it stays stable it doesn't grow and you know what if you can make a GBM stand still You've Won like that's that's I'll take that as a win because those things are are extremely aggressive and so if you can get that to just sit down and take a nap fine not happy with that so I definitely want to see you should pick her brain on that and now there's another five years of of uh you know data and um and experience that she has on that and so I definitely definitely interested in uh that um so Ellie asks how do you know if you are eating enough uh how much protein should I aim for she's five eight and um and no no that's why Ellie Ellie saying I'm sorry I'm chatty is my first one no I want you to be chatty please do ask questions that's the purpose of these lines is so people can ask questions and it's nice when people you know submit questions obviously because I have something to start with but otherwise you know I I just go off what you guys uh are saying in the chats and so that's very helpful so please please don't feel uh shy about about that um how much protein should be eating uh as much as your body is asking for as much as tastes good you know if you're eating a lot of lean meat that eventually will just stop tasty it'll just start tasting boring you know like I mean think about how you know like like chicken breasts it's not it's not too too interesting you know chicken thigh like oh okay now you've piqued my interest um but even lean steak it tastes good for a bit and then it's just like yeah I think I'm over that but then you start adding some fat anyway oh well hello um so you know you want the fat but you know your body will your body will tell you so just go by taste as well I I don't I don't shoot for any specific number I just even tell I'm full I just see you know until my body says yeah that's enough and for me I eat like two pounds so like a kilo or so of of meat that's fatty and you know when I'm working out a lot I've literally doubled that so you know if I'm if I'm doing that like I'm getting you know hundreds of grams of protein even though most of my calories are coming from the fat you'll get a ton of protein don't worry about that as long as you're giving your body what it what it wants and so you eat to satiation you eat until meat stops tasting interesting and you don't have to worry about that you don't have to count macros you don't have to count calories you don't have to count protein unless you you know like you know Serena has pointed out before sometimes people uh you know if you're not eating enough and you sort of Count Your calories and go like wow I'm really not eating a lot um I was doing that I remember looking out like I'm getting less than you know when I eat I get like less than 400 calories a day and then I'll have like a big meal you know like a couple times a week maybe uh but like most days I really wasn't eating at all and so that was um that was bad and uh and it cost me you know eventually I got to the point where I was just like I was actually feeling worse when I was working out or normally like every time it was better better and better and better and uh and I really like that feeling and then all of a sudden I was just like it was actually taking me down the peg I was like well that's not right and I just was looking at them like I'm not I'm not eating though and that that's probably the problem um so you know but at the same time like I said you know when I was losing uh extra fat uh this last time around you know there was there were days I was just like the thought of eating meat or anything else just sounded abhorrent you know and so that that can be a thing as well but as long as you're you know at least trying you know just try something that should be fine so if if you're getting if you're getting you know if you're taking in a small amount of calories you're like well maybe I should have more than this you still shouldn't go past what tastes good you know but you should ask yourself am I eating I know am I eating until it tastes good you know am I getting am I getting uh you know am I trying to eat more than once a day just to see you know and and you might be surprised you might be surprised with the answer on that one so that's that's something you can do but otherwise just yeah just listen to your body um and um Olivia asked can you ask Nina how she can get more support from communities to change dietary guidelines that's a good question um I'll write that down yeah get support to change guidelines yeah the guidelines are a bit of a pain because those are bureaucracies that's not those aren't doctors and scientists actually making those guidelines at all they they will pick you know a panel of people that they'll say Hey you know can you guys give us some recommendations based on the literature and the science uh available scientific literature available I should say and um and uh and then they submit all these sorts of things and then a bureaucracy goes in and votes on and just says yeah this is what we'll do and it may be completely different to any of the recommendations and so uh you know that that's it you know that's what people should understand is that these guidelines are written by bureaucrats and politicians not doctors and scientists so it's not even it's not even a case that you know it's just like a doctor or scientist who did their best and they got it wrong it's like it wasn't it didn't even come from them in the first place you know so this is not representative of you know the the literature and and then um oh yeah and then uh Olivia reminds me that uh of the interview and Paul Mason very excited about that as well um all three of those those interviews are going to be uh I are are three people that I've really really admired and uh been interested in talking to and Paul Mason is certainly one of those guys I actually spoke to him on the phone uh the other day dude that guy is is even more uh erudite and learned in person than than he comes across on his his videos which is saying something because he he has I think he does brilliant uh job on his on his videos but you know we were just talking he was just just going just rattling off just study after study after study after study it was so interesting it was like it was just you know just getting his crash course and just everything we were talking about it was really really interesting and and he's a very very cool guy very passionate about this and and and helping people and getting people healthy and uh and so that's great so yeah I'm definitely looking forward to talking to him as well and you know he was very impressed with that guy you know he only works four days a week so because he wants to take one day a week where he just reads studies he just says a whole day I just I want a day that I can just read studies and that's his and that's what he does basically his job I'm just reading studies reading studies reading studies and and that is a that is a great approach I'm actually sort of thinking about doing a similar thing where you know I might take like uh some time off from from neurosurgery next year uh just to be able to to finish the book I'm writing and to work on other projects and do research and and also just just read again and be able to like read studies and read uh uh different papers and research because I like doing that I really am interested in that and I just don't really have the time anymore and so I I was going to take a bit of time off to sort of just focus on that for a bit and um and also still work and still do sort of like you know you know private surgeries and um and also working the you know do the functional medicine uh preventative health sort of thing that I do on the weekends now and so maybe just sort of work like three days a week and the rest of the days I just focus on you know just reading writing and uh and and uh you know my own research and that's um it'll be interesting it'll be interesting to see how that goes I think it will be enjoyable um but uh yeah so so Paul Mason definitely it looking forward to that interview as well I knew there was other sorry it's it's early I haven't slept much um okay so there's another general question um and when people say you're on an Atkins diet what is the best response is there a lot of negative perceptions of it how does carnivore compare to Atkins I don't I mean I don't know why there's negative connotations with Atkins I mean the dude was right you know like you really shouldn't be eating carbohydrates should be focusing on animal uh you know protein fat and just animal nutrition um so you know I don't you know any any you know negative connotations or perceptions that people have or are very undeserved uh for for that but um it's not Atkins Atkins gets you know close to the mark but he's not not quite there what Atkins did is he eliminated out a lot of the different poisons and recognized that hey you know animal protein and fat are good for you so um that's uh that's that's really all that was and it was just a you know one of the you know it was just an Elimination Diet we're just eliminating out carbs and other other you know toxic plants to get good results and people did get good results they got fantastic results and it's just uh you know so it's in the same sort of idea of an Elimination Diet of an animal protein and fat based animal uh diet um eliminating out other things but carnivores are just really the ultimate Elimination Diet where you're eliminating everything that's not species specific and optimal for human beings and so that that's the difference but I would I would just sort of push back on this oh well it's Atkins and acting as bad I was like it really isn't you know and then you just ask them it's like okay why why is it bad oh well people get heart attacks no they don't actually that's that's against literature well you know Atkins you know died of a heart attack first of all who gives you know who cares uh about that or not you know just because he came up with a die doesn't mean he actually practiced it first of all second of all you don't know that if he had any other sort of medical conditions you don't know if he smoked or drank or had had you know some sort of congenital abnormality like we had we just don't know you know and so I don't I don't really put too much stock in that you know if I'm doing this and I get hit by a bus tomorrow I'll be like oh well that Dr Chaffey was full of it he died at 42. I was like yeah not not of anything related to my my health you know it's like there's things can happen in life that are outside of diet and also so again Dr Atkins came up with the Atkins diet did he practice it was he strict on it you know I don't know I never asked him but you know that's that's something to consider so you know and just because you know one person had you know that's the thing you you you have you know millions of people doing Atkins around the world one guy has a heart attack and you don't even know if he was doing Atkins and then that just you just throw everything out it doesn't make any sense you know so you know people are going to have problems they're going to have problems for different reasons and you know and so you know it could be that you you build up all this this plaque and artery uh you know Gunk for a while and then you go carnivore and then you you know but you and then but things are already unstable and already problematic and then there's and there's a problem there's um I was talking to uh you know someone yesterday and you know their dad went went carnivore and then all of a sudden had some internal bleeding and and uh what was on blood thinners and sort of went to the hospital like oh well what was this because of the carnivore you know I mean things are you know can be coincidences as well you know and like certainly Carnival is not going to cause any internal bleeding um but you know when you start something new and you're and you're a little bit worried about it and then something happens I knew it I knew this was bad for me it's very easy to to look at that you know with uh you know confirmation bias um but no I don't think there's anything wrong with Atkins except that maybe it didn't go far enough you know but I think that it was it was definitely a large step in the right direction so I would I would sort of push back against that if people started said say oh it's Atkins and Atkins bad um something about raw meat was this address this is from Dr chafee's Discord curious what Dr chafee's opinion is on eating raw meat if you're in the western world it's probably not that big a deal um you know if you're if you're hunting and you're getting something from the wild probably going to have parasites probably don't want to do that but you know we are actually designed to eat raw meat you know we're actually that's actually okay but I think we've been cooking meat for a very long time we have very strong evidence that we've been cooking meat for at least a million years and there's and there's supportive evidence um that we have been eating it for like two million years or sorry uh you know had fire for like two million years was probably cooking for that and he's probably gave an advantage probably from that standpoint is you know getting rid of parasites um and so you know that that could be you know why we we've come to cook meat and enjoy cooked meat and same with with uh you know wolves and now dogs it could be from a parasite perspective that would be my my suspicion that that would at least lend a um a a evolutionary advantage or just you know survival Advantage you know it doesn't even have to be evolutionary but just just a survival advantage to cook meat and get rid of those parasites that way um but in the western world there aren't any there aren't any parasites you know even like trichinosis like that last recorded case of like trichinosis in um you know uh Pig farmed pigs in America it's over 20 years ago you know I think I think I I think it's probably more than 25 years now because I heard that several years ago um so I wouldn't I wouldn't be too worried about that um yeah and carnivore veteran says each raw meat while hunting and many of those do yeah I that's what I said you know it's like you know that's the only thing that I think you you would contend with is that they might have some parasites in it but at the same time we have an entire immune system dedicated to dealing with parasites and that's actually a thought that um that that people have is that it's actually our our lack of exposure to parasites is actually giving us these crippling allergies because it's the same part of the immune system that would normally attack parasites that gives us these weird allergies and people that actually do have like the really strong cases of allergies and actually crippling allergies they find that if they just introduce like give themselves like round worms gone allergies are just gone and and so there are several um you know case studies looking at that where people would go and just like go into you know the third world and just expose themselves to as many parasites as possible and then they get something and bang their allergies are gone and and these are people that are really desperate you know they're just on every medication they've got all the injections and shots and all these sorts of things they just feel wretched all the time and so that's definitely worth it to them so that's something to think about as well you know it could actually be an advantage to eating raw meat sometimes and get exposed to these these parasites obviously without getting like a full parasitic infection because that's not good you know but if your body's able to fight this stuff off and you're getting uh you know some exposure um but not to the point that you're getting you know diseased from it that that might that might be uh confer a health benefit as well but if you're if you're just worried about it I eating raw meat um especially like you know uh Western farm meat I don't think I honestly don't think that there's really any concern with that um you know people say oh this is bacteria and you'll die and it's like no not really you know if you let it spoil sure but there's actually a lot of people that do that they do the high meat thing I've never done that I don't I'm not suggesting anyone tries that but they literally let it spoil and rot and um which can't smell good in your house and and then they eat that and they feel that actually that that makes them feel the best um I don't I think I'm feeling good enough I don't need to go down that route it's nice to know that you know if we're you know had some zombie apocalypse and I have to eat some you know rotten meat that I'm not gonna that it might be okay it might be I might even feel better but I don't think I need to go down that route uh just yet um but if you're just thinking about you know is it safe to eat raw meat absolutely you know I don't I don't think there's any problem with that um as long as you're careful and it's not contaminated you know you as the USDA process is is very stringent you know not everybody knows this but like I've been to some of these places long before I did carnivores just you know for other reasons and I've spoken to these guys I've spoken to some USDA guys and maybe they've changed these things but at the time it was explained to me uh thusly they have 24-hour processing cycle and that's broken into three eight hour segments six hours of just processing uh the meat and then every six hours they have to shut down and just clean they do a deep clean they get pressure washers and bleach and they just clean every surface and really really really do a thorough job cleaning everything out and then the USDA guy comes in and starts checking things and taking random samples from place they find any contamination any bacteria anywhere they have to start the whole two hour process over again and so it's in their best interest to do a good job and they check it every time and they also take samples from the meat so it's like taking a couple packs of of meat from each uh cycle each uh you know six hours cycle and then he said those off to the lab and they do cultures and if they find that that they've um have any contamination they pull the whole thing back they do a recall and you hear about this every now and then but you don't hear about it often you know and every night it makes a news oh my gosh recalling me oh there's all this me you know like yeah and when was the last time you heard about that nine years ago you know so it's uh it's very rare and when and there are safe and there are safety measures and checks uh in place so if you get a contaminated batch it gets pulled so if you're gonna eat raw meat you know I mean I basically eat raw meat I just sear it at the outside the inside's raw you know a rare steak that's what raw meat tastes like AKA good you know so it's um you know and yeah as as Elle said you know like raw seafood I mean think about Sashimi you know and that that's the thing with with parasites so they they prepare Sashimi in a certain way especially like salmon uh can have a lot of parasites and so they prepare in a certain way to sort of you know uh you know disable those things um and then jerky built on all these things are raw you know they're just dried so I wouldn't be too worried about that as long as it's not contaminated you're fine and it's very unlikely if you buy something from a store in a western country that is going to come contaminated you might it might become contaminated by your practices and how you're treating it you don't wash your hands I mean you know when you know 98 90 somewhere 98.5 of food poisoning cases in America are actually come from plants and like you know vegetables and things like that contaminated vegetables um it's very hard to clean lettuce there's always like nooks and crannies in there so if you have E coli on your hands and you have all these Farm Workers that don't wash their hands regularly and they actually you know go to the bathroom in the middle of the field because they're six miles away from the nearest bathroom they just have to just go and they just have to keep picking which is you know not a nice thought you're never getting that off of that lettuce and so these things can get contaminated and uh and that can cause and that's what causes the vast majority of food poisoning cases in America and probably elsewhere but I just know about the statistics for America um and the ones that come from me aren't from the meat itself like this got out of the plant and was contaminated those are from food handling problems you know like there was there was a restaurant worker that didn't wash their hands and so they contaminated that so it's not it's not the meat that was the problem it was them not washing their hands and after they went to the bathroom which is gross um so that that's what I would say about that is is it's not it's very unlikely to come contaminated and if you don't contaminate it fine I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about that okay so it's just it's just nine o'clock guys um I might have to get going here in a second um but so there's a couple personal questions that might maybe do these ones sort of a bit quicker so which sports teams do I support aside from the Seattle Sea Wolves obviously that's my those are my uh my boys who I support them the most I'm going to be the Seahawks I really love the Seahawks I've liked them since I was a kid and I was I was very very hurt when we lost against the Patriots or sorry the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Super Bowl I thought that was that was robbed I absolutely robbed from that uh Super Bowl win I think it was at Super Bowl 40 or something like that and um there was a I watched I was watching ESPN uh thing like the 10 most controversial calls in NFL history right three of them were from that game all against the Seahawks it was just like you have got to be kidding me and we still barely lost so that was that that that's still that still bothers me um but yeah uh yeah Seahawks definitely uh support the Seahawks and then you know the U.S any any USA team playing anywhere you know Olympics or national circuit International circuit or something like that you know obviously you know the US Eagles uh US national team for rugby um and then obviously you know I was in I was in Ireland for you know many years I was in England for many years so I would I would support those those teams as well unless they're playing America obviously they're going to win anyway I don't they don't need my support uh in that in that regard but yeah that's who I would I would uh support mostly and then top three bands are artists to listen to I have a very uh eclectic sort of uh you know taste in music my mom was a was a classical singer so she was like a professional she was a you know a classical soprano and so she would sing like you know like operas and that sort of music and yeah absolutely just stunning voice I I love hearing my mom saying and um I still do she doesn't do it as uh really as often anymore because she's uh shy but I I that was that was one of my favorite favorite things as a kid was listening to my mom sing and um so I really love classical music because of her and uh and and um some like Blues sorts of things really really like those um and then I listened to a lot of rap growing up so it's uh you know like I think probably the first album I had when I was a kid was like two Live Crew which is like if people know that it's like the most crude and crass and dirt 30 rap out there but I just thought you know you're a kid and you just think swearing is funny and so that's that was sort of uh uh you know that was what um what I listened to as a kid growing up so I still like I still like that kind of music but um I absolutely love Mozart I think Mozart's fifth piano concerto is probably one of the most amazing things I've ever heard especially like the third movement I just like I heard that I just like something woke up in me it was like it was like the first time I'd actually heard music properly and uh it was really it was like I just heard music for the first time I thought I was like what is this I just saw this is absolutely absolutely amazing and um and so I absolutely love that then uh Beethoven's um violin uh Concerto in D that is absolutely brilliant and uh he only did one he only did one final concerto but it was fantastic and um and uh you know and that and and again the the third movement on that I really like the allegros I like the sort of the faster paced big the final finale crash finish really like that and then and then Bach is obviously just you know the man you know and um you know that's the thing with with Bach is a guy's perfect it has to be perfect and his Brandenburg concertos I just absolutely love those those are some of my favorite favorite pieces of music and his bot and his um cello solos um specifically played by um uh Janos stalker oh my God like if you haven't heard that guy Play The Cello or his his um uh Bach uh solos like you just haven't heard these things played properly anytime I hear someone else play these things I might be doing it wrong that's wrong no that's wrong and it's the same thing I hear with with um uh the Mozart piano concertos uh I saw Marie Pariah playing I'm sorry no yeah no doing it wrong no no no no and um so yes that's what I think and then yeah and then Brandenburg concertos um who is that is uh um is it Carl Richter and the the and the Munich uh box sort of um Orchestra they just they just do a bunch of block and this this was this was the the album that they did uh of the of the Brandenburg concertos um this is what they sent in like the discovery shuttle like to like you know contact other you know other life forms that rest in the universe you know it was like and that that was their version of of the Brandenburg concertos that they send off it was like just the best version ever and it's brilliant it's brilliant brilliant brilliant forget the movie I think it's like the seventh peace in that um with the trumpet with the trumpet solos amazing I was absolutely loved that trumpet um who was it a firing line with um uh William Buckley Jr uh he had that that that trumpet piece for the Brandenburg concertos as the beginning for uh Firing Line it's a firing line I think it's Firing Line uh back in like the 80s and 90s and it you know it starts with that trumpet going through I just I just love that piece that's really my favorite piece and uh and other than that uh like too short yeah DJ quick so this would be so the other people I listen to uh but but no those are my favorite ones would be those pieces uh from those artists um great all right well all right guys well I I think I have to uh call it there I think that's pretty much all the all the questions um you know Karma was saying I should get recordings of her singing I really wish I had them I I would absolutely love to have recordings of my mom singing um I might be able to get her to do it I think she might be just too embarrassed and shy she's very shy little lady um but very very sweet and so you know we'll see but uh I don't I don't think I have any recordings of her uh when I was a kid or younger I would I would absolutely love it I mean this was before YouTube and all that sort of stuff so I don't I don't know if there are any recordings out there but if if there are that's that's definitely worth getting um great all right well yeah yeah either classical or swearing that's basically my life is uh is uh is that so uh yeah unfortunately but okay guys thank you very much for coming on I hope that was interesting for people and uh we'll put this up on YouTube as well so that people can can take a look at it and the people that uh ask their questions they can they can they can see uh the answers to that and hopefully it helps them too and um you know if anyone isn't on the Discord Channel that's something that's um uh very good to get on and people can ask more questions and talk about things and also submit questions for future uh Live Events like this as well and um and anyone who is watching this uh subsequently and has it signed up if you would like to be a part of these these Live Events you can go on and uh you know join my

get um you know access to my things it's just something that that helps me and it helps helps me sort of you know be able to dedicate more time to these sorts of things um because time is time is uh is pretty dear right now and so that that does help and if people can you know sign up for my uh YouTube uh just Anthony chafee MD and uh Instagram and and following the social media and help and actually just share a lot of the videos I think that's probably the most helpful thing that people can do is if you like a video and you think it's helpful and someone else will find it helpful please do share it with them because it makes all the difference in the world when people start sharing things around people start you know watching more that that helps the algorithms from YouTube just say like oh hey this is interesting people like this will introduce this to other people as well and maybe they'll find it interesting also so that's really helpful uh for people uh or or for me to get this stuff out there and so if people would be able to do that that would be great too okay all right thank you very much everyone really appreciate it hope you have a great rest of your day take
