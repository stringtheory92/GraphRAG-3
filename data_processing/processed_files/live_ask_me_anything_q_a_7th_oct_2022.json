        "body": "foreign trying to get this going here oh there we go son of a [\u00a0__\u00a0] sorry everyone there we go great all right well okay great well thanks everyone for for coming on I'm just doing a series of lives on YouTube Instagram and uh YouTube videos YouTube Instagram and Tick Tock so I'm just doing a q a session some people have put in uh questions and so I'll answer those and then if people want to put in uh questions live I can try to answer them obviously I've got a few different things to look at so I'm gonna have to um I'm gonna have to uh I'm gonna have to sort of look around between different ones so um but yeah if you want to have questions you can just sort of ask them live and we can go from there and I'll start off with some of the questions that have been sent in uh so the first one is asking about gallbladder um this person said that he has gallbladder removed sometimes when he drinks a lot of water he experiences some discomfort in his upper GI area some minor pain rumbling he's not drinking above his own thirst and he has not really found anything else that helps he still struggled with acid reflux in the past um he thinks his stomach acid level might be diluted but that's as far as his ideas go any idea why the pain and what can be done so I wouldn't expect you to to have any issues with drinking water that's not that's you know unless you're drinking you know so much that you're actually causing pain like you really shouldn't uh have it have an issue with drinking water um if you're drinking water with the same time that you're you're eating a bunch then you know that could slow digestion that could give you some indigestion um but that's really about it um some rumbling and minor pain that's a bit weird um yeah I would just just try different times like it was just happening all the time is this happening when you're eating Foods would this happen when you're not eating food uh or you just haven't with any glass of water or you're drinking like a ton of water and things like that um someone asked do you ever have carb refeeds to restore T3 hormone nope I don't I don't think that you need to do that uh you know Professor Bart K talks about how if you're eating a large protein bolus that you'll actually transiently kick yourself out of ketosis and that will be enough to sort of regulate those systems I just eat meat and I trust that that's what my body wants and is supposed to get as that's what I think the best evidence shows uh that is our optimal diet and so I just eat physiologically I eat what I think biologically we're supposed to eat and um and I I just trust that my body's doing its thing you know whether I'm in ketosis or not I don't know I don't really track that um but I do know that I'm supposed to eat meat and so if I'm doing that then I'm then whatever my body's doing after that I'm pretty happy with it you know my my T3 has always been great my my thyroid TSH and T3 T4 reverse T3 have all been been optimal and so I've never you know had an issue with that um and so you know and a lot of people don't you know uh different different Native populations they haven't had these issues there really aren't any carbs fruits or or honey available in um you know the ice ages when people were crossing the bearings straight uh over the ice Bridge you know it just wasn't available to them so obviously this is something that we don't actually strictly need so something was happening um is weight loss possible uh with is insulin resistance yeah it absolutely is possible but the main thing is that it's going to um you're going to become less insulin resistant you're not going to have high insulin all the time your body's not going to be able to not going to be having to produce a ton of insulin and uh and have the problems that come with that um oh well someone said that Dr Barry was in here if he is that's amazing that would be absolutely awesome I love that guy um so question what do you recommend I tell my doctor if they push back on me doing carnivore I'm just going in for an annual visit and I've lost 30 pounds since starting in February this year well first of all you don't have to tell them you don't have to say anything you just say hey just been been adjusting my diet and lifestyle and I've lost some weight and I feel great if he asks you more you can tell him if you want to and uh it depends on what what they push back with if they say well that's going to cause heart disease or that's going to cause bowel cancer all these sorts of things then you can just point him towards the the reasons why that isn't the case and um you know and just and just you know uh bring forward you know that sort of evidence um you know I I post uh a lot of links to video in my videos to studies and articles uh that address the things that I talk about and I know that many others do you know like Dr Berry like uh Sean Baker and uh you know Ben bickman everything uh uh all those people uh all put these these um links to these studies so if you're having a problem uh with you know explaining to someone or they're pushing back you can just you just say in a nice matter of fact tone of voice like yeah well actually you know you know that's um I've been reading these things I mean researching these things and I've seen other doctors and talk to them and they're uh you know they've pointed me to these studies and um and that's fine you might you might be surprised maybe they uh have actually you know come across keto and uh are quite interested in it I know that um you know my mother's doctor was was very very impressed that she reversed her her diabetes and went from an hba1c from of 8.9 to 6.1 in a matter of of uh two months and and she was she wanted to know what she did she know she's like what the hell did you do how the hell did you do this you know diabetes is not something that you can just reverse you know is a progressive disease that only gets worse and it and we can modify it and uh and slow it down with diet and lifestyle or and medications but it does not go backwards how the hell did you do this so you know many doctors are going to be actually quite interested so you know it may not be that you're you're you know you may be gearing up for a fight that you're not even going to be in so you know just just see what happens and but be prepared you know know what the studies are and know you know why you're doing this I think that's the most important thing is that you know just for your own your own self it's it's good to know why you're doing this it's good to know um it's good to know the background on these things and know as much as you can about it just you know for your own sake because maybe you see something oh actually that you know that Dr JV guy I think he's wrong about this and here's why so you know maybe so you should check that out as well and then you'll be very well versed in explaining it to other people um so uh there's a comment do you have my numbers early this morning uh were great 71 glucose and two ketones I couldn't get these numbers on regular carnivore I went high fat carnivore in one week my energy uh that was gone for years is back well that's really great um congratulations on that that's really oh hey Dr Barry thank you so much that was uh great to see you thank you for joining that's uh that's awesome thank you so much uh I really appreciate it and um uh I I think that I don't know if I got an email back but but Dr Barry and I did a video together you know which I really enjoyed and and um we were talking about doing a live together at some point and um I think I sent an email back to you I don't I don't uh I don't know if I got one back but hopefully uh if you haven't gotten my email just so you know I'm very happy to do a live at any time that you that you like I would love to schedule that um okay um so someone says that you know where's the key for dairy come from is it healthy so Kefir is one of those fermented dairy products that uh well it depends I mean yes it is it is good it has a lot of good things for you and it's fermented so it takes out uh the lactose uh most if not all of that and so fermented dairy products are something that we've been using for thousands and thousands and thousands of years people in Mongolia still you know use a lot of fermented dairy products as well and so I think that it's much better I still think that meat is optimal I think that fatty meat is is the best thing you can do but I think that if you're going to have dairy something like kefir like the fermented dairies are you know the traditional age fermented dairies are are a very very good option I think I saw a question here on Instagram um so someone asked said that they've been diagnosed as a pre-diabetic years back I'm probably well past that uh now but after being in transition a month a month now and reasonably adapted how long uh will it take to get rid of lingering insulin resistance well it can it can take a very amount of time it'll be a lot quicker than you think you know it can it can you know if you're borderline diabetic you'll probably respond fairly quickly in the next sort of couple months you you would see your hba1c come down dramatically hba1c is a three-month marker of your insulin or your blood sugar control and so check it again in three months and see what it is you know that's not necessarily you know I mean you have you can check your insulin levels as well because those you know may be uh still up a little higher for a while but I would I would expect you to respond quite quickly you know people uh will start to make improvements right away and you not having necessarily too far to go should see some some good changes fairly rapidly um so let's see another question here so I can't see this is a comment or question between two butter options one has oh that someone's answering a question there and someone's saying that their OB GYN suggested that they go carnivore seven years ago um they did that and It reversed endometriosis migraines nasty seasonal allergies eczema and uh keratosis Polaris and have never been healthier and that's amazing and that's and that's something that um you know a lot of people are seeing uh endometriosis is something that I've always been interested in to see if that something that helps because um that's something that a lot of people suffer from and I've always thought that that would it would almost certainly help with the pain and experience of endometriosis but I didn't you know I didn't uh know of anyone who's actually like reversed reversed it so that's that's that's really amazing migraines you know we have we have studies going back 100 years to show that uh just a ketogenic diet let alone a carnivore diet uh has has very good effects on migraines and can help people you know quite a lot allergies that's a good one too I've noticed that I actually I have much less allergies uh just just by dropping you know plants just the just the um just the vegetables actually gotten a lot better but um no that's great very well done um let's see another question here so there's a question that says what do I think about sunglasses not being as good uh as your as your eyes don't get the signal to produce uh melanin affecting vitamin D synthesis and also allowing pupils to dilate too much enabling harmful UV rays to enter so I yeah I don't I don't know too much about um yeah you know the signal produce melanin you know in your eyes you know um you know if that if that's um that you know that maybe that's not um something I know too much about uh I wouldn't have thought that you know the like getting in your eyes had anything to do with melanin production on your skin but you know baby I don't know um vitamin D synthesis I it was it was again um thought that that was sort of made on the skin but maybe I do know about the Uvis and the light you will you will dilate your pupils and um and that can allow more UV light to go in so that's why they have like these UV blocking sunglasses and if you are if you are going to wear sunglasses probably the way to do it I think the sunlight's not bad for you I like sunlight I like getting in the sun I don't really wear sunglasses I just like being out there and uh and enjoying enjoying the sunlight and letting that get in your in your eyes in a natural way and and that stimulates different different um you know parts of the Circadian rhythm and you know especially in the morning that sort of gets you up and going and then kicks things off in a good way if you are wearing sunglasses without UV protection your eye your pupils will dilate and and more UV light will get in than you necessarily want and people have thought that this is this is going to be a negative and so just be mindful of that um and so so someone asks if taking Vitamin D supplements in two doses is it best to take once a day or spread it out to take twice if you ever need to get sunlight to synthesize vitamin D synthetic vitamin t d of taking supplements I don't quite understand that sentence but um do you still need to get sunlight to synthesize vitamin D if you take supplements maybe uh well you know if you're taking supplements and you're taking you know vitamin D3 you know that's going to and that's going to uh you know supplement your your your your vitamin D I don't you know you don't need to get sunlight in order to kick that off you you are just taking you know the substance um and uh you know something that people don't don't always recognize is that you know when you uh you're out in the sun and you're getting sunlight and you make Vitamin D it actually makes it you know on the skin it actually takes a while to sort of absorb and soak in so people um you know have suggested that if you uh are at the beach or you're out in the sun and then you take a shower directly afterwards you're actually gonna curtail your body's absorption of that vitamin D and so it's just to be mindful of that um I this was years and years and years ago it wasn't like a study or anything was just it was just um uh you know just from from speaking to dermatologists about this they said that it would it took like six hours for the Vitamin D to soak in uh to your skin after sun exposure so you know if you if you sort of wash things off it could be a problem um no I think you can just just take just take a vitamin dose vitamin D dose once a day I also think that you know you don't really need to take supplements unless you have a have a clear diagnosed uh deficiency and then you don't you don't need to do that and you're going to get it you know pretty much everything you need well you you will get everything you need from meat and sunlight and water so if you're able to get in the Sun and you're eating enough animal fat you you should be fine on the vitamin D side of things but you know if you're in a situation where for some reason your vitamin D isn't isn't optimal you want to take some you just you know you you can you can do that um but you know it's best to get it from natural sources you know people like the you know the Inuits up north you know they're not they're not if you if you live past this you know in the northern latitudes Northern and far Southern latitudes you just won't get enough certain rays of UV light to stimulate enough vitamin D growth or or production and so you know nine or because the sunlight's so oblique so in less than likes in the summer months you're just not going to get enough enough rays of sunlight and so if for nine months out of the year you know you're just not going to get enough from the Sun and so how do people how do people survive in these in these conditions well you know they um they actually find that there's just a ton of vitamin D in the fat of the of the animals that eat you know like seals and uh and other other marine mammals so you know they do just fine with that and there's there's quite a lot of vitamin D and animal fat and butter and things like that um so that should be fine uh to get it that way and so just check your vitamin D levels and see if you actually even need to take a supplement you may not um but vitamin D is very good for you and it is it is a hormone it's an active hormone in your body and it does a lot of uh you know very beneficial things and is quite good for immune uh your immune system as well and um you know there's been a few studies that came out over you know the pandemic and lockdowns and they found that if you're I think it was actually published by the CDC there was a couple studies that came out last year that spoke about how if you had sort of above a certain number um on your of your vitamin D that the the you know mortality rate for Covenant went straight down just went way down and um and if you were even higher than that above this other threshold I forget exactly what it was uh you know the morbidity and the long covet and all these sorts of things went way way down as well so that's just something that that can really help you uh so someone asked me to talk about fermented veggies well you know I think I think that again you're you're optimizing um you know a less optimal situation I think you can just get everything you just need just from from meat and animal fat and you don't really need to go looking elsewhere if you're in a position where you need to rely on on plant and dairy products fermenting them and processing them in in the traditional ways that that people have done for thousands of years when we've had to have to resort to that um is is the way to go so [Music] um you know it's um but but there are other things I mean the fermentation is is one thing but you know Dr uh you know um Bill Schindler who I just had on on the podcast uh published this week you know talks about like you know tell the story about initialization of of corn uh in you know mesoamerica and um and how this this unlocked a lot of the nutrients and B vitamins that that are in there and whereas other and and reduce the toxicity as well and this allowed this to to be you know a viable nutrition source for people and uh when people took corn and took that to Europe and uh and and you know took the corn but didn't take the the techniques and processing the corn you know people were getting sick they were ended up getting uh pellegra which is a you know vitamin B1 deficient be one timing deficiency yeah and um and it's devastating it's fatal it'll kill you after a certain time a certain amount of time and so it took a long time to figure that out but you know so if you're going if you're going to be eating veggies which I don't recommend I don't think that you know you need to be doing these things if you have access to meat I think that meat is definitely the way to go that's that's where you're going to get your optimal nutrition that's where you're going to get uh the most benefit to your body with with the you know the least downsides you know plants have toxins all plants have toxins to a certain degree you can maybe ferment them and and put them through other processes to make them less toxic like cooking you cook and you can denature a lot of the lectins and beans but they're still going to be causing some some form of form so you know if you need to survive and subsist on you know plant products then yeah you know there are there are ways of making them less toxic I mean look at at cassava uh this is this is the third most um important source of calories in the third world and uh there's a ton of cyanide in there and if you don't there's a couple different kinds of cassava but uh the the you know the sort of the more yeah poisonous one uh has a fatal amount a lethal amount of of cyanide in it so if you don't process this properly you will kill you or if you eat enough of the less toxic stuff it'll kill you and um you know and so you just have to be aware of that and even low-grade cyanide exposure can uh cause uh you know thyroid dysfunction and neurological damage so even even at a reduced level it's still going to be harmful and and uh so someone commented plants are trying to kill you uh that was that was that was a comment from my uh cancer biology Professor 22 years ago that's how I sort of came into this whole whole Arena um you know he's talking about how toxic plants were and how um and how uh you know plants use toxins and as defense because everything has a defense while animals can run away or fight back plants can't and so they uh use other defenses and one of those defenses is is um is uh you know to be physically poisonous to stop animals and insects from eating them and you know we were learning this from a cancer perspective and we're looking at all the different carcinogens that were in plants and uh you know we learned you know 22 years ago now that brussels sprouts had 136 identified human toxic carcinogens in them and that mushrooms had over 100 and spinach kale lettuce celery cabbage cucumber broccoli you name it all these things had you know dozens if not if not over a hundred known human carcinogens in them and they were quite abundant they had um you know Dr Professor Bruce Ames from thank you very much Shelley that was very kind of you um Professor Bruce Ames from uh Berkeley um I'll answer your question just a minute Shelly sorry Professor Bruce Ames from Berkeley um did a study and published in in 1989 just talking about a certain pesticide ALR and showing that there were actually ten thousand times the amount of natural poisons in you know plants and specifically looking at like mushrooms in this case then um than the ALR right so by weight there was 10 000 times more toxic elements you know in these things and that the the mushrooms were far more likely to cause cancer than than the alars so this is this is back when they were trying to sort of ban all these things and he just sort of pointed out that you know it may not be as uh um you know as bad as all that in context you know if you're going to eat the plants you know you're you're bringing along some poisons for the ride and this is how you stop animals and insects me then that's what pesticides are you know they're poison and the plant uses its own internal poisons to as their own pesticides to stop from being eaten um as we were quite taken aback by that and um and so I remember sort of looking around wildly I was just like how how is this possible like there must be a joke you know there must be some ta like you know laugh you know snickering in the corner like ah he does this all the time and you know there wasn't and so we were all just really blown away by this and uh I remember thinking my head I was like but yo but but vegetables are still good for you though right and he just must have read our minds because he just looked at us and he said he just gives his weird look and he just said I don't eat salad I don't need vegetables I don't let my kids eat vegetables plants are trying to kill you so I was like right forget plants and I just I just stopped eating them and that's how I started this and I just you know went around the store and I was just like well everything's a plant like why why is you know like everything has planted everything is made with plants or from plants or or whatever and so I just went around I was just walking around till I found something I was like oh eggs eggs eggs don't come from plants I think it's eggs like milk milk doesn't come from plants get milk meat meat doesn't come from plants so it's meat so that's what I just ate eggs meat and milk for you know five years in my 20s and sort of slipped off of it later and came back to it more recently but that was where that line comes from the plants are trying to kill you and and you know I mean I don't think they're they're out to get you by any stretch of the imagination but um they you know they certainly don't want to die you know and they're and they're willing to defend themselves uh you know with with lethal means if necessary which is perfectly reasonable you know animals do that too we do that uh you know if someone's gonna try to to you know some some you know animals gonna try to eat me and attack me I will defend myself you know as as hard as I can so you know and that's just that's just true of anything in in nature so that's where that comes from but uh it's it's sort of just it's sort of stuck around because it's kind of funny uh Shelley asks which Camp I'm in high fat or high protein um she's getting confused needs healing um our lipidemia ra lipidemia needs to lose 30 pounds I I'm in the in the high fat camp I think that that's um that's that's that's very beneficial you know fat is a very important nutrient and it has you know comes with a lot of things that are very very good for you and important and uh you know like cholesterol cholesterol is is an important precursor for a number of your hormones like progesterone estrogen testosterone uh your glucocorticoids and mineral corticoids all the things made in your adrenals above your kidneys uh like you know cortisol very important hormone and you know there's there's 27 steps between cholesterol and testosterone and estrogen and uh you know all of these things all these intermediaries have important roles in your body so these are these are important nutrients and I think that that uh that's that fat makes the animal kingdom go round you know animals you know get uh most of their nutrition their their calorics you know resources from fat you know um carnivores because they eat animals with fat and they generally go for the fat first and so they get a lot of their their calories from fat and and uh also herbivores though because that's what you know what people don't realize is that herbivorous animals that that eat um that are able to break down uh able to break down fiber I mean no vertebrate animal can break down fiber but the bacteria in their gut and their special digestion is set up to cultivate these bacteria they eat the fiber and then as a waste product they produce short chain fatty acids which are 100 saturated and so that's what they that's what they absorb so gorillas that just eat green leaves they get about 70 of calories from saturated fat cows get more than that because they're they're better able to break down these um you know the this product they're more efficient at it and um and so you see that you see that the animals get all the high high fat diet so and then the bacteria die off and absorb that as protein and so they um they get you know a high high amount of higher amount of fat but they also get a lot of protein as well they're really not absorbing a bunch of carbs so I'm in that camp I'm in the high fat camp I've seen that help Lobby I've certainly seen that help me I feel better when I do that I have a video called fiber constipation and diet and carnivore for beginners and I go into that and about sort of why that is and how you can sort of tell if you're getting enough fat but meat in general people with autoimmune diseases in particular are can be quite sensitive to really plants in general and that can that can stimulate uh flare-ups but also dairy uh seems to be a bit of a trigger for people and even like egg whites for some reason not everybody but I've just come across you know anecdotally a lot of people with um autoimmune issues that that responds negatively to egg whites at least early on and even like chicken and pork I think it probably has more to do with what the animal is eating itself than than like the actual chicken or the egg but um just something to think about and so people seem to do best on red meat and and you know the healthier red meat the better like the old grass-fed but uh in general you know just doing better with meat so that that's gonna that's gonna get better on its own but I think that high fat is going to to help you out and I think that losing weight as well if you're giving your body the nourishment and nutrients that it needs you're going to actually stimulate fat loss paradoxically people think but if you think about it you know you know in in sort of a starvation way like if if we're starving and we're in a famine our bodies are going to try to sequester you know energy is just going to slow down your metabolism and say hey we need to we need to hold this back because you know we're in the middle of the 30 Years War and we can't we can't um afford to lose this stuff and so uh you know if you if you start eating enough you start eating enough fat and and as much fat as your body wants your body makes a certain amount of bile that's almost I think physiologically that's how much fat your body wants um if you're if you're saturating the amount of fat that your body gets in because that's how much your body wants then I think that you're going to stimulate uh uh energy energy mobilization and fat uh loss as well so I would I would be definitely in that camp and I've seen it help a lot of people um so thank you thank you to everyone you know uh Douglas Somerville and Tommy Mead and uh uh Anthony Clem so um that's very very kind you guys and generous and uh Tommy asks being carnivore for one month uh is having hemorrhoid problems energy mental Clarity has improved uh I have SCI and want to increase testosterone any thoughts so not 100 on the acronym SCI so or maybe that's an sc now as an SCI so maybe if you can comment what SCI stands for I can I can better answer that um hemorrhoid problems I I'm assuming you're mean that you well I don't know if that means that you've had problems previously um or that you're sort of developing them afterwards if you're if you're having an issue with them in general uh just getting enough fat as I alluded to previously your your body makes a certain amount of bile and I think physiologically your body's not going to just make a random amount of bile your body uses bile to absorb fat emulsify these fat you know fatty acids and absorb them as column microns and you know I think that you know it's going to make the amount of fat that it wants or amount of bile that it wants into that in return and so if you are eating enough fat you know that means that you're eating as much fat as your body has produced bile for to absorb I just think that from a physiological standpoint uh would would make sense I don't have any proof of that it's just sort of thinking about things from first principles um so I think that if you eat as much fat as your body has bile for that's enough that's what your body wants but if you're but how do you know you're doing that well if you eat a little more than that more than your body can absorb your body is like a spillover effect your body's gonna not absorb it your body can absorb some fat but it's a small percentage of fat without bile it's it's it's really it really needs biles to really absorb fat um it can only absorb small amounts otherwise and um and so it's going to have to be that leftover spillover that's going to get into your stools and keep that soft and that's that's what people seem to find is that if they're eating a little more fat than body comes orb it'll stay soft and then if you know a lot more than the body can absorb then they they get you know like uh you know quite loose stools and some people finally go to the caramel oh my God I'm having all these problems with with loose stools and that could be just you're eating too much fat or it could be that you're you're have you're still including other things in your in your diet that can cause loose stools as well and that's certainly uh possible um so I would I would definitely try to increase your fat and make sure that you're having soft nice stools if you're if you're getting constipated which means hard dry stool is not infrequent stools right because if you're going to absorb you know you absorb about 98 of the meat that you eat and so if you're doing that then obviously um you know it's uh you're going to go less often you're going to have less waste less is going to go out and so you know uh it's it's dry hard stools that is the definition of constipation you can look at the Bristol stool chart it'll tell you and so if you're if you're having problems with hemorrhoids I would definitely make sure you're getting enough fat so that things are soft and move through and that give these things a chance to heal and calm down um mental Clarity has gone up which is great I want to improve once you increase testosterone well I think that that's that's going to happen anyway um you're going to optimize your hormones as I said with cholesterol you know you're going to get the substrate that is then later turned into testosterone you're going to stop eating uh plants that have different uh hormone disruptors and can actually increase your estrogen levels it can block testosterone levels it can just disrupt your hormones in other ways as well um I there's actually you know Dr Berry has has videos on how to increase your testosterone and and growth hormone some of those involve you know just just eating you know intermittent fasting even if you're not doing a carnivore diet or a keto diet you can you can just intermittent fast just eat you know one you know one big meal a day in a certain time periods and and this has been shown I think to increase testosterone testosterone by as much as 50 um and growth hormone as well if I remember correctly so he has he has uh you know a couple great videos on that as well people can check out I've I've certainly seen in in clinical practice you know when we we measure people's hormones uh that you know men in their their middle age or or older will routinely increase their testosterone by 30 or even 40 just by going on a carnivore diet and there are a number of reasons for that and some of it which have uh sort of sort of gone over but yeah you can you know definitely definitely do that uh increase your testosterone and prove that so again thank you very much everybody who's uh donated us very very kind of you um Billy asks how can I put weight on with only beef I feel like I'm eating too much fat and it causes bloating uh well it depends on well I mean it depends what kind of kind of what you want if you if you want to stimulate muscle growth then you need to to to do resistance work you know whether that's you know just just working in the yard and doing doing physical activity or you know lifting weights or doing some sort of resistance training exercises you you need to stimulate your body's growth you know your body is very efficient it's not going to waste energy uh you know building up an organ that that's not necessary to build up you know it has to be efficient it has to utilize energy and resources very carefully or else you know you'll you'll squander them and you'll die and that's uh you know and and you know biology is nothing if not efficient and so you have to be able to stimulate these things and so if you're stimulating your body to work out you you go to the gym or you do you're just just heavy you know physical activity you're going to stimulate your body into growing and then if you on an only beef diet you're giving your body the perfect substrate you know that it needs to grow more meat because it's meat and that's going to be good for your hormones and everything like that as well cholesterol independently has been shown to be important in muscle growth as well and obviously getting enough protein is is very important for that also so that's going to be very beneficial and you're not going to get the the detriments of the different plant toxins and I think that that carbohydrates are completely derail your your body's ability to you to build lean muscle mass and perform athletically I've it's a night and day difference between my athletic performance and my ability to stay lean and put and build and maintain muscle on a carnivore diet versus a standard diet even a 9 on not all that standard a Whole Foods you know omnivorous diet I I just it's a massive difference in my own experience and the experience of a lot of people in biochemically it makes a lot of sense to me as well um so my advice would just be resistance training or you know physical labor and exercise and and just eat enough make sure you're eating enough fatty meat to the point that you're satiated and meat just doesn't really taste that interesting because I think you get that positive feedback and taste and that that tells your body or that that's your body telling you hey this we want these nutrients it tastes they're just going to make it taste better they're going to reward you after certain time it says yeah we don't really need this anymore you don't get that same positive feedback it doesn't taste as good the same steak will taste better or worse at different points in the the meal experience and so I think that's your body telling you physiologically that it has enough and it doesn't need anymore foreign so thank you very much Lynn it's very kind of you um I think there was I think there's another question here we go so uh Yaz back asks why am I stuck at 227 to 230 pounds down 70 pounds walking and lifting every day I eat beef bacon and eggs blood sugar is 71 this morning ketones 1.8 well you're doing great I think that's awesome you've dropped 70 pounds that's massive um and eating beef bacon and eggs that's perfect that's exactly what I eat and um and your and your blood sugar is great so I mean I don't I don't know why you're necessarily stuck there I don't know if there's anything else you're adding in I don't know how long you've been doing that I don't know your body composition you know it could be that your body is is quite happy there uh I that's that's about what I weigh at the moment and if I if I work out more or less I'll stimulate more or less muscle growth and and depending on how much I'm able to to eat I'll be able to maintain a certain body mass as well and and um you know but I'm still fairly lean the more I work out I actually get I do get more lean um but you know if you if you are sort of around 2 30 and you still have you know more you know more fat to lose uh you're working out a lot you have to remember that you're lifting weights you're going to be stimulating muscle growth muscle weighs more than fat and so you're going to be offsetting the weight that you lose from fat in weight that you're gaining from from building muscle and so you should you shouldn't just focus on the scale you should also look at your body composition and your body habitus and and how and how you feel is really the most important thing because this is really about health it's not about you know just getting jacked I mean that's that's a that's a happy consequence of of doing the sort of things that you can you can get in very good physical condition but it's you know uh it it should it shouldn't necessarily be your your number one goal I think that it's very important to focus on your health and how you feel and I think that's a that's a better way of looking at it and and it's you're more likely to stay on it and stay with it longer or even permanently if you're just focusing on on that sort of positive aspect of it and then and then your body composition and everything else will just come with it it really will it will just happen all on its own and so remember that you know when I when I first came when I came back to this you know like five years ago again you know when I was you know Revisited carnivore and went like what that was it that's what I was doing back in my early 20s I was only eating meat I was living as a carnivore and I felt unbelievable and I just started really going into it and digging into the the research and and the papers and start asking questions be like what do we know what can we prove and and going from there and uh I just I was only eating vegetables I was sort of on a keto diet but I wasn't doing keto I was just not eating carbs and and because I felt better when I didn't eat carbs and didn't eat sugar and wasn't drinking I was just eating vegetables and meat and I was trying to get back into shape after getting back from uh Bangladesh during uh sort of volunteering the refugee camps there in 2017-2018 with the rohingya refugees that sort of escaped genocide in Burma if people have heard of that and um so I was I was trying to lose weight I was trying to get in shape and so I was just eating lean meat and a lot of vegetables and so I was cutting down calories cutting down fat and all the rest and I just wasn't feeling great I wasn't losing weight and I was like well I'll have to work out more and and do my normal thing to get back in shape and um then you sort of revisit that went like right I knew it I knew plants had these toxins I knew these things weren't good for me I stopped I stopped eating them and just went back to eating a lot of meat and started eating a lot of high fat meat as well and I dropped like 23 pounds in 10 days I think most of that's going to be water weight and inflammation you know um and uh but then after that my body's body style started changing dramatically but my weight stayed exactly the same I I was 240 243 pounds on the nose every single day that I weighed myself I would do for three months you know I there wasn't a single day that I was 242 or 244 it was 243 on the nose every single morning and you know and so that was the thing about my I was physically I was just dynamically changing you know I was getting much more muscular much more lean that finally got it down to a stable sort of state of uh you know low body low body fat and high muscle fat muscle um composition and you know and uh but my weight really didn't change you know it was it just stayed right there so that could be happening with you as well you're you're eating the right things you're doing the right things and just remember you know you're you're lifting weights and you're building muscle and so that's going to offset the fat that you're losing so I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about uh the scale just you know just focus on how you're feeling how you're doing man you're you're killing it so just uh you know be proud of that and keep it up uh let's see oh where's that okay so um so Anthony has uh will mild um left ventricular hypertrophy reverse eating strict carnivore is a large weight gain 45 plus and edema normal eating carnivore no um I mean you can you can gain weight it should be healthy weight though it should be you know muscle mass it shouldn't be uh like you know fat and things like that um it it well you know it depends on what's causing your uh you know ventricular hypertrophy there are there are other things in in medicine and in the body that can go wrong apart from you know eating a bad diet and eating things that aren't good for you and not getting the things that are good for you um so just be mindful of that it can certainly help a lot of conditions but it's not going to reverse something that it didn't cause in the first place so you know think of this as like a you know toxicity relationship you know you if you're getting in lead from lead pipes you know you're going to get lead poisoning and so you know it's um you know and that's going to cause a lot of problems and then you get rid of the lead in your Dot and in your your ingestion of lead and the lead poisoning is going to eventually go away and that's going to get rid of the problems that you know came from from the lead poisoning but it's not going to reverse other problems so just remember that that there are other causes of things so uh we'll just you just have to see with uh with the heart issue uh but you shouldn't you should not be gaining you know an abnormal amount of of fat you know sometimes early on some people can can gain uh gain weight it is quite rare it's it's the exception as opposed to the rule and um there can be different reasons for that um you know sometimes you know people like Kelly Hogan talk about how you know they took it took like six months before she started losing weight she was actually putting on fat and you could be gaining muscle but she was saying like no I was that was definitely getting fat I was getting weight and I was I was I wasn't um you know it wasn't a good way but she felt really good as I was just focused on on the health side of things and then after six months just something just clicked and she just started shredding off the weight and she's you know maintained it she's you know she's very slender you know very bummy very high energy you know if you just see any of her videos she's you know just Delight you know because she has so much energy and so much uh just joy in her presence and it's really it's really nice to see and um you know but that's something that she experienced and other other people do as well and so and I have I have spoken to people who have eaten like a higher protein than fat ratio and they've actually put on weight I've uh speaking to someone the other day they put on like 30 pounds because they're eating low fat high protein carnivore and it just wasn't working for them they didn't feel great they didn't feel good and they were actually putting on weight then they switched over to high fat um and and a lower Pro you know a lower amount of um protein because it's really not low protein it's actually way higher protein than you know any other diet is giving you and you should really think of it um um as um as as getting adequate protein I was talking to coach Bronson the other day and that was something that he pointed out I think that's a very good way of looking at it is that you're not eating high this and low that or anything like that you're eating you're getting the right amount of protein and you're getting the right amount of fat and I think that once you start doing that and your body's going to work better and so this person then went on to eating more fat getting enough fat for her body and uh and the right amount of protein for her body and and then the way it started to come down and she started doing a lot better so an edema is not normal you should not be getting swelling you should not be getting that so you know if you are getting this you know there could be something else going on obviously you know if there's if there's some sort of heart condition you had some you know you know left ventricular hypertrophy you know there might maybe something else is going on generally you get a demo of like you know right heart failure but um in any case you know you you could have other things going on besides besides uh what's going on with your diet so that's something that you should you should get checked out by your doctor you know you don't want to you don't want to leave something alone that uh you know may need to be addressed okay so just uh be mindful of that uh let's see here sorry now okay Della should I worry about Omega-3 supplements on Carnivore yeah usually not um you you should be getting quite a lot of Omega-3s um there's yeah there's a lot of Omega-3s in in uh you know animal food and products especially when that animal is eating what it was supposed to eat as well um Dr Paul Mason I saw a talk of his and he pointed he was all about Omega-3s very interesting and people haven't come across him you look him up that guy is awesome and um very very interesting uh stuff and uh very well versed in the studies like he I was actually talking to him and he said that he he's you know he's a doctor he's a clinician and um he only works four days a week because he wants to have a full day to himself to just read studies that's what you just he just likes reading studies and reading studies and just knowing what's out there which is I think is just is you know very very very cool and very impressive and so and it shows I mean the guy knows a lot and um and he was talking about Omega-3s a lot in this and as it relates to heart disease which was very interesting and people should look that up and he was talking about meat and how there is there's definitely Omega-3s in you know things like grass-fed beef and that actually when you start grain feeding them you can actually reduce the amount of Omega-3s and start increasing the amount of omega-6s and you start getting a a bit of a wonky uh ratio and that there were there were some uh evidence to show that after a certain period of time you you your omega-3 rate levels went basically to zero and he I think if I remember correctly he said it was about three months so if someone if an animal is being grain fed for about three months that that would you know you'd lose a lot of the Omega-3s or maybe even all of the Omega-3s so something to keep in mind anyway but that's not to say that you know you shouldn't you should you should only grasp I mean I'm not saying that at all I predominantly just eat uh grain fed or grain finished beef anyway so and I feel very very good on that I think that going to you know uh you know independent ranchers and and buying a cow that's just been eating grass this whole life is doing good things for use good doing good things for you know the Rancher and uh and it's it's cheaper too if you can if you can afford the you know The Upfront cost and uh and the freezer then you know you do really well with it um but yeah so uh something to think about anyway but no you should you should be fine on omega-3s uh Luis asks uh any benefits in convincing parents to eat strict carnivore Monday to Friday and cheat meal on the weekend only way they may do it well look you know you have to sort of meet people where they are and if you think that's the only way that you're going to get them on board then you know do what you can I mean eating less poison is definitely better than eating uh you know a lot of poison and you know it might be that they're they're feeling a lot better and then when they eat these cheat meals it makes them feel a bit chunky and gross and they can actually see for themselves the difference and think like actually you know I don't feel that that hot when I when I do that maybe I'll just stick to the stakes so uh yeah if you can if you can get them there yeah get them there and uh you know just just do what you have to do family's hard family's hard to convince you know because they remember you when you were seven and you're like oh yeah remember when you thought that you were a superhero yeah how'd that one turn out you know and so you know they're they're not gonna necessarily um you know believe everything that that comes from you because they just you know uh they just know you too well and um and that can be and that can be a blind spot for them so you know you just have to you just have to live your life and you have to live uh literally by example and just know learn as much as you can about it and you know just be interested and if they're interested and they ask you about it you know you have you have answers ready for them you don't sort of push push on it but you just you'd be there as a as a resource and as uh support if they do want to try it um so Billy asked when I eat 100 grass-fed beef uh lamb I feel amazing my body reacts to chicken pork and even grain-fed beef is this uh autoimmune condition well it depends on what the reaction is um but I think that um it's more common that you see people reacting to that with autoimmune conditions and that can trigger flare-ups and um you know uh a friend of mine Phil F Scott who have I've done a couple podcasts with you know he has a ton of experience with autoimmune he's dealt with his autoimmune issues himself and he's helped talked to him Coach you know you know God knows how many people with autoimmune issues over the years and and that's something that that he um you know that he that he told me this is something that he saw regularly was that you know grass-fed beef really grass-fed red meat is really the best thing for autoimmune people because they're they're just too sensitive to things and maybe after months or you know a year or something like that they can can start eating chicken and pork and and dairy but at first certainly they can get a bit a bit done up by it so it's not necessarily that you have an autoimmune condition if you react to these things it's just that if you have an autoimmune condition this can cause a flare-up but I definitely feel the best on the the 10 year old grass-fed and finished cow that I bought in in America before I moved to Australia that was just like it was like you know eating Energon cubes it was just like Just Pure Life Force I just felt amazing I was just charged after eating that stuff and so you know and you look at the contrast you know like I've been on the sharp end of this for years now just just eating meat and only drinking water and sometimes Dairy but really not all that often and so I noticed the difference too I feel much better as opposed to you know eating you know chicken or pork and that's why I prefer eating beef just because I feel better on it um I don't necessarily feel bad I don't have reactions to to them I just don't feel as good and so if you're having a reaction to them just you know just listen to that whether it's autoimmune or something else it's just you know you're you're sensitive to that and or whatever that that animal is eating and that's being passed along through to you that it because that's not its natural food so it doesn't have the defenses and ability to break down those poisons and so some of those are going to slip through as well um so yeah just be mindful of that and you know just stick to stick to what works for you and that's pretty much it um this gentleman asks what do you think about people that state that carbs are needed for maximizing explosiveness and performance in sports such as basketball boxing MMA I just I just think that physiologically that's that's mistaken if you look at the biochemistry of it you know we produce you know blood sugar liver collection muscle glycogen ketones in exacting levels basically to an unlimited capacity when we are you know in ketosis when we're not eating carbs when you eat carbs it derails that entire process and then you can only run on the carbs that you have just eaten because insulin goes up and Insulin blocks proteolysis and lipolysis so you know basically it it forces energy into cells it doesn't allow it to come out of cells and so now your fat cells are blocked off you can't access those as energy your fat is your energy and so you're going to run out of energy you're gonna be feel fine for for a while while you have muscle glycine liver glycogen but that that is a finite resource that will go away and now you can't access your fat stores which is a way better way of storing energy you have way more energy stored in your fat than you do in your glycogen it doesn't matter how much your carbo load you you will never beat the amount of energy you have in your fats in your fat stores uh with with glycogen you're just you're just not going to So eventually you're going to run out and then you're going to hit the wall I mean every you know everyone who's done you know high-end sports or Endurance Sports knows about hitting the wall you go and you go and you hit the wall and then you you feel you know Garb like garbage and that most people stop at this point but some people push through and they say if you push and you push and you push then um you can break through the wall you can get your second wind and you can get you know this uh you know um what's it called a runner's high and you can just go and go and go well what that is uh physiologically is that you've been eating a bunch of carbs and you carbo loaded up so you have a lot of glycogen than you do but it will run out and your insulin's up and so this stops your body from being able to mobilize your fat stores and produce more energy and so you'll hit the wall you'll run out eventually and it usually takes about 24 hours for your insulin to drop this is why intermittent people that are doing intermittent fasting they find this gives it athletic benefit as well and exercise better benefit because you're waiting out the clock on insulin and then you just get into the state and they can run marathons they do great and if but if you push and you're push and you push and you push eventually you can force your your system to start uh accessing your fat stores and then you start making all the blood sugar glycogen and ketones that you need and you just feel amazing you come alive and you just go and go and go well I live in that second wind I am always in that metabolic State and so I'm constantly producing the amount of energy that I need for what I'm doing so sitting here talking to you guys I'm producing the exact amount of energy that I need to sit here and talk to you and when I get up and I go and do a workout or I go to the gym or I go for you know play a you know a game of rugby or whatever not that I have time to do that anymore it's been a couple years unfortunately but you know when I would that my body would is going to produce the exact amount of energy that I need to do that athletic Endeavor and it will uh and I'll feel great because when you when you burn energy you feel better right and this is why we take stimulants and and things like that to to increase the amount of energy we're using and we wake up and we feel great well when I work out I that makes me feel great because I produce more energy I burn more energy and that makes me feel good which makes me want to work harder and I burn more energy which makes me feel better which makes me want to work harder and it's a positive feedback loop and so that's very beneficial and so no I've I've found as a high performance athlete as a you know you know I I trained in MMA I didn't do it as a carnivore but I definitely did it and that and wrestling uh beforehand and also played rugby before and after carnivore before after enduring carnivore and I can tell you for a cold Frozen fact it is night and day difference it is so much better on a carnivore diet than anything I've ever done any way I've ever eaten and it's just not a comparison so you know just drive for yourself and see it's absolutely hands down better better so scroll here sorry uh so early um asks um second request sorry I didn't see the first one will microbial colitis get resolved and with this way of eating also been doing intermittent fasting so far no results after four months well I guess it to answer your your sort of address that that uh the second part first um you know it really matters if you are really doing this in in the correct way you know just saying carnivore diet you know it's like saying you're vegan what does that mean you know are you eating you know just carrots and onions and and you know you know uh heroin you know and eating Oreo cookies like these are all things that are vegan and vegetarian even plant-based um or you know where you're eating like you know a bunch of sugar and processed nonsense or you're eating like Whole Foods and all that sort of stuff so it makes a difference you're just saying you know carnivore you're just not eating you know you know things outside of the animal kingdom but you know maybe you're you know eating um you know some things are mixed mixed in and it's just mostly meat based and you're not getting enough fat or you're not eating enough you're not eating Society it's very easy to under eat on a carnivore diet and um and so it's um you know important to to get give your body what it needs um so I'd have to know a bit more to know you know why you're stalling but I would just say that you know if you're on a Carnival diet you don't necessarily need to fast if you're hungry and your body's asking you for food I think you should you should give it that I think you should eat fatty meat until your body's satisfied and if you do that and if you get enough fatty meat to where your body's satisfied um you're just not going to be as hungry as often so I really generally eat like once a day maybe twice if I'm working out a lot and that's that's all my body wants because I'm giving it what it wants in in the proportion that it wants at the time so I think that you should just focus on that and I think that would and especially focus on getting enough fat and enough protein that you'll you'll find that you have some benefits from that microbial colitis depends on what's causing it really but you know there's there's just a study that that was published recently uh with with um sibo and showing that like a carnivore diet actually you know really benefited people with sibo so a small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and uh and this really benefited that and those people so uh it's it's uh perfectly reasonable to um to consider that as something that might help um and your your microbiome will be you know absolutely helped and optimized as well which is something that is is a problem with with microbial colitis like you know C difficile and uh and you know other you know bacterial overgrowth it just sort of gets a gets an edge in that in the wild jungle that is your intestinal Flora um you want these things to be in Conflict you want a whole bunch of different species and specific species are more beneficial than others and so if you're if you're eating carnivore diet you will have this this largely diverse microbiome that is that is evidently beneficial and so that can certainly help and they I mean they do things and you know with with C diff where they do like fecal transplants and get people with with uh you know healthy gut microbes and they just like physically implant them uh into people which is um exactly what it sounds like and um so you know but it but it helps it actually does help um and there's there's even companies that do this you know they find people that are like in really good shape and they find that their microbiome can actually be very beneficial their studies in mice that you know identical genetically identical mice and some of them had a certain microbiome and they're just good normal healthy microbiome and uh and they just ate the same night they were given a controlled feed and uh you know they were just a healthy skinny mouse and then the identical twin of this mouse was um just has it's got micro microbes change in the microbiome changed to something else that they were studying and feeding the exact same food the exact same amounts and this thing just chunked up it just became very obese and so that that made that sort of line of research go down to really look at the microbiome and how this can affect have sort of meta effects um on the rest of the body in your health and so there's companies now that are that are looking for people that are that are you know very very slim and muscular and in good shape and saying okay we want to buy your your uh your stools and people do this they can sell it for like 500 bucks um uh a go and they can just send this to people and it's it's quite funny but um nice little side hustle if uh if anyone's uh able to do it um so I think that it certainly could help you and it certainly can't improve your microbiome is it going to is it going to help your specific case it's hard to say I mean sometimes people do need uh medical intervention and help maybe maybe even a fecal transplant I don't know uh but that is something you should certainly discuss with a doctor especially this has been going on uh for four months and you actually have been strict carnivore and eating a proper carnivore diet so I would be um I would be uh you know just uh very cautious about this you know you don't want to just leave things untreated for for too long you do want to uh get help uh from from uh from your doctor if you need it okay um so Brian asked anything I need to consider uh related to carnivore diet after having a full thyroid removal I take levothyroxine levothyroxine every day no uh you don't I mean you still need to take your medication you know because you don't have you don't have your thyroid producing that um that hormone so you you do need to take that and just you know just make sure that you're getting tested regularly and then that your body's um you know you're still on the correct dose for your body um there are different ways not everyone looks at these things but there are different ways of looking at the efficacy of thyroid hormone which is uh looking at trying to trying to see how uh uh how it's you know being affected inside the cells uh your serum thyroid isn't uh necessarily indicative of um of the inner workings of thyroid because thyroid hormones you know it's active in the cell not in the serum and so you know we can we can look at this in fact well generally in this serum range this is what this is this gives us a good physiological result but it's not necessarily the case it's not necessarily A one-to-one and so you can look at other things such as reverse T3 which will give you a better idea of how metabolically active the the the thyroid hormone is in the cells and it's not perfect but it gives it sort of gives a bit more fine-tuned look at uh how that's working but no you don't need to do anything special um besides just take you know take take your hormones uh it's it is important you do need thyroid it's you do need thyroid hormones so it's it's very very important it's using every single cell in your body and and has very important roles so just yeah just take that and make sure you're at the right level and just enjoy uh enjoy being healthy uh let's see and great discussion guys that this is awesome that everyone's uh participating and talking to each other and um sorry I'll just miss that one damn it it was about supplements oh someone's saying oh that there's C diff went away after one round of antibiotics and not doing probiotics nothing got better until I stopped the probiotics yeah well yeah probably yeah sometimes you just need this I mean C diff is nasty it's a nasty infection it's very life-threatening and so um yeah you don't just let that sit around you know it's it's um it's bad news um so PJ asks uh they've been strict carnivore for almost two years down 90 pounds uh five foot ten 215 pounds how do I get six-pack abs should I fast or cut calories I work out three days a week just keep doing what you're doing man like it's um you you have obviously had you know very good results just keep doing it you know it's um it's uh you know it just takes time you know if you have excess fat you've already lost 90 pounds you know just you know that's like that's like like in um in football I'd always get I would drive my Dad nuts you know when I'm like uh you'd be playing a amazing game of football American football and a team would be playing great and then you know they go in the ends they go into the prevent defense you know it's just like they have everyone just spaced out all the way over the place so they don't want to be like the big long you know uh touchdown and so these guys are making you know 15 10 yards 15 yards like every single play because they're stretched out their defense so they just make these like shorter attacks and they just keep moving the ball keep moving the ball keeping the ball and they end up scoring you're like guys you you don't change the losing your winning strategy you know like you know like the old saying is like you don't change uh horses in the middle of a race just go you know you're you're going and don't don't change your style up you have done an amazing job you've lost 90 pounds um that's great and and I'm sure you feel amazing and I hope you do just keep doing what you're doing like you will you will continue to lose more and more body fat and you'll get you'll get slim you're working out you're building the muscles up now you just got to get get the fat all the way off of it you know you're talking about fasting and cutting calories fasting and cutting calories did not get you here eating meat to satiety and working out got you here you know got you to the point that you lost 90 pounds so you know just keep doing it keep doing what you're doing you're doing a great job and you know don't get discouraged I mean you're right by the Finish Line you're on the home stretch you know don't get distracted and derailed now um sorry I'm just trying to find some of these and someone else is like can you talk about histamines when starting carnivore does this eventually resolve itself uh I mean yeah I mean I think that's that's a that's not really something that I know too much about and B there's a lot of people um that would really argue that you know that this those whole histamine things is probably a red herring and there's probably other things going on that's that's causing a problem and we're just sort of blaming it on so on a histamine reaction whatever that is um so I would just really focus on just being um you know as strict as you can be and just eating just focusing on animal uh nutrition and getting enough fat and getting enough nutrients and eating enough and and if you have a reaction to something if you're reacting to some sort of you know some food or whatever then um you know then don't eat that food you know you eat some other you know meat product and regardless of what it is whether it's histamines or anything else you're reacting to it and you're not doing well with it so just just cut it out don't worry about it and uh and just you know to eat whatever makes you feel the best um Bryant asks any idea why sleep and energy would drop off if I'm just doing beef bacon eggs and butter and water um that's a good question I I you know again there's other things that can be getting in the way of of all of this you know you know what's your what's your light exposure light in in your house you know are you staying up too late are you working too late you're getting stressed out with with work or family um are you you um having concerns before you go to bed are you getting um you know watching TV until late on computers on phones you know we have all this this light pollution that's getting into our eyes it's getting difficult to sleep um getting more and more difficult for people to sleep and so you can be more sensitive to these things uh than you were before certainly so just focus on that and focus on a getting enough food getting enough you know meat getting enough fat and getting enough water and you know you know an hour before you know you want to be asleep you know start turning the lights off like get into a dark room start start triggering your melatonin uh release and uh and start winding down you know read a book in low light don't go on computer screens don't go on yeah turn off all screens an hour before you go to sleep use a sleep mask you know even having you know just a bit of light in the room even though you you think it's pretty dark you know you're you're stimulating your brain to to wake up when it shouldn't and so like I use sleep mask I've I've never felt better I've never slept better it's just and it's also it's like a trigger you know it tells my brain like sleep mask goes on like oh we're going to sleep now I I used to have a horrible time sleeping and it would be very difficult for me to get to sleep and and stay asleep now it's really not a problem my sleep's improved dramatically so uh yeah it is a bit weird but you know there can be other things going on there can be other things going on besides what you're eating and so I would I would focus on those things or try to optimize yourself and your life in in other ways as well the diet is a huge huge huge step in the right direction I think it's going to accomplish most of you know a lot of it's going to cover a lot of uh problems and give a lot of benefits um and um you know so that's that's uh you know kudos for that but there are other things in your life as well that you need to need to address also that um you know we'll really help you out and and and optimizing you know your sleep routine is definitely one of those sleep is very very important I really wish I had a lot more of it in my life um let's see actually the thing you think he's skipping around I'm trying to like scroll through the questions and it just skips um okay um someone asked can you please comment on whether there are any any other meat-based influencer MDS that you disagree with on what constitutes the optimal human diet and if so what are the points in contention um well you know I mean everyone everyone sort of has a bit of a different take and that's that's totally fine I guess it's great to have a lot of different voices out there and to discuss these things and uh and and then we can all sort of you know talk about it and fine-tune um our our thoughts on things and you you know change our minds accordingly if if we're convinced that we may have had something uh off you know I you know as you know there's certainly a movement and then you know where people are you know eating more carbs or eating specifically like fruit and and and sweets and drinking juice or eating honey and things like that uh you know and there's and there's reasons that people put forward uh for doing that and and people you know saying that they that they like that um I think that you know that that fructose in particular is is quite harmful and I think that that's probably one of one of the better pieces of of you know nutritional science that we have at the moment is that you know fructose causes harm like it goes into your liver um and it breaks down into the same byproducts as uh ethanol and so it gets this it gives you the same problems uh as the breakdown products of ethanol and causes huge problems like fatty liver disease cirrhosis diabetes heart disease and even implicated in things like cancer and Alzheimer's so that's quite bad and um you know there are even uh studies um by like Dr Robert lustig and he was professor emeritus at UCSF medical school and he has been studying these sorts of things for a very long time and he um had a study that just published was it 2020 I believe that these are dozens of studies on this but you know this this was one in particular that that caught my attention um that uh actually you know showed you were able to reverse uh metabolic syndrome and fatty liver disease in kids just by eliminating fructose and it was a control there was a controlled study and they um sorry now uh so it was a controlled study and they and they found that that keeping it isochloric so the kids were all eating the same amount of calories and but they were just eating different calories uh and some were even eating like carbs and like you know crummy carbs too you know they were eating like like bagels and bread and all that sort of stuff and they just weren't eating they weren't eating fructose they weren't eating like that that sugar and they found that these kids in Just days were reversing their metabolic syndrome they're becoming more insulin sensitive their blood sugars are being better controlled and their fatty liver disease was was reversing and and that study actually met the Bradford Hill criteria for showing causation uh in in a study so um there's quite good evidence to show that fructose causes harm and it can cause long-term harm and short-term harm but laws and term harm is going to cause uh you know you know could cause metabolic syndrome and all these other things um and short-term it derails your metabolism like like I just talked about before you know raises your insulin that sort of just derails things and so you're not producing energy the same way that you were um and sort of in sort of shorthand layman's terms you know when your insulin goes up this forces energy into cells and not coming out so it it puts you into a fat storage metabolism as opposed to a fat burning and utilizing metabolism it also makes you overeat you know insulin makes you overeat by having these big swings and blood sugar swings so you don't feel as good and you feel like your energy is low so you need to eat carbs in order to to perk yourself up but also it blocks a hormone called leptin which you know comes from stretch receptors true in your stomach where you eat a big meal it sort of stretches out and sends leptin off your brain knows like Hey we're full but it's a majority of it comes from your fat cells your adipose tissue and that gives your your brain a signal of how much energy you have is like a running gas gauge and so when insulin blocks that your brain gets a signal that you have zero energy of energy energy reserves and your blood sugar is dropping because insulin stays up your blood sugar is going to drop and you can't replenish it because you've blocked your fat reserves and so you get a panic signal that says hey if you don't eat you're going to die this you're running out of energy this is dangerous and so this is why people just keep eating keep eating they overeat they don't realize how much they need to eat all animals in the wild know exactly what they need to eat you know they they eat to hunger they eat to taste and it just it just happens you know nature is natural it just happens all on its own you know if you you know I've never seen a koala with a calculator like figuring out their macros you know and if you need a calculator to figure out what to eat you're probably eating the wrong thing you should just be able to eat naturally so um but yeah so in any case um lost my train of thought there so I'm sorry but I didn't completely answer my question but um in any case um Billy asked how long before and after eating should you not drink water I'm just really tired guys I'm just I'm getting like a few hours of sleep every single night the last several weeks now um because it's just um just busy and a lot of on calls so how long before and after eating should you not drink water and how long does meat and fat take to digest uh so you know there's different thoughts on that but um you know like Dr Salisbury you know back in back in the day of uh you know the the augmentation of uh or sorry the relation of elementation and disease the book you wrote on on diet and health and uh and disease um if I'm not mistaken he was talking about sort of a two-hour window before and after and um and like room temperature water warmer water and things like that but um if you think about it you know if you if you drink a bunch of water you're going to do two things one You're Gonna Fill Up space in your stomach that you know is going to kick off that stretch receptor and send some leptin your brain's gonna go oh we got we have enough food now and this is why this is the argument for eating a bunch of fiber containing plants because fibroid cause bulk and stretch out your receptors but actually you're you're tricking it because that fiber has no energy and no nutrition in it so well you've got one over on your body well done and um you know so um if you're drinking a bunch of water you can just physically fill up the available space in your stomach and you're just you're gonna eat some Meats it's like oh yeah I'm just kind of full I don't want to eat anymore and so you can you can falsely uh dampen your hunger signals and maybe you don't get as much nutrients as your body wants um but it's also going to dilute your your stomach acid and your digestive enzymes you know how how much of an effect that makes I don't know but it's going to have some effect certainly um and uh you know meat and fat when eaten on its own on an empty stomach with this this highly concentrated stomach acid that we have uh we'll we'll should break down and digest fairly quickly within like an hour or two that should be liquefied and absorbed you know pretty much by then so it's fairly quick you know if you eat fiber it actually blocks that it makes physical barriers in between your food and the enzymes so they can't get in there to break them down and then it's the physical barrier between the broken down food and your gut lining and the Lumen of your small intestine where it's absorbing these nutrients and some people say oh well that's good it's it's reducing the amount of nutrients that you're getting and you know um you know even lustig you know talks about how well eating fruit is okay because you're getting the fiber and the fibers you know uh reducing the amount of fructose that your body absorbs but of course your body is still absorbing some of that fructose and you know you know you get less you know arsenic is better than more arsenic but you know like I'm but I'm happy with no arsenic thank you very much and so you know and also in that same vein you know it's going to be blocking other nutrients from absorbing it's not just going to be the fructose it's going to be other things as well so it's just something to keep in mind um uh when you when you think about all these sorts of things and then think about you know is fiber really something you want in your body for me it's really not it also you know uh uh Dr um Kilts um who's a really interesting guy who I've spoken to a couple times you know he talked about the you know the the glycocalyx and the you know the lining of um you know this Matrix lining around your um uh the aluminum of your Elementary track your digestive tract and and how this can be disrupted and damaged and how that has serious health effects and when you have the fiber going down it's called it's like steel wool is scraping that stuff off and it's been shown to cause micro abrasions in your gut lining cause increased you know inflammation and uh and you ask anyone with crohn's or ulcerative colitis you know they eat fiber you know it's it's bad news so that's uh also something to think about when you're thinking about fiber all right so keep skipping sorry guys I'm trying to sorry guys I'm just trying to find some of the questions it sort of Skips around a bit um but yeah by Rico uh thank you very much for Enrico um he asks uh are you concerned at all about long-term uh pancreas Health on a super high fat diet no actually uh no I'm not um I literally never thought about it that way but you know if you think about it you know we you know this is this is you know what I believe is is our physiologically uh appropriate diet that you know or you know as um uh you know Dr Barry says you know proper human diet I fully fully in agreement with that I think this is this is biologically what we are designed to eat was what we're supposed to eat and so you know and that goes for our pancreas as well I don't think that this is going to be optimal for some of our organs and not others I don't think that that that holds much water from a physiological biological standpoint and so no I I think that that your pancreas is going to be just fine and uh you you're not going to overwork it you're not going to damage it you're not going to cause cause it to be harmed and in fact it's going to eliminate a lot of other sort of issues that could mess with your pancreas such as you know gallstones which can then cause you know gallstone pancreatitis by getting blocked and backing up all these enzymes into the pancreas and having it start to digest itself and so that's um you know you're going to avoid that how do you avoid that what are gallstones you know people say that if you eat too much fat and too much cholesterol you're going to get gallstones well that's something that's never really thought about this physiologically because you know your gallbladder stores bile and um you know so it stores bile and um and it and it pulls it there for when you next eat uh fat because that's very important you know you have a number of organs working in concert to just or absorb fat right your stomach starts breaking things down your liver makes bile your gallbladder stores it uh your pancreas secretes you know lipase and other enzymes to break it down and your small intestine absorbs it so you've got five organs working in concert just to absorb fat so how are we saying that that's bad for us you know it doesn't really make any sense our body wouldn't have wasted its time making all those very expensive uh you know biologically expensive processes if if that was you know if it didn't want that like if you didn't want that well that's bad for me it's just not going to absorb it your body actually you know can can give barrier protection against a lot of toxins in your in your body if you eat these things like lectins normally you wouldn't absorb these things it's only when you have like leaky gut caused by other other sorts of plant toxins that the lectins get in in the first place and your body reacts to these things or or it has a reaction to your body normally you're not going to absorb this stuff your body's like we don't want it stay out of there um so if your body didn't want fat it just wouldn't absorb fat so that that just doesn't make sense to me and so when you know if you think about it if you eat enough fat and again enough fat I mean uh as much fat as your body can absorb as much fat as your body has bile to absorb then you cannot you physically cannot get gallstones right because you are going to express all of the bile that you have in your gallbladder every day and even if you were some had some weird illness that you were going to make you know gallstones in one day which wouldn't be compatible with Life you wouldn't have made it out of the womb um you know you you still will not form gallstones because you're going to be expressing this every single day you're going to be getting out of getting it out so every day it's just going to be empty empty empty empty you're not going to be you're not going to be in a position to ever make gallstones because what are gallstones right when you're when you're storing the bile in your in your gallbladder it doesn't just it's not just you know that's just the set amount and then everything else is just spilled over you know it actually concentrates it and because you have to you may be going a few days or a week or two between meals as a carnivore in the wild which most carnivores do have long periods in between their meals and so you need to store up the amount of bile that you need to get a big bolus of fat so that your body can run on that again and so what happened you know so it goes into your gallbladder and actually concentrates and concentrates concentrates concentrates and so what happens to any hyper concentrated solution at rest forms you know precipitate it forms crystals that's what bile sludge is that's what gallstones are and you know maybe it's it's some people you know concentrate it more than other people and they're the ones that are going to be predisposed to getting uh gallstones because not everyone who fasts or goes on a low-fat diet gets gallstones but uh that is that is what you see people that are trying to lose weight and they start cutting out the fat those are the ones that are that are getting gallstones you know you look at look at the numbers for um people who get bariatric surgery and they get like a um they get you know like a bypass or something like that there's much much higher proportion of these people get gallstones much higher it's massive massively increased and uh you know for people try to explain this there's like oh well something changes metabolically when you lose a lot of weight and you get this bariatric surgery and you lose a lot of weight and that something changes and so um you know it's uh it's and that's why it's just sort of you know we don't really know but something happens right um but a lot of these people you hear them say like I actually heard one lady say you're like look I just I'm gonna have to think I have to sort of let this settle because you know I I didn't think it was possible at all for me to get gallstones because I have for the last three months I have not eaten any fat at all so I should not be able to get that because we tell people that you know you eat fat you know you're going to get gallstones and that's that's a problem like that's why she got gallstones because she didn't eat fat and if she had just eaten enough fat she would have been she wouldn't have been able to form Stones so even if something did change metabolically with her weight loss to to make it more easy for her to get gallstones she still wouldn't have made gallstones because there wouldn't have been any bile in there in the first place so something to think about anyway um so how bad am I messing up my 22 month carnivore way of eating progress by using erythritol and monk fruit sweetener like well it's not gonna be good I mean you know I I mean I haven't really looked into monk fruit sweetener exactly what that chemical does to you but you know first of all you're going to be hitting your limbic system and you're going to be remembering all this like these sweet things so you could potentially be you know uh uh you know getting a recurrence in your in your uh you know carb and sugar Cravings um and uh you know there's there's sort of mixed information on whether or not artificial sweeteners you know affect your blood sugar or insulin but they're they're you know but there are some that suggest that it does and I've certainly seen people with um with diabetes who get worse control um you know they check the blood sugar quite often uh they get worse control when they're when they're eating and using artificial sweeteners um you know urethra tall like that's like one of these these sugar alcohols those things were gross those are so bad for you and like those those could cause like just you know explosive diarrhea like that's just that's nothing you want in your life man like seriously um but uh you know it's it I however you look at it it's it's whatever it is and whatever it's doing it is not what we evolved on it is not what our biology was designed for and so however you slice it it's not optimal and so if you include it and that gives benefit to your life somehow and you and you are okay with the effects that it has and you know uh that's that's fine that's perfectly up to you you know I don't I don't think that you know it's my way of the Highway by any stretch of the imagination I just I just think that you know this is this is you know how to do it optimally that's what I I believe that there is is an open way to do this um and that you know anything that didn't exist 100 years ago a thousand years ago a hundred thousand years ago is probably not going to be in that camp right and so you know and some people say well some things are are you know good for some people and we're all different and all that sort of stuff we all are different in certain respects and there are people that have uh you know more or less protection against you know less optimal things or even toxic things like certain plants or lead um but just being more resistant to these things doesn't mean that they're good for you it just means that you're more resistant right and you know there are no examples in the wild that I know of and that anyone's ever been able to produce to me of two members of the same species that have different optimal diets you know if you have two animals that have different optimal diets those are two different species they just have to be and they're gonna be quite distant species as well and we are one species we're a homo sapiens sapiens you know if if one group of people were herbivores and another group were carnivores or or omnivores we those would be different species that's it that just is it and so we do have an optimal diet there is something that is the best I argue that it's a carnivore diet a high fat carnivore diet but it is something whether I'm right or wrong it is something we do have uh an optimal diet for our species that that that just that's just a fact and so anything that didn't exist a hundred thousand years ago or you know several thousand years ago or even 100 years ago and uh you know those sorts of sweeteners those artificial sweeteners have not existed all that long you it's you're gonna be really hard pressed to to make a good strong argument that that's something that's actually beneficial or necessary in your life so and then you know sort of jumping back to like the fructose sort of fruit things you know we had a lot of a lot of our ancestries living in ice ages and living in uh you know ice times people say well yes because everyone moved closer to the Equator obviously and getting all that tropical fruit first of all a lot of tropical fruits are poisonous and will kill you look at the diet of a cassowary bird that thing needs 150 150 different fruits in the tropics that every single one of those will kill you dead all right so no fruit isn't there for you to eat fruit is there for something to eat but not necessarily you and in in the case the cassowary bird those those plants want the Castaway bird to eat it because those seeds germinate in their gut and they're able to to have Offspring and if they get eaten by something else those seeds go to waste and so they do not want you to have anything to do with it um but you know when when you look at the fossil record actually this is something that that uh Professor Bill Schindler talks about you know he's a professor of uh of you know paleo uh archeology like he he's showing the false record actually when the when the ice sheets were coming down and the first ice ages people were moving up they were going into the ice okay and so you know it's not um it's not uh it's not something that uh you know is really really held up by the um by the by the available evidence you know and so um so yeah so you just you can just sort of go into that a little bit more and um and then just realize that you know when people are living in these ice times there really isn't it wasn't going to be any any fruit or honey available and yet people were were living and prospering and and uh and thriving during that time and so you could argue that you know fruit and fructose and and carbs or um are okay um I don't really think you can argue that they're necessary I don't think I don't think you can make that argument stick too well because you know there are so many examples of people that don't eat any of these things and don't eat any carbs whatsoever and haven't for a very long time as a civilization and and do just fine do great so um sort of a tangent but yeah and um so I had someone someone just try to go um like join my live I don't know exactly what that is I haven't really thought it was on Tick Tock I really know how that works um and so I don't know if they like have to I don't know right now send me a message so tell me what you want to talk about I guess um and let me know um I don't yeah I don't know maybe I shouldn't you know accept one of these things someday and just see what they want to say it's just like sort of answering the phone randomly just be like okay and uh I guess we'll find out whatever you want to talk about um let's see sorry so Judy asks uh hi are you a doctor yes I am a medical doctor specializing in neurosurgery but I also do a lot of research into diet nutrition how that affects health and disease and so that's that's what I I talk about on these things um and um and she asks can you reverse type 2 diabetes yeah you actually can so you know the thing is is that there are a lot of these so-called diseases that really aren't diseases per se these are um these are a product of um what I think they're not diseases per se I think that they're really um toxicities and malnutrition so a toxic buildup of species inappropriate diet and a lack of species specific nutrition so namely too many plants not enough animals okay and um and so I and I think that's manifesting that these toxicities of malnutrition are manifesting in in a way that we call diseases but they don't act like diseases you know they just get worse and worse and worse it doesn't matter what you do and uh diabetes is one of those things however when you remove these causative agents you know like carbohydrates and sugar and alcohol and and smoking you know that these these so-called diseases go away okay so that's not a disease right that's a toxicity a toxin toxicity relationship right so you know you're eating a toxin and you get a toxicity right so it's um you know and then and that's evident by the fact that you remove the Toxin and the toxicity goes away and that's it that is exactly what we're seeing with things like type 2 diabetes autoimmune diseases and and so many other things but yes type 2 diabetes you can absolutely reverse that there was actually a show called reversed where they uh had a bunch of people with with very bad type 2 diabetes and um and they got together with you know people like you know Dr Ken Berry and they helped coach them and give them on a ketogenic diet and um and uh and and then they reversed their diabetes they had people that were on you know and there was a lady that was on an insulin pump for 12 years and um and she she came off of uh she came off of that and so um you know this is this is this is happening all over my mom reversed her type 2 diabetes she was a type 2 diabetic for you know 30 years and two months on a on a high fat carnivore diet for hba1c went from 8.9 down to 6.1 and she came off all of her her medications you know and her doctor was like you know what the hell did you do how the hell did you do this like that's incredible this never happens how did you do this this only gets worse but you people don't just reverse this but she did and and and I talked to her about about why she did about why it did and my Mom's doctor is no slouch you know she's an MD PhD from Harvard she has a PHD in Biochemistry from Harvard and I was talking to her about how like look we've got biochemistry all wrong you know I think that you have to call me as a Fed State not a fasting State I disagree I think the so-called fasting state is our primary metabolic State that's the that's the um where all of our heavy machinery comes to Bear we have studies you know with with you know wolves and things like that looking at you know you know back in the 1980s saying like oh well these guys don't you know these these uh you know wolves don't uh you know carbo load before they chase Caribou for 10 hours do they have blood sugar they have liver glycogen they found out yes they do and it's rock solid it doesn't change so they're in this metabox state you know cows are in this metabolic State because they break down fiber into fat and protein and that's what they absorb and so they're in a ketogenic starvation State well they're not it's not a starvation State first of all you eat three pounds of ribeye a day you're not starving you're not starving anyone you're not fasting certainly uh so that that's just a misnomer and um you know it's it's the I think it's our primary metabolic State that's a primary metabolic state of nearly every animal in the wild so I don't think that um I think that uh it's something that provides serious benefit to people um so so Samantha says I have psoriasis over 75 of my body I'm so sorry that's uh that's very serious um did carnivore for six months without relief is there something else I need doing well um psoriasis just like you know other other sorts of conditions um you know is is very sensitive to these things so you know you need to be very strict you're going to need to be more strict than most people and so you're going to need to cut out all Dairy um really going to check and probably check check out like egg whites uh chicken and pork and if you can just do grass-fed red meat like you know beef and um um and uh yeah grass-fed beef and lamb uh that's going to be best for you and then just and just stay with it you know um because you know psoriasis does clear up eventually but you need you need to be much more strict than other people so you can't take any of the any of the monk fruit or the urethra tall and uh or any of that stuff you know you're gonna have to be even even doing a carnivore diet even just eating meat and eggs uh you're gonna have to be a little more strict you're gonna have to you're gonna have to eat the most beneficial and safe ones out there so um you know that that's what I would suggest um and and Judy says that her talking about the type gives her husband's type 2 diabetic and yeah I would I would absolutely get him right on board with a carnivore diet like it would just remarkably change you know with it you know uh HBO and C is a marker of three-month control of your blood sugar so test it now go carnivore for three months test it again I guarantee you it will be night and day difference in fact I'll be on the second season of reversed um and uh you know with with uh Dr Dr Berry Dr ovadia who's a cardiothoracic surgeon wrote a book called you know stay off my table he Advocates a carnivore diet is a cardiothoracic surgeon who does bypass surgery on people with heart disease and he's saying hey we've got it wrong you know like stop eating plants stop eating sugar and garbage and just eat meat just go carnivore and you will not need bypass surgery okay so um that is something I think about we're doing the second season of reversed in um later on this year sort of like end of November early December is when we're going to film that and um and that's going to be addressing uh things with the carnivore diet and we're just going to really go at things uh strong with with a carnivore diet and um and uh you know and try to reverse other people's view not even try we're going to reverse other people's diseases using a carnivore diet um so Jeff asks for lean meets uh cut for stew and other do we get benefits from adding fat to it when cooking and does oh Jesus why come on why did it Skip and why I said okay so I don't know this thing just skipped out and um I have no idea where your comment went it just went to the absolute top I don't know uh yes there's a benefit to adding fat to it because you do want to get enough fat you you stew the meat it breaks down uh you know the collagen and connective tissue and make that more readily digestible which is great um but you still need fat fat is very very important for you so I would definitely get uh get the fat um okay guys so I've been uh talking here for nearly two hours and it's been a lot of fun and I really like uh to hey Ben how's it going um and I really like doing this and I'd like to keep keep doing this uh unfortunately it's getting quite late I've got an early morning and um and and I've got a few things I need need to do and have dinner and things like that and uh and sort of uh and uh you know other other responsibilities they need to take care of so uh thank you guys very very very much uh for joining me I thought this was a lot of fun uh if you guys like this then this is uh something that's um you find useful uh and and you guys show up and ask questions uh there's something I'll be I'll be doing more and more of and and try to make more regular time for it and um so I really appreciate it thank you all for coming on if you think this is something that other people would benefit from and and would help them then you know please you know share it and um and send it to them and uh and you know uh and uh yeah and that just this helps get the message out there because this is something that I think is eminently important um this is something that people can actually take control of their health and their lives again they can get a lot of control back and um and and they don't need to be sick and they don't need to be hurt and they don't need to be tired and they don't need to be sad and depressed and and um you know they can just and they don't and they they can do it without medication you know which is the most important thing I think um you can just be healthy you know you know humans are designed to be healthy animals in general are designed to be healthy that's how we survive you know like things that have made it through nature nature is wild it is kill or be killed and so if you if your species has not gone extinct yet is because it's a pretty badass species and so it really can't just be sick and miserable all the time that means something is wrong so if you're eating what you're supposed to eat if you're not if
