    "body": "member asks in general how long after starting carnivore would someone be fully adapted cleared of toxins and experiencing the full benefits thank you um well full benefits is is a bit different majority of benefits within a few weeks um you're going to get a lot of these toxins out of your body a lot of them seem a lot of people seem to feel a lot better after about two weeks alcohol generally takes around three to four weeks to get fully out of your system but it's know it's better every every week every day and so that's why I tell people you know give yourself a full 30 days because then you'll get most of the stuff out of your system then you'll start feeling really really good by the end of that time and you can give yourself you know an accurate depiction of what you might feel like with all this stuff out of your system some things take longer so Omega sixes seed oils these sorts of things have a longer halflife you it's like a couple years halflife so it can take years to clear this garbage out of your system and after 3 four months you end up radically increasing the amount of mitochondria you're going through autophagy this whole time you're turning over cells you're turning over cell lines you're turning over organel and so usually about six months on you sort of recycled and turned over all of your cells you feel a lot better but you can continue to stimulate more growth and um increase the number of mitochondria and their efficacy going on to you know two three years right so you're just going to keep getting benefits you're going to feel fantastic after a few weeks you're going to get tons of things out of your system if you have any sort of medical issues they can take longer or shorter to go away a lot of them clear up quite quickly which is remarkable because people live with these things their whole life and they're just taking medications and medications and just getting worse and worse and worse and now all just you know a month or two in then these these serious medical issues are improving dramatically or even going away others take longer so Hashimoto can take a year or two before you really get your antibodies down to zero depending on how high they were and and then allow your thyroid a chance to repair which it may not do all the way there is such a thing as damage done if we if we permanently damage ourselves due to exposure to the wrong food and causing autoimmunity or just direct toxic damage you know from eating you know cyanide containing things like almonds and cassava and flax seed and these sorts of things that that can permanently damage your thyroid that can permanently damage your neurological system so you know that uh that that can leave lasting damage that's not going to heal fully but you'll get as you'll heal as much as your body is able to heal um so you'll feel a lot better most people feel a lot better after a few weeks two to three weeks they feel dramatically better and I mean I felt like a different breed of human just superhero after two weeks and most people report that as well some people it takes longer like I said to get that energy level and all that sort of stuff um but if if you are um if you're you know if you're coming to like a very strict carnivore diet and you're only eating meat and only drinking water most PE and getting enough fat getting enough food most people will feel a lot better after two to three weeks but you get continuing benefits you just keep feeling better and better and better and then you start having more energy you want to start working out and that's going to obviously improve your health even more so you get a vast amount of benefit within a few weeks and then you keep getting more benefits after that if that makes sense so full maximum benefits that's a lifelong expression right but you keep getting you get a lot of benefit just right away getting this garbage out of your system and that that can make you feel dramatically better within a couple weeks"

    "body": "carnivore for about four months still no weight loss how much longer do you think till it comes off still facing brain fog am I not fat adapted yet so this was this was the question about uh Dairy so look you're in that situation where you're not necessarily uh losing much weight remember that if you put on muscle and you lose fat you will stay the same weight so the scale is really not what's important a lot it's really important for people to really focus on their health as opposed to the scale the vast majority of people will lose weight and fat uh early on but other people will be you know everyone comes from a different situation metabolically and hormonally and so you just need to look at things from from where you are and focus on your health this is about being healthy first and foremost this is not a weight loss gimmick this is a health optimization technique this is this is eating to our biological design and being as healthy as we can possibly be that's the main thing weight generally comes along with that fat loss generally comes along with that but it's that's that it's important to focus on the health aspects so think about how this is helping you think about how this is benefiting you and um and and go from there and let the other things come as well brain fog is rare but again there's there are some people that it takes months before they really start seeing the full benefits and we don't exactly know why I haven't figured that one out yet um U because it's very rare we just don't see it every now and then and then just all of a sudden something just ticks over and just people feel massively better and their weight starts coming off there are a lot of reasons for for weight loss stalls could be Dairy could be other things that you're including in your diet like artificial sweeteners that's a common one people including orthol monk fruit sugar Stevia these sorts of things because they think well it's natural sweetener well Sugar's a natural sweetener right and so you know we're we're avoiding that too so you know you just want to just just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good just cut out everything else just keep it simple um and have uh you know a bit of organs things like that the higher nutrient density the more satiated you're going to be earlier on your body's chasing nutrients it's not chasing calories so you don't want to eat a ton of organs because that can be overwhelming to your system you can get too much of a good thing and have hypervitaminosis or you know increase it especially the fat soluble vitamins like vitamin A or things like copper and the different metals they build up and take longer to clear out of your system than say like water soluble vitamins like B vitamins right so just be mindful of that but having a bit of organs especially early on when you're transitioning it's great idea you know it's it's Nature's multivitamin right and so and uh so you can try that there are other reasons different hormonal reasons things that people have leptin resistance Le tiin that's elevated it's generally very difficult to lose weight for most people and um some people still can but a lot of people don't a lot of people when they have high leptin it's very stubborn weight loss and that can be in indicative of a slowed and damaged metabolism and so you need to coax your metabolism to increase you don't want to starve it and suppress your metabolism more and that's what happens if you can if you chronically limit the amount of nutrients and energy available through your diet your body's just going to shut things down and you're going to feel really tired you're gonna have horrible brain fog you're going to feel wretched and you're not going to really lose weight because your body saying no no no we have to store everything everything coming in is going into fat because we need to survive a famine and so energy levels are down because less coming in less is going out so you want to do the opposite you want to coax your system you want to coax your metabolism and speed it up so you want to do things like exercise anerobic exercising so resistance training sprinting those sorts of things even though you feel tired just do it you'll get something done you you'll start encouraging your system to work but you need to eat enough as well you don't just want to exercise and not eat enough because then you're doing the opposite as well your body's like well now we really need to save everything because you know we're having a high demand output and you know we're not getting enough in so we really need to hang on to this tightly so don't do that uh eat enough and eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you know try that twice a day if you need to especially if you're working out and see how that goes you can check test your blood you can test your thyroid you can test your uh leptin you can test your fasting insulin these are signs these These are different things that if they're out of balance that can cause uh slow weight loss and and slow metabolism you can also check your your nutrient status your B12 your vitamin D your zinc and your magnesium these are very important things um you get them with meat but people are when you're starting on this thing most people are on a very deficient diet and not taking supplements and so they're going to be quite deficient in these things to to the extent that the reference ranges have actually slid down and gotten and gotten lower because they're just an average for the community since everybody's deficient in magnesium B12 zinc and vitamin D they're just just move that reference range now well this is normal now it's like this is the new normal deficiency is The New Normal apparently and uh no it's not normal and so if you're in the reference range for these sorts of things you're not on the really upper end of that reference range or above that reference range you're low that's all there is to it it's I've never seen um any country uh any any lab that had a reference range for B12 that's actually made it into what I would consider an optimal reference range for B12 so the other ones you know sometimes they sort of lip into the right range but not always um so you want to be on the upper end of their reference range If you're sort of low normal for them you're really low if you're low low for them really low um so you can check those things as well uh but just be patient get out everything except fatty meat and water and make sure you're eating enough make sure you're sleeping well because that can be a major stall as well if you're stressed out you're not sleeping well that raises cortisol and that will stall your weight loss and um there a lot of different things it's it food is the main factor here but these other factors really matter as well so just keep that in mind uh as well and and um and then just just keep giving it time you know it uh it can take longer for some people than others even when they're doing it right the vast majority of people don't uh have uh as much of a delay as this but you know it will happen for you too i' I've never seen anyone not get there and some people I see that their letin massively elevated and it just takes time and they're not really losing weight not really losing weight not really losing weight and then all of a sudden their leptin's coming down the whole time and then all of a sudden Just Hits that Tipping Point and the rest of their metabolism other sorts of factors coming play and then they start losing weight um I just had a lady actually been following since last year she uh has been doing this and you know explain that to her and and she'd been overweight her whole life nothing had ever worked and um and she came around this and she said okay I'm just going to give it a try you know I knew it can take longer and and she's doing this for her health and she just really enjoyed it she was eating well and things were and and know it wasn't hard for her to do so she's like okay you know I'm enjoying this she wasn't really losing much weight but her leptin was Skyhigh and her fasting insulin was very elevated as well and she had other other markers that you know this was going to take a while and um you know so we we corrected things and added a bit of liver and all these sorts of things that she was able to eat and we just sort of tracked her every month and she's losing a bit but not all that much and uh you know really just very slow but she's like okay I'm just I'm in this for the Long Haul you know I feel good I'm just going to focus on my health and just give it time that was back in August right so was a long time ago right and just last month she came in hadn't seen her for sort of a month before that and every month she was just sort of like losing just a a little bit little bit a little bit and then all of a sudden bam 16 kilos which is significant right I mean that's like 35 pounds right so that was in a month month six weeks you know and so that just that just happened to hit just that was it her her Leon was coming down down down and then bang just dropped all this weight so you know that that is generally what happens your body needs to just get to a point where it's happy and it's saying okay we're not in a famine anymore we can release this so fix all those other things and then after that just give it time and I think you'll do fine I'm sure you'll do fine"

    "body": "member says I've just got my first A1C after starting carnivore serum sugar from 8 to 7.2 A1C from 6.8 to 6.4 trigly 1.1 hdl1 I disappointed my hba1c isn't lower what might be the next step I need to take well first of all it came down and that's good doesn't doesn't do that any other way right I mean what what you know have you what have you done so far that has given you even that much of a drop in your A1C right so you know I mean this is we need to be appreciative of this as well you know count your blessings uh some people have have more of a drop than that but you know who cares you know I mean some some people have you when you're coming from the very higher levels of A1C that can have a more dramatic drop so I mean I've seen people with a hb1c of you know 13 14 drop down to you know five or six after three four months that's that's incredible right so that doesn't happen but that doesn't happen either it's not supposed to go from 6.8 to 6.4 it only just goes up it just goes up it goes up it goes up and you try to slow it down with medications and lifestyle but it only goes up that that was the previous thought and teaching was that this is a progressive disease and it only gets worse right not anymore so you're already improving and that's that's you're already breaking the norm breaking the standard so that's great you should be really happy with that also how long was it between tests right you know was it one month two months three months five months six months a year right obviously that's going to matter too so the point the the main thing is is the trend you're trending in the right direction also if you're on blood sugar medications for your diabetes you should not stop them until your blood sugar indicates that it's appropriate to if you're if you're you're fasting blood sugar um you really should be between four and five that's what you want to keep it and so if you need medications to keep it there take medications to keep it there right um going from 8 to 7.2 and dropping from 6.8 to 6.4 that that seems is about right you know you want to be you want your fasting uh fasting blood sugar to be between four and five really so you still have insulin resistance you still have diabetes you still need to take medication if you're on it and you should probably be be on it uh in this case that can help you bring that blood sugar down and reduce the insulin resistance or give you enough insulin if you're not producing enough uh for now but it's um most people can come off insulin um but it takes time right so it can take you know people you know people get you know very excited that that this can help reverse their diabetes so they go okay if I just stop eating carbs I don't have diabetes anymore no not yet you know you have you have lead poisoning right and so you stop drinking leaded water great there's still lead in your body there's still poison in your body your body still has to recover from that and if you need medications to get that lead further out of your system and heal and repair the damage from that lead great you know then so be it thank goodness there they have medications for those things I don't think we use that as a crutch to justify eating a whole bunch of carbs and sugar definitely not but if you need it uh because you have damage and you're you you're using it as a bridge when you're transitioning to a proper diet great that's very useful and so that's what medication is supposed to be for it's this temporary bridge to get you to where you need to go not just a lifelong um you know lifelong condition that you have to chronically be taking even though that's what they are buil for and designed for because that's what makes them the most money is if you take this the rest of your life you don't need to take it the rest of your life but you may need to take it right now so if you if you're on medication I continue taking your medication I would try to get your blood sugar down between four and five when especially when you're fasting and um and if you need you know metformin or whatever you're taking to to achieve that that so be it don't come off your medication until it's actually appropriate to you but you know what whatever you're doing is working so that's good you know it's all about the trend you're going in the right direction and so why would we be upset about that it's going in the right direction you know we can all want in instant results but this is amazing that doesn't happen normally right and so doing anything else that doesn't happen this is the only thing that has ever done that right there right and so you be very happy about that be very proud of that and just look forward to the rest look forward to it it continuing to get better you know if um you know if you're if you're not pure pure pure fatty meat and water get there and um and get rid of all artificial sweeteners everything I I don't care if they don't have carbs in them I don't care if allulose has a much lower glycemic index just don't eat it just don't have it just eat fatty meat only drink water eat until you're full stay on meds when you need them come off when it's appropriate and you will do you will do just fine and you will reverse your diabetes that is what people all around the world are doing uh by the millions now it's it's absolutely incredible so um you know just keep it up keep going get as pure as you can and uh just be patient it is going in the right direction and you're doing gr eat so just keep it up"
