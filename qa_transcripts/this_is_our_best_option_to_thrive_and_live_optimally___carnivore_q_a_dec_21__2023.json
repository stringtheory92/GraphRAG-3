    "transcript": "you start looking at how we've just been lied to you for decades about what to eat and we've been hurt by that a lot I mean extremely hurt extensively hurt and continue to be hurt and profited on our misery and illness and in fact selling is a thing that makes us sick and miserable and then profiting off that sickness and misery that's that's truly sick that people do this but they do and they do it by the millions and so it's affecting billions of people around the world it's absolutely disgusting all right hello everyone thank you very much for joining sorry uh running a little late just back in Seattle and um had a bit of technical issues with all all my stuff here so lighting's a bit weird and um and everything else just took a bit of time to to come back but um thank you all for joining hopefully uh we can we can get everything answered that um that people people need to be answered so there are a couple let me see here there's just a let me see I think there was a there was a few questions earlier I'm just going to try and scroll back and see where it is so anyway this is this is for uh December 21st in America uh December 22nd in Australia in that part of the world world and we'll start with this one this is the first Super Chat I think there there might have been ones before that but this is the first one that's popping up for me so this is from Lively lioness thank you very much for the Super Chat two years carnivore on a calorie um calorie deficiency started eating to fullness this month and gaining rapidly I'm scared I I want to have faith uh that I'll lose weight so it depends on what what what you're putting on basically I mean you yes you can you can put on fat and that will make you gain weight but you can also put on muscle and you will also gain weight so it it does matter about that also remember that if you're eating in a caloric deficit for too long if you have too much of a deficit for too long you will slow down your metabolism and then when you start eating more to what your body requires or demands or is asking for then you'll gain weight because your your body isn't doesn't know that you're on a diet your body doesn't know that you want lose weight your body is taking your inputs and creating outputs from that so it's your body is very physically responsible if you get your hours cut at work the last thing you want to do is start blowing out the credit cards right you want to you want to budget you want to restrict you want to you know be very frugal your body does that as well and so your budget's going to be reduced you have less energy coming in you have less nutrients coming in you're going to have less going out simple as that and the thing is though is that when you do get your hours picked back up and you do have more money coming in it doesn't just go okay yeah great you know let's go uh let's go party now it says well I never want that to happen again you know the next round of layoffs could be right around the corner we need to save and so you're going to keep your your energy act outputs low and it's going to start putting money in the bank right which is fat and so you can do that as well and so that's why people do these yo-yo diets where they they starve themselves they depress their metabolism and they and they lose weight but then they but then they stop losing weight and they aren't able to maintain that because it's not sustainable and then they put start putting weight back on and or even just go back to how they were eating before maybe just slip a little bit and their body goes okay no we need to store this we need to store this so um it can also be hormonal issues as well so that's the main one is that is that there are metabolic issues that you're depressing your metabolism when you're restricting and so so there's also a difference between eating to fullness and eating to what I think is your body telling you to stop so people say oh you want to eat maximally until you just want to vomit and you just feel stuffed and never do that ever never ever ever do that you just eat meat when it tastes good and if your body's telling you this tastes good that means it's rewarding you for getting those nutrients in it means it wants those nutrients right if they are the right nutrients there are things that taste good and aren't good for you of course it's highly palatable food that you have food scientists that for some reason they decided to use their massive brain power to figure out how to make something horrible for you taste really good so you keep eating it in an addictive manner instead of actually making something good and healthy for you I mean that's already been done that's just a stake but you know that that's what they're doing and and so they're making things taste good even if they're not good for for you and and it it's addictive as well so if you're just eating actual real food that's really good for you and it tastes good keep eating it right if you're just eating fatty meat and it tastes good keep eating it you'll get to a point where it just stops tasting good you don't have to be full you don't have to be stuff you should not feel gross you should not feel nauseous you should not feel physically overwhelmed there should never be a negative interaction between you and food you don't want to have a negative relationship with food you want to be have a very positive relationship with food food is good for you and so you want that you want that good healthy positive relationship as well so sorry random package I don't know what the hell that is anyway um so that's what you want to do you just want to eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you want to stop then so don't so there's a couple things in there that I would that I I don't know exactly what you mean by that and and so I would just say that but you know if you have if you have been doing sort of everything right in the sense that you're just eating fatty meat and and only drinking water not having anything else no artificial sweeteners or any anything anything anything and you are just eating until things stop tasting good and you're getting this those are some other reasons you can you can depress your metabolism and uh and gain weight that way but that levels off once you what I tell people when tell my patients that are trying to lose weight like I don't want you to depress your metabolism I don't want you to be on a diet where you're restricting I want you to encourage your metabolism I want to be beef your metabolism up and so you know you eat as much as your body asks you for and your metabolism goes up and say hey we don't we don't need all this excess fat we don't need to store and maintain we're not in a famine we're in a time of excess so we don't need to store all this stuff so you know we'll we'll let some of it go now we'll let most of it go and that and that's what you want to do you want to stimulate your metabolism to go up not down and that can take some time you know I mean look at Kelly Hogan she gained weight for six months but her health was so much better she said okay I'm just going to stick with it and then you know something happened it was like seemingly overnight and then she just start dropping her weight so there's hormonal reasons for that as well generally leptin if you test your leptin and that's elevated it's called leptin resistance that can be very difficult to lose weight but on a carnivore diet or any ketogenic diet you just have to get rid of carbs really because blocks leptin and can and can precipitate leptin resistance that you know once you you start eating that way your leptin starts going down when you get that down into a more normal level that's when you start losing a lot more weight as well so it's multifactoral but um yeah that's that that's where I would start anyway okay so can't bring up the super chat but it's just been sort of um a super chat from uh Jenny Jenna Westra g n a Westra um thank you very much for the Super Chat they say I've been carnivore for almost three years and I have a geographic tongue is there any hope of getting rid of it um there is nothing on Dr Google that helps it just says they don't know what causes it I've never actually heard of that so um I don't know I'm going to just look up what that is and see when what that is okay so it's a it's an so it's an inflammatory condition on the surface of the tongue um that causes smooth red irregularities and things like that okay so uh well any inflammatory process can be improved by lowering your inflammation and improving your immune system so presumably you know if that if that indeed is uh the underlying cause is your body reacting and your immune system reacting in an inappropriate fashion that's now affecting your tongue that could very well improve um it's been three years if it hasn't helped in three years I'd be a bit more skeptical of that um especially if you've been sort of pure pure meat and water um but I don't know I don't know if you've had any sort of improvements if you have then that's great you know uh but after 3 years if it stayed the same I wouldn't I wouldn't really expect it to get much better just from from what you're eating but you never know it could be that there's something else underlying that you know is affecting your health and you can continue to improve that and eventually that will clear up but generally if this is just sort of an inflammatory underlying thing you're reacting to something that you're eating you get rid of that thing in a few weeks few months uh your body can can heal from that or at least start to heal and so if you haven't really started to see any Improvement in three years and you're just doing just meat and water and and if you're not just doing meat and water and not just doing just red meat and water give that a try you know because it could be that you're reacting to something much more subtle and it's it's enough to to continue on with this this issue so I would try that but if you have been doing just pure meat and water certainly pure red meat and water getting enough fat and you haven't even seen any Improvement after 3 years then I would I would be doubtful that this is going to be addressed with just just the diet itself and there'll be something else causing it unfortunately and which which is the case I mean you know there are other there are other things in the world that makes us sick it's just a major one is eating poison and not getting enough uh proper nutrition hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own questions please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest of the Q&A okay so this one's from Sunday creative thank you very much for the Super Chat my mom is 76 years old 167 uh centimeters 52 kg high risk of Alzheimer's recently started keto great HDL LDL from 2.6 2.6 to 3.1 3.1 is that good her B12 is eight times higher Jesus at 4,427 CRP is 0.9 as is 36 alt is 40 those are liver markers uh how to reduce B12 so look it sounds like she might it's supplementing I mean I don't think you can possibly get that high of a B12 naturally unless you're just only eating liver um and even then would be pretty would be pretty surprising the the amount that you want you want to get between about 800 and 1,00 for Australian numbers and this is seems to be from Australia um and so I would uh well B12 is is water soluble and so you know just drinking water will will help flush this out and then if she's eating a lot of liver you can reduce that certainly uh just go just just to you red meat and water or whatever meat and water and just skip the organs for a little bit um I I would I don't think that that's the only thing you you just don't get numbers that High um um unless you're taking a supplement or or way too much of a supplement and maybe getting injections large injections on a weekly basis sort of thing and um because um you know when you're when your B12 most the B12 range in in Australia is is 139 or you 140 or so to to 650 or so right depends on the lab depends on the area because it's just an average for that for that area and that lab um and that's low you know that's because most people in Australia are low and so I I commonly see people with their B12 under 400 and under 400 Studies have shown you can actually get nerve damage get demin of your axons and so they don't fire as as readily and they don't have as as fast of conductivity so that's an actual deficiency so this is 10 times what you often see people in Australia with a sort of a normal standard uh diet would would B so uh you're not getting that um just from keto I mean espcially recent keto so I I would I would I would be shocked if that were a true and accurate number so first of all oh test is only as good as a retest and that could be just wildly inaccurate um so just get it tested again it could be a very different number if again that number is that high she's there's some sort of supplement in her and something she's taking that has a ton of B12 in it and you just need to cut those out and um and just go back to eating normal regular food um Zeta CF um 5.0 I think six months beef butter bacon and eggs chronic parasite um blasto citis Honus okay um despite antibiotics in the past floating low energy iodine and oregano oil help but irritating so a chronic parasite infection you know being you know being on a carnivore diet and and and beefing up your immune system and eating as clean as possible and clean Meats as possible and and you know I I'm I'm a big fan of the of the BBB and but it's not as clean as you can go the best thing you can do is just grass-fed and finished beef and lamb and that's the absolute best thing you can do besides like venison but might have some parasites in venison uh so you have to cook that well done uh which isn't always what you want to do but you know for for Taste uh reasons but you know there's going to be just a bit of sugar a bit of you know preservatives and things like that generally in in bacon which is typically fine for most people you able to handled that pretty well but if you're trying to really optimize things perfectly that's where you go you go to just just beef or lamb and maybe just grass F fed and finished beef and lamb um that's going to improve your immune system dramatically and so you you'll be better able to fight off different infections like parasites Etc but if you continue to have a chronic parasite infection I think that's when you you go and you get medicine you know so um not antibio iotics but anti parasitics and I'm sure that that's you know likely what you meant and um but they you know they are different just so people know and um but you know getting with a you know parasitologist or infectious disease specialist to help help you clear that um because you know a lot a lot of people and animal in the Wilds do have have some parasites but they can be horribly harmful sometimes they can be uh you know it's just something your body's used to doing I mean there's there are people that actually give them M themselves parasites because they have such severe allergies and and it's thought that well it is the same part of the immune system that that gives you allergies that is actually supposed to attack parasites which thought and this this Uber clean way of of living that we have now just completely sterile environment we don't let kids play in dirt or anything like that anymore and just everything's clean clean clean clean clean clean and disinfected and bleached and all that sort of stuff that your your immune system is is there for a reason and it sort of just goes a bit haywire and starts attacking you uh with allergies that that's a theory anyway and there are people that that then go to you know developing countries and they expose themselves to things that will give them parasites and and they have crippling allergies and then they're gone so you never know but uh parasites can be horrible at the same time they can absolutely kill you and and do horrible things to you and so uh if you are struggling with that then think and and you're you know eating a great diet and your immune system is very strong as a result of that then I think you need to go and and get get medical attention and uh and sort that out um with with more antiparasitics and get a specialist a parasitologist to help you with that and good luck with that um and be ay thank you very much for the Super Chat what is causing my reflux I only eat BBB and e um well could be uh a number of things quite often people's reflux improves on Carnivore diet or even just ketogenic diet and if you are continuing to have reflux it could be something else going on you could have gastritis you could have an ulcer you could have a hiatal hernia a structural sort of defect that can sort of um press in and um and cause sort of discomfort and reflux type symptoms and so it's it's important to get um it's important to get that checked out and make sure you don't have any of those those issues so if you have if you have just ongoing months and months years and years of reflux and it's not really getting better you know you need to talk to your doctor and potentially get get investigated for that like a scope down the throat and see if there's any sort of physical organic uh reasons for that as opposed to just you have a bit of heartburn you know so there could be there could be something else going on that you would need to get investigated as well so I would I would talk to your doctor and see about getting that investigated and then Josh Smith uh asked a question thanks for the Super Chat Josh said do you own any Bitcoin I'm I haven't really gone down that path I mean I think I own a bit um just because a friend of mine sort of did that sort of stuff and uh and so I you know put a bit of money in that but I'm almost nothing you know and so it's not something I know enough about but it is interesting how you know you you have people that that find certain things you know they go to bitcoin because they don't like the sort of the the centralized you know currencies and the control that that different governments are trying to place upon them and so they want sort of a decentralized you know currency and you know like gold you know it's just you know just like that has a value that has an intrinsic value that we've placed on it and so whatever happens you know inflation goes crazy or they try to you know whatever you have that you have that commodity that you can you can trade right and um and that has value same thing with with Bitcoin it's something that you can sort of decentralize and people can't they can't sort of lock down on you and so you when you sort of see that and you s have those problems you start looking at other things like okay well we've been lied to we're trying to be controlled and corrupted and you know in these ways what else is going on you sort of get the wool taken off your eyes and you start looking for other other you know ways that you've been you know hassled about um same thing with carnivore you start looking at how we've just been lied to you for decades about about what to eat and we've been hurt by that a lot I extremely hurt extensively hurt and continued to be hurt and profited on our misery and illness and in fact selling it's a thing that makes us sick and miserable and then profiting off that sickness and misery uh that's that's truly sick uh that people do this but they do and and they do it by the millions and so uh now it's affecting billions of people around the world it's absolutely disgusting and you know they're sending Coca-Cola trucks into MSI Villages every day and they sell out right away because they have no idea how bad these things are and their teeth are getting messed up their development is getting messed up they have chronic diseases they're getting diabetes and you know Dr Mark Heyman went over there and saw this seem sort of horrified and he and he spoke to one of the you know the chief of that area he said hey you know that's it's not really good you know like that's that stuff can make you sick can actually give you diabetes and he was shocked he was like oh my God I didn't know that we we actually have really bad diabetes problem when of the Messiah ever had a diabetes problem when they were just eating meat milk and blood they did not it did not exist you know the big big study it took years to do in the late 20s um early 30s that showed that and especially the Messi men who who were eating nearly exclusively animal based they started adding in some Millet seed back then but that was new to the diet and it wasn't that much at that point and then uh they were extraordinarily healthy especially the men then the women were secondarily and they didn't eat as much meat and blood they had more of the dairy and maybe a bit more of the Millet or whatever uh and then third on that were the female akuu who were more plant-based but they had a diverse uh range of plants that they ate and the worst the sickest were the akuu men who ate mostly Gra and seeds and things like that and they were horribly unhealthy and then you go several decades later and the Messiah start getting more health issues and chronic health issues and diabetes and and heart disease and things like that because they're eating more plant-based crap and not even a bunch of you know processed foods but just plants you know they're not good for you like that's the whole point now they're even worse and now instead of having you beautiful white shiny teeth perfectly straight big wide Jaws wisdom teeth all come in now they're getting crooked teeth bad dentitions rotting mouths and diabetes and heart disease and all these sorts of things and they're and because you know they're not not only they're eating more plants but they're also drinking Coca-Cola which is not their traditional diet and people say oh well I hate talking I hate you know people say the Messiah you know they just eat meat oh they're eating all this other stuff now they are but that's not that what their traditional diet was and that's what we're talking talk about and when they were eating their traditional diet that's when they were as healthy as as we're talking about that's what that's the example that we're trying to replicate and so you know it's people say oh well they they eat all this other stuff too yeah that's the problem that's why they're getting sick so um then you see that you say okay well this is  what else have they been lying to us about and then you start going to other avenues and and you actually had a lot of people sort of just spotted spotted the lies in many different different fields and then said okay what else is going on then we sort of see other other people uh with that so there are a lot of people in Bitcoin that sort of find the carnivore sort of way of eating and and it really helps and there's people in carnivore that go to bitcoin but I haven't I haven't done that yet myself um but you know the concept is is one that I'm favorable to it's just I don't know if it's a a good investment it's quite unstable goes up and down it used to be when Bitcoin was being used for you know drugs and assassinations it was it was actually the most stable currency in the world and I almost invested then actually tried to but it was just on the dark web and you couldn't really get it but it was it was $6 a coin back then and it was very very stable and I was going to put in like $2,000 and and buy sort of like two grand worth of bitcoin which had been you know a few hundred coins at the time and I I just couldn't figure out how to do it on the dark web because I didn't want to like go on the dark web and just everything hacked and so I didn't end up doing it and um you know Mor is the pity because would have been that would have been a good payday but um no I haven't really gone down that that route yet okay so there a Super Chat from russley Richards thank you very much for that isn't a a question involved U maybe down the chain there's a super chat from Terry thank you so much Terry uh she says no question just gratitude well thank you very much Terry I really appreciate that it's very kind of you um Joanne Selenas had a question Bren tried carnivore did it for two months lost weight felt good then blood work showed uh Alp down as alt a and ALT up um all three out of range Dr advised against continuing should he worry look the your liver function test can go uh can go off for a lot of different reasons and um you know a alt you know a can be associated with things like fatty liver but you know you generally reverse that so um you know test is only as good as a retest you know you want to sort of retest these things and so I would just not worry too much about it in fact I I generally see people's liver function tests improve if they're actually doing a carnivore diet and they're not having a bunch of sweeteners and weird ass things added in there not drinking alcohol um and and things like that or having sweeteners and sugar and all that sort of stuff which can also derange your liver function test um things should get better and you know they will get better so you but sometimes you just get a weird aberant tests and could be a lot of different reasons for that I mean I've I've gotten blood tests where like my liver function test is perfect perfect perfect and then just like alt is just up a bit it's like oh that's weird I'll test that again back being perfect so you know the thing is is that was that just my liver just had a funny day or was that something wrong with the lab or what you don't know so you need to get you need to get further you need to get further um data points and so you know the doctor is just going to be paranoid they they don't know about a low carb diet they don't know about carnivore diets and so they're just going to be paranoid and go like oh that can't be healthy oh my God look at this you're liver oh you got to stop they were going to find something anything that's just going to be a little bit out of the range for them they they're going to freak out about so they're losing weight they're feeling good they're objectively improving you know what are the other Bloods doing are those Bloods getting better uh that's what you want to look at and then you know those things are sort of fluctuating you don't know why they're fluctuating you know it's just they're they're fluctuating you have to put that into a clinical context are they unwell are they having problems no okay so what does that correlate to it's hard to say um what is that being caused by very even more hard to say because you don't know what it correlates to you definitely know don't know what causes it so I would not freak out I would just you know eat as clean as possible just fatty whole meat as possible don't have anything else and check it again in a month see what happens check it again a month after that liver function tests are cheap really easy to do so you know you just go just get that checked and see what's happening I would I would be willing to bet that those liver function tests will start coming down and if they don't come down things going up there's something else going on they have some underlying illness or they're taking you know a bunch of Tylenol and paracetamol and things that um or or taking more than they should and and it's affecting and damaging their liver or they're having artificial sweeteners or sugar or alcohol or something but meat is not going to cause that you ask your doctor what can you name a single substance in meat that will damage the liver can't say cholesterol can't say fat that doesn't cause fatty liver disease sugar alcohol cause fatty liver disease that's been that's been shown in actual Interventional trials experimental trials um out of University of California San Francisco from Robert lustig so um I would I wouldn't worry too much I just go and get it checked out get some more data points so here's a question from Rusty Richards from previously thank you very much Russy Richards for the for the super chat um 50-year-old male long history of hyperglycemia so it's high triglycerides very poor clearance of triglycerides and REM levels hit 500 to 900 after a fatty meal yeah okay that well but that's going to happen that's always going to happen after a fatty meal you know that's how that's how fat gets taken in tes taken in by um kyom microns it goes into your lymphatics and goes through so that's why you never do a cholesterol test you never check your triglycerides after a meal you check it 12 hours after a meal and then you'll get more accurate uh depiction um so yeah so the question is you any reason to modify carnivore diet no I don't think so at all you never take car uh you never ever ever ever take uh cholesterol uh if you're not fasting there's no point you know because that's just gonna because that's how your body absorbs fat from your bowel it goes through the lymphatics you know everything goes through your portal Venus system up to your liver except for fat and the fat soluble nutrients that's how important fat is is that is that your body is just like yeah just get it just Mainline it in we don't even need it to go through the liver we don't even need to to have it you know checked and and shopped up it's just like fat yes bring it in let's go and so you know that that comes in the form of C microns which will show you have very high uh triglycerides and LDL and all all these other sorts of things it so it's not accurate you're not you're not comparing Apples to Apples right because we don't do unfasted uh lipid panels and compare that to other people with unfasted lipid panels we say no you have to have a fasting lipid panel for exactly that reason and so that's what you need to do so as long as you're getting rid of carbohydrates sugar seed oils alcohol and you're just eating fatty meat and nothing El your triglycerides your fasting triglycerides will start to come down and uh stress is a big one too stress High cortisol bad sleep High cortisol these can derange your your um your lipid panels as well and I've seen a few people in very high situations even on a carnivore diet with uh High you know low HDL and high triglycerides and when they were able to sort of address their sleep and address their stress and that that all sorted itself out so um you know it is a bit more complicated than just what you're eating but that's a major part of it and you you can't you can't test it if you're not fasted you just have to get a retest so never test directly after a meal there's no point in that hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys convert Neil thank you very much for the Super Chat uh you're the best thanks for all you do well thank you that's really nice of you to say two years carnivore uh now that I feel and look great can you recommend your favorite form fitting t-shirt brand sorry not the normal question uh you get um well yeah I mean it it just spends like different t-shirts I mean I I like the you know the the Seattle SE Seattle Sison you know rugby shirts those are I think those are some of the best fitting shirts that I've ever had those are great but um you know they're just called fitted t-shirts you know so um so there's that um you know the for for workout gears as as lame as it is like I I really like Lululemon stuff it's so weird but um you know my brother started getting them you know my best friend Jonathan started getting them and I was just like DN those are those are pretty good material I know I'm sure that they have like these different sorts of weird you know plastic chemicals and things like that that soak in your skin that you don't actually want um I haven't looked too deeply into that I'm sure people in the comments here will will tell me how wrong I am to wear these things um you should just stick with cotton probably uh but as far as workout ones I mean they they fit very well they're very high quality and they they last a long time they're expensive though but the but if you treat them well then you you don't buy them again um but apart from that just the fitted t-shirts of any description made out of cotton probably a better idea uh so it doesn't get all the gunk soaking and this I'm sure probably has stuff that's Legion to my body at the moment uh that I don't want but uh I don't think this is Lulu Lemon but I anyway it's just an athletic top but yeah those those are the ones that I've had and then just yeah fitted tees and you just get get the sides that that fits you right Thomas SE thank you very much for the Super Chat my wife and I have been strict carnivore for five months now she is losing lots of hair in the last month she started collagen peptides is there anything else that would help her with hair loss well she first of all needs to eat as much as her body's asking for get enough protein get enough fat quite often people have hair skin or nail issues they're not eating enough and they're in particular not eating enough fat so make sure she's getting enough fat make sure you cut out everything else any sort of artificial sweeteners Stevia all these sorts of things apart from that you can actually trigger a Fallout phase that doesn't mean that the hair follicle is dying that doesn't mean that it's not ever going to come back it just means it's now has a Fallout phase and now it's going to go to a regrowth phase and also check folate uh that's another one some people especially women like some 44% of women are positive for MTHFR G mutation there's a constellation of them it's not just one and that can make it so you don't methylate folate properly you don't you need more of it in your diet you need more folate in your diet and just eating muscle meat is uh not always adequate for those people and so you just need to check your folate uh check your arthrite folate that's more accurate so it's in in the red blood cell or RBC um folate or arthrite folate if they test for that not all Labs do it's a very specialized test and so but check the FID anyway if that's slow start eating liver maybe just start eating liver anyway uh you know a couple times a week and uh and then checking make sure your B12 full later up you know if you're with one of these people that just need a bit bit more help that can be that can be part of it um but a lot of people will actually trigger a Fallout phase they they'll lose weight they change your metabolism this triggers a Fallout phase this is especially concerning for women because you have longer hair and so it's much more noticeable and it takes a lot longer for that to grow back in so it can grow back in generally does grow back in as long as you don't have any sort of new nutrient uh issues so you're getting enough meat you're getting enough protein you're getting enough fat and you're not eating anything else and you're fate and b12 are all in good ranges then I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about it it will grow back in and that's what happens for the vast majority of people and and I I speak to a lot of women that come go through that and they're like what the hell's going on this is this is this is concerning and then you know it takes months you know because it takes a long time for hair to grow back into any decent decent length and so all of a sudden it starts coming back in it comes back in thicker and they're like oh actually you know it's fine now um so but it can take longer especially for women to to see what the hell's going on and if it if it's coming back um at all let alone thicker but that's generally what what people find is is their hair comes back better as long as you're eating enough and you're you're getting all your nutrients and if you need to add in a bit of liver to do that then definitely do that but that's that's what I would do check folate check B12 add in some liver and make sure you're getting enough getting enough fat and meat and um and just be patient it it uh should come back and should come back better Tyler vinor okay I don't know how to pronounce that thank you very much for the Super Chat uh what down what's the downside of white rice what is the cleanest carb I I mean it depends on what you mean by cleanest carb they all they all are sugar they all break down into sugar sugar that'll break down into glucose in the body and so that's going to raise your blood sugar so is that is that what you want if you raise your blood sugar you're going to raise your insulin that's going to suppress your body's ability to make glucose glycogen ketones so you're going to be out of ketosis you are going to be in an alternate pathological uh biochemical State I think that's taught as our primary metabolic State I think that's dead wrong um because if it were we'd be one of the few animals on Earth that that was was our primary metabolic state so I don't really buy that um but uh you know if you're eating straight glucose you're going to spike your blood sugar quickly and you're going to spike your insulin quickly if you eat white rice you're going to spike it in a more graduated fashion and so it's just going to be more of a time relase capsule where it sort of drips in drips in so it depends on your goals it depends on what you're wanting to do it all breaks down into glucose all breaks down into sugar as far as grains are concerned concerns they have toxins in them they have defense chemicals in them they have lectins in them because that the seed is a plant's baby the seed grain Bean legume nuts all of these are are seeds and and you know everything protects its babies more than anything and the seed is a plant's baby so that's where you're going to find the highest concentration of toxins so I would actually think white rice is better than brown rice except for you know some of the fiber May delay and prevent some of the absorption but there's a lot of you know of the of the germ and things like that uh that can cause harm and uh more lectins and things like that can be found in there as well so it's actually you know again it just depends depends on what you're going for if you if you just have to eat carbs um I mean the cleanest carb out there is just straight glucose right but it's it's going to hit and Spike your blood sugar right away other ones come with toxins and and um but they're more time released fashion you know like like the white rice so it's a hard question to answer uh because there are a lot of downsides of all of these things and any carbohydrate is not it's inherently not clean because they're going to spike your blood sugar they going to spike your insulin they're going to derange your metabolism and they're going to get you out of the metabolic State you want to be in I think that's a very important metabolic state to be in and it's going to keep you out of that now whether you you eat a lot of protein or whatever and that transiently brings you out of keep kis fine but you certainly don't want to be taking in a lot of exogenous carbohydrates that that keep you out of it and so every carbohydrate so I think the answer is no there is no clean carb all carbs are carbs all carbs break down into glucose all carbs will spike your insulin all carbs will derange your hormones and your biochemistry and your metabolism and be harmful so other ones have come with more toxins and that makes it worse obviously but I don't think you're safe with any any of the carbs really so Malai P or Somali pirate thanks for the super chat um how do you feel about cold showers is it worth it good question I haven't I haven't looked the data myself i' I've spoken to a lot of people that that swear by it they really like it obviously that's something that um you know Dr Andrew huberman is a big fan of the sort of cold exposure regularly um for like two minutes pretty cold temperature if it's a shower or like 30 seconds if it's like a like an ice bath dunk um and that that you know helps with dopamine and um and helps you know reset your circadian rhythm so they think that's worth it I haven't looked into it too close um so like in the morning sometimes I'll just you know take a shower and then just turn it on cold and just you know wait it out so there you know I I think there's probably probably some a lot of benefit to it there's a lot of people that do seem to be benefited by it there's more and more uh you know research and papers coming out suggesting that it's helpful and stimulat these cold shock proteins from the liver that are that are helpful going back and forth between saunas and cold plunges and things like that from depending you know on different reports can raise your growth hormone significantly raise your testosterone for men significantly and so might worth a shot but I I think it would um be worth looking at Andrew huberman's uh talks on the subject I mean goes into great depth of detail and and see what you think you know and see if that the the studies that he talks about if they're big enough and you know properly powered and and formulated to to give you an answer and uh and then go with that I wouldn't be able to tell you definitively one way or the other but um from what I've seen I would I would I get the impression that yes it is worth it and it's something that that can help and uh improve your cating Rhythm and hormonal function as well and dopamine Grayson Nicholson thank you very much for the Super Chat hey Doc mom's been in the ER with kitis I'm very sorry to hear that uh she's been sick for two weeks up until uh last something LK this point up until L I'm going to guess have no idea how to help her um can you share share info on on that well look colitis call a lot of different things so ulcerative colitis is something specific that's that's an autoimmune issue you can get colitis and an infection um it's just colitis colon itis inflammation so inflammation of the colon and so there can be multiple means from that if it's an infection you know it's a different ideology than than ulcerative colitis if she has ulcerative colitis then 100% putting her on a on a red meat and water diet only should help that if she has infection or other sorts of issues either way getting her off all fiber is going to help rest her bowel it's going to help rest and recover from that and that's you know people get diverticulitis and other sorts of uh inflammatory infections or issues with the bowel you put them on a low residue diet no fiber or anything like that that's a carnivore diet is and that just rests the bow so you don't have to be pushing things through if it caus a whole bunch of constipation and big blocky horrible stools that would cause more harm wouldn't it so it's not doing that and we know that we just are stupid and we forget the things that we know in different contexts and situations and so we know that that doesn't cause constipation we know that that just rests the bowel and everything's fine um and then we think other times oh my God no you have to have fiber or else you'll get constipated you'll have all these problems intestinal problems like but when you are having intestinal problems you tell people specifically not to use Fiber so what the hell is that about right um so I would still do the same thing um it may not address the underlying cause but it can certainly help rest her bowel and and improve her immune system and reduce inflammation and hopefully give her a better chance to recover and recover and let her bowel heal you know she's well she's in the ER I don't know if they've admitted her but you know if if they have then you don't really have as much control over over what she eats unfortunately but um you know if she's at home I would I would try to encourage her to get on to just fatty meat and water and that's going to keep her stool soft and her bowel rested and it's going to allow her to heal and if it's ulcerative colitis that she's dealing with the autoimmune condition then it's doubly important that she go on this because that will reduce inflammation will reduce the things that her body's reacting to that are causing the ulcerative colitis so that should that should sort itself out in a few weeks and hopefully improve right away if she stops eating those things and so good luck with that hope your Mom feels better Miss e thank you very much for the Super Chat having a lupus flare um prazone and line diet only type two diabetes um in remission for two months hey that's great glucose was 178 after 3 days on meds is this dangerous well look it's um um it's you know that that's that's what happens with the prazone that's a steroid and that's that's cortisol basically mimics cortisol hits the same same um receptors as cortisol right and so when you um are taking that that's going to have the same effect as cortisol cortisol will raise your blood sugar and so that's that's what's happening here and um and so you can go on sort of blood pressure or blood sugar medication sometimes or even put on like an insulin sliding scale if they're in the hospital um is that dangerous prolonged hypoglycemia like that is absolutely dangerous yeah and so that's not something that you want but presumably you're going to not be on prazone long term and that's going to come down and come off and your body will will normalize um and so you know do tell your doctor that you know because that that is quite high and they might want to put you on medication to help lower that while you're you're taking this but that that is a known complication of putting people on steroids which is why you know you don't want to put people on steroids if you have unless you have to um and uh that's that's a trouble for neurosurgery you have someone with a you know brain tumor and they have all this swelling in their brain and you have to put them on steroids or else they'll die it's just going to crush their brain and so you do that but then it spikes their blood sugar and that feeds the cancer and it's just sort of like you're chasing your tail at that point without even realizing it um so you want to get sort of underneath this get down the base which you are with with which is line diet and I think that's going to address this and so I think that you will hope well I I think that if you continue on with just a very strict lion diet high fat red meat only diet nothing else no supplements no sweetened beverages nothing that your flareup will calm down fairly quickly especially with the prazone you know uh I don't know how long they want you on that but if you're not flaring if you're actually feeling better then you know talk to your doctor about weaning off and coming off because your your blood sugar is going crazy um but uh that's what's going to keep you in remission longer and keep these flareups from happening is just being very strict Lon diet so I would just address that underlying is just line diet so do that and talk to your doctor about your blood sugar do they want to continue the steroids you come off the steroids your blood sugar is going to come down you know you have to wean off these things though um especially if you've been taking a you know decent whack of this stuff for you know more than a week you know you want to you're going to need to to to wean off this stuff but it's a quick wean you know it's uh it doesn't take all that long it can take you know days to weeks depending on how high of a dose you are how depending on on a lot of different factors so you need to you need to talk to your doctor about that but you know the best thing for this is to come off the steroids so if you're able to if you're in a position to because you're on line D because the prazone has done its job then you can presumably come off of this and that will just normalize your glucose and I would I would try to do that as soon as that's safe and then continue on with the lion diet and hopefully don't have those flareup again excuse me Mona should be beer thank you very much for the Super Chat how long are withdrawal symptoms when starting carnivore I get to day five and feel Tremors get scared to continue then stop uh what when do things get better pretty much right after that so generally in a week or two you'll get a lot of away from a lot of the the withdrawals it depends on what you're withdrawing from withdrawing from alcohol is a very different thing than withdrawing from sugar or withdrawing from carbohydrates or the other sorts of random plant so um you know people that are dependent on alcohol um and they start getting like DTS they start getting the shakes they can start hallucinating that can be very dangerous you need medical help and support um if you're detoxing from something like that or bzo diazines things like that so it's um it's uh important to know you know you know be clear on what you're you're withdrawing from but if it's just food and it's just sugar that that'll get better sort of right after that um and uh usually about two weeks you'll you'll you'll stop having cravings usually after about a week or so the feelings of withdrawal from sugar at least and carp it that will get much reduced caffeine as well generally about a week for the really severe cases so it depends on what you're withdrawing some but from but yeah it's generally about two weeks is that and that's and that's a gradient so it'll sort of go up and then it'll start coming down down down down down usually it's done by week two if we're talking alcohol or benzor the a aenis then you need and you're getting the shakes and things like that you might actually need medical support to come off of that and that's something that is available and and does help but being on a ketogenic carnivore diet has been shown to actually help people get through those uh DTS and need less medication and actually subjectively feel um better coming off of that as well so just something to know about so um Tyler Villa Senor again thank you very much for for the Super Chat please interview Carney Economist staden Amos okay just take a picture of that okay I'll I'll write that down um I think um I think we were talking about you know Bitcoin earlier um so maybe that that's that's what that was um yeah interesting um I always like the sort of Economics of these things um but yeah I'll check them out thank you for that OC pads thank you very much for the Super Chat uh did Labs yesterday after two months lion supposed to lower triglycerides question mark prior three year prior three years ago at 71 to 248 Trias rides now 121 to 301 total uh cholesterol and 34 to 52 HDL now 72 to 205 LDL now so the LDL that was that that's an easy one you just fast you just stop eating your LDL is going to go up plain and simple it's a it's a metabolic State change it's it's nothing anything else to do with anything you know your liver um you know if you're not eating carbohydrates your liver has to make carbohydrates has to make blood sugar and glycogen and so if you don't have that coming in you have to transport fat from your fat stores up to your liver to make those those things through glucogenesis and that's what LDL is it's a transport molecule transports cholesterol around and so it's taking taking fat basically from your fat and taking it to your liver um you know then there's you have people that that have um looked at that like Nick norwitz who's um a medical student at Harvard his PhD at Oxford so it's Dr norwitz and he did something like it was called a Oreo cookie challenge where it just uh just take like I think it was like 12 Oreo cookies a day and what do you know after a week his LDL came right down so are Oreo cookies good for your heart health I I don't think anybody outside of an insane asylum is going to say yes to that um so you know we we've been looking at LDL wrong it is not a cause of heart disease full stop and so why are we looking at it like it is uh you know the sugar companies blamed it and then we're and we're still you know chasing our own tails with it I mean just we should just stop that as far as the triglycerides um that again can be caused by definitely things that we eat but also stress and also sleep and so you need to optimize those things as well uh it also depends on the timing of your test you know like I said earlier you know the gentleman who said he had very high triglyceride straight after after eating you you always will if you're eating a fatty meal and so the time that you're fasting before your your cholesterol test will change the the amount of triglyceride so if you're fasting eight hours or you're fasting 12 hours you'll get a different result and so I mean you could try this yourself you know stop eating at 9 o'clock the night before check it 9 o'clock in the morning then check it two hours after that 2 hours after that four hours after that and don't eat the whole time or eat and then test it every four hours after you eat you'll see it it dramatically changes your triglycerides and the other other um lipid markers so even fasting well I fasted eight hours or this guy fasted 12 hours there's going to be a discrepancy there so you need to do things consistently and again a test is only as good as a retest you want consistent data points you're saying you tested your your cholesterol three years ago we don't really know what happened in in the intervening time so you've been two months lion diet and it's supposed to go lower triglycerides yeah unless you're stressed unless you're not sleeping well what were your triglycerides right before you started the lion diet that's the question because you tested it three years ago but is that did that stay exactly the same that whole time even if you're eating the same way it doesn't necessarily mean those numbers will stay the same and so you need you need to get an accurate marker so I would use this as a baseline actually as long as you were fasting if this is a fasting panel then I would do that if it wasn't a fasting panel if you didn't have at least 12 hours between meal and blood test you get first thing in the morning fasting from 9:00 p.m. last night get it between 8 and 9:00 a.m. in the morning at least two glasses of water no more than four glasses of water no sex or um exercise the morning over the day before uh because that will derange things that will change your your your blood plant panel so uh and your cholesterol panel certainly and definitely your hormones so you need to do these things consistently L and you'll get more consistent reliable results so I would check it again I would get it at least 12 hours post prandial so after a meal fasting at least 12 hours and you know no exercise or sex at least you know and get enough water everything like that and uh and check what it is and then check it again in a few months and see what it is I would promise you that that's going to come down as long as you got your stress and your sleep under your control and and you're doing everything else from right from a diet perspective um but again you don't know what your your levels were right before you started and it's important to know that and so I would take this as your Baseline and then go from here sorry just one second okay so L CHF thank you very much for the Super Chat uh question not losing more weight after 6 months carnivore started adding salad lettuce to lower the calories which salad is less harmful thanks well the thing is look hold on a second you're adding in something to lower something else like you if you think you're eating too much just don't eat so much right but your body knows better and you bring in salad you're bringing in you know random leaves and they're going to have random chemicals in them that aren't necessarily going to be good for you um you know are you are you saying you want to eat less then eat less don't eat more to eat less right so you know you don't have to add in lettuce you know if you want to sort of cut back on things drink more water if you really just want to fill up your stomach with mass and matter you know you can just do that so you just drink a lot more water a lot of people don't drink enough water and in fact they mistake hunger um as uh or thirst as hunger and so they end up you know eating when they actually should be drinking um but you know the thing is too is that you know you're not losing more weight but are you losing more fat and are you eating enough to stimulate fat loss because you know like I said earlier your body is very physically responsible if you have less energy coming in you're going to have less energy going out you're and simple and so if you're cutting calories you're cutting nutrition your body's going to cut your metabolism that's just what's going to happen and so you'll end up losing less weight we know this from um many different sources biochemistry being one but uh but human trials and um was it the Minnesota starvation studies anyway anel Keys our good friend the evil you know the the whatever the the evil doctor what are they called those Evil Genius sort of people they're like up in a lab making Frankenstein and things like that uh Frankenstein's monster Dr Frankenstein but damn it anyway some sort of mad mad scientist that's what it is the mad scientist anel Keys um you know he he took a bunch of people that were um didn't want to fight in World War II and I said okay well if you don't want to get drafted and sent over there you got to you got to be part of this experiment so they said yes and they basically starve these people to see what would happen to the body when you starve them and they sort of limited uh food intake and and they found it they lost you know weight quite precipitously at first and then it sort of leveled off and so some of these people if it was just calories in calories out they would have ceased to exist because they ate less calories than then uh they would have needed to maintain any amount of weight and so uh if it is just calories in calories out and there's a certain amount of calories correspond to a certain amount of weight and fat um they'd be dead and they weren't dead they they stabilized and were able to last a very long time they actually didn't lose more weight than that very very slow uh loss of weight after that if anything and so that's because their metabolism slowed down because their metabolism is much smarter than the people who think that calories in calories out is uh all there is to know about biochemistry and so that's um you know that's what we see we see people's metabolism shutting down and so if you're not eating enough you're not eating enough fat you're not stimulating your metabolism you're not going to lose weight your body's going to slow down it's going to stop losing weight in fact you can actually put on fat and so the last thing you want to do is start adding in a bunch of salads because ay why would you drink water if you just want to eat less and you want to fill up your stomach um and B you're you're going to slow your metabolism more and also what is weight is weight only fat is that the only is only thing that has weight is fat and so if you lose weight you are losing fat because we wouldn't go vegan they can starve themselves and they can lose weight but some of that weight's going to be muscle and some of it's going to be bone some of it's going to be fat you don't want to lose muscle and bone you only want to lose fat and so and maybe not even that you know has fat to lose so you know when you go on a carnivore diet you lose weight but you also put on muscle and you put on bone and so you don't lose as much weight but you're losing more fat and that's the whole point you know I I I experienced the same thing myself you know I just dropped I dropped the salads I already wasn't eating carbohydrates because they made my back hurt and I just noticed I'm like I don't want to eat that you know my my back hurts for three days after I eat eat anything with carbs in it and so I was just eating spinach kale and broccoli and just lean meat and I stopped eating the veggies the greens started eating a lot more meat stimulated my metabolism and I lost 23 pounds in 10 days right and then I lost nothing I lost nothing after that so you're losing weight for six months I only lost weight for 10 days but you know what I was losing fat and I was putting on muscle because I was working out and so I was replacing the fat I was losing with muscle I was gaining and so I stayed the exact same way and I didn't care so I didn't care about my weight I didn't care what that number said I cared how I felt I cared about my athletic performance I cared about how much energy I had and I cared about um you know my body composition I was losing fat visibly I could see that my clothes fit differently I look different in the mirror and then I was putting on muscle same thing you know I was I was visibly getting more muscular and so that was great that's what I wanted my weight didn't change so don't worry about your weight um you want to worry about your health first and foremost how you're feeling how your energy is how your your athletic performance is if you if you work out and then body composition way down at the distance second and weight never you should not you should not be worrying about weight on the scale you should be worrying about health and body composition very secondarily and and that's how you get it you eat the right things you don't put things in your body that are harmful you know if salad were such a good way of losing weight we wouldn't have the weight problem we have now we started suggesting salads and greens and veggies in the 80s to lose fat and what happened we the obesity rate went up from from 8% to 42% so salads don't do it salads don't do the job steak does it stimulate your body stimulate your magnesium or your your metabolism promote build up your metabolism so your body says you know don't need to hold on to this we can lose this and workout exercise Anor robic exercise that's going to be the best thing to stimulate your body and your health and then don't worry about the the scale you want to get a dexa scan check your body composition then you check it again in three months and see what happens then you can make some more um more accurate you know decisions and and conclusions based on real evidence as as opposed to the weight don't don't waste your time on the scale it's it'll lead you wrong Abel thank you very much for the Super Chat Dr chaffy uh a bothering question do you remove the visible white chunks surrounding the ribeye also what do you well no I don't I I eat all the fat at first it's it's difficult to do that so you have to sort of cut off small pieces of fat put it with a lean piece of meat and eat it together and that tastes good now I that took months for me to get used to eating fat now I I can just eat chunks of fat they taste great you know so you recondition that we're conditioned to not like the taste of fat we're conditioned to feel physically sick and Ill when we eat fat because we're told that's gonna make you sick that's gonna that's GNA be bad oh God oh God and you get this psychosomatic response and so uh you can undo that and now now I can at first I couldn't so I took a small sliver of fat put it with the lean meat ate it together tasted great now I can just eat chunks of fat and it tastes great so goes on uh also what do you think about kosher meats like uh the fat surrounding the loins uh being a different fat so kosher meats from my understanding is something that was prepared in the kosher you know means uh same with Halal so this is something that you the animals had to be treated nicely I'm all for that you know if there's any sort of signs of damage or abuse or illness you know they won't they won't touch them um uh at least in halal I I believe in p as well um similar sort of Origins you know just being thankful and kind to this animal that's giving its life for for your life and your family's life and um you know saying a prayer to to them and and thanking them and their spirit for for their you know dying so that we may live U I don't think it has anything to do with um actual you know actually how the animal was raised I think it's it's more about you know treating it well and not harming it and then and then slaughtering it in a very specific manner um and um so that's good you know um some might think that kosher way because I believe they sort of cut their throats and let them bleed out that's was the traditional way and back in the day that's probably the quickest way to to kill something you know there no nice way to kill something now we have numatic hammers and we have you know like Electro electrocution she just schol and it's done you know it's probably there really isn't any other way that's quicker than that that we have anyway that's as close to instant as it is possible to get at the moment and that has ever been able to get so those are some of the some of the things with kosher and Halal you know you just treat the animal better and and try to give it as clean a death as possible I don't think it actually changes the the quality of the meat apart from you know the animal was treated better or at least you was didn't have any visible signs of harm or or duress at the time of Slaughter I believe so I I don't know if it makes too much of a difference past that but certainly if that's something you want to do I mean there are there are extra steps and measures being taken um you know in in in the you know for the for the benefit of the animal and that's that's not a bad thing so Scott Weldon thank you for the Super Chat zo question but maybe there's um just a you don't have to do another Super chat you can just sort of put it in try and star it and and bring it up so if it's down in the chat we'll try and catch it Danny Becker thank you very much for the Super Chat my blood show I have hyperthyroidism Graves disease are you familiar with anyone having success with carnivore without nuking the thyroid yes absolutely yes um I've had a few patients with Graves disease and that have improved with a cornal for diet so is that to say that everyone will no it's very preliminary um but and it's anecdotal but go on to uh the Facebook groups the long long ones long um standing ones like uh zero carb health and zeroing in on health those are two fantastic ones they've been around for decades at least 20 years I think and and the people doing them have been doing carnivore for 20 years and so they used to call it zero carb now it's sort of called carnivore but used to be called zero carb which is why zero zero carb health and zeroing in on health that's the sort of the idea going to the search function there and look for Graves disease you will see hundreds of people talking about their experience with that and most of them being positive um from what I from what I know I I have seen people improve on that and if you want more reassurance then go then go on those sorts of things and see what other people's experiences have been um other things can affect this but autoimmunity is is one of the things that responds dramatically well to a carnivore diet because you're eliminating out the things your body re is reacting to and so the problem goes away that it is addressing the underlying mechanism you eat something reacts in your body your body attacks it you remove that issue you remove that substance your body stops reacting stop attacking that is the cause of autoimmunity if you're if you're removing this and the problem goes away then you're removing the Cause right so that that is some certainly something that people have found um so yes absolutely it can absolutely help Graves disease and I hope it does for you I'll give it a shot lion diet right so red meat and water only grass-fed and finished is the best but you know just Safeway beef you you'll be fine almost almost no one even with autoimmune issues has to go to grass-fed and finish but some do so just just be mindful of that that's always your Baseline that's the base of your pyramid is just grass-fed and finished beef and lamb little bit sort of on the top of that base is uh grain finished beef and lamb and then everything else on top of that um so I would just do that I would I would I would bet that you'll improve a lot so Elena uh don Francesco thank you very much for the Super Chat what effect does carnivore diet have on estrogen depends on if you're a man or a woman uh if you're a guy it can help normalize your testosterone estrogen balance and with women it'll B it'll help um balance your estrogen and testosterone PR progesterones so it'll balance everything you know in so far as it can in so far as it eliminates out all the endocrine disrupt hormone disruptors phytoestrogens uh that will that will play merry hell with your with your um hormones and uh importantly for women it will improve estrogen dramatically just by getting rid of carbohydrates carbohydrates raise blood sugar blood sugar raises insulin insulin disrupts basically every other process in your body if it gets too high and one of those processes is conversion of testosterone into estrogen so women and men make testosterone first and then that is then converted into estrogen um and Insulin High insulin blocks the conversion of testosterone into estrogen in women but it also stimulates testosterone in the ovaries for women it does not stimulate testosterone for men so you're not going to get higher testosterone from eating a bunch of carbs in men you actually get lower testosterone so I have I have uh men and kids I had a I had a boy that looked like he he might have primary testicular failures his testosterone was way below even their um their boundaries it was like you know 130 and just put him on a carnivore die he wasn't even all that strict he was sort of mostly eating meat and he overd doubled his testosterone and sort of got back up now he's in a sort of a more normal range not necessar for his AG because he's imp so he should have it have it higher but doubled it right and so that was only on a few months of of uh not even like just doing carnivore just eating a lot more meat and eating a lot less carbs and sugar and crap and that doubled his testosterone right so carbs are not going to boost a man's testosterone they'll boost a woman's testosterone though and they'll depress your estrogen so you get too much testosterone and you're not converting that to estrogen so you get too little estrogen and this is actually a major cause of P OS polycystic ovarian syndrome which is the number one driver of female um you know female origin infertility and it also causes heroism which is hairy hair growing body hair and facial hair inappropriately sort of in you know masculine sort of territories and uh and you get weight gain and other sorts of problems so you you get rid of carbs you get rid of the phyto estrogens and phyto hormones and and hormone disruptors and and your estrogen will improve your progesterone will improve your testosterone will improve in whatever Direction it will it will fix that problem because it removes a very very potent cause of hormonal disruption in both men and women and so that'll get better so you you'll have a more balanced uh hormonal system some women find that they get some disruption of their periods for four or five months after going to a carnivore diet that's fine it's just your your hormones rebalancing as long as you're eating enough you're getting enough meat you're getting enough fat your body will will do its thing and your these hormones will sort of get inbalance after four or five months on the outside you know the longest I've ever seen was four four or five months tends to be that you get back to a very normal pattern of of menstration and in fact a lot of people can have very irregular erratic patterns to their menstration now they get it very regular after that and just your hormones that's just your hormones balancing out so that'll be uh yeah so that should improve Scott Welden this is from the previous Super Chat that didn't attach so uh thank you again for that Scott Dr chaffy my total cholesterol is 458 HDL was 58 uh triglycerides were um 87 was 12 I don't that's shockingly low um and LDL 4 00 fasting insulin was 2.5 uh would this concern you first of all your fasting insulin is excellent so that's that's amazing so I'm I'm these sort of look like American numers so I'm going to assume you're in America and if you're insulin is between is 2.5 that's fantastic you know there's Dr Casey means uh who I had on on my podcast she has the company levels they track glucose have a CGM constant glucose mon sort of keep track of these sorts of things see what how to how to improve your metabolism and your health through glucose and Insulin control and she was saying that sort of the best range they found was between two and six for your fasting insulin so that's excellent um and your your total cholesterol is is um you know 458 that's certainly above the arbitrary boundaries that that have been set for cholesterol but what does that actually mean well in a study with 44,000 people this year published out of um Sweden they looked for different biomarkers that could you know best relate to your o you know relate to odds of living over 100 and they found that the two best biomarkers for predicting if you were going to live over 100 was low insulin and high total cholesterol so you got both so that's very good all right so at least according to that study you're in a better group for longevity uh um hdl's 58 that's fantastic above 40 for men and above 50 for women is is the target range and I you know I would actually agree with that target range um triglycerides 87 from 12 I don't know how they were ever 12 even if after a carnivore diet I've never seen them that low and certainly if people are eating carbs and sugar and alcohol and things like that I don't I don't know I think that might have been just an error in in measurement but either way if it's gone from 12 up to 87 or 87 down to 12 either way you're well below the threshold for any sort of concern for triglyceride so I I wouldn't worry about that LDL again if you just fast your LDL is going to go up so eat some cookies eat some Oreo cookies and your LDL will come right down if that's what you're worried about it's not what I'm worried about and again it was a it was a it was a surrogate no sorry it was a scapegoat for the sugar companies you know they they needed they needed something to blame for um for heart disease because it was much more likely to be that their product was causing heart disease they like well we got to we got to shift the blame somewhere else it's complete um and so why are we still looking at it it was a con it was a con then it's a con now like so I I just don't I don't even look at it um you know there are the there are no highlevel studies none showing causitive relationship between LDL and atherosclerosis despite anything that Peter AA says as a re recent interview he did with um Derek from more plates more dates and he says well everyone knows that this is causitive highl causes this and we know that anyone who understands math and statistics um knows that well the problem with that is is that there are no studies at all that show a causitive relationship between LDL cholesterol and and um atherosclerosis just none and that's the only thing that you can use to prove causation in fact there are randomized control trials that can show causation with thousands of people very high-powered well done well done and designed studies that actually showed the opposite they showed a protective uh relationship that higher LDL cerol actually had lower heart disease than strokes and um and that's what the journal American College of Cardiology said is like there should be no arbitrary upper limit on the amount of saturated fat people eat because the more saturated fat you eat the less Strokes you get get and there's no relationship between higher saturated fat and and higher um cardiovascular disease none none so you know I I think that you know Dr here should relook at that and understand that uh if you understand statistics and you understand um you know how the the nature of these studies you cannot cannot show causation unless you have you know from a from uh anything but an experiment al randomized control trial that's the that's the Baseline and all the ones that have been done have shown the opposite okay so anyone who's understands Math and Science and statistics does understand that unless they've been completely misled by um by the propaganda it's it's complete crap it's utter utter crap and um the only highlevel studies show the opposite of what their Theory shows and we know that they were lying in the first place so that fits pretty well right we know they're full of and now we have studies proving it in fact we had studies then proving it they just buried them for decades because they didn't want people to know about it and so um and I and I wonder why because they were trying to hide stuff they were trying to mislead people and then so they buried that in order to hide it in order to mislead people do not trust these people cholesterol was never the problem why are we still looking at this you know I people do ask me about their cholesterol about this and it's generally very similar um Bloods here and of course they're going to be worried about that because we've just been drilled in our ears all the time I hope to get to a point where no one asked me about their cholesterol because it was never a problem in the first place and it's not a problem now so I if I had those numbers and I probably have something pretty close to those numbers except my HDL is a bit higher than that um I've been doing this longer um my insulin's very similar um you know I wouldn't worry about it it not because you know this is this is this is a straw man that they make so oh people say well if you're if you're metabolically healthy and your insulin's low well then this doesn't cause a problem that's what petera say oh well I don't know why they would say no no no no I don't give a about your metabolism I don't give crap about anything else LDL is not a goddamn cause of heart disease full stop okay not ever not in any condition at all it does not cause heart disease that was a scapegoat something else causes it now does sdldl a small dense damaged lipoproteins do they play a role maybe but they don't cause themselves something caused them to exist and that process is causing these other things and maybe that plays a role in that they are not the underlying cause because something cause them we make large buoyant LDL molecules those do not cause atherosclerosis you damage those you disease those if those were to have a problem well something else caused that so that's not the beginning that's not the Genesis right but then again they're not the driving Factor either because increased sdl sdldl is only increases your risk factor for heart disease by 70% 1.7x metabolic syndrome increases by 600% 6X type two diabetes increases it by a th% 10x which is up there with smoking right so you know the the one has the least uh you know relative risk that's the one that's that's the direct cause that causes everything that's the underlying I mean you know um you know that little meme that kid his car se's going I mean I wish I had that kid I just turn it on every time someone says something asinine like that um you know smoking uh carries something El like 11,500 increased risk of developing lung cancer if you smoke like per per pack year history right so it goes up right so that's a that's a that's a very very very strong link right and it and it goes up you know with a dose dependent you know sort of uh criteria right and that's not what you see even with sdldl you don't see a very strong relationship it's a very bad marker for that so why the hell are we looking at it I don't I don't I do not look at cholesterol as a sign of of uh heart disease risk because it's not because cholesterol never had anything to do with it in the first place and apparently it's protective so if anything you want to look at your your cholesterol to see um if you're protected and you have higher LDL which seems to be protective you have lower triglycerides you have higher HDL you have lower insulin all of these seem to be protective so good for you well done uh clay thank you very much for the Super Chat how do we get vitamin C on Carnivore um meat uh also can I eat just beef cheese eggs butter and bacon and be healthy uh any workout advice for big muscles uh well yeah I mean you eat that and be healthy I mean I am and and millions of other people are uh I would limit the cheese though I would just stick mostly to the meat and beef you know is the best definitely pasture raised eggs butter great grass-fed butter bacon make sure you're not getting sugar in the bacon workout advice anerobic exercise so high intensity short interval bursts so weight training to exhaustion to muscle fatigue sprinting to exhaustion resting do it again right doing those anerobic exercises those are hands down by far the best the best uh exercise modalities certainly for building muscle but also just for General Health cardiovascular health hormonal Health longevity those are the best kinds of workouts uh how do you get vitamin C again in meat uh meat does have vitamin C liver has more vitamin C than Apples tell you that right and um but you don't you don't need as much yeah okay so you know you vitamin C we worry about getting scurvy but what is scurvy scurvy is a mdev of of collagen right so you need Vitamin C to to hydrate to catalyze a reaction that hydes Proline and lysine so you need to get hydroline and hydroly that's what you need to form proper strong collagen um you eat meat there's plenty of hydroline hydroly in there so you don't actually need Vitamin C to not get scurvy because you have enough collagen it's only when you don't have enough collagen you're not getting enough protein that you need Vitamin C to then make better collagen you have to make it yourself instead of getting the resources from your food so if you're just eating meat you're eating a lot of meat you don't need it and there are other things that vitamins does in the body you need a very small amount of it very small amount of it and you get that from meat and especially when you're not eating carbohydrates you get plenty right because um carbohydrates block out vitamin C vitamin C looks very similar to like a fructose molecule with a little tail on it so they actually go by the same transport molecule which called the glute four receptor and so that pulls in carbohydrates that also pulls in vitamin C right and so if you have are eating a lot of carbohydrates then that will block out vitamin C so you'll need an abundance an overabundance of vitamin C just to get in what little you need and if you're eating a lot of meat and collagen you need even less of it because you don't need it to make collagen you just need it for its other other properties uh throughout your body so you don't need it look at the Messiah when eating a traditional diet not drinking a bunch of Coca-Cola and crap like that or even when drinking Coca-Cola but they're also drinking milk they have a lot of carbs in it they're not getting scurvy they're not getting the vitamin C deficiency right because they're eating a lot of meat and they're eating a lot of animal proteins and P and and um collagen and things like that and hydroline and hydroly they're just getting inherent part of their diet right so even now that they're drinking Coca-Cola they're not all dying of scurvy right and um you know they're just dying slowly of diabetes unfortunately maybe scurvy would have given them a wakeup call like oh crap when we were drinking this stuff and in a couple months people are dying okay you need to get rid of this crap but if it's you know 20 30 40 years down the track that people are are getting seriously ill from it so they don't realize they don't put connect the two right um you get plenty of vitamin C you don't need nearly as much of it on a carnivore diet especially when you're not eating carbs but even when you're eating carbs if you're eating enough protein you don't get scurvy and you don't get other problems either and the MSI have been very healthy up until eating more Western foods and when they were eating carbs with milk but they were eating a lot of meat they didn't get any problems to do with vitamin C uh Karen Caitlyn thank you very much for the Super Chat I'll keep an eye out um for the question there wasn't one attached big boss thank you very much for the Super Chat what do you think of fruits are there any major downsides to them or will I do just find eating a crispy Granny Smith apple well I mean I mean you know it's all relative right so uh you know having an apple every now and then it's not going to kill you uh it is sugar and it is fiber you actually don't really want fiber I don't want fiber fiber can cause its own problems because cause uh a slowing or or prevents you from absorbing um up to 30% of the food that you're eating so if you're eating a bunch of garbage and a bunch of sugar and a bunch of crap then yeah sure you know reducing the amount that you absorb with fiber is great great idea um but if you're just eating meat then no you don't want to do that because you want to absorb everything that you're eating that's actually one of the ways that that plants detract from your health is they stop stops you from absorbing nutrients that you need that's why you eat that's the point of eating now we're eating for entertainment which is a really bad idea uh you just want to eat for nutrition you want to live your life enjoy your life be a happy healthy person and you want to eat to promote that that's it that's the reason you should eat ever you should not eat for fun or enjoyment or entertainment you should just eat because you need it because you need nutrients and um fruits have other problems as well you know sugar is addictive it can become more addictive you know one apple every now and then can turn into a couple apples and more apples and then some mango and then a pear and then all these other things and then you start getting worse and worse I see a lot of people slip down that carb hole and get addicted again they start putting on weight again they start losing their health and then they start eating other carbs and sugar and then six months later they're back on the couch regained all the weight eating pizza and drinking sodas I see that a lot and so I did a video I don't know if someone can link it in the chat just called fruit and honey are not carnivore and so I just go into to a lot of these things and also you know most fruits will still kill you they do still have defense chemicals most of them are toxic and inedible to human beings uh the ones we eat the ones that have sugar in them have less toxins but that does not mean they have no toxins you know uh there are 80 different um medications or or more that interact with the tox well that that can't eat grapefruit or take grapefruit juice with because there are these toxins and Fran aerin in grapefruit that your liver has to detoxify because they're toxic hence the name detoxify and those enzymes are the same ones that that metabolize certain medications and so you get derangements of those those uh of the actions and and um build up you can get too much or too little of these medications in your system if you're if you're taking them with uh or if you're eating grapefruit with them so they all have toxins you're not getting away from it just because it's an apple and a lot of people eat apples there are some toxins in there and you know Less in the sweeter fruits definitely or ones that contain fructose and it doesn't mean like the more sweet the less toxic because sugar itself is toxic and also we we've designed these things to be way more sweet than they were in nature so I just go by the Paradigm if it wasn't around if we weren't eating it 50,000 years ago during an AG you don't need it and you probably don't want it so watch that video uh fruit and carnivore fruit and honey or not carnivore and see what you think and make a decision if you want to add in Fruit fine keep it rare keep it more rare than cheese and dairy just have every now and then have a bit of an apple and watch yourself because if that starts creeping up and creeping up and creeping up you know you know the direction going is sugar is a drug drugs are addictive that's how they work hi Cari myth thank you very much for the Super Chat can you drink um 2A or A2 A2 creamline milk without many issues low heat pasteurization I drink like 12 ounce glasses only for dinner um and don't eat cheese really also thank you for all you do oh well you're very welcome thank you for watching and I'm glad that things have helped I Hope they've helped um milk in general I tend to avoid just because of the carbohydrates it has enough lactose it'll spike your insulin and kick you out of your primary metabolic state if you're doing that once a day probably less of an issue but I I still wouldn't do it every day certainly I I would do it very rarely um I have seen it in myself and others spike your fasting insulin and so you can actually have a problem with that depending on how much you drink I mean I I was I went overboard I drank three gallons in three days and uh that was raw milk um so had enough lactose that it you know my my insulin started creeping up right so that's a problem I don't think that's a good thing and so regardless of the you know the the type of CAS and that's what the A2 is there's A1 and A2 regardless of that you're going to have enough uh lactose that it's GNA spike your insulin and I I tend to avoid that I don't like insulin spikes um and so I I don't do them uh the A2 is less inflammatory so A1 milk is is pro-inflammatory and A2 milk is less inflammatory but it it it's still is inflammatory it's just much less inflammatory than A1 milk so it depends so if that's something that you tolerate and you don't have an autoimmune issue and you're not flaring up I mean I don't I don't flare up from that I do fine with A1 or A2 milk but the lactose is the problem and so I would just very rarely have milk I I I wouldn't do that every day I certainly don't do that every day even though I love milk it's bloody delicious but I don't have it I I mean I may have it like once a year and um you know maybe you know every every now and then maybe once or twice a year something like that but you know it becomes addictive you want it more like oh that tastes it tastes like ice cream now I mean it's just crazy how sensitive your sweet receptors get when you're not just inundating it with just constant overload I drink a glass of milk it's like oh my God it tastes like I'm drinking ice cream so of course I got to want more and you have more and you have more and that that can sort of set you down that path as well you're you're having one glass at dinner that's great um you know I wouldn't have this at any other time I wouldn't have this I wouldn't just drink milk on its own have it with a meal with meat and you know maybe that's fine but um I would I wouldn't do it every day that's just me personally I would I would avoid that not because of the of the casan if you don't react to that then then that's fine because of of the the lactose and lactose free milk doesn't work because that's just putting in an enzyme that's just splitting lactose into glucose and galactose so it still has a sugar you want like sugar-free milk they filter out the milk that actually are some um it's like High Life milk or something like that in America and they filter out a lot of the sugar and have more protein in it and actually tastes better um but it has less carbs but you don't you don't want the carbs it has enough carbs it'll it'll screw with your metabolism so that's why I avoid it a number one meat eater kid thank you very much for the Super Chat thanks Dr chaffy 60-year-old man 67y old man 18 months carnivore Savage awesome uh that's great to hear traveling uh 1,000 miles with morbidly obese 50-year-old woman slri stubborn set in her ways how do I start the convo about our way of life very good question it's difficult I mean is very individual because like you said you know someone who stubborn is set in their ways they're going to they're going to push back as soon as you start telling them they're doing something wrong the best thing you can do is is lead by example show how good you're doing how lean you are you know there's going to be something that they're not really happy about if they're not happy about their weight or they're not happy about their diabetes or something like that I me you can talk to them um you know and so you you might be able to find a a way in but you have to do it in in a sort of an unobtrusive way or else they'll they're going to meet up with resistance and the last thing you want is a conflicting uh uncomfortable thousand M Thousand Mile car ride with someone who's pissed at you and be like can you just stop you you don't want to do that you don't want to put them in that position and you don't want to be in in an uncomfortable position either but you know it's not it's not fair to them to make them feel uncomfortable when they're they're trapped you know and so you have to be very very subtle and kind about it most of the time it's best to let them come to you um you know that you're doing better and you're talking about that or whatever um it might be that they have an issue you know that they have diabetes that they're struggling with and they're having to inject or they're doing whatever or they have an autoimmune issue or something um and maybe you just say he's like hey you know would you mind like I've been doing this I've been doing this thing it's really helped me I've just been sort of changing my diet around and just eating meat and it I actually feel really great and I'm I've just been sort of listening to podcast would you mind if I listen to one I was just sort of I wanted to sort of catch this one you know if you don't like it we can turn it off but you know would you mind you do it in a nice s way she'll know she might say yes you never know uh might say no she could do that too and then you're sort of stuck but you can find that and then may maybe she has something on Diabetes maybe put on an episode you know where I talked about diabetes and how you can clear that up or with Professor Steve finny um you know interviewing him talking about how you can have done clinical trials reversing type two diabetes and adults with um with ketogenic diets um or you know my interview with Ben Vickman something like that you know if you think there's something that that might speak to her or you know she wants to lose weight you know putting on um you know my interview with with uh Shawn White where he he lost 250 pounds in a year you he went from being basically the extent of being bedridden he could stand up he couldn't stand up for more than 30 seconds his legs would go numb and he to fall over and um because he he was very very overweight and he just lived on his couch basically for three years and now he's going to the gym he's being active he's going I mean it's just great I mean he's completely reversed his life he's back to work he couldn't work before that he was too depressed sick miserable and overweight he couldn't do his job now he can you know now he's back to work he's he's he's living his life he's enjoying his family and his children he's being there he's being a present father for his children which is you know the most important thing probably that you can do in your life and and this allowed him to do that so you maybe maybe putting something like that on there there's probably going to be something that she just doesn't give a crap and she's just like yeah look I don't care this is what I want to do this is how I want to live fair enough it's her choice you know it is her life and you may disagree with it and you may worry about her um but you know it is it is her decision at the end of the day but you can try those little things and you know if there's something if she's taking injections or whatever like I I just did um actually just had my first uh call on the airplane I was flying um back to Seattle to last night um and it was just like if you know if you're a doctor or or a medical practice or an EMT or a nurse or something like that you know can you please make yourself known to flight attendants and I was just like Oh Yeah you sort of wondering that so I was like all right you know went up talked to him once this guy and he he was having he was hypoglycemic and his blood sugar he had thankfully had a constant glucose monitor and CGM and you notice it you know dropped down to 60 and he took his normal dose of lantis which is a long- acting insulin but because he hadn't really eaten all that much that day had eating a whole bunch of carbs the insulin was too high and dropped it down so you know had some you know some juice and some you know sandwich and things like that you know started coming back up so he was fine but you know I just sort of explained to him like Hey you know if you're if you're eating a different amount you know it's not just this is your dose of insulin the insulin dose depends on how much carbohydrates you have in your system and how much that needs to lower that down and so if you're just eating less carbohydrates you just need less of a dose of insulin so you just sort of you know you meter that and I sort of said you know and you know the extension of that is that if you just stop eating carbohydrates at all you need far less insulin and eventually your body can heal and you don't need to make you don't need to use any insulin as long as you're still producing at least some insulin and that's been shown in you know clinical trials and he said whoa really no one's ever told me that no one's ever told me you could reverse diabetes I I would I would that would be amazing you know can you tell me more can you give me some resource I was like look oh here's you know here's the research here's the guys here's some interviews with them here's some lectures with them and you know this is this is my my podcast you can take a look and here's some of the videos to watch and he's like yeah definitely do that no one has ever told me that you could do this they just said this is you for the rest of your life and um and he had you know kidney issues and all these sorts of problems likely all derived from his diabetes no one has ever told him that and I was just like well I mean that's the thing you know our education as doctors come from the drug companies and they tell us how to use these drugs and we don't really think much past that and they say no you don't have to limit the amount of carbs you just take a corresponding amount of insulin okay well how about you just don't take any carbs then you don't need insulin right and um you know they don't tell you that part of it right they tell you no no no eat more carbs just use more insulin that's fine oh it's fine to do that no no it's not fine I don't want to do that I want this to go away right well it's fine for the drug companies because you use more of their products yeah eat eat all the carbs you want it's fine you just need more insulin well High insulin causes a problem it's not just the high glucose so you know and then telling him that and just sort of pointing that out um they're like wow I really want to know more you know so that that's something that caught their attention so there might be something with your friend that catches her attention said hey you know by the way you know you point that out that might get them interested or you might you sneak in pop in a podcast you might think would speak to them as well one of the problems that they have and they may might go huh interesting and if you just if you're just a parent you don't have to just keep talking about it you don't want to be that guy that just keeps talking about it and and everyone no one wants to talk to you because the only thing you talk about is that you know you don't want to be the you know the alter ego to the vegans that are just like oh yeah I'm vegan and this that don't don't do that um you know but you can just be a healthy example and and just and everyone knows why and people will start coming to and hopefully she does so Eric C thank you very much for the Super Chat hi doc need advice uh triglycerides 132 cholesterol 324 LDL 26 61 HDL 38 carnivore for one month doc wants to start statins 60-year-old male heart bypass aortic valve replacement cancer history any advice keep doing what you're doing that is my advice um it's been one month first of all what were your Bloods the month before you started what were they the day the day before you started right you need to look at that you have no idea what the changes were if you don't track the changes right you need before and after so this is a baseline check it again in three months see how it goes check it again in six months in a year see how it goes you will not develop heart disease and atherosclerosis in a month or six months or a year it takes a lot longer than that so you know whether or not you need statins you certainly don't need to to you know need them now based on one month of just eating differently regardless of what you're eating um and again LDL will go up if you just stop eating so eat Oreo cookies for for a week check your blood your LDL again that will be low your doctor will be happy and you can tell him that he's fired because that's idiotic right um check your blood sugar again or or check your your cholesterol again in a few months after doing a high fat uh red meat and water diet your HD will go up your triglycerides will keep coming down uh your LDL will do whatever the hell it wants to do because that's a a metabolic issue if you if you're eating carbs LDL will be low you stop eating carbs LDL will go up or you just stop eating totally that it'll go up as well so that's that's a metabolic thing that's not a that's not a you're going to die of you know dietary cholesterol doesn't doesn't really affect our serum cholesterol anyway we make the majority of cholesterol it's only when your body is impaired and stopped from making uh enough cholesterol is when you start absorbing more cholesterol in your from your diet and so your body is perfectly regulating this you know like why are we why are we screwing around with the biomechanics of our body and we think we have to we have to micromanage you know all these different things in our body that's stupid you know like what what animal does that in nature they're all just dropping dead and dying just all these diseases because they just didn't you know micromanage their blood markers properly those species wouldn't exist they would go extinct because they suck our species is not extinct so we don't suck and so these things can you don't have to micromanage them so I I would love to get to the day that no one ever asked me about their cholesterol again but I do understand why they do um you know starting some I mean you're oh my God your LDL came on dude who cares stop eating for five days you know your LDL is going to go up tell your doctor to fast for three days see what his LDL cholesterol does is fasting bad for you now is that bad for your heart eating Oreo cookies that's going to lower your LDL is that good for your heart well LDL if it goes up that's Pro  that is not true there's a direct relationship between high LDL and their development of atherosclerosis  there's zero highlevel um uh studies showing that none it's correlation only and there are a lot of correlative studies with hundreds of thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions of people showing that higher LDL cholesterol is actually inversely related to heart disease and all cause mortality so the higher your CL the higher your LDL cholesterol the longer people are living in multi-million person studies right the Framingham study itself which is like probably the only study that your doctor was taught in medical school certainly the only one I was taught in medical school about cholesterol and heart disease that was a correlative study and it it said that we were taught that higher cholesterol uh corresponded with higher rates of heart disease in fact if it was the opposite the co the framing study showed the opposite of that it was misrepresented by the American Heart Association which were in the pocket of the sugar companies this is a fraud this is a con I don't I don't pay attention to that it's not a good marker for heart disease it was never the cause LDL is not the cause of heart disease and so I would just I so I don't look at it as that cause I look at other sorts of things uh as a as a as a marker for that and that is not it that is not the one look at so I look at fasting insulin I look at blood sugar control hba1c those sorts of things those are much stronger indicators much stronger smoking drinking much stronger indicators okay Chris Barry thank you very much for the Super Chat I was feeling bad on Carnivore 20 days in I added two electrolyte packs a day and I'm feeling much better will I have to do this forever no I don't think so most people don't need to I'm glad that you found that and that helped you uh definitely get the ones without sweeteners without um artificial flavorings uh no Stevia no monk fruit sugar nothing like well monk fruit oh it's it's a new sweetener it's it's a sweetener it's it's a random chemical that you're putting in your body and the newer does not mean the better uh it means the less long-term evidence we have for it right and so like that's that's exactly what you don't want you want things that have 50,000 years plus of History to it you want things that have 2 million years of History to it meat right we've been eating meat for millions and millions and millions of years that's what you want to eat so if it didn't exist if we weren't eating it you know during during the last ice age and it didn't even exist during the last ice age you should definitely not be putting it in your body it may be neutral but the likelihood of that is of it being beneficial or neutral is much less than it being harmful so uh that's great so no no generally people don't need uh electrolytes long term just give your your body a chance to sort of normalize it's electrolyte dumping and um and it will and I don't take any electrolytes I don't even salt anymore so you know and I'm doing fine and that was just a natural slow progression my body just salted to taste and when you do that you just get what your body needs and after about five and a half years or so five five and a half years my body just said yeah actually tastes good without salt so actually tastes salted without salt it doesn't taste Bland so yeah no you don't need to do it forever just uh you know just do it while you can you can sort of go to one packet a day see how you feel after you know a few weeks few months and then down to half a pack a day or something like that and then you know try coming off it see how you go uh but now I I wouldn't expect you to need this forever because you know you're eventually your body's going to sort of get back to working how it's designed to work and um we're designed to eat meat so your body's going to work the way it's designed to work when you're just eating what you're designed to eat and we did not evolve with electrolyte packets so you you would have gotten that from your food so no worries there Jerry Graham uh thank yeah so question is um 55y old female uh I have SCS uh for chronic pain Post BC chemotherapy and radiation thoughts on them as a nurse uh surgeon please trying to eat carnivore and heal um so um well as far as pain is concerned your your your expression of pain can reduce significantly right so that's going to be improved dramatically right so you you reduce the amount of inflammation you're bringing in your food you're you're increasing your ketones which are going to suppress inflammation as well and that can significantly reduce the amount of inflammation and pain expressed up your nerves due to that inflammation so that can help a lot for chronic pain I did do a video on chronic pain and fibromyalgia and we did talk about uh you know nerve related pain radiculopathy so you know um you know so e even the thing is with spinal cord stimulators they're they're they're not great for pain I mean I've I have yet to see someone who really had like oh my God this just changed my life it's always just like ah we did it but like I'm a lot of pain like maybe it did something maybe it's better than not but um I mean I don't do those it's generally like pain specialists that sort of you know do those we we often don't uh I don't anyway um but you know quite often we see those and they're just like they're not they're not all that helpful but changing your diet can be very helpful and reduce inflammation reduce pain and if you go to that video of of the one I did on chronic pain and fibrom myalgia it I think the mo I mean you can watch the video and sort of tell you similar to what I'm telling you now um but what what is really telling are the comments you go into the comment section and you will see hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that have dramatically improved their pain and chronic pain uh situation it is it's absolutely amazing it's so wonderful to see so you can see that and be like okay wow that that has worked for other people in my situation you know that can work for me is it is it going to completely reverse all of your issues it's very hard to say but it will it will definitely reduce inflammation and that can reduce the amount of pain that is expressed it's not necessarily going to you remove the underlying cause of damage and harm to your body but it will reduce the the inflammation which can absolutely reduce the pain experience and and I hope it does so I would just go clean high fat red meat and water you want more fat more ketones more ketones less inflammation red meat because you want absolutely nothing else in your system that can your body can trigger uh an an you know inflammatory response to and uh you know that that should put you in the best situation that you know can reduce the inflammation and reduce pain and hopefully it does um okay I think we've G for about two hours now and we've got several super Chell lot of super chats to get through so why don't we cut it there um I'll I'll try to get through the rest of the super chats but um I do need to go uh because I I'm just I'm just home for uh Christmas and I haven't really seen my family yet because I I only just got in uh very late uh so early morning sort of thing and um uh so finish up the super chats and then we'll we'll go from there and see okay all right so mark Sanchez thank you very much for the Super Chat almost at 20 years with athletes foot I believe it may um be a Candida related and I'm interested in carnivore uh would diet alone possibly help or would you recommend probiotics and other supplements no you don't need probiotics or any other supplements um you'll get you know meat is a probiotic um certainly fermented sort of foods and dairy L like yogurt is a probiotic um but you know meat is I should say a Prebiotic which is that it it feeds the correct bugs in your gut and just changing what you're eating in a day that's going to you you change your microbiome in a day you know it's very responsive because you the cell turnover rate the mitosis rate you know they they divide every sort of 20 minutes or so uh you know depending on the species but you know roughly every 20 minutes for for many bacteria and so you know you're you're you're you're stimulating different bacteria that you know better and they're going to they're going to compete faster and respond and replicate faster and quicker and and crowd out the other ones that you know you don't really want there necessarily and so you know no you don't need to take any any sort of products or supplements or anything like that just eat high fat meat and drink water and that's it but that that that's the trick is that is it you don't do anything else and that can help and it can certainly help with candida it can help with fungal infections um even on the feet a lot of people find that they tonal fungus a e foots clear up um other people find that it it can help their tonal fungus but it doesn't get completely rid of it so you know it depends um you know keep using whatever antifungal powders or whatever you've been using uh or if you haven't been using them start using them obviously see your doctor and see if they have anything for you um but yeah it can definitely help and know you don't need any any other sorts of probiotics or supplements on top of that it's just the meat and really the trick is getting rid of all the other things and letting your body just work the way it's supposed to work Nicole H thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy I'm 44 and have Cushing syndrome symptoms which started in my late teens can carnivore alone reverse Cushings well so there's Cushings there's cushingoid there's there's different sorts of causes of of very high cortisol so Cushings uh traditional Cushings is a pituitary issue so you have your you know you have like a pituitary macroadenoma or sorry microadenoma or something like that that is metabolic active is kicking off um lot hormones you simulate cortisol and this is this is sort of a central cause of of high cortisol and um and there's other causes you get like a tumor that just pumps out cortisol um and you have other sorts of you know cushingoid syndromes that uh at the end of the day just means you have a lot more cortisol than you need so there are um you know there is in the in the literature evidence that being on a ketogenic diet which a carnivore diet is but specifically be in a KET state of ketosis that that urates the effects of hypercortisolism which is what Cushings gives and so that can amarate that and so you know meaning they mitigate the problems that you get from high cortisol and you know so that in it in it of itself helps so um there are there are groups that will put people on a ketogenic diet you know as soon as they discover that they have mega High cortisol or Cushings or something like that and then they'll put them on that and often keep them on that after uh the the actual treatment for that like surgery taking out microadenoma or macroadenoma from the pituitary um or you know different tumor that's secreting cortisol different things like that you know depending on what the under under L causes or some medical cause you know treating with other sorts of uh medications and but a ketogenic diet has been used as an adjunct to that so you put people on a ketogenic diet like a cornivore diet and that can actually help with the symptoms of high cortisol and then you get the treatment for that and then you hopefully sort of address the underlying cause and you can continue on with the keto uh so yes it can absolutely help it can help amarate those the the effects and symptoms of Cushings and then I mean if you were diagnosing your teens and you're 44 then presumably they've done what they could to they they could to address the underlying cause and presumably maybe they can't or maybe you've just been on medications and I don't know what treatment they have you on I don't I don't um uh I don't treat these sorts of things outside of the surgery side of things the rest of it's done by the endocrinologist um but if you've been sort of being treated for you know 30 years and you haven't had I don't know if you've had surgery I don't know what else you you've done or maybe you don't want surgery uh but at the end of the day being on a ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet and preferably carnivore diet uh I think it's much better for many reasons can help that and uh but hopefully there's some sort of way to to address the underlying cause of that as well baby Jesse James thank you very much for the super chat I'm on ketovore with omad and I'm trying to work my way to carnivore once I reach my goal how do I stop losing weight if I'm not consuming any carbs would I need to increase my fat intake you just need to eat enough so you just eat uh fatty meat until it stops tasting good your body will do the rest if you're working out if you're exercising you'll stimulate muscle growth and bone growth and so that's what you need to do so you need to give yourself the proper stimuli and that will grow your body body and then you need to give the proper nutrients so that it can do that U if you just want to stay exactly where you are then just you know do what you're doing and but you need to eat enough you need to eat enough meat you need to eat enough fat and you don't need to eat more than your body wants your body will tell you your body will tell you how much to eat so you just keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good you get down to a stable body weight and body fat percentage and you're eating until it stops tasting good then you won't lose weight you'll be very stable if keep losing weight you're not eating enough or it's unhealthy weight that your body's trying to get rid of inflammation fat uh you know water weight things like that but if you're if you're losing weight past that you're not eating enough if you want to put on weight you want to put on lean healthy weight you need to exercise you need to do Anor robic exercising uh weightlifting sprinting and and then again eat enough eat until that stops tasting good your body will know your body knows how much it needs you you should be able to eat intuitively if this is what we're naturally designed to eat and that's what people are able to do so just do it okay I think Stephen James thank you for the Super Chat looks like you did another Super Chat it still didn't connect but it looks like there's another one here so Stephen James thank you very much for both super chats and your question what vitamins are there in beef and bacon uh all the vitamins and minerals that you need for maintaining Optimal Health so all of them you know so you know the thing is you need a different constellation of nutrients based on what you're eating and you have different antinutrients in Plants you know just like carbohydrates it blocks out vitamin C and you don't need as much vitamin C if you're only eating meat because you're getting enough protein collagen right so you need a very different constellation of nutrients depending on what you're eating so you know by the time we looked at our rdas and again this is Anil keys and I I just hate this guy I I don't trust this damn thing this guy did now presumably something he's done was worthwhile or else he would never have been in the position to sell his soul if you didn't have any power and influence he wouldn't have any power influence to sell so you know presumably would have done something right but who knows when that started you know I don't and I don't care the GU the guy's a crook and um also you know he did looked at the recommended daily allowances um you know at a time then when when everyone was eating carbs and plants and a mixed diet you know so you don't you don't know uh we certainly know that you don't need as much vitamin C as he thought we did right and that's that's still just a hold over from World War II so you know uh it's very different and so you know the simple fact that you can just eat meat and live your entire life without eating anything else tells you that you get absolutely everything you need in the proportion that you need it right and so that's where the Inuit and the MSI and the nette and all of our ancestors going back throughout all the ice ages who were only eating meat or very nearly only eating meat and certainly during the ice ages and the ice flows not much else to eat besides meat and uh and they were all doing great so everything you need in the proportion that you need it is found there and people say well what about these phytonutrients you need these things in Plants there a recent um article came out showing that there are more phytonutrients in you know grass-fed beef than in the plants themselves because they concentrate it they filter out the bad stuff they concentrate all the good stuff and that's what you get so you get everything you need there was um there was one um there was one gosh where was that from anyway it was a paper that came out and they were just basically saying there's likely about 50,000 different micronutrients in in beef that are essential that you need that we don't even have names for you know so it's like so there's there's a lot in there anyway but but the short answer is everything it's got everything uh copper kitchen Carnival uh my friend Melissa um I don't I okay sorry I may have not have seen your private chat um well thank you for the Super Chat you definitely didn't need to do that um but um Melissa says in several groups recently people are asking about getting more collagen and the answer uh they are hearing is get commercial collagen products no uh I think you can get all you need from animal products thoughts thanks yes absolutely you can get absolutely everything that you need um you don't need to get from commercial colle you don't need anything from a commercial Source you just don't you I mean that's the whole point of this is that you're is that you get everything you need you know when you're eating properly you shouldn't need the supplement now maybe there's some specific conditions you know that people may need you know more can't think of any off the top of my head but you know maybe they exist but certainly for the vast majority of people you don't need that you don't need commercial collagen products you just need to eat meat and you know if you really wanted more collagen eat make bone broth there tons of collagen in there and so you certainly don't need a commercial product and people but but do you need more collagen you know do you need more collagen than that than you're getting in meat probably not you know I mean there people that live their entire lives just eating meat not even making bone broth and perfectly fine of all the collagen that they need so why do you need why do you need different amounts um you'll get everything you need from meat if you're really worried about collagen and something that you're trying to catch up on or something like that make some buone broth you know tons of collagen in there yeah so I agree I don't think you need need to to buy anything other than just meat uh Curtis Baron uh looks like I catch your one down here great uh Curtis thank you so much for the Super Chat I'm completely off insulin and my diverticulitis is unbelievable one year carnivore well that's amazing uh that's that thank you very much for sharing that that's absolutely fantastic and um you know that that's something that people said you can't be done you you cannot get uh get off your insulin you cannot get away from diabetes and look at that people are doing it millions of people are doing it around the world so that's that's amazing Curtis thank you very much for sharing that hopefully that helps helps other people feel a bit more confident about trying it for themselves Mobi connected thank you very much for the Super Chat is there any issue eating uh more uh Burger 7030 versus steak also best to keep fat two times the protein excuse me um no there's no issues with that it's it's meat right and so it's just it's it's it's the same cow you've just grounded up right and so because you you've taken these parts that are a bit less tender and and and you sort of ground them and uh now they're they're able to be chewed so no that's totally fine you know it's very very healthy 7030 is a good fat content 6535 is about two to one grams of fat to Protein that's it depends on what you're going for look your body your body has limited capacity to absorb fat and so that's based on on your bile you can't really absorb F without b a little bit but you know really small amount like 10% or so and so if you're eating fat to a point that you've satisfied and saturated your body's ability to absorb that fat well that's all you want you know you aim for about one to two grams of fat to one gram of protein then you just adjust for your body and if you're if you're able to get 65 35 or so meat and fatty meat and you're absorbing that all fine and and you're getting you're not getting diarrhea you're just getting sort of soft stools means your body is not you're not eating way more than fat than your body can absorb um that that's great just do that so listen to your body listen to your stools you know make sure that you're they're soft and and a normal texture if they're getting more loose and liquid then that could be that you're eating a lot more fat than your body can absorb and so you're just not absorbing it so you don't necessarily need to eat it however coffee tea any artificial sweetener any like Stevia monk fruit sugar sorbitol Xylitol all those things will cause diarrhea they can all be laxatives but also magnesium supplements metformin which a lot of diabetics are on those can all cause diarrhea as well especially when you get rid of fiber out of your diet it's much more likely to cause diarrhea then too so that could that could um cover that up too so just be mindful of that but just aim for about one to two grams of fat to protein and and adjust according to your body's ability to absorb it it's going to absorb what it wants to absorb I don't think for a second that you can absorb more than your body wants you to absorb unless you force it to with something like ox bile I don't think your body's making a random amount of bile uh to make to absorb a random amount of fat your body just doesn't work like that in any other way so I just don't I don't believe that um so yeah so Abel uh thank you very much for the Super Chat Dr chaffy coming from Jim broci everyone says I need 3.5 kilal of a balanced diet I did it for one year no gains but skinny fat do I need the same 3.5k of fat or much less um TDE I don't know exactly what that means two mad that's twice two meals a day thanks uh yeah well looks I mean this is the whole thing your biochemistry is is so much more complicated than any little equation there is no equation complex enough to explain the the absolute workings of our biochemistry so you know anyone who who says this crap is just has just never taken biochemistry or if they did then they should they should have failed it because this is stupid that's a stupid thing to say and so a b what the hell is a balanced diet balance with what what a balanced diet really means is you need a balance of all the essential nutrients in a balance in the right proportion right so if you get a whole bunch of proteins from plants but they're out of proportion that's not a balance you're not getting enough of certain amino acids maybe you can get all the amino acids but you're not getting a balance they're not balanced in a way that you know you get the effects that you need and so that's a problem and and then just all the nutrients B12 you you just need these specific nutrients 50,000 or more nutrients essential nutrients in meat and you know you need those things that's what a balanced diet is is that you get a balance of all the nutrients that you need and um and so uh that's where a stake is right so you're already doing a balanced diet getting a balance of all the macro micronutrients that you need in a fatty state so that's a balanced diet um or do you want Oh when people say oh you have to balanced diet and they think you have to eat all these different food groups first of all there's one food group it's called food food is species specific so it's just not you can just you can eat anything that doesn't make it food and so that's not a food group is it meat is food that's it so that is a balance of all the food groups because that's the only thing that's food for humans right and so yeah you want to eat vegetables you want to eat this you want if you're saying you want to eat you have to eat something that contains carbs it has leafy greens it has all these different colors I mean what what nutrient is is red exactly there multiple multiple things that make the red color so that's very foolish anyway and um and then you know meat right so you want a balance of all those things when people go vegetarian or vegans that I mean that's not a balance no one ever says they have to get a balanced diet oh that's really good good for you no that's so this is this is silly this is just a you know this is just one of the many you know fooleries that people that you know people throw out there to to try to you know mislead people so you want a balance of all these sorts of things why do they have all the different nutrients I mean that that's the thing it's just like if you're saying you need a balance of all these different sorts of things it means that you you have no idea what you actually need you have no idea what nutrients you need and what is actually right for humans you have no idea what our evolved diet is you have no idea what our biological um what what is important for us biologically and you just need to cover your basis you need to hopefully try to eat all these random things so you hopefully get all the nutrients that you need to get a balance of the nutrients right and you just have no idea how to do that well if you just eat a steak you do that right and um but also the bad you get the bad with the good right because those things don't just come with nutrients they come with anti-nutrients they come with toxins and so is that what you want you want a balance of nutrition and poison I don't I don't I don't need that balance right so a balance of what exactly um you just need nutrients and just eat steak that's what you need that's a balanced diet um 3500 kilo calories what I mean a calorie is not a calorie is not a calorie and you can you can address that by many different ways of um of looking at it and I'm not the first one to say that you I mean Dr Robert lustig has an entire lecture series called a calorie is not a calorie and um just goes into that and so you know and it's it's very but you know it's it's it's wrong eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good if you're working out a lot try to eat twice a day to make sure that you're getting enough to put on adequate muscle and that's it you don't need to count calories you don't need to count macros I've never seen a koala pull out a calculator to figure out it's macros and you don't need to either if you need a calculator to figure out what to eat you're eating the wrong thing so if you're eating the right thing you should be able to eat intuitively just like every other animal on earth and so do that eat steak eat meat eat fatty meat keep eating until it stops tasting good no animal on earth when they have access to food does not eat that food right and so why would we if our body is getting less than it's asking for it assumes that it's because you don't have access to it right it's not assuming anything there's no intelligence there it's just a reaction it's a response right and so if you're not getting it enough your body's going to okay shut it down slow it down you know because if you had food why the hell wouldn't you eat it everything else does right so that's what that is so just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good try eating twice a day just to make sure that you're getting enough and listen to your body and relearn your hunger signals because that will tell you everything you need and there's a a post from my sister Rosland very nice to see you Rosland and Thea is my niece and Thea wants to say hi Anthony well hi Thea very nice to see you um it's been nice Thea my my sister rosin picked me up from the airport last night I was very very kind of them especially because it was actually ended up being late because my my plane got delayed and um I ended up giving her piggyback rides and airplane her around the the um baggage claim area and it's getting a lot of people was very crowded and I had this seven-year-old on my shoulder and was just all right I me not bad but you know it was um it was funny she was like airplane out like like stiff as a board like all my shoulders are sort of holding her there she just flying through so that was kind of funny so hello Thea very nice to see you Tim Mah thank you very much for the Super Chat I've noticed on Carnivore I no longer get mosquito bites you know that that's I used to get killed by mosquitoes uh anytime we go out I get much less now much less now I wonder if it has something to do with blood sugar I wonder if it has to do with you know going after you know sweeter blood and going after you know more blood sugar um you know I I don't know if it was La Dr borash or uh Dr somi but they're both dyum experts I can't remember I think one of them mentioned that they thought it was because of the dyum and there's going to be more dyum in a carb uh carbon sugar high blood sugar individual um and that you know because they're they're trying to get blood to go and multiply their their eggs and things like that you need more dyum for multiplication and all that sort of stuff so when you're growing and um and so that they think that you know they're going for higher dyum content but whatever it is it seems to be that we get less less mosquito bites now which I am not complaining about that I I still get them um but much less I used to get eaten alive by those little bastards so uh yeah I'm very very happy about that I don't know maybe other people I don't know what other people's experience has been in with uh mosquitoes as well but maybe leave the leave that in the comments let people know so Melody uh thank you for the Super Chat I think there's um continues down here there we go so meldia uh asks what causes the diastolic U blood pressure to be high I heard sugar I got rid of sugar and seed oil um there are a lot of causes of high blood blood pressure and a lot of it can be due to high insulin and then your arteries stop being compliant and they stop you know growing and shrinking and you know um in response to insulin because they just get tired of it like yeah we boy you cried wolf we've been hearing this for a while we're not listening to you anymore and then so it just sort of stays in that in that um so size you're going have the same volume going to have higher pressure and then when you get rid of carbs get rid of sugar get rid of seed oils get rid of alcohol uh then it starts being compliant again now you have more normal low insulin levels and that that seems to be a major driver for high blood pressure and improving high blood pressure is a major way to improve high blood pressure and there are other causes though so if a lot of people will improve their blood pressure by getting rid of all carbs sugars and Seed oils alcohol going on a carnivore diet ketogenic diet and um and uh but people who don't there are other causes of high blood pressure that should be investigated uh things like foch chrom oyas very rare but you know about 5% of people that have sort of unresponsive high blood sugar sort of poorly controlled blood sugar or uncontrollable blood sugar have a foch chromosoma so you know worth looking into but you know going on a carnivore diet improves a lot of people's blood pressure so you need to be careful because we're on blood pressure medication that can go too low and you can get dizzy you can fall so you need to be mindful of that and get on a a weaning plan uh with your doctor if you start getting that if you if you get up you start getting lightheaded and dizzy a lot you probably uh need to be on a lower dose of medication so you need to talk to your doctor and um yeah and and that's it and if you if you're getting a response you're able to come off your medications is great if not then you should investigate some of those those different kinds of high blood pressure with your doctor Lolita Sila thank you for the Super Chat Dr chaffy will carnivore reverse male pattern hair loss um it can for some um Dr Barry has a has a episode on this um that he said that if you sort of start seeing hair loss uh in your 30s and 40s that that that's likely due to insulin resistance it's like likely due to high blood sugar and high insulin and that's actually the cause of it and actually going on a ketogenic diet carnivore diet can can actually help that and reverse that um so yeah it depends I mean there are a lot of people who improve their hair you know it's interesting you know Jordan Peterson um you know who's you know did has done carnivore for health reasons sort of just came to it randomly he and his daughter um I saw a TED Talk of his you know when he came to prominance after Bill c16 I followed him since that I since the very beginning before you know he had his books out and he was doing his tours I I came across him just on on the internet people trying to blast him and he just he he knew what to say and he was just like look no that's not that's not what's going on here and I was like wow they that that guy's really bang on on a lot of these things and he's defending himself very well even though he came under a huge huge amount of fire and I was like wow that's that's really good so I started sort of you know listening to more and more of him and it was very interesting but at that point I think he'd already been keto and then recently carnivore um or maybe soon after but um you know he he improved his health in many many ways and I actually saw a TED Talk that he gave before he was Jordan Peterson before know back when he was just a you know Harvard Professor um and um and an academic he did a TED Talk and he was talking he was he was much more lethargic he was much more um you know slow in his speech and he was much more portly and had much thinner hair much thin in her hair and I was actually pretty surprised he looked he looked 20 years older than he does now and far less healthy and and that's so at least for him it look for him like maybe you guys can find that Ted Talk I mean he he had he had noticeably thinning hair now now it's much thicker so a lot of people find that they have much thicker hair so it can help in that regard and it seems to be due to high blood sugar and uh and Insulin so it's worth a shot anyway but you know it whether or not and the thing is too is that if you've already started losing your hair and if the follicles are damaged but not destroyed they may not be healthy enough to grow a hair and produce a hair but they they're still alive and if they're still alive then there's you can still bring them back to life you're not going to raise the dead so if that H hair follicle is dead now then it's not going to come back and so it just depends so if someone has had a certain amount of it has just started the balding pattern then some of those hair some of those hair follicles are still going to be alive and they can they can potentially come back and so hopefully that's the case but you know if they're if they're dead then unfortunately they won't they won't come back and yeah so it's it's definitely worth to try anyway give it a shot and see how you go or see how your friend goes if you're asking for someone else asking for a friend and um Sheila Sab Sabal Boro thank you for the Super Chat I'm not seeing anything attached um I don't see anything down in the chat but maybe maybe there's further down I'll keep an eye out for it Heather Mayfield thank you very much for the Super Chat what can I say or show someone who says red meat leads to increased prostate cancer in African-American men um you don't have to show anything they have to show that to you okay say like okay what are you basing that on well everyone knows it no please show me you don't need so that's the thing they're assuming a fact that's not in evidence they have to supply evidence first before they make that that um accusation and that um that assertion so they're saying well hey this may this increase prostate cancer in African-American men okay it says who what's the evidence they need to provide that evidence first and then you can provide counter evidence why do you need to provide counter evidence for evidence that was never provided there is no evidence they did not Prov they just made an accusation okay well they need to back that up and so if they show you a randomized control trial showing that you know red meat uh increases prostate cancer in African African-American men then you go okay well then we should look into this and we should look at the data more they're just making an accusation you you absolutely don't need to um you know to jump through hoops to you know you know prove a negative you don't there's nothing to prove there they haven't they haven't supplied any evidence so they haven't supplied any evidence they need to do that so okay well what are you basing that on you know what papers what studies with this and the other and that'll make them go and go okay well this is just something I heard sometime and they go link into it and they're like well there's just a blog post or just some some article or something like that well if there aren't any actual studies then there's no evidence is there uh and it doesn't um African-American men in particular African-American women as well or just you know people of of subsaharan African descent around the world whether they're American or not I think it's it's even even more important for them to go on a carnivore diet a mean only diet because they've been it's much more recent that they've been introduced to agriculture uh through Western influence and same with the Native Americans and the native Australians there's much more recently that they started getting exposed to Agriculture and I think that that's a major driver for health disparities there's going to be multi it's going to be multifactorial that's one of them and so certainly in the Native American population the native Australian population they've only been really eating agricultural crops for 100 years as a as a as a people you know think of the Plains Indians they were eating bison up until the day the Bison population were wiped out you know and um that was in the late 1800s you know with Buffalo Bill and so uh that's very recent you know um you people from Europe or the Mediterranean or you know Persia and and parts of Asia they've had agriculture for you know 78,000 Thousand Years they've at least had some time to adapt but then other populations like subsaharian Africans like native Australians like Native Americans North and South they're going to be it's a much more recent introduction to these agrarian food stuffs and and you're going to get more harm from that because they haven't picked up as much defenses you go back to heraus you know ancient Greek historian they chronicled um uh an encounter between uh Persian Empire and Ethiopians you know and so the king of Ethiopia was talking to the Diplomat from Persia and said hey you know what does your Emperor eat how long do your people normally live and they explained um you know growing wheat and making bread and they said that our people would normally live around 70 years you know pretty similar to now right and no modern medicine anything like that and that's how long they live not just average life expectancy from birth which is a con that's just a this is a manipulation of Statistics there are three kinds of lies right lies damn lies and statistics and that's one of them it's just saying oh average life expectancy for oh people are only living to be 30 no that's not what that means that's average life expectancy from birth and if three out of five people are dying in infancy that brings that number way down as an average that doesn't mean that's how long people lived when they died of old age just when they were killed by something brings down the the group average that's not what we're talking about no one cares about that number um realistically you're not you're not looking at that number as oh this is how long I'm likely to live no that's that's meaningless for that um and so back then they were saying we live about 70 years when people die of old age right because they didn't use statistics like lunatics back then or maybe they did but not in that case and the king of Ethiopia sort of laughed at him and said well no wonder you live such short lives if all you eat is dirt because you know we only eat boiled meat and we only drink the milk of our cattle if besides water and we would live 120 years sometimes much longer and people say Well they're just lying they're just making that up no one lives that long well we know as geneticist now that we're genetically designed to live 120 years on average so it's exactly that he hit it right on he hit the nail right on the head and you know and they were just eating meat and so that's that subaran PO African population that um you know at least 2,000 25 200 years ago when Herodotus was writing that you know they were still eating just meat and you know up until very recently you know uh most of the rest of the continent were just hunting and eating meat so um I would think it would be even more beneficial it's gonna it's G to be beneficial to everybody we're all humans so we're all going to have an optimal diet it's just some people have more of a defense against suboptimal agrarian food food um but you know that that's going to be people that have had agriculture for 10,000 years or so not a few hundred so it's going to be even more beneficial to uh to you know your friend hopefully T Alexander RJ thank you very much for the Super Chat greetings Anthony uh you think 200 grams of bacon uh in a day is too much no no not as long as it doesn't have bunch of sugar and additives and things like that I mean I think pork belly uh obviously is a bit more safe you know you're not going to have a whole bunch of nonsense in it but if you can get you know sugarfree cure uh and no artificial sweeteners de dear God um just as as you know natural cure with no sugar um I know I think P's Farms does it I think hemplers does it depends on where you are uh in the world but um you know if it's if it's very few amounts of additives and sugar should is it's perfectly fine um Factory farmed Pig are going to be fit a bunch of corn and soy less good but as long as you're not reacting poorly to it and you're doing well with it go for it Joshua Joshua bester thank you very much for the Super Chat hi doc my sister is vegetarian she developed a lot of problems um due to iron deficiency why aren't people more aware of iron deficiency in vegetarian vegan diet um thanks well thank you I appreciate it and well yeah it's because there's a lot of propaganda there's a lot of inundation they say wow look at spinach has all this iron in it and they don't they they they know but they don't tell you that it's not bioavailable and you can't absorb it and you certainly can't absorb it absorb much of it and so um it's we've just been lied to and we continue to get lied to and lied to and lied to that you can you can eat just plants and be perfectly healthy and so so why would you eat an animal uh because you damn well have to that's why and if you want to be healthy and you want your children to be healthy and you want your parents to be healthy then why the hell wouldn't you um it is it's say it's not ethical to eat animals well every every animal on Earth Eats something gets eaten by something people get eaten by other animals too and we go and admonish the crocodile well that's not ethical have you thought about have you thought about that Mr crocodile hm um that's not that's not what ethical means ethical means living uh to your nature that's that's what the aresta tilian definition of of ethical means about moral well moral is a is a judgment decision based on your your religion and your values so that's that's subjective as well um to an extent I mean I there's there aren't going to be many people that um you know disagree that you know there is a difference between hurting a child and and helping a handicapp person across the street I mean those are those aren't it's not just oh it doesn't matter what you do of course it does um but I think there's a sense of morality that helps and betters humanity and your society around you and your and your civilization around you and you know doing things that are good to people around you benefits the people around you and benefits you and benefits your species it can help perpetuate the species so I think there is an underlying sense of morality there um eating animals is part of that you know you can do it in a nice way you can treat the animals well but you know you do need to and it's it's not moral certainly to let your children suffer and have them get horrible uh conditions not developed properly make their brain not develop properly so they're not as healthy and intelligent as they would have been otherwise that's not moral that's not ethical and so you know this this is this is why we just need to put a stop to this nonsense and not listen to them but unfortunately still being pushed out there that that you know you can get everything you want from Plants everything you need meat is bad it causes disease completely opposite just projection and so unfortunately it's just people have just been inundated with this nonsense but it's not true and you can just point out to your sister and say hey look you're eating these ways but you're nut you are not getting enough nutrients and so people can say all they want that there's enough nutrients in there but but you are seeing that there's not you know maybe you can try just eating some meat see how that goes it will get better and her iron will get better and her fet will get better and her B12 will certainly get better and she'll get better she'll get better and she'll have so many things that have been going wrong she didn't even realize we're going wrong we'll start going right and then she'll be like oh crap okay yeah no that that's not the right way to go and I hope she does okay Dylan kater so that's a new one haven't come across that name uh thank you very much Dylan for the Super Chat hello Dr chaffy uh which binder would you recommend for someone who has bile acid diarrhea due to a right hemicolectomy my uh GI is giving me the option between uh cholerine and chest cholesterol thanks um I don't actually know the differences between those two products unfortunately there they aren't things that I that I use um I'm not actually even sure that you would actually need one on a carnivore diet given proper balance of of the amount of fat that you're getting I you know just for a right hemicolectomy I don't I don't see how that would change um eating on a carnivore diet things you know might get a chance you know might not get as much of a chance to to dry out and desiccate and dehydrate the stools you get a bit more loose stools but I don't it's not going to change your absorption of fat uh at the at the colonic level right because you do your absorbing in the in the short intestin the small small intestine sorry and so I don't think that that would necessarily need to be done it depends on what your you're um experiencing though like the diarrhea might just be more to do with the fact that you just sort of not pulling out all the water right which is doesn't mean drink less water though you need probably more water because you're not retaining it and I would just play around with the amount of fat that you're eating and to try to amarate that and certainly get rid of all coffee tea any sweetener magnesium supplements things like metformin just understand that those can cause diarrhea as far as the medications are concerned you can always try them and if they help that's great um but I don't unfortunately know I don't unfortunately know uh the differences between those two so I apologize for that CU your daddy 92 thank you for the Super Chat quit vaping lightheadedness was gone great carnivore 10 months but had symptoms duh L I think it elevated my glucose and A1C um if I cut everything but beef and water can I fix it yeah I mean you shouldn't you shouldn't raise your your blood glucose or A1C if you're just doing meat salt and water if you're extremely stressed getting horrible getting poor sleep not enough sleep uh raising your cortisol from other other means then then you can raise your blood sugar and you can potentially raise your A1C there's another thing too is that your your blood when you're healthier can actually live longer and when you're eating a whole bunch of plant oils and plant sterols that can actually shorten the the lifespan of your red blood cells and so you now you're you're looking you're comparing an average of um you know two months your things are living your red blood cells are only living two months two and a half months and you're comparing that to numbers for red blood cells living on average three months and so you know it's like oh well my hbm see is this and then you're all of a sudden you get healthier you get rid of all these plant stero so it's not mucking with your cholesterol in the cell membrane of your red blood cells so they're much more pliant and they live longer they don't get taken out because they're too stiff uh as early and they last longer and all of a sudden these things are living a month longer they're going to get another month worth of glycation even if the blood sugar sugar is very low and um so your HB andc can artificially go up even though your blood sugar didn't change at all or even your blood sugar went down so it depends if you're checking your actual blood sugar and you're checking that on a daily basis and that's going up and that corresponds correctly to the rise in hba1c okay well then you have to start looking at other things such as are you really getting rid of everything is there any sugar is there any sweeteners there any artificial sweeteners in there which I'm sorry you know people have gotten derangement of their blood sugar um from from taking artificial sweeteners and and the things that go with the artificial sweeteners and so you know you just want to cut out all of these things go strict you know red meat and water like you said like a strict L diet and and reduce stress and reduce and get proper sleep because those things can raise cortisol those things can actually raise blood sugar start doing sprinting chronic cardio like longdistance runs jogs that can actually raise cortisol that can increase your um abdominal visceral fat and that can you know also at the same time raise your blood sugar and your hb1c so you know me eating eating the correct thing is is definitely the major part of that um and it can fix that but you need to do the other things too you need to make sure that you're getting enough sleep reducing stress and and uh exercising Anor robic if you can if you're doing a lot of long jogs you need to cut those out switch to Sprints and um and then go from there and I would I would expect that yes definitely um uh that that would help so I think this would be be the last one guys uh Bishop's deep learning thank you very much for the Super Chat do you ever eat pure fat yes I do um I used to catch my mom eating butter back when we were like we were raised in a priyant household that was a f you know Dr pin's heart healthy diet was was just a household name when I grew up and so we all knew oh Fat's bad Fat's bad Fat's bad and um and then my mom just never bought that I've spoken to her subsequently she's like I never bought that crap I never believed that for a second and and so we catch her like every now and then she cut off a a piece of butter and just sort of you know she'd be buttering bread and then she would take that just put in her mouth and like one of us seemed like Mom and she go and know like gets startled and scared and um and uh it would be like horrified they should be doing that then like I was in um Australia they just trim every ounce of every scrap of fat off of these steaks which is really appalling to me um so I was adding butter to uh Scotch filet which is basically a riye with all the fat stripped off around it so it's just like just a waste such a waste and so I adding butter to that I had a knife and sort of cut that off put that on there's a bit of butter left on it and so I was like do I want to scrape it on there I'm like ah just not enough for that so I sort of my fingers took it off and looking at I'm like uh should I eat that and I was like might as well so put in my mouth I was like yeah it tasted like ice cream it was just amazing and I was like oh God they guiltily sliced another piece of butter and like ate that I'm like oh my God it's the best thing I've ever eaten in my life and you had more my body obviously needed more fat it needed more nutrients in that fat um it doesn't taste as good now because I'm you know more consistent with with getting the fat in but yeah I will eat a chunk of fat and um I actually go to the butcher and get the the offcut fat trimmings as well often we give you them for free if not they give it to you very cheap because they normally throw it away and sometimes they have to pay to get it thrown away so you're doing them a favor and um and you just cut that up into little chunks you fry that up in the pan put some salt on it if you use salt tastes amazing and so yes I absolutely eat chunks of that it's delicious so that's from uh my sister Rosa again please no more Super chats there's a little girl sitting outside the doorway waiting for her uncle to play with her okay well I will come out and play with a little girl and um and so I will end it there thank you everyone uh for coming on it was great to have a bit more time uh this time and uh and sort of see everyone and
