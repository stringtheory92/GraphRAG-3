    "transcript": "it's the difference between average life expectancy from birth and modal age modal age is what's the average age of people actually die at how old do people get to if they die of old age those are different things how long people live if they don't get killed by something and average life expectancy from birth very different things inant mortality was like three out of five You' had to have those other two people living a very long time a lot of people died in wars and famines in early age basically that one in five had to live a hell of a lot longer just to pull that average up to 36 38 but if you lived to 10 years old it was 60 and if you lived to 20 it was longer and you lived to 30 it was longer if you got through those kill points in early age people lived a very long [Music] time parents think that strict carnivore is bad father his late 60s is too skinny as on Statin thoughts on that effects on the brain keto for him if he won't do carnivore question mark how much fat intake he needs more muscle and healthy body weight yeah look if the if um it's understandable I mean this goes against a lot of people what people have been saying for the last sort of 50 years however it goes exactly in accordance with what doctors and researchers have been saying for thousands and thousands of years the meat's very important it's very healthy it's very it's very critical to have for Optimal Health and Longevity and um and we did not have the chronic diseases and Alzheimer's that we had uh previously or that that we've had uh recently so and oh wow people just didn't live long enough stupid stupid statement uh of course we did uh Socrates was 76 when he was when he was terrorizing Athens with his intellect 2 200 years ago or so um when they killed him with a plant by the way they made him drink Hemlock and um and so you know where was his Alzheimer's you know and there wasn't there was nothing in you know in Plato or anybody's writing I was like oh my God he was just the oldest guy in the world I mean oh this just amazing we had PHD programs you know going back how many hundreds of years I mean it's just just a thousand years you know and you have uh you know people that were you know finishing their education in their late 20s and then going on in their career and they only lived 10 more years after that pretty foolish to to waste your time getting a PhD an advanced degree and going in Academia if you're just going to just like work your ass off and then die 10 years later I mean this is stupid um you know just look at look at the ages of the founding fathers of America and when they died my great grandfather was born in 1875 he died in 1975 at home fully Compass menus um this is stupid so Alzheimer's was first described at a it was a it was a oneoff case report from Dr Alzheimer's that he presented at a conference in 1906 and it was brand new no one had ever seen this before that's why he presented this w wow look at this weird new case and and then it got coined Alzheimer's dementia and now it's extremely prevalent and deaths from Alzheimer's is is on the rise even when adjusting for age so no this isn't this isn't something that's been going on forever and we just didn't notice it or people weren't living long enough to get it um that's foolish that's someone who's never looked at the statistics never looked at the modal age it's the difference between average life expectancy from birth and modal age modal age is how how you know what's the average age of people actually die at how old do people get to if they die of you know of old age those are different things than you know how long people live if they if they don't get killed by something is and and modal age how long people tend to live um when they Liv to adulthood and average life expectancy from birth very different things you know inant mortality was like three out of five right so you know You' had to have those other two people living a very long time a lot of people died in wars and famines and early age and then so that basically that one in five had to live a hell of a lot longer just to pull that average up to 36 38 um I think it was 38 average life expectancy from birth was 38 and in 1850 but if you lived to 10 years old it was 60 and if you lived to 20 it was longer and you lived to 30 it was longer right so if you if you got through those kill points in early age people lived a very long time right so no that's ridiculous but um keto has been shown keto is the most studied diet ever and um as uh Rob uh Dr Rob CIS said uh in our interview the other day that we coming out in the next couple weeks really interesting guy um and uh he was saying you know I sort of mentioned that and he was just like it's the only diet that's been studied because the other diets are just you know have a have a questionnaire you know you get the nurses study and you give them you give them a questionnaire once a year and say hey what did you eat in the last year how the hell would you know that with any accuracy you know I mean it's just ridiculous and and so that's that's the quality of data on these other diets ketogenic diets have randomized control trials in large numbers with multiple Health out outcomes and end points by the thousands right so this is this is really the only really well-studied diet certainly the most rigorously studied diet ever and those Studies have shown that a key high fat meat-based ketogenic diet is a better treatment for Alzheimer's than every medic for Alzheimer's ever Tri that's what the Studies have shown um people are reversing Alzheimer's and if you're going to reverse it you can certainly prevent it by going on ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet doesn't even necessarily have to be carnivore but you just need to eat more meat more fat that's what your brain is made out of like we were talking about before and you go you're in ketosis so your brain is getting ketones it's running on its optimal fuel source it's getting ketones in there to reconstruct into fatty acids and rebuild the structures of the brain and you're getting nutrients like B12 that are integral for for myelination of your axons which will actually give bulk to your brain um and there was a study in 2008 out of Oxford that looked at um part of it was looking at vegans they followed them for five years looked them on MRI and found that their brain shrank by 5% volume and they thought this was likely due to their critically low B12 which was 180 190 and that's that's that's in the normal ranges now uh for B12 because again we're just so deficient just people are oh plant-based everyone's plant-based people don't realize oh you need to go plant-based you're already plant-based the average the average Western diet is plant-based it's like 70 80% plants right and so you know it's just processed plants there's barely any meat in there it's not the meat that's doing that it's all the other plants and garbage that they're putting in it seed oils sugars all this crap and um you know so that's that's that's what the problem is um so being on Statin Statin you know why do we need to be on statins to lower LDL okay well is LDL actually a problem I don't think it is I think the evidence is very clear that this was just a scapegoat there's no serious scientist actually independently said oh I think I think cholesterol is a really big problem here it was the sugar companies came up with that and then they found people like anel keys and other other professors three from Harvard in particular one became the head of the USDA who they could buy off and say hey you need to push this we want we want to get this out there that cholesterol causes heart disease and they're like sure my my Integrity is non-existent I'll I'll be happy to and um and so they they did that and um and we we know they did that because we have their contracts we have the internal memal from the sugar companies saying that they did this and so you know this is this is a matter of record it's not a it's not a conure it's not up for debate you don't need a study or a flyer or a survey from nurses once a year to figure that out we have this documented this is this is a known entity and so uh cholesterol was never the problem you know and they keep Shifting the goalpost they said oh total cholesterol that's the problem then you have all these different kinds of cholesterol okay there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol and that didn't really work out either there's 100 different kinds of chol LDL cholesterol oh okay well maybe this one maybe that one no no no they're all bad and oh maybe this and and now they're like okay well that's not really holding up either because people with higher cholesterol LDL cholesterol of any description live longer like okay and there's inverse correlations in some studies with total cholesterol and cardiovascular death like the Framingham study that's what they their actual data showed but it was misreported by the AHA American Art Association who was being paid off by the sugar companies to lie and say that it was the opposite and that higher cholesterol higher cardiovascular mortality rate in fact it was the opposite lower total cholesterol higher cardiovascular mortality rate um and so they went oh okay well that's not well now it's Appo oh Appo oh my God it's just they're just they're just banging the same drum and every time you just show how full of they are they just they just move to the next thing move to the next thing you know it's just classic misdirection they're just trying to it's just red herrings they're just trying to keep you looking over here don't mind the man behind the curtain just look over here look over here uh it's nonsense and and the sooner we just get away from this and just say look it's it was always  it's now we're not talking about it the sooner this goes away if we keep just playing this game and keep and they keep saying well but it's this well but it's this well but it's this we're never going to get anywhere right so we just stop talking to these people about it hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnival bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys first heart attack in America First death by heart attack on autopsy in America was in 1912 first case of Alzheimer's was 1906 right so where was this before that oh we just didn't notice before that  doctors were doing thousands of autopsies and dissections over their career and you had thousands of people doing thousands of autopsies in you know any given country and More in some countries that were bigger and uh not a single damn thing in the literature before 1912 except for one obscure reference and somebody tried to say it's like oh well you know there's this reference here in the late 1700s and they presented at a conference saying that oh wow isn't this weird we saw this thrombus in the in the coronary vessel is like isn't isn't that strange we've never seen that before they're like that's your proof that this was happening all the time and this is the number one killer in the world by this one obscure reference 130 years before it's ever seen again great job buddy and um so you know you have to deal with less than intelligent people when you when you talk about these things because they're just trying to defend an ideology they they're convinced of something because they're they think that they're smart they're the smartest person that they know and that they say oh well if I think it it must be true um and so they're just desperately trying to defend why they are not wrong uh so again 130 years absolutely zero heart attacks were eating more meat and fat in the 1800s than we were in the early 1900s when this became the number one killer in America first heart attack first death by heart attack um proven on autopsy in 1912 20 years later it's the number one killer in America you do the math this is at the time where we're eating the least amount of meat in 200 years us shaped curve beginning 1800s lot of meat slowly coming down slowly coming down a big vegetarian push from the the puritanical and the and the temperance movements because they're saying meet sinful it makes you lustful and makes you want to have sex and oh my gosh how could we possibly want to procreate and Advance the the human race and then we get down to the 1920s and 30s it's at the trough the lowest point in meat consumption in America in America for 200 years that's when it becomes the number one killer in America and then it sort of comes up from there uh so it's not even Associated there isn't even Association with this so and and the thing you have to realize too for the people that you know saw Peter aa's talk about how fil familial hypercholesterolemia proves and you know all these other things prove that um LDL is causitive okay well if it were cause of it why is it that the people with familial hypercholesterolemia in the 1800s didn't die of heart attacks it's not what they died of because there isn't a single case reported in the literature but if people study population genetics you'll know that the exact same percentage of genes and Leal that exist in the population stay in that population regardless of time and expansion of of the population as a whole uh unless there's a mass extinction event or a mass migration event so but if we're talking world population or at least in America at least in Europe where we can look at these things and check these things unless we're saying that you know just people from third world countries are the ones getting hard attacks and they moved into different countries and now they started getting picked up very unlikely um but you know in in these Western countries you'd have the exact same amount of people having familial hyp cholesterolemia now is then right and yet no heart attacks right so if high LDL will kill you and your body just makes the the you know the the the product of its own demise then you know why weren't we seeing that before 1912 why was there just one obscure reference in the late 1700s people obviously could see it these were smart people and they knew the H they these people did more dissections than any surgeon alive today any of them you know like an anatomist maybe you know that spends all day in a lab but that's what these people were doing they spent all their most of their days they're just in the lab doing dissections doing dissections they go out and treat some people you know some babies go back in uh that's when semov viice actually figured out that there's you know microbial infections and things like that because people were doing dissections on cabers and doing autopsies and because that's what people did and then they go and deliver a baby not wash their hands go back in and start cutting up dead bodies again and the infection rate was through the roof on these on these mothers so people were always doing dissections that was a major part of what you did as a doctor in those days in the 1800s and um you know I mean these people figured out the the circulatory system hundreds of years ago with no Imaging um you they figured out how to calculate the number of atoms of gas in a in a container before you had any way of measuring it with advanced Advanced Equipment and it was right right so you know these people were a hell of a lot smarter than most people alive now because they had to be they didn't they couldn't rely on technology you know and um it's certainly a hell of lot smarter than anybody who made makes the statement that oh they just wouldn't have noticed it because they're stupid yeah Da Vinci who invented a helicopter hundreds of years ago was a and even though he did thousands of dissections I'm sure he just just wouldn't have noticed a big ass clot in the heart and a big dead chunk of heart muscle yeah just the guy was a you just you just can't trust these people so pretty on a bit of a tangent there um but uh look statins like you don't you what do we need those for um you know to lower lower LDL cholesterol but why are we low LDL cholesterol it was a con it was a farce uh in the first place I did a um a video called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease and I I just go into the the actual studies that completely run counter to that and so people people want to check that out they can um hopefully your dad eats more meat more fat it's good for him um should really think about you know what he's trying to accomplish with the satins um I I I don't I don't I'm there may be some application outside of uh lowering LDL but you know that they have but um you don't want a lower LDL LDL higher LDL is um is a associated with longevity and lower all cause mortality in studies with 12 million participants and total cholesterol was shown in another study with 44,000 um out of Sweden last year that the two most important biomarkers to predict living over 100 was low fasting insulin and high total cholesterol so why would you want to lower your cholesterol I I don't I think that's exactly what we're supposed to do maybe people you people that go on a carnivore diet genic carnivore diets they get this massive elevation of LDL oh my gosh it's up there with people with familial hypercholesterolemia or maybe that's not the aberration maybe maybe they're protected against eating crappy food and lowering their LDL to a suboptimal state maybe we're supposed to be there maybe that's a better place to be and maybe when you eat what you're designed to eat and your body works the way it's designed to work and your cholesterol does that maybe you should think and say hey maybe that's where it's supposed to be maybe that's where we're designed to be by biologically maybe we've been eating meat in this you know in sometimes in exclusion for thousands of years during ice ages in the Arctic Circle or people like the Inu who stayed up there you know they've been eating that way for Millennia and their cholesterol is likely going to be like that so maybe that's what we're supposed to be maybe that's what's normal maybe when you eat a bunch of carbs and sugar and crap and your cholesterol comes down maybe that's the aberration maybe that's bad and maybe the people with familiar hypercholesterolemia are protected from that and your body says nope we're keeping it up here because that's where it's supposed to be I think that's how you should think about it you know you should question these sorts of things we should we should not just be spoonfed uh you know answers from people that do not that that had their own interests at heart they're they're protect they're trying to sell something they're trying to push a product and they're trying to protect their product because their product is toxic to people and why are we listening to them why are we listening to their advice and the advice of the paid shills that um that they that were bought off by them not great not great idea so yeah keto is certainly better than any than uh the alternative if he's not doesn't want to do carnivore uh just eat more fat eat more meat and you put on muscle you know stimulate it go for walks try to do some exercises and resistance and should be right the stimulation of producing more mitochondria and replacing old damaged dirty dysfunctional mitochondria and so this is why ketogenic metabolic therapy um has been shown in clinical trials to be extremely efficacious uh in uh cancers and treating Cancers and so and presumably the prevention of cancers"
