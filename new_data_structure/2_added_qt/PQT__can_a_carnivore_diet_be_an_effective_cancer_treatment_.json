    "body": "hi Dr C I talked to a co-worker today regarding one of her relatives um having stage four breast cancer I'm very sorry to hear that they told her she would have less than five years to live would carnivore help I think that it it would there are a ketogenic carnivore diet there there is a growing body of evidence in the literature showing that ketogenic animal-based diets like a carnivore diet doesn't have to necessarily be a carnivore diet but just a ketogenic animal fat diet because it's the animal fats that are good for you and the plant oils are not so good for you and the studies that that show the best results are the ones using meat they're eating animal fats and things like that to get into ketosis and then other other studies on ketogenics you know generally in mice you know giving them a bunch of like Crisco and and hydrogenated vegetable oil which does not exist in nature and yet we're giving them to to animals and people and saying hm you know we're getting we're getting strange uh and POS possibly bad you know blood markers and biomarkers from this ketogenic diet it's it's like yeah well no kidding you're giving them poison and so they're in ketosis but they're also giving them poison and so I'm not surprised that they're getting better results the ones that that are getting the best results are the high fat animal-based ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet um and depending on the breast cancer too that that's been more studied as well I U you remember seeing a study on triple negative breast cancer responding very well to ketogenic metabolic therapy um always remember that U you know Dr OT warberg showed nearly 100 years ago that cancer is a mitochondrial metabolic disease it's not a genetic disorder uh and then Watson and CRI came along and discovered DNA and everyone just went everything's DNA well every most things are stored in the DNA but that doesn't mean that the DNA is the brain and the PowerHouse the mitochondria of the PowerHouse they're actually moving around in the cell and actually uh um you know turning things on and off and running the cell as if it were a ship the DNA and the that information that it codes for is very important but it's it's um it's sort of the blueprints it's not the architect and the and the builders right the mitochondria or the workers and The Architects they're using that information and the proteins that it's producing to go and do work elsewhere in the cell now it's a bit more complex than that because the the DNA can actually you know self-control which proteins get Express and so and so on U but the but that's like like a chemical Dynamic and um based on gradients and other sorts of signals that that the DNA is getting uh the mitochondria actually moving around doing work and so they're very very very important and excuse me and so we have something called the warberg effect which is that cancer cells require 400 times the amount of glucose as normal cells to and so it has um you know has been shown that when you rest restrict glucose and sugar and you go into a ketogenic State you get your gki low your glucose Ketone index your blood sugar is low and your ketones are high that actually shows a survival benefit in in cancers of you know all different forms I mean there's there's dozens and dozens of studies in multiple different cancers uh like dozens in each dozens of studies in in in each of these different cancers including breast cancer showing significant Improvement with ketogenic metabolic therapy all the studies that show the most benefit are the ones that have the least carbohydrates so I have some that have sort of middling like is it all that much better uh whether they're having you know low carbohydrate what the hell does low carbohydrate mean it's it's ambiguous so some of them like you know below 200 grams of carbohydrates that's a low carbohydrate diet well that's intensely high from my standpoint because I don't have any carbohydrates outside of the glycogen that shows up in in meat and organs um and I don't even have that many organs you know it's really much it's really just meat um so then there's other ones like 50 grams or you know 20 grams and 10 grams and zero grams as you go down you know people tend to have better outcomes and so you keep that gki under 2.0 that's considered therapeutic and you do that from a combination of a ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet and uh potentially restricted eating you need to include organs if you're going to do that because you still need the same amount of nutrients you just want less energy coming in and uh and potentially fasting you know if you can't get your gki under two or even under one is is uh preferable uh for periods of time at least so that you can sort of have um this sort of constant pressure of of low access to energy then um you know fasting can can sometimes help that help sort of tip the balance and get you uh into that more ketogenic state so good luck to your friend um maybe show her my my interview with Professor Thomas seed SEF IE D where we talk about cancer and cancer biology and it's it's pretty amazing it's it's a you know hour and 40 minutes uh long talking about you know cancer biology and it's it's my most watched long video it's like two million views nearly maybe even hit it but that was 1.9 last time I checked and and then my my my lecture at uh it was a medical conference in San Diego last year uh and it was just called uh ketogenic metabolic therapy as a novel adjunct to standard of care and cancer bit of a mouthful probably not a Punchy enough to really make it go crazy on the algorithm uh but it's a good talk it has good good information in it anyway and um and so I would I would recommend taking a look at those and and um and seeing what she thinks and at the very least it's not going to hurt um it can help actually make chemo and radiation uh more successful by sensitizing the cancer cells to the chemo and radiation and uh protecting her healthy cells from the chemone radiation as well so I would take a look at those and um and maybe show them to her and see how she does because it's it's you know cancer is really nasty and um and you have to throw the kitchen sink at it um otherwise you know you're just sort of giving into to fate and that's not it's not a good fate to give into so uh I would definitely try that it's not going to hurt her that very least and I think it would help yes that's what the that's what the data shows anyway you know and and the thing is to you know you talk to her doctor if her doctor has a particular feelings on oh my God don't do that you know that's that's a discussion she can have but the vast majority of doctors that that or an oncologist that I speak to and that um patients speak to they say is there anything I can do with my diet should I change anything they say no don't worry about it eat whatever you want okay well then eat what you want and and if you feel that this is going to help you um along with that then uh you know it's worth a try and that's what more and more studies are showing to be helpful and uh and and increase survival and that's that's what we're trying to do here with things like cancer so good luck to to your friend",

    "body": "my friend was told she has nons small cell lung cancer very sorry to hear that they've told her that it is terminal and have her on a prazone causing massive weight gain even when she doesn't eat can fasting and carnivore reverse all this well you know cancer is is an extremely dangerous and deadly and nasty disease even doing everything as best that we can and fasting and doing carnivore and ketogenics and things like that sometimes it's not enough and um you know there is there is a point of of no return but there are a lot of people finding that they are significantly improving their health issues there have been studies on La M lung cancer and ketogenic diets I'm nearly 100% sure just going back to that lecture I gave I those some of the studies I came across were for non-s small cell lung cancer and so it's definitely worth a shot the prazone is you know it's it's a double-edged sword because it's reducing the inflammation allowing their their breathing to be easier but what it's doing also is causing diabetes and massively increasing her blood sugar and feeding that cancer and making that cancer much more aggressive and it's also suppressing the immune system which fights the cancer so this is sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy is um you know that she's on those medications to sort of help her symptomatically but they're they're accelerating her demise unfortunately so it just depends on how how much left she has in her how how much she has in her to fight this you know if she comes off the the prazone to get her blood sugar under control and she can fast and eat carnivore and ketogenic um and you know potentially address the you know glutamine action with different sort of medications press pulse um method that Professor seed has outlined in several of his papers and another paper that um I'm actually a part of that will be coming out shortly and um and that I talk about in the uh my uh talk on ketogenic metabolic therapy for cancer and in our our um interview my interview with Thomas caed uh we talk about all this I think it can definitely help and I think it can definitely help her feel better and get more out of this and uh and be healthier for longer and I can't say that it's going to reverse all this I can't say that it's going to fix her I can't say that um she's going to be able to put this into remission but I can't tell you that others have um and that they are still fighting this you know I mean this you just have to sort of assume that this is always going to be going on in your body you really can't stop and so um you know if if she tries it I think it's well worth trying you know nothing else is really going to do much I mean they've already given up on her and said that she's terminal and so they're putting on paliative measures and just giving a whole bunch of prazone which um is just going to jack up her her blood sugar and and accelerate this cancer cells require 400 times the amount of blood sugar as normal cells and so you know you want to do everything you can to keep that blood sugar levels down not up because you take do a pet scan you eject radiol labeled glucose and you see where that goes you see dot dot dot dot dot oh that that's all the cancer cells are sucking up all that glucose so that's what's happening when her blood sugar is high it's just feeding those cancers and they're lighting up lighting up lighting up so remember that pet scan anytime you have a bagel or a piece of bread or or have your prazone jumps up your blood sugar you really want to keep that down uh because the you're just you're just stuck energy into these cancer cells which is exactly the opposite of what you want to do so I'm really sorry for your friend that's a very difficult place to be in you know especially because sometimes you know the breathing is so hard that they really can't go off the the steroids and that's that that's really tough and you know it's like for for brain cancers brain tumors get a lot of swelling in edema you have to go on steroids you have to because the edema can kill you then you do the surgery you cut out the tumor and then you have them on steroids for another you know several days in a weaning dose and uh and then you come off of them you know when that swelling's down you've taken out the tumor so now it's not causing swelling anymore so you can get them off the steroids you don't keep them on for very long if possible and then you do radiation that causes more swelling so you put them back on steroids and then you're sort of going down that rabbit hole but it's um it's something that in certain circumstances when you have brain edema or you have so much edema in your lungs that you can't breathe that sometimes these are these are necessary evils and U you know the fasting and carnivore diet being at least ketogenic so you're not adding fuel to that I think is definitely going to be a net positive and hopefully it reduces the swelling down enough as well that she can come off the prazone and um and not be so horribly symptomatic that she's that she's miserable or or or uh putting herself in danger of respiratory failure hopefully that's the case and and if it is and she can really attack this with you know getting her gki below two or below one if possible with with um combination of a ketogenic carnivore diet liver organs um some restricted eating and some fasting hopefully that that um is enough to start turning the tide back the other way there are people who have done that and it's a growing body of them and there there are there's a growing body of experimental literature of randomized control trials and Interventional trials that um may be you know controlled but not randomized um you know self- selected uh trials Etc that um that that are doing extremely well and there's a just there's more and more there are more and more of these studies showing that so uh good luck to your friend hopefully she gets a lot of improvement by going carnivore hopefully she's able to get off the prazone and hopefully she's able to turn this around you can check your actual objective markers your CAC score or uh you know cored Doppler and see what's going on I have a number of patients that have been reversing their atherosclerosis this is all anecdotal but this is they are reversing it had a a gentleman in my my patreon uh chip who had 100% uh stenosis blockage of his right cored artery and uh a year before he started uh you know a a year ago he was on carnivore for a year",
