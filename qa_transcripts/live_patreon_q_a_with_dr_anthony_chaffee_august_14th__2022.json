    "transcript": "okay hello sorry it just took me a couple minutes to actually figure out how to do this and i just woke up too because i've been on call so hello everyone thank you everyone for joining this is sort of the first uh of many live events i'll be doing for um patrons i really appreciate everyone's support it's you kind of view to um uh you know to want to support the show and support my work and i i really appreciate it um so i there's a few questions that people had and i'll just sort of bring up the list but if people have more questions do do you bring them up and um [Music] and just sort of just pop them in the in the in the chat um let's see here okay yeah i'm sorry i'm just trying to read all these stupid things i'm sorry you can't get his emails up okay so this is the first question just popped up in here in the chat um by carnivore uh d veteran my son who has seizures has been told not to do carnivore or keto due to when he cheats he may have a seizure what are my thoughts on this my thoughts on this uh you know immediately or whoever said that is is not actually thinking clearly that's like saying don't take seizure medication because when he stops taking seizure medication he might have seizures the whole point of doing keto or carnivore is that this actually suppresses seizures not only does it suppress seizures it stops the initiating event of the seizure so you know it it it fundamentally changes your your biochemistry and your your um your brain chemistry to make it so that you're not going to have a seizure in the first place so why wouldn't you be doing this you know so that that's a very strange assertion that hey this works and stops seizures but don't do it because if you stop doing it then you'll have seizures it's like okay well you've stopped doing it then so you're gonna have seizures so i would not listen to that sort of advice i don't it was it was i don't know if that was the doctor who said that if they are they should um have a real big think about uh what the hell they're actually doing and um whether or not they can use your brain or not because maybe they should well they should definitely go keto or carnivore so their brain works a little better that's that's an appalling thing to say if it is from a doctor hopefully it and hopefully that was um just someone who was just sort of not thinking quite straight about it but yes you should absolutely do uh at least keto um and especially carnivore because you're going to eliminate the factors that are going to be causing seizures and you're going to and he's going to be developing his brain properly and and he's going to be much more healthy and intelligent and happy young man so i would 100 encourage that and that is backed by over like 100 years of of data and clinical research so this is you know we've paced it over a century of of medical literature just because you know they've said that that cholesterol was bad for us but cholesterol is not bad for us okay so we need to throw that out and start looking at okay well what were we doing before this what do we actually have in the in the data and the evidence okay and this is a big one you know you don't if you if you want to suppress seizures then then don't eat things that cause seizures um do you have a follow-up neural net the neurologist said that get a new neurologist absolutely get a new neurologist that is that is an insane thing to say and if he's if he's just if he's just his brain doesn't work well enough to like realize what he's saying that he's telling you to do something that precipitates seizures so that you know that oh well you don't want to have seizures in the future so do things that cause seizures what the hell kind of sense does that make so it you know it's just it sounds like he's just pushing pills and and but that way but it's the same thing it's just saying you know don't take your sodium valve away because if you ever stop taking your sodium valve parade you'll get seizures well you just stopped your sodium valproate you know um so and you know and and you know the easy one here is don't stop taking you know don't stop eating keto or carnivore it is it is better for him you're doing something that's going to you know not cause seizures and not have to take medication like why would why would that not be a beneficial thing and that's obviously something that someone would want to do i would want to do that i would way rather just eat something different and then feel amazing and never have a seizure again i'm not saying he will never have a seizure again but it will have significantly less and will have to take significantly less medication if any at all um but yeah so i'm very sorry to hear that um but yeah do not uh listen to that sort of nonsensical advice you know just do what you know is right for your kid which is try to get him on a diet that makes it so he doesn't have seizures because these things cause seizures you know there was there's someone i was talking to um that cured their epilepsy by going carnivore nearly curated by going keto full on curated by going carnivore you know had some caffeine bam had a seizure you know so these these toxic elements in plants are neurotoxins and they and the people that are susceptible can cause seizures so even if it's not it doesn't have carbs like caffeine doesn't have carbs but it's still called seizures because it screws with your brain chemistry so yeah i would absolutely avoid anything i mean i'm sure that that neurologist is you know that other things it's like oh yeah you know these black flashing lights and these sorts of activities like these will precipitate seizures okay we'll avoid those things okay well carbohydrates and other plant toxins precipitate seizures so avoid those things i mean that should be the natural thing that they say i have no idea why this person said that but that is an appalling thing to say all the neurologists i've spoken to that don't use keto or now carnivore um for this they all just say oh well it's just so difficult so difficult to get them on there so the first line is just get them on medication if that doesn't work then you try some some food things and it's like okay well at least it's in your mind but i think it's completely the other way around you try the you know the food things first oh it's so hard to get people to stop eating carbs have you tried you know so you try if that doesn't work then you go with the medications but you at least try and they at least have that on their on their radar even if they don't ever use it but this guy expressly saying don't ever use it i don't know sorry i'm i could i could just rant on that forever because that that just that is that just drives me crazy that's that is just a crazy thing to say i know i'm normally trying to be like diplomatic and especially with other doctors who i'm sure trying their best but that is that is just an insane thing to say a bio neurologist so i'm very sorry they said that i completely disagree for the aforementioned reasons um okay sorry hopefully that that was helpful and not just just too aggressive okay and uh saying that it's all on board um difficult when there's other parent involved yeah i mean definitely yeah and docs are actually giving out this information absolutely that is nuts um yeah i i think that um well i think just just making those those same arguments you know is is probably the way to go just be like look you know the doctors aren't going to say stop taking your medication because if you ever stop taking your medication you can have a seizure of course you will because that will stop suppressing the seizures and then you know and the doctors are going to tell you don't you know to avoid things that precipitate seizures okay well these things in plants like carbohydrates like sugar you know like caffeine and other other sort of plant toxins neurotoxins are going to cause seizures so the appropriate advice would be avoid these things that cause seizures and so if you look at these in this way these things in cause seizures you know hopefully your your husband can sort of see the logic of that argument as well and uh my god yeah and mike is saying malpractice that is absolutely malpractice that is 100 malpractice if you then go stops doing this and then has a seizure i mean it's i guess it's a bit more cut and dry malpractice if he were already on keto or carnivore not having seizures and they said no no get off that right away and then he had a bang seizure because the definition of legal definition of malpractice is you did something wrong and it caused harm so right now they're doing something wrong but has it caused harm yet you know hasn't necessarily changed anything because he hasn't been doing it yet so but yeah that is that is extremely unethical and uh bordering very closely on malpractice i absolutely agree okay um let me see okay okay so uh one question is about hair loss with females on 90 carnivores six months in um quite often when people are having you know hair loss hair thinning things like that it's often because they're not eating enough fat that is something that i've commonly seen um so that's uh what i was would ask is how much how much fat are they eating um are they having dry hard stools are they still eating or they're eating 90 carnivores what else are they eating um you know if you if you're eating a high fat meat diet and nothing else like your hair will get better and your skin will get better your nails will get better and stronger and so but you do need to get enough fat fat you know where your hormones are and this can be hormonally driven as well especially for women due to estrogen and a number of other factors but you uh will definitely want to um get enough fat get a lot of fat you know generally generally when people start this you know they eat more fat than they have before so i think oh i'm definitely getting enough fat because i'm being so much more fat than i used to but in fact they're actually not they're still getting constipated they're still getting dry hard stools they're still not you know there's their their hair is not doing what it should and their nails aren't doing what it should and their skin's not doing what it should and they don't have a lot of energy that that is most typically when people are not eating enough fat so i would that's what i would recommend is try to eat more fat um see yeah there's good stuff going on in the comments to uh guys talking about epilepsy as well which i think is great please keep doing that and um and i'll keep trying to go through the questions here um that we had ahead of time then please you know anyone sort of uh ask questions as we go as well and we can take those as well okay so someone knows someone that has started experiencing carpal tunnel on carnivore after six months in what would i suggest um well carpal tunnel is caused by you know inflammation which you will be absolutely reducing on a carnivore diet so that should help and um also from you know repetitive movements and things that you know typically people do at work and typing or you know dental hygienists have their hands just tucked in all the time and um and um so you know you should address those sorts of aspects of their life as well your carpal tunnel doesn't just come out of nowhere it takes years and years and years to build up but you look at what they're doing outside of carnivore because they're you can you can have things go wrong that are outside of carnivore but it shouldn't be contributing to the inflammation uh in in her or their wrist um it with anything it will it will reduce that so i would look at the other things that are going on as well because that can you know these things can build up as well um okay so they say that nails are strong skin is fabulous hair is just taking a dump okay that's different um i'd still try to eat more fat but um you know the other thing with um with with premature hair loss is um like like uh higher insulin and insulin resistance as well um so i don't know what the other 10 of non-carnivore are but you know if they're containing carbohydrates i would drop those but um you know i would i would definitely try you know something is you know not agreeing with you or it could just be that this is sort of a timing thing 99 carnivore what's what's the other one percent okay coffee once in a while that should be fine um i would just i would just try in the short term trying to increase increase the amount of fat that you have but we also ask how much how much fat are you having like what exactly are you eating and you know clint asks what is the ratio of fat to protein a carnivore should eat in a day you should you should aim for between sort of 70 and 80 percent calories from fat but your body will will ask for sort of sort of something different because you're only going to absorb a certain amount of fat based on the amount of bile that you have it's very difficult for your body to absorb fat without bile and so if you're not getting enough fat you're going to absorb every ounce of that that's not going to spill over into your stools and you'll have dry hard stools it's that little excess fat that happens after you you absorb everything else that keeps your stool soft so if you're getting sort of soft stools and not drinking coffee because coffee will loosen your stools and make things move quicker so i'll give you a false impression um then you know you know you're getting the right amount of fat you should just sort of eat that that amount if you're getting very loose stools and you're not drinking coffee and you're not using artificial sweeteners then it's more typically because you're eating more fat than your body can absorb like a lot more fat than your body can absorb it'll come out as loose stools so can you saying bowel emotions are smooth no issues uh that's good uh also remember just the coffee will will uh will make things uh move quicker as well so it could be sort of masking uh masking that as well um you pass those uh kenya like i'm i'm sorry i don't uh i don't have any good answers for you uh you know you know being on carnival or not eating anything else is um [Music] you know you should you should actually you know help your hair get better i've i've you know seen that many many times um you know if you're and if you're getting enough fat and you're getting and you're not really drinking much coffee and you're not not doing cars otherwise carnivore um i don't have i don't have a good explanation for that uh unfortunately because you know you should be getting you know better so it could be a timing thing it could be that this you know was sort of happening and and and now you're just noticing it but um you can you should also get uh checked out you can get other blood panels and um it was getting thicker then all of a sudden it just started coming out in droves okay so i mean that that suggests there's something something else in your environment that's in that's affecting this as well um because it's uh you know something changed right so try to think about you know any precipitating events anything that that changed shortly before things started dumping out you should also go see someone and get like just a complete blood panel not just through like your family practice doctor but like a someone who does like metabolic health or functional medicine that can do like a deep dive into looking at hormones vitamins and minerals to see if there's just there's just something off that can either be you know corrected or or at least identified that uh that can be fixed so um that's what i would would suggest trying to try to think of you know what else is going on in your environment that can affect this if you don't know or think it can affect this just think about things that have changed around that time and and then doing a deep dive into your into your blood work and seeing you know exactly what what what is going on nutritionally and biochemically just and hormonally to see if there's anything that can be done about that um [Music] did you see naturopath and all of these came back yeah i mean i don't know exactly what they tested you for and i don't know what reference ranges they use because you know the the normal reference ranges from the labs are all off because they use reference ranges of of basically how they get the reference range is is the first 2 000 people that come in to get a test that year that's the reference range and they just call that normal but you know a lot of people are coming in because they're unwell and so those obviously aren't going to be normal numbers they can be elderly they can be sick and so um we uh my clinic we use uh reference ranges that uh are just for a 25 year old person in you know who isn't sick who is healthy male and female obviously and so um [Music] so you know you can just just make sure that they're they're either looking at those in that way or you can find someone who you know does look at things in that way um and uh yeah and you know if you want to just just quit coffee and just see see what the hell that does you know completely you know just give it a try um do i recommend uh some carbs if very active or bodybuilding absolutely not i actually i actually think it's more important to avoid carbs if you're very active and uh and bodybuilding because when you're when you eat carbs it it derails your entire metabolic system so you're when you when you eat carbs you basically can only burn carbs and say oh you have to eat carbs to burn carbs no you only have to eat carbs to burn carbs if you're eating carbs it's a self-fulfilling prophecy you know people talk about like um you know getting their second wind you know they go and they hit the wall and just oh that's all i've got that's all the energy i have um and then they they have they normally stop and then you have like marathon runners and distance that you know performance of endurance athletes that say oh if you keep going you keep pushing keep pushing and then you force yourself then you get into your your second wind you're in the zone and you get this runner's high and all these different terminologies and and they go and then you can just run forever and you can just work out forever what that is biochemically i argue is at first you're eating eating a bunch of carbs until you carbo load and you do all that sort of stuff and so you build up all these carbohydrates and glycogen fine but your insulin is up and so you're going to be stopping your body from mobilizing your fat stores you have way more energy in your fat stores even for a skinny person than you will in your glycogen it's just that's just you know that's just a thing and so when you uh are just doing that with while eating carbs your you know insulin is up and you know and so you're going to suppress your body's ability to mobilize your fat stores so you'll you'll have more glycogen sure for now and that will run out and then you'll feel horrible and you'll have no energy and when you are you push yourself you know normally take about 24 hours for your insulin to come down low enough that your your body can can uh access your fat stores but if you just keep pushing yourself and pushing yourself and pushing yourself pushing yourself biochemically you you have to have to force this change over so you start making ketones and start producing blood sugar and glycogen and then also you get your second wind and you just feel amazing because of all this energy because now you're mobilizing this from your fat stores well i live in the second wind i'm always on a runner's side because my body's always working like that biochemically so you know i produce exactly the amount of energy i need to do whatever i'm doing sitting here and talking to you guys i'm producing the exact amount of energy i need to sit here and talk to you guys when i start working out i will produce the exact amount of energy i need to do that workout and so you know the more energy you burn the better you feel is why people take stimulants this is why they drink coffee this is why they do drugs and um that increase your energy and so when i work out i get more energy which makes me feel better which makes me want to work harder which makes me feel better and so on and so you get this positive feedback loop so especially for people who are are you know playing sports or bodybuilding or doing endurance training or anything like that you are shooting yourself in the foot by eating carbohydrates because you just you just shut down that entire biochemical you know factory of energy production and you will only be able to burn you use carbohydrates and also insulin slows down your metabolism you know and people say oh well maybe that'll help you store store um you know you know build muscle and protein like maybe but it's going to store a lot more fat and it's going to store fat and glycogen in your muscles to make them look puffier but that doesn't that's that's not actually lean muscle mass that's like a wagyu steak or a marbled steak that's that's how they get that marbling that intramuscular fat is by feeding them carbs by feeding them grains so you know like that's that's the whole point you know when you don't have a you have a grass-fed cow grass-finished cow it's just lean muscle and with like a little border of fat whereas you give them a bunch of carbs it's it just adds to the fat it doesn't add to the muscle so that's doing that to you too if you eat carbohydrates even if you're working out so i would yeah definitely recommend the opposite um use your pass number she tries not to chase numbers yeah yeah yeah i mean look i'm sure i'm sure going back to kenya um with her with a the hair issue in the naturopath you know i'm sure they're sort of looking at things um in a nice way but you know obviously something's going wrong and so you know if if it's if it's not if the bloods are all looking fine then that's one thing if you haven't gotten that you know but but yeah i mean i would at least ask the question you know and um not necessarily looking at your past numbers you know exclusively but you know this could be something else going on but yeah if you're looking at your own numbers and things aren't really going off then you know maybe that that wouldn't explain it but something to think about anyway and you know it wouldn't hurt to just you know eat more fat and stop eating um stop drinking coffee and just and just see what happens you know that's i think that's a first line experiment anyway and stress is a factor too like yeah i mean there are a lot of factors but i i think that's a good place to start anyway is just going strict strict pure pure pure and uh and up the fat and just and just see what happens there as well because that's something that you can you can adjust now and then you have and if that doesn't work then you need to look at other things in your environment and you know potentially your bloods but if those are fine then that's fine but you know there's something going on something changed right so you need to sort of try to see what's going on there um so do you think that an iud like marina coil uh progesterone-based that is used uh that is being used to better regulate female cycles is less necessary once on carnivore or even sub-optimal dangerous um so well i mean i don't think it's dangerous you know your your cycles will be you know more uh physiological uh than they were before because your hormones are going to be more physiological does that mean that they're going to be less painful or lighter or other things i couldn't tell you that but they're going to be what your body wants them to be and and you know is it you know but you know the progesterone marina coil works locally to to secrete progesterone just there in the uterus and what progesterone does right there in the uterus is increased mucous secretion around the cervix making barrier protection against uh you know sperm entering into the uterus but it also uh you know suppresses the endometrial lining so there's just there's just lead less blood able to form in the first place and so you you will just naturally have lighter periods just because of that um so it just depends on what you're going for and um and what what would you want it it's you know it's first and foremost a form of of uh you know protect of birth control and protection from getting pregnant so you know that's that's it's the primary uh end point but it is also used for people that you know want you know lighter periods and also with women with uh postmenopausal bleeding uh it helps suppress that as well so it just depends on what you're on what you're going for but you could always try if you were doing it to regulate your your hormones and and uh get your periods a bit more manageable then you certainly trying carnivore and and seeing what what you're like now when your hormones are working properly is is a very good thing to do and then maybe you you don't you know you don't want the the the um the coil but that's that's sort of going to be an individual sort of question uh to answer um [Music] so so i provide okay so clint says that i provide great arguments for carnivore diet any chance we'll be putting this information collected over the years into a book form i am certainly trying to i've uh really time poor at the moment and so i just i have not been able to get get uh a lot of work done on the book but i have i have started writing a book i have all the chapters mapped out i have my bullet points sort of things of what i want to say sort of in loose loose guide i need i do need to go through them again and get a bit bit tighter and then i can just fill in the gaps um and i just need to start working on it because it takes a while to get going on especially when you're in the middle of a chapter you have to reread the whole chapter and sort of get back in the mindset of what you were trying to accomplish of the argument you were trying to make in that chapter okay where else do i go from here and it's it's um it's time consuming and then and then you get into a rhythm and and then you really start getting productive after like an hour or two and then like you really just need to keep doing that for several hours after that if you want to get any sort of uh of work done on it at least for me that's that's how it works so um it's i just i don't have several hours in a row with all my other responsibilities so but it is a work in progress i am i am trying to do that and so um hopefully i can get that done this year that is that would uh that would be my goal is to try to get it at least at least on paper and able to be edited and looked at and critiqued and then looked at publishing sort of you know towards the end of the year you know just in time for christmas you know and um but yeah hopefully hopefully i'll get get off my ass and actually get it done um okay so yeah you read something okay so um carnivore veteran uh read something today they claim the only reason carnivore works is because of a decrease in calories uh does ceco also apply to the carnivore realm so yeah this this is an argument made by um oh gosh what's her name what's it was it reddick i don't know choose a lady she was on um she was on joe rogan's podcast she wrote like a 30-page paper on you know uh just just trashing carnivore diet and i think a lot of her arguments were uh oh god damn it is it rhonda rhonda pep is it rhonda patrick the hell is it if anybody knows what this is you know pop it up in the comments because i'm i'm blanking here might be rhonda patrick or unless that's that like fitness person that does like the the tv show about losing weight but anyway um i'll i'll think of it at some point but if someone remembers it just just pop it up and she she made the argument a lot of different arguments that i that i think aren't um uh you know that that are easily uh you know debatable and uh and debunkable one of them was that was that when people go on an elimination diet they just naturally start eating eating less and then you know they're eating less calories and they lose like that way so all it is calories and calories out and then she just dismissed it there and my immediate response to that was like don't you see how significant that is how ridiculously significant that is that people are naturally reducing the amount of calories that they're taking in just just by hunger and taste and they can actually listen to their hunger signals now do you not see how how important that is to recognize and and how a that's going to be more in keeping with something that's natural for us because we can naturally listen to our instincts but also yeah okay yeah if you if you force feed yourself a bunch of extra calories yeah you're gonna have to put them somewhere you know that's a fact and so you know when you're eating a carnivore diet you're not screwing with your your body's hormonal signaling and of of hunger and so all of a sudden your body goes goes whoa we don't need all this let's just let's just tone it down here and so and then you naturally start eating less so that your body will not and your body wants to use its uh excess adipose tissue first and then when you get down to a stable state your your your hunger will go up like that's exactly what happened to me yeah rhonda patrick i thought that was what it was so yeah i i just don't think that's that's really seeing past you know the surface there and you know because that's a very significant thing that you can just listen to your body and your body will just tell you to eat the exact amount of calories that you need the exact amount of nutrition that you need to get to an optimal weight and body composition for your genetics maybe not optimal for you if you want to do like a fitness competition you want to be like you just absolutely shredded like yeah you're gonna have to do something a little different either just working out like crazy or um you know or or you know changing changing how you eat things that's that's a bit different but i'm talking about getting down to an optimal genetically biologically optimal uh body fat body composition where your body says like get this is where we want to maintain that that is really significant that your body will just naturally do that and tell you to do that through its own signaling and so obviously that's an important thing and then the whole calories in calories out thing is is way too simplistic yes in a sense you know you we are using expending energy and we are bringing in more energy and then you are going to be using some of your body uh stored energy in your body in the form of fat uh in order to uh you know do things and run your body and stay alive and then you're going to bring in more okay so as calories in calories out not exactly a calorie is not a calorie is not a calorie these are complex bio or bio organic molecules they have chemical functions and chemical reactions in your body carbohydrates are not just four calories per gram and that's the only thing that exists in their world because we're not just burning them these aren't combustion material these are organic compounds that have or your organic chemical effects in your body and so they will do different things just the just the simple fact of not eating carbohydrates and being in a on like a keto diet you your basal metabolic rate the amount of calories that you burn in a day increases on average by 300 just right off the top all right so if you're eating the exact same amount of calories but some of those calories are in the form of carbohydrates you will suppress your metabolism insulin goes up metabolism goes down and you lock down your fat stores so really you're only you're only burning what you're taking in really and then your store collection as well this is why people feel like crap three four times a day i have to eat i have to eat i have to eat because they're running out of carbs and so i have to eat more carbs they have to feed the beast and so you know if you don't do that then you know you're on a different biochemical pathway and your body can can actually you know use its fat stores so that's a little wrong in my in my view but you will never be able to calculate your exact calories out without very sophisticated machinery which none of us have access to in the in the co in the real world so you know and what you eat you know changes your calories out so carbohydrates right there off the bat change how much calories your body will put out you know just your basal metabolic rate okay eating more fat that actually stimulates your body to mobilize your fat people they think it's the other way around oh if you have fat in your system your body's going to go no no keep the fat out it's it's actually the opposite and so if you're eating more fat this is actually stimulating your body to release more fat because you're basically telling it like hey we've got this coming in you know we don't need to sequester this anymore we're not in a starvation state you know bariatric doctors weight loss doctors and weight loss surgeons you know will i mean i've yet to hear one say uh differently than this but they will say um that's uh you know that if you eat less than 1200 calories you're not going to lose weight because your body's going to go into a survival starvation mode and just say hey we need to shut things down we need to just shut down you know as many processes as possible and we need to conserve energy because we're in a famine we're in a drought it's winter we've got to just just hibernate and tuck in and burn as few calories as possible or you're gonna die because that's how it was you know before we had uh you know agriculture and and uh and and farming and just a huge abundance of food you know we went through times of of uh starvation where you know we we needed to be able to weather that and one of the main uh weapons in weathering that is is uh shutting down your metabolism okay so if you eat less you're gonna you're gonna burn less you're going to use less so that that's just a fact that's just biochemistry um i was i was going to say biochemistry 101 saying it's basic but actually biochemistry doesn't start until 400 levels so that's biochemistry 460. okay but that's how it goes [Music] okay so mike says that my history of why and how we are carnivores was what first caught his attention and hopefully that will be part of the book yeah i'm going to try to put a chapter of that in the book as well and um you know maybe like you know in the future when i get some of these some of these things written out i can sort of put out you know you know parts of chapters and things like that uh to the patreon group for people to sort of take a look at and let me know what you guys think and see um you know see if it's uh if it's worth uh doing or maybe worth redoing and see how we go um when will i be recording a cuticon slideshow presentation very good question um i uh again have to just have time for that um i will try to um try to get on that but yeah uh hopefully soon i'll i'll try and do that um if i the main thing to hold me back is i don't exactly know how to sort of set that up where i'm just recording my voice and the slides but i'll figure it out um [Music] so dr kerry berry says that keto carnivore isn't uh weight loss diet is a health optimization diet um weight loss or gain will be whatever your body demands yeah i agree you know this is just your body's gonna actually start working you know how it's supposed to biochemically and so you know whatever that means you know some people they'll gain weight and they don't want to gain weight but i think i think when you're getting if you've already got excess fat and you're gonna and you're gaining more excess fat when you're when you're going to cornbread that's a vanishingly you know few people that experience that but it does happen and i think that has to do with them being in a hormonally compromised state after years and years and years of improper eating and dieting quite often their leptins are very very high they have leptin insensitivity but at the same time i literally just saw a lady yesterday in clinic who uh had leptin at literally twice the twice the level that that bariatric uh doctors and surgeons would say if you get past this number you can you will not be able to lose weight on your own you will have to have bariatric surgery um so normally you want you're left in um it's like millimoles per liter i think it's like three to eight and if you get over 100 it's traditionally said that you will not be able to lose weight on your own you won't be able to uh hers was 200 and guess what she's lost 10 kilos already you know in a few weeks on a carnivore diet so about a month i think and so maybe her her weight loss is not going to be as dramatic as it would be if her leptin was normal but she's still losing weight and and we're re-testing her her leptin again to see and i guarantee you it's going to be you know way down from where it is so this this just makes your body work in a much better way so there's something else going on there with the people that are gaining weight it's generally people uh when they've tested it they've uh told me that they've had high leptin but that's obviously not the only only part of it because i see people with super high leptin lose weight as well so you know still have to figure out what's going on but i'm you know it's probably something to do with hormonal signaling that their brains again are that leptin insensitive and you're just it's just saying hey we need more we need more food than this and eventually that heals and that corrects and your body goes oh actually no no we don't and you just you just naturally uh um you know just eat what you're supposed to eat um so question is to increase fat is it okay to increase with butter the duck eggs ribeyes chuck roast done at steak uh ground beef and tallow and other animal fats yeah butter butter's fine i add butter to my steaks all the time if you are someone who has a problem with dairy then yeah just stick with tallow but a lot of people are fine with with you know butter or even ghee and so you know if that's if you're one of those people then then just do that that's fine um dr chafee would you suspect that an upper limit of eating fat is possible where it will stop the body from burning its own i don't actually i mean i don't have any hard evidence of that but if you think about things physiologically just down at first principles your body makes bile in order to absorb fat i i honestly i trust my body to you know to know what it's doing in in these regards so i don't think it's going to make more bile than is going to be physiologically beneficial to my body and that's why there's a very limited amount you know we don't make bile in response to fat you know we don't eat a bunch of fat and our liver go let's make bile we make bile at a steady rate and we store it in our gallbladder so it's there ready to go you know and it concentrates down this is where gallstones come from is that it actually sits there and gets really concentrated and so if you're not eating fat at all you're not moving that and it just gets you know concentric hyper-concentrated solution at rest is going to start forming precipitating crystals which are what bile sludge and call stones are but no i don't think so i think that you know your body's going to make as much bile as it actually wants you to absorb so i actually don't think it's possible to overeat fat because you have an overflow valve you know you just won't absorb it you know you can absorb some but like like some and it's usually like medium chain fatty acids and not that many of them it's very small as it's actually on the the uh some of the surgical boards here in uh australia that's actually just you know uh that's that's a general uh teaching that's not just that's not just me saying that you know and that's not just you know certain obscure textbooks that's actually general generally taught and but people don't put that into context and think about it but yeah no i don't think i don't i think if you're going to be absorbing like a bit like a small fraction of the amount of fat you eat i mean i guess you could theoretically eat just so much extra fat that that little bit extra that gets absorbed in is you know that small percentage you know ends up being a problem but yeah i mean i i think that would be you'd be very very hard-pressed to do that because you you would have torrential diarrhea like you would just naturally not want to get to that state and you certainly wouldn't want to maintain it uh because most of the stuff would be overflowing and you would be uh in you know disaster pants territory so um someone's having leg cramps after six months what i recommend yeah usually quite often it's it's uh dehydration as opposed to lack of electrolytes um you know when people go to tropics and they're sweating a lot they can lose some electrolytes they can also lose water and not drink enough water and you can get a lot of leg cramps i you know when i was playing you know a lot of sports and things like that when i was getting leg cramps and calf cramps it was when i wasn't hydrated enough and it was getting hydrated that that did did the business and people say like oh they put some salt in water and then they drink a bunch of water with salt in it and i've always wondered myself as like is it the water is it the salt and i i really think that it's a lot more likely to do with the water you can get you can get cramps with you know things like magnesium deficiencies um you know possibly some potassium deficiencies but like these these deficiencies like you know like potassium deficiencies like you get like major heart problems you know um that's the main problem with with potassium deficiencies when we see that in the hospital when people have low potassium like actually clinically low potassium um you know their main presenting feature is not crazy leg cramps you know it's it's heart arrhythmias you know so you know that that's that's normally more typically what you see so i i just you know i'm inclined to think that it's more to do what's usually more to do with with a low um too low water intake you know and a lot of people will be taking a lot of supplements a lot of electrolytes and and then they're still getting cramps oh what can i do do i need to take more and it's like well you know you're throwing good money after bad you know um you've already tried that you've already tried correcting your electrolytes and it didn't work okay now try something else because it's not working so i would suggest that so you can you can try you know getting it like you're going to have enough magnesium you're going to have enough potassium you're going to have enough sodium if you're eating a pure carnivore diet so generally the problem is going to be uh the water so i would try that so any thoughts for the x3 better than standard weights um it's it is better for standard than standard weights in certain in certain regards such as um you're working until failure you know quite often with standard weights you really have to you have to you do your lift and you have to do a drop set where you have as let's say you're you're benching whatever you bench and and then you you know drop a plate off that and you keep benching until you can't anymore and then you drop a little plate off that and you keep going and then you keep going you keep going you keep going until you're down to the bar and you're just struggling to get that thing up that is actually working that muscle group to failure um and it's it's a bit difficult to do that you can do that or you know or just just doing as many uh of your heavier lift and then just doing push-ups until you're exhausted uh that that can that can be done as well just like burnout sets um this is really good at burning you out uh the x3 is really good at burning you out just on its own and so that's because you know as you know the whole idea is it's variable resistance right so when you're when you're um you know contracting your muscle if you're if your muscles is is not contracted it's extended out um the actin fibers how your muscles work um when you get down to a molecular level is you have these little teeth that run up and down the muscle fibers and you've just you've just got you know billions of these things stacked up on each other and and so those actions it's not just two of these things there's like you know every you know couple you know nanometers there's another one of these things and so when you're more contracted you have more actin fibers bound and ready to go so they're stronger right so you're you're just physiologically stronger at your peak contraction because you've shortened your muscles because of that so you know the shorter your muscle is the stronger it is and and this is also like priming your muscles by sort of getting those actin fibers bunched up and ready to go so you have like 70 actin engaged already and then you can bam hit this hard contraction uh that's better this is why people actually arguing that stretching is a bad idea because you're you're pulling this away and you're stretching these these actin fibers off each other and now you've only gotten you know 20 of these things engaged so now your your engage is going to be much much weaker so when you're doing variable resistance like the bands are or like if you put like your heavy chains with like these big heavy links on like you know a bench or a squat rack so that you know as you go down it gets lighter and as you come up it gets heavier it's um it's going to put more you know resistance on on your your muscles when they're stronger because you know you can you can hold like a bench out here you can just hold it there for a lot longer than you could you know pull it down and and and then try to get it off your chest you come down you go like oh god i'm stuck and you need help to getting it off and then after you get up for a bit then you can sort of keep going uh that's because when you're when you're here and your muscles are stretched out you know you just you're just weaker you don't have as much engaged acting fibers and so you know you're not going to get as strong of a contraction so you need to pick a weight that's going to be light enough that you can do it at your weakest point right you're only as strong as your weakest link and with the the bands it's lighter when you're weaker and it's more resistance when you're stronger and so this matches your your strength resistance curve strength and resistance curves match up so you're able to you sort of burn yourself out at every level and and you do you get burnt out and then you sort of you get you can't quite go all the way because it's like 700 pounds 750 pounds of pressure something like that way out at the peak and then so obviously you can't do that you're only getting it to 650 and then 600 and then 400 and then 300 and 100 and you just can't you can't budge an inch and so that that's what i find is pretty good about it i spoke with with dr jayquish just last week which i'll be publishing soon he um you know i asked someone okay well what about what about doing more than one set with this and you say you don't really need to because you're stimulating this growth cycle in fact you know if you keep doing more you'll actually damage uh the muscles that actually um diminish your growth and diminish your results so you actually just want to do it hit the sweet spot and then let your body let your body grow and recover you know it's this stimulates a 30 36 hour growth and recovery cycle and then so you do this 48 hours later you know two days later every other day and and so you're just hitting growth cycle after growth cycle after growth cycle on these muscles and obviously you're alternating muscle groups so you have two different workouts on different days you're hitting different muscle groups and so um i see my x3 poster in the background yeah so that's that's where i put it and that's where i sort of just work out just right there in my my living room and so i i do like it um we'll see the sort of the results i get i i still like going to the gym just because um like i say you know when i'm working out when i'm doing things i just feel better and so i kind of like doing like a big workout and just like staying there for an hour or two or really three or four and and then just just go into town i just it just i just feel good and i can oh i you know i don't know i'm still the jury's out for me on whether or not you know one uh set of the x3 is um is all is all i need or or or all i want to do because like i just recover so much quicker you know and i can do so much more like i can i i tell people this you know they usually don't believe me but i did you know when i was testing this out because i couldn't get myself sore i couldn't wear my muscles out you know i did i did uh 32 sets of heavy legs over the course of like four hours and like i couldn't wear out my legs and i wasn't sore the next day and i wasn't you know and then i went to rugby practice and i hiked up uh you know a big big steep uh hike in washington state uh called mount sai which is a miserable hike to do i don't recommend it to anyone it's awful it's just switchbacks just switchbacks all the way up you know and it's just it's awful it's a big view at the top but like i don't know not worth it but like um did all that and my legs felt great i couldn't wear them out and i wasn't getting sore i'm like wow that's crazy so that is not something i would have been able to do on a normal diet just absolutely not i would have been crippled and sore and anguished for weeks after something like that which i have done and i was and so you know it's not um you know those those experiments and those studies have been done for you know normal humans who are not eating the proper diet and they're they're eating things that are curtailing their body's recovery so that's actually something that i'll have to you know uh ask jaquish about uh the next time um we speak well the third time we speak because you know i'll be publishing our second talk soon the third time i speak i'll try and pick his brain about that and maybe or maybe you know offline sort of talk to him about that and see if we can sort of run some you know carnivore you know type experiments to see like hey if you're eating if you're eating optimally you actually you can do you can do things differently um but in any case i'm just i i do really like it as well because it's it's super convenient and right i i was working out regularly for a few months up until probably november of last year and and actually quite regularly so i was weighing 240 pounds i was able to maintain that with how i was working out and how how much i was eating i really didn't have enough time to work out more than that and get heavier that was sort of where i settled down and then after that i wasn't able to really work out more than really really once a month and i was still i still look like i work out every day but i wasn't and i would you know my weight reflected that as well because i dropped down to like 220 um and so i just don't have the same muscle mass i'm like 225 now i don't have the same muscle mass that that i did when i'm working out you know every day and so you know i just this is just because of time i just don't have the time to just go in there and work out every day and then that sucks and so this allows me to just do just like a 10 15 minute workout and i'm actually getting it done and so it's it's um for me it's it's uh very good from that standpoint as well because it's very convenient i'm getting it thought i'm i'm actually feeling better you know deadlifts you know i've bad lower back uh problems that are much better now that i'm a carnivores when i eat any carbohydrates my back isn't just agony like it's literally like very difficult for me to get out of bed if i have any any any grains or carbohydrates because my back is just in so much pain now i have i mean i i guess i can i can notice that my lower back feels different than other things and when i'm doing things it makes a bit more strain because it's not as strong because i you know avoid things with it because it's not as as comfortable to do with my lower back but now that i've been doing these things it actually puts a lot of a lot of tension on your lower back for a lot of the different exercises so now i've been forced to strengthen my lower back which has really helped and i've gotten a lot better at these lifts as a result of it and my back has gotten better as a result of it so i've i i'm seeing positive things from it and there are definitely a lot of positive things to take away from it especially you're you're hitting your your strength curve better you're going to get a deeper burnout it's like can be a lot easier to burn out as well which i tell everybody that is that is the secret to getting uh good results is working to failure burning yourself out going until you absolutely cannot go anymore and that is is very easily done with well it's not easily done but it's more easily done with with this but it hurts okay so you have to like you have to have some grit because like it really starts to get painful and you start just going okay yeah all right this is getting painful i want to stop but in fact you can actually keep going and uh because you're always keeping tension on so you're not sort of resting the top you're not resting at the bottom okay so you're building up a lot of lactic acid and you are you know and and you're going to feel it and long before your muscles give out you will want to give up because it's it it's a very deep burn but you keep going because that's what you do if you want to get the best results and and if you can do that you will find that you're like okay wow yeah i really worked that muscle group out well so i would i would try that um okay how long have i been obviously asking other people how they use they say they like the x3 which is good um [Music] okay if i was a dog which kind of dog would i be suspected timberwolf yeah or a direwolf i don't know um but uh i don't know my dog was a was a yellow lab and that was that's always my favorite she's a very very sweet little girl but tough as nails man she was like the most darling dog but she was a badass and we got her from from the pound so obviously she had some difficulties i don't we don't know why she was in the pan because she was so well behaved she was so well trained she had the sweetest personality it's like who would ever give up that dog like that dog is is a dog that you would just cherish and we certainly did cherish her and but she did not like adult men she did not like adult men and she did not like other dogs oh my god did she hate other dogs and so she obviously had some experiences maybe in the pound maybe elsewhere maybe the dog catcher was was really rough with her maybe former owner was really rough with her but you know we brought her home she was great with everyone except my dad she was just like oh that growling him my dad was just like because we didn't even tell my dad we were getting a dog my mom just uh just ambushed him with it uh we just were going around looking at dogs at the pound and my mom just i thank god she saw this dog and recognized just not what it just a sweet you know soul she had and we were looking at like you know this like this pit bull and this this dopey looking rottweiler and and like oh yeah these are the ones we want my mom was like nope this is the one we're getting and we're all just kind of like one of these other ones and she's like no no this one had eyes that looked at me and i knew this was the one and just like right away it was just like this is the best damn dog that i've ever seen in my life and uh but she did not like adult men she was my dad just comes home there's this dog and he was really against getting dogs and then all of a sudden he's there's his dog and also the dog hates him he's just pissed but um you know that that came around she was able to you know get over whatever trauma that she had in her past and you know obviously loved my dad and and uh and was okay with uh people after that uh never got over the dogs thing holy god yeah so whenever there was a dog we lived in in place called bridal trails at kirkland where there are a lot of you know horses and there's a horse barn and things like that people go up in the woods past our house a lot of them would bring their dogs and they said we'd come wandering around when they came into our into our property in our yard my dog would just lose it and she would just freak out me barking at the window and just go booking downstairs to the front door and just like you start whining and barking and looking at me like you know please god open the door please oh gosh please and it was just like it was heartbreaking to see her in so much distress and like i knew she wanted to go out to go like beat up these dogs so i'm like oh god okay but she wouldn't just go up and attack him she had the meanest stare down i have ever seen in my entire life and so she was like a you know 60 70 pound you know medium sized yellow lab and she would just go up to like you know male rottweilers and german shepherds that were like well taller than her and she would run straight up to them and stick her eye on their eye i've never seen anything like it it was amazing it was just this eye just right in their face and you just see them just go and they would move and she'd move with them she's like and just you just have this eye like on their eye like what the hell are you doing here and it was and that everything i never saw a single one that didn't just break and run like they were just like don't just get the hell out of here and the one time there was actually a full-grown rottweiler and a full-grown uh you know male german shepherd she goes bolting out there and just goes right up to the german shepherd which is the bigger of the two and just bang right on his eye and he's just like and the rottweiler's just like the hell is going on here and and so she just was doing that that stared down thing and also both of them just broke and just got the hell out of there she just chased him off off the the property and you know i saw him it was like these two big male dogs i was like okay i was like you know her name was toby i was like oh toby like i don't know i don't know if this is a good idea like i mean she was just she was just just like you know you have to let me out and so i was like all right well i'll go out with you and like we're just both going to have to fight these dogs you know because i'm not going to let them hurt my dog didn't need to it did it just did never even came to that i never even got close to them you know they were gone long before i even you know you know got 10 feet out of the door so um but yeah so she was she was a great dog so i i don't know i'd be i'd be i'd be that kind of dog i think but um maybe not old yeller i mean the other before you got gravies anyway and um all right so let's see there are a couple other ones um what is the sword that i have in my apartment that is uh katana from the uh tokyo samurai museum they make those custom so they um i don't know how traditional it is or anything like that it's probably just not really um uh 100 percent sort of traditionally made it's just uh probably a replica but it's pretty badass and it's a replica of like uh i don't know some like shogun sword of like in the 1400s or something like that so it's a replica of that um i don't know what sort of alloy they use um but it is something that says you know this is this is for display only not for sharpening and like obviously like if you're gonna have a sword i mean you should you know should probably sharpen it so i'm actually debating whether or not to do that or maybe it could be just like sort of like a a much lighter alloy that really wouldn't wouldn't take a good edge and probably would would ruin it if you tried to sharpen it i don't know that's what sort of uh made me hesitate to do it um so far but i'm still sort of thinking like if i have a sword i should probably you know probably be a real sword i don't know how the australian government would take to that they probably would not like that there was actually a story about a guy last year who was at home and someone broke into his house while he was there and he had like a samurai sword that was like maybe sharpened or whatever but he had one and he just pulls it off and he's like charging the guy i was like oh jesus and like runs out of there so a guy chases him out of the house with his samurai sword and uh and then like caught him and like hacked him up and like actually like killed the guy and they were like they arrested me like no you can't that's no you can't do that you can't like chase the guy down to kill him you know like he was in the house he chased him out fine but you know you've gone too far so he ended up getting uh in big trouble i think he actually may have killed the guy or at least at least seriously harmed him um with his sword so you know but uh you know i think that's like you know just like pulp fiction style you know someone comes in your house right you know meaning you ill and you pull out a samurai sword there's just that's gonna that's gonna change some things in their head um [Music] let me see here if i could pick up a new skill in an instant what would it be uh probably a piano i would i would really love to learn the piano i love the piano i took piano lessons as a kid um from a really really good um [Music] uh teacher and it was uh katinka danielle and she was actually like a you know her and her husband were very famous pianists they were from hungary they got caught behind the iron curtain after world war ii um and part of the soviet soviet state she was in the soviet she was she was in hungary and her husband was like touring off in england and so he escaped and they basically the soviets kept her and the kids you know and said like if you don't come back and because they wanted to promote all these like oh look at these these soviet pianists and gymnasts and all these sorts of things look how much better our system is than yours and so they were like they say hey we have your family you better come back here and do and and be part of our program and you know they decide like no no you stay away there's no point in you coming back you know and have us all trapped and so it was like you know several years that there was trapped back there and then eventually she escaped but she she like trained the the previous like you know um you know grandson of the previous emperor of the of the hungarian empire before that you know became a vassal state of the soviets but um so she was very very good and i just loved it i love the piano my favorite pianist is marie pariah if that's pronouncing that right and i just i i think he does mozart better than anybody else i think it's just like like i remember i was studying for my my usmles back in you know after my second year medical school and i was just in the summer and i asked my mom for a bunch of different classical tapes because she was a classical soprano she sang professionally and then gave that up for uh to have a family because she didn't want to be away from a family she wanted to be there with her kids and her husband and i had an amazing absolutely amazing voice my mom and still does and as though she doesn't doesn't sing that often anymore which is a shame and um so i asked her for a lot of like really good pieces that i could have like sort of going in the background while i was studying and and she gave me a whole bunch of different things and one of them was murray pariah's um doing mozart's fifth piano concerto and the third movement of that i could just it just something about it just snapped me away from studying and i just like turned around like actually stared at my speakers and it was just like it just just did something to me like it was just like the first time i'd actually heard music you know and it was just it just really really uh was just amazing it's still my favorite favorite piece and and his his version of that is definitely my favorite piece with like the english chamber orchestra i believe um absolutely amazing i just bought his uh complete works of mozart um all the piano concertos by him and the and the english chamber orchestra i think and so if i could if i could sort of snap have that i would absolutely want to play because i that that's something that i do plan to do is you know learn how to play piano so that i can play those pieces that is what i would really like to do if i'm not eating beef what am i eating other beef usually sometimes i'll have eggs and [Music] some will have pork uh that's that's main ones really yeah it's really you know you know like you know 97 98 of what i eat is is gonna be beef and then you know every now and then i'll have some pork bellies or i don't know sometimes lamb um and uh and eggs i'll do eggs as well but the vast majority of what i eat is is beef yeah but you know chicken's fine just you know you want to get dark meat like chicken thighs with the skin on um you know i'm not in the camp of you know avoiding you know chicken and pork because they have you know you know a different compliment of polyunsaturated fats you know it's it's likely you know it's probably gonna that's gonna have more to do with what the animal's eating itself if you get like just a you know naturally raised uh chicken or pig it's gonna have a better complement of of fats anyway but look it's it's it's it's at least it's muscle and it's at least it's animal at least it's animal fat animal proteins and so you're already doing a lot better than than everybody else on earth so you know and you're not eating all the other plant toxins that are just going to screw you up so i if you if you like chicken if you like fish if you like beef if you like whatever you like just it's fine just eat it you know i i noticed that i feel the best on beef and i feel the best best on grass finished older cows that have only eaten grass for you know the entire 10 years 15 years of its life i feel way better on those and i love that harder to get so you know grain finished beef is just fine uh for me and i feel better on that than i would on eggs than i would on uh bacon or pork or whatever so that's that's what i do but whatever whatever you like whatever you enjoy and you'll start noticing how you feel on different things and you'll make adjustments accordingly uh and that's fine uh but as long as you're not eating plants you're going to be in a good stead and getting enough fat as well um let's see how many pounds of beef do i eat in a day generally like two to three if i'm working out it can be double that or you know use like four or five um if i'm working out heavily yeah definitely like five pounds of beef uh fatty very fatty so that's a high high calorie intake you know as i tell people if you get you know a pound of you know 100 lean ground beef and you get a pound of 50 50 lean to fat ground beef though the 50 50 meat will have three times the calories and nutrition far more nutrition because you know there's certain nutrients in fat that you can't get from lean beef but you'll get you know three times calories and so uh you will just have to eat less pounds of food in order to get the same amount of calories that your body wants and also the nutrition you have to eat you have to get that nutrition you have to get those essential fatty acids as well um so that's that's what i do so if it's you know getting very fatty if i if i'm eating more lean like i will want to eat more i'll eat eat like twice as much because you know i need that to get the you know the calories and nutrition that that my body wants and so if i'm eating leaner beef i find that i eat a lot more uh during the day so it does also depend on how fat it is how do i feel about shrimp i feel very affectionate towards shrimp they're good they're good food source i mean they're not as necessarily as fatty but there's decent amount of fat and you can add butter to them which makes them taste awesome and you can make uh you know yeah just a bunch of you know shrimp and and sort of melt some butter into it sort of mix all that together so you have this sort of dripping butter all over it tastes great um so yeah so i'll add that in sometimes just for for fun but like going through and i'm doing a shop or whatever and i just see like a big bag of prawns or whatever and i'm just like yeah that actually looks good maybe i'll get that and so i do that every now and then but but not all that often uh let's see if i had a time machine would i go back in time or into the future probably in back in time it'd be cool to see the future obviously and by the time we get time machines if we ever get time machines you're going to be in the future so you sort of have an idea of what's going on but um you know it'd be good it'd be nice to check out and see what the hell is going on and sort of get some ideas and maybe you know see who the next hitler is and just you know just take care of that before it becomes a problem um but also when you go back you know what you're going back into you know you know the philosophies you know the culture you know the uh the laws and the and the the sort of the the climate um you know it's uh it would be interesting it'd be interesting to go back and see these you know different uh historical societies and civilizations and you know even america before the the federal government was so intrusive and oppressive and and you know taxed you know that six months of your life uh your your slaving to the government you know that was the thing you know back in back the day before you know um the federal government really grew uh uh into the proportions that it is now and grew out of proportion uh that it's um that all your taxes and all your duties and all these sorts of things people on average had to work six days of their of their years six days of their work went to the government went to taxes now if you think about it it's it's well over 50 percent for most people and and at least 50 for a lot of people so you're at a conservative estimate six months of your life you are just working for the government you're a slave to the government and you you six months of your life just goes to the government so half of your life is being taken by the government and then you're still getting taxed even after you stop working and then you die they tax that more and they do estate tax all these sorts of things so it's a pretty nasty system i think and so i think it would be nice to see you know a system where that doesn't do that you know maybe this is why you know you know dubai is becoming more and more uh popular and places like singapore is uh uh you know uh doing so well is because they're they're not trying to rip people off and they're just letting people do their thing because the whole point of a government is to help people prosper and to keep them safe so that they can prosper whereas now and most but yeah but most governments ever have been about power control and tyranny and so you know we we sort of popped away from that with the american experiment american experiment of self-governance of liberty people of the government just protecting your rights protecting your property and um and uh and allowing you to just get on with your life we found that you know it's you know unlimited prosperity of even you know the meanest person they can they can all prosper they can all flourish and of course you know as jefferson said the nature of government is to grow and for liberty yield and and that's what we're seeing you know so people are getting you know power hungry again and or more to the point this you know they are that the system is is attracting more power hungry people because before when the government really didn't have any power or control there was no there's no power control to sell and so you know um you know so they didn't really attract those kinds of people now there's a lot of power there's a lot of control there's a lot of money and so they can sell themselves to the highest bidder it's very easy to do that so it's attracting those types of people unfortunately so that's it would be nice to see what it was like you know when it wasn't like that obviously there were other problems there's you know abhorrent racism and even slavery which is this is just appalling and obviously you wouldn't want that um that would not be a nice thing to see and so i have mixed feelings about about that but the the system of you know governance was was a lot uh nicer i think um okay uh saying thank you uh for answering questions and having access well thank you i i hope you guys liked it and um i think that's pretty much all the questions that i have pre-arranged um [Music] and um [Music] so if other people have any questions we can sort of uh do those um or any little comments or anything like that people had uh we could do that or sort of just sort of hour and 20 minutes now or so um but yeah thanks so much for opportunity to have this q a definitely helps encourage and motivate me and many others okay well good well and thank you for that i'm glad that that's helped that's the whole point of doing this is is to sort of help people out and keep them encouraged [Music] watch a recent dr berry video we drank six raw eggs every morning blended with a ninja surprisingly it's not been as bad as we thought blended eggs are better than than whole yolked eggs whole yolked eggs are big like gross as far as uh the texture is concerned just you're just just swallowing just lumps of snot and it's just you know it's not not really great but if you break up those yolks and blend them up it just it tastes like cold scrambled eggs i mean and as it should it's eggs right but but you know it tastes a lot better than you would think it would especially with that so okay um well there's no more questions uh everyone uh thank you very much um for joining this sorry for the the last minute uh nature of it um was just sort of something i was just sort of thinking about last last little while of getting these going obviously um now that uh that people are sort of joining all the patreon i want i want to sort of be more active with that and and and provide everything that i i promise people because that's uh that's the whole point and so and then getting more active with everyone and and doing these live uh live chats and live q as and then you know zoom meetings for uh those in the sort of second tier and above um then uh we can sort of start doing more of these i will start doing i think i'm going to start doing the the zoom meetings with the tier two and above sort of in sunday mornings perth time which would be sort of late afternoon early evening uh in america uh whether you're on the west coast or the east coast and that and probably you know latest hell uh in in the uk and europe so i'm sorry about that um but we can we can also adjust these things and so if there are a lot of people saying oh that time really doesn't work for me can we do this other time then i'm happy to adjust if i if if and when i can because you know some things i am limited by uh with work but that's what i'm thinking i'm thinking sort of sunday mornings i generally have sundays off um i do work six days a week no matter what um and so i've been i'm in the hospital five days a week and then doing on calls at certain nights and then working the whole weekend sometimes uh with with the hospital and no matter what i'm working saturdays uh in the functional medicine clinic doing metabolic health so uh sundays are a good day for me and so if that's a good day for other people then we can do that uh and what's my cooking channel called that's called uh kitchen carnivore um which you're gonna be adding more stuff to soon i have we have other videos and cooking things that um we have ready and we just need to sort of just get them uploaded and get them ready to go and so we'll we'll be doing that too all right guys thank you very much i hope to be doing these regularly we will be doing zoom calls um regularly starting on sundays starting sort of next sunday and then we'll go from there and we'll do these live streams sort of when i can fit them in as well and so we'll try to try to um publicize those a bit more ahead of time so that people have some warning and can and can uh you know be available if they want to be available and i think that's it let's just say that's it all right i forgot whatever else i was going to say but yeah so alright everyone uh thank you very much and i'll see you next time you"
