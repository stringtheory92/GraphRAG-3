    "transcript": "no I don't I don't think there's any reason not to try carnivore I think there's many reasons to try carnivore I think that's going to be healthy as for her regardless of her situation um just because she's human and you know meat is still the best thing for Lions regardless of their medical situation generally it's even better for lions that have medical conditions because you obviously don't want to be feeding them things that they're not designed for their body body has more of Trouble with um when they're in times of stress and cancer is certainly one of those times okay hello thank you everyone for joining uh today's the Live for November 16th in America 17th in Australia so thanks everyone for joining on uh I have about an hour and a half today and so hopefully we can get to a lot of your questions um and and then I gotta go uh we'll start off with one that sort of came in earlier so you know we announced this a while ago so so people have been able to um put in chats and things like that so this is a Super Chat that actually came in uh much earlier so even yesterday so this is from Marius patre uh thank you very much for the Super Chat he says on a four-month carnivore diet with great results that's good recent blood tests high cholesterol HDL 68 LDL 271 uh hypertension of 160 over 110 unmedicated 130 over 70 on X Forge cardiologist suggest cholesterol Med your advice well the cholesterol medications I mean that's um that's something that you're going to have to sort of figure out with your doctor but I would look at different resources such as uh Dr asra's book uh Statin free life and he goes through the statistics and the data from the drug compan talking about how much of an effect this has on people's life so for instance according to the drug companies their own studies this is the best that it's ever going to get that if you have had a heart attack and you go on statens for at least five years and you stay on it long term that you will extend your life by five days on average five days on average okay so that's an improvement isn't it so some people will gain an improvement is it a marked improvement not necessarily but if you've had a heart attack and you stay on it long term then you might see this this five-day benefit on average if you have not had a heart attack you really don't get any extension in life maybe up to a couple days at most but that's that's not something that that would really wow a lot of people and so obviously those aren't the statistics that they put out there they say uh different sorts of things like oh this reduces your risk by 46% or whatever it is and uh that's that's um you know that's relative risk it's not it's not actual um you know the total risk so you know there's it's a it's a small percentage of people and that drops it very slightly in that percentage of people but like the total risk reduction is like less than a percent um according to the data that we have currently so is that something that's going to benefit you I don't know that could be something that you your your doctor might think is beneficial to you however we need to also think about what statin do how they lower cholesterol and what what that mechanism is they stop your body from making large buyant LDL molec so even if you have the small dense sorry if you have small dense LDL molecules it's not going to help with that it's going to stop you from making the large buoyant uh LDL molecules which are beneficial and these are the ones your body makes and they make them on purpose because you need them and so this stops your body and your brain for making these and I think that that can be detrimental um in many cases so you have to sort of wonder about that your HDL is great you didn't say your triglycerides but they're probably good too that's a that's a marker of metabolic health I don't think that we can really look at cholesterol as a as a clear marker of heart disease because it's not a very strong marker of heart disease even the small dense LDL molecules U being high it only increases your your risk by about you know 1.7 times okay so that's an increased risk but metabolic syndrome increases it by six times Diabetes by 10 times and the same things that you would do to address metabolic syndrome and diabetes namely high fat corn diet with no carbohydrates you know ketogenic diets have been proven to reverse type two diabetes and I've seen this in person many many many times doing that will will uh improve your sdldl as well you'll have less of that you'll have more of the large buoyant ones and as LDL was really never a marker of heart disease in the first place it was a scapegoat by the sugar companies that's a fact you know we have that on record from the sugar companies that they they lied and misled people for decades still doing it probably um although that that machine is just moving now and now the drug companies are into it and they sell statins and it's the highest grossing uh drug that they've ever put on the market I believe um you know they're not going to stop pushing this angle anytime soon you know they're not going to say oh hey look we got it wrong you never needed stattin in the first place so we'll just we'll just dump our best-selling drug ever um and and try something else they will never do that um they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to never do that and even if it even if it's um they're selling a product that doesn't help anybody or maybe even hurts people they're they're going to be financially incentivized to keep pushing it and I believe that's this that's where we are now and so I personally don't uh think that that we need to address cholesterol for heart disease I don't I don't think that's a thing because it was never a thing you know it was a scapegoat and so if we know that that this was all based on a false premise why why are we still worried about it I don't think we need to be I don't think we should be I'm personally not if your HDL is high your triglycerides are low you're metabolically healthy that's the only thing that's the only thing I care about when I look at uh you know my own cholesterol and LDL and total cholesterol these both been associated in large studies with with longevity right and these are associative studies but every study that came out negative against LDL and cholesterol were all associative studies too and they were doctored and forged and fraudulent most of these things right so you know you really it's not something that I worry about anyway but you can look at my video uh called the truth about uh cholesterol and heart disease I think that that goes into a lot of the arguments and the studies and the data that show that this isn't really something that we should we should worry about the way that they're making us and then um my interview with Dr Asim hotra where he talks about you know Statin and things like that how they're really not necessarily all that cracked all you know cracked up um all that cracked up a Jesus what is that saying I'm so Tongue Tied today um you know it's it's not what they said it was so you know uh that's what I would do I I would take a look at that and then make a personal decision because of course at the end of the day you know everyone has their individual circumstances you know there are people that gain five days out of this on average so going g a little more than that but it's not a great recovery maybe some people are going to be help more than others but why is that it's probably not because the cholesterol is being lowered it's more likely to do with the fact that have a small anti-inflammatory effect like an aspirin but an aspirin has a has a better anti-inflammatory effect which is why uh people take aspirin and it can and it can help in in a number of ways so those are sort of my thoughts on that but I would I would definitely look into it more so that you can make an informed decision on your health and not just blindly go into one thing or the other as far as hypertension stay on your medication until such time that you you can come off your medication um most people will reduce the amount of of blood pressure medications that they're on most will you know and a lot of those people will actually come off completely some won't you know other causes of high blood pressure apart from uh insulin resistance and and high insulin um levels so you know just just remember that and um sometimes you need to investigate for that but um I would at least stay on your medication until such times that that that lowers down and that you don't need or want to be on it because obviously you can get blood pressure that's too low and that's dangerous as well so good luck with that um so a question from uh Lara Leon please can we chat about my 14-year-old daughter lime and Grandma seizures sure we we definitely can I mean a lot of people have improved their Lyme disease with a carnivore diet and U and that that has been really nice to see people having chronic lyme disease for years and years I just had a had a lady Angela on my podcast and she had line for 30 years it was undiagnosed for a long time and then then came diagnosed and um she a lot of problems from that and was able to reverse that or at least treat it and significantly improve it with a carnivore diet and you know still in the process of that and then grandall seizures we have a hundred years of evidence on ketogenic diets carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet I you know if you you should be anyway and that that has been shown to improve outcomes with seizures especially in pediatric populations so I think that's something something that's very important to consider and to include in any uh epilepsy treatment model it's not good enough to just throw drugs at it I mean that might fix the problem or not fix the problem but it might address the problem and stop the seizures from happening but if you can address this with Med with without medication if you can address this with with uh your just dietary interventions that are going to improve for health in other ways as well is going to be in KET so her brain is going to get more ketones and her brain is going to be able to grow and develop better so I mean that's a benefit and the something is happening with our brain chemistry something is happening with the energy Dynamics in our brain when in ketosis that that we don't have seizures at nearly the rate that we do otherwise for most people so that's something that I think you you start with and if that's not enough then you move on to uh adding in Pharmaceuticals you don't just start with Pharmaceuticals you start with diet and then you move to Pharmaceuticals if you have to most people well a lot of people I should say um will improve on a ketogenic diet this is this is in the literature for literally a hundred years and I've seen people improve more on a carnivore di because you're removing even more you know toxins and things like that that uh can can act on your brain as well and um act negatively so I think that that would be definitely something to to attempt and to try with your daughter low car blow drama had a question um a quick big thank you to Dr chaffy we are currently traveling overseas um Dawning plant pre MD cap and sharing info on this dangerously healthy way of eating called ketogenic carnivore carnivore diet cheers oh well thank you very much that's really that's really nice I hope you like the hats I think they're funny I think I think all of them are hilarious I I sort of made the shes because I thought I'd want especially like the killer broccoli one the plants are trying to kill you one I just think that's hilarious and um it's just this murderous brocking I don't know I I it cracks me up and that's and that's why um we made it but um well thank you and I hope that you're you're doing well with it so Don and J has a super chat thank you very much for that just adjust that there do your patience with CFS me get better 30 plus years with it Hashimoto and 3 months mostly meat salt not doing great some of the car Community says csfm people need carbs too is this true um no I don't I don't think that's true um I don't I don't think anyone needs cars there's no such thing as um there's no such thing as as an essential carbohydrate and if there's no ESS enal carbohydrates then you don't need them in any of these sorts of things um so so I'm assuming that CFS is chronic fatigue syndrome but I'm sort of trying to wonder what what me is um could be a lot of things sometimes sometimes it's best to just just write out everything because there's so many acronyms for different sorts of things and so if you haven't come across it because I don't you know I'm not in field of medicine so I don't I don't know all of them um I'm assuming that CFS is chronic fatigue syndrome I'm not 100% sure on what me is so maybe put that in the chat we'll try to see that but um chronic fatigue syndrome a lot of people have improved we don't know exactly what the hell causes chronic fatigue syndrome so it's hard to say exactly what's going on there Hashimoto definitely improves as well but that takes time and it's it's one of those those things that you really need to be as as strict red meat and water as possible all autoimmune issues uh react best to a strict red meat and water diet and so the closer you are to that the better you're going to do so you're sort of on a a mostly meat and salt um that's good you know that's going to be better you're going to get more nutrients and more things that your body needs and wants and that's great you're going to be excluding a lot of other things your body doesn't want your body's reacting to your body's making antibodies to potentially and that you are having a problem with that's all great but you can still react to other things and so I would I would really try to get get rid of everything just go on just a red meat and water diet only you know people call like a PKD diet like the Paleo ketogenic diet you know what our ancestors were eating 50,000 years ago I'm fully on board with that you know that's that's um Sophia Clemens um terminology PKD diet I I I argue the same thing just in a different name we should be eating what we were eating 50,000 years ago during the ice ages eat that you know eat eat you know very high quality red meat and and some organs and nothing else and if you if you do that your body's going to be uh best able to to deal with anything you're you're facing Hashimoto can take a long time and you get very tired from Hashimoto because attachs your thyroid you produce less thyroid hormone so obviously you need to be on replacement thyroid hormone potentially if your levels are are such that that that's required if you've had a diagnosis of ashimoto then you almost certainly do have depressed function of your of your thyroid so I would look into that if you're not on it already and make sure you're on the right dose um most doctors will sort of look at this and just be oh yeah you're within sort of the range so that's fine but you still feel like garbage the thing is you need tighter control than that because those reference ranges are reference ranges for the entire Community most of whom are sick most of whom have a metabolic disease most of whom are overweight or obese why are we judging ourselves against people that are you know sick and unwell and potentially elderly and and overweight that's not who you want to compare yourself to you want to compare yourself to people that are that are in the throws of Youth and and healthy they don't have health issues they don't have metabolic disease they don't suffer from obesity or or weight issues so that's what you want to compare yourself to and when you do that that's a very different range then we would normally see sort of like TSH in in most most areas and most um um places use the same uh can't remember the units but anyway the similar units like in Europe and America and Australia um most will say going up to 4.5 and your TSH is is fine and that's in the normal range because that's normal for the population but anything above two actually doubles your risk of thyroid cancer okay so that's not good now double a small number is still a small number not a lot of people get thyroid cancer but this is still showing you that your body's overstimulating your thyroid saying hey we need more of this and also you're increasing your risk so you don't want that a better range is 0.3 to 1.5 and that's what we see in people that are in their 20s and have no health issues and so that's what you really want to aim for so you want to have you want to have a better control over that you want to have uh and then you know free TSH and free T4 and reverse T3 all these things come into it so you want to be able you want to go to a doctor or clinician that that understands that understands there are different reference ranges for actual Health as opposed to just the the broad reference ranges from the lab because those are less helpful and uh and then just stick with it you've only been doing it a couple months um hashing Motors can take a long time to heal if you're doing it your red meat and water and if you're not quite doing that it's going to take a lot longer and you're not going to get the same results and Improvement so I would I would really try to just eat fatty red meat and water get a lot of fat like a gram to two grams of fat per one gram of protein so that means about 65% of the meat should be lean 35% should be the fat tissue so like if you ground bee for mints that'd be 65 35 65 lean 35 fat that that's about 2 to one grams of fat to one gram of protein that's what I would go for that's where people get the best results is with that but even when they're doing that it can take over a year or more before they get to a point of stability now is that complete resolution or is that to a point that their antibodies are down basically to nothing and their thyroid is functioning as best as it can some people get permanent damage and their thyroid never works properly again they have to be on a on some sort of thyroid supplementation but most people will will improve dramatically and they'll come way down on their um thyroid hormone demand and that's the point it's not letting it get worse and getting and and keeping it stable and improving it as much as you can Amberly question uh good morning Dr chaffy carnivore three years recently diagnosed with diverticulitis can't understand why previous sad diet genetics brother eat sad and got it same age as me coincidence uh maybe thank you uh well look you know diverticulitis just like heart disease just like a lot of things they take decades and decades and decades to build up so you know it's taught in medical school at least when I was going through that at 50 years old 50% of the population will have diverticuli diverticulosis which then can become infected and become Diverticulitis and then what your age is after that is your percentage risk of having diverticulosis so it's very very common you 880 you have an 80% chance of having it 100 it's 100% everyone everyone who's 100 has it I don't know if that's true but that's that's what's taught is that that's your percent uh risk likelihood risk of of having this so it's very common um it does come from decades and decades and Decades of of eating the wrong thing I believe and then you have it and you have dulosis and then that can become infected and that becomes Diverticulitis and so that's that's uh what you have now or or that's what you're describing now uh unless you mean diverticulosis and you don't have an infection but you have an infection then that's something that's that's superimposed on something that's been there for a long time and been developing for decades so I wouldn't worry too much about that you know the thing that we do when someone has an acute flare diverticulitis is we put them on a low residue diet we rest the bowel AKA no fiber and so don't eat things that that are you're going to have to pass and you're you're upsetting this area right so that's um that's what you're doing you know you're already on that and so you're on a good treatment you may need antibiotics you may need some more help because it is a serious issue but but I don't certainly not caused by by um a carnivore diet you know there's studies with over 2,000 people they they found that there's no connection between meat fat constipation uh and and developing diverticulosis the only connections that they found or increased fiber increased B motion so more than 15 a week which is just slightly more than two a day and and so you know there there's not even an association with meat fat and constipation and and uh and developing dulosis at least in that study so I would um you know I wouldn't I I wouldn't be uh concerned from that thing that that point of view I think if anything you know you're improving situation you're going to have a low residue diet all the time you're not going to have all these seeds and nuts and fibers going to get stuck in there and irritate and upset the diverticula and that can get those infected there you're still at risk of getting those things infected but it's uh I would I would bet that it's much lower you know I don't think we have numbers on this on different diets but I would I would bet that it's much lower because you have this low residue diet already so you're already resting the bow you're already um taking it easy you're just not giving your body more and more and more chances to to uh damage these diverticula and and cause a problem and get an infection hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own questions please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest of the Q&A okay so question rapid heartbeat on a cornivore diet and waking up at 3:00 a.m. is this comment well it's not it's not unheard of it's not exactly common it's not like most people get it but it does happen um rapid heartbeat is different than than a strong aggressive heartbeat so like not aggressive is probably the wrong word but um sometimes you get this big beat it's just oh my God I'm having palpitations because there's this very strong heartbeat well your heart preferentially runs on ketones that's its that's its primary fuel so you know it's basically like you know you know driving a NASCAR a Formula One car on on diesel and it's just like well that's not working well then you get to actually write Fuel and all of a sudden it's it's you know tearing off down the down the park so that's sort of what I think about that's how I think about it with with our heart and Ketone so when you go on a keto J and people will notice this as soon as they eat carbohydrates that slows right down okay is that a good thing though you know I I would say no I'd say you you want your your heart running on ke ketones and your brain running on ketones because that's what they're supposed to be running on they can alternatively run on glucose but that's not their preference and and I've gone into that in in other way in other uh talks you know going into why that I you know I would say that their preference because they even when they have glucose and ketones available they they don't take in the glucose they only use the ketones or primarily use the Ketone so that shows a preference that's your heart and your your brain so you can get strong beats now if you're getting rapid too fast that could be just your heart's just you know now it's gone on the Rocket Fuel and it's really happy about that or it could be something else underlying so if you're getting if you're getting um a rhythm that's that's over excuse me if you're getting a a beat that's over 100 beats per minute or you're having an irregular pattern to the Rhythm that's something you need to get an ECG EKG on depending on parts of different parts of the world I don't know why they say it's EKG or ECG I just keep it the same guys but anyway in America it's EKG elsewhere it's ECG largely and should get that checked out just make sure you don't have something underlying this isn't going to cause an arhythmia you can get your electrolytes checked and get your potassium checked and get these other things checked just to make sure but I I've really never seen that you know someone getting their potassium so low that they causes an arhythmia um but you could have something underlying it it this shouldn't you know eating what you're biologically designed to eat should not cause dysfunction at all right if anything it should be it should be undoing a lot of dysfunction waking up at 3:00 a.m. be a lot of reasons for that you want to optimize your your sleep State you want to optimize you everything around that and um and then you know use a sleep mask make sure there's no lights in the room because even just phone charging uh just little blue light phone charging that that can be enough to disturb your sleep s so using a sleep mask making sure things are very dark um you know turning off lights an hour before you want to go to sleep getting Morning Light all these things set you up to sleep well uh a lot of people will find that they don't need nearly as much sleep and so they something wakes them up and all of a sudden they're just wide awake because they got really restful sleep and some people are super lucky they don't they just don't need all that much uh sleep but I would just optimize your sleep uh sleep experience and all these different sorts of ways just to make sure that you're not getting something that can disturb you and wake you up things like that um but some people do have a bit of sleep disturbance most people actually improve their sleep I definitely improved my sleep and so that's what a lot of people do so I would I would just just keep going with it I would just you know get it tracing on the heart just to make sure that that's okay and um and then just op you know try to try to fix the the Sleep things like sleep MK things like that and hopefully that'll that'll get better SMY pirate uh thank you for the Super Chat you say we shouldn't drink a lot of milk yet we find in most cultures it was the norm to eat a lot of uh meat and milk how do we balance both of these well is going back how far I mean that's what you have to ask yourself we haven't been drinking milk all that long sort of you know 10 20,000 years something that maybe a bit more but either way it's not um you know it's not 800,000 years it's not two million years like we have been eating meat and I think that a lot you know when since the megap died out and we didn't have this super high Rich high fat uh meat available we sort of had to find other ways of getting more fat more nutrients um there is is someone who I I believe is um well incorrect in a lot of ways but it sounds like he's just intentionally misleading people um and um you know someone who who uh you know the vegans will bring on all the time talking about oh H gathers all this time oh they they they didn't actually eat that way it's like he is literally the only person saying that and he's and he's comparing things to the hodza oh look at the hodza they get they get all this you know from from plants and and honey and things like that yeah because they they were taking off their traditional land and they can't hunt big animals anymore so they're just doing what they can to survive you can't compare the hza with our ancestors who were living in the ice ages hunting mammoths I mean that's stupid um and so I don't believe this guy is stupid so that sounds like that's intentional he's intentionally trying to mislead people and he said oh well you you this whole thing about fat I mean that's ridiculous even if we were eating meat we weren't eating a bunch of fat because wild animals are so lean they don't have any fat they have barely any fat okay Native Americans eating bison they made pemin with 5050 ratio of Tallow to dried beef which is 80% calories from fat it's two grams of fat per one gram of protein tell me that how that's not a high fat diet exactly also why are you comparing hunting deer now with Mammoth 20,000 years ago 50,000 years ago 100,000 years ago a million years ago right the bigger the animal the larger the proportion of fat to body ratio did did he did no one tell him that I bet they did I bet he does know that and so he's he's comparing apples and oranges and so that's what we have to to do here and understand here is that we're sort of comparing apples and ores even though the Messiah eat milk and and drink milk and things like that that doesn't mean that we've always been drinking milk um it's just that that's what they have to do now to survive because they need they need more in the way of nutrients and nutrition and fat in particular and so if you go back to when we were eating megap there were tons of fat and we went for the fat and when those megap started getting less and less that's when we started seeing uh our ancestors start you know baking the bones and and making breaking marrow bones and cracking into them and getting at the marrow because it's like that's a that's a you know that's that's a difficult process they weren't doing that for a long time and then all of a sudden there's not enough fat and now you see them spending hours you know breaking into these bones and um you know and that that's that's that's something they didn't have to do before so that's that's the argument is is that it's because they needed more fat and they're just trying to find different ways of getting more fat and so um you know the idea that we you know just lean and all that sort of stuff like first of all were we eating plants during the Ice Ages which ones which ones grow on Ice shelves exactly and um and the idea that we were and and which ones are we still eating now which plants were round that we were eating during the ice ages 100 thousand years ago a million years ago that even exists now in our in our uh grocery stores and things like that we're not eating any plants that even existed during the last ice age we we've sort of bred them all predominantly and so you know it's just it's a really bad argument and it's a worse argument to say that um that animals are really lean like they weren't that wasn't uh that wasn't what they used to be and when that switched we started going to things like Dairy and agriculture because we had to we had to supplement our die because it what we weren't getting enough because uh we were normally getting what we need from the meapa but places like you know PL as Indians in America they're still doing just fine on the buffalo bison and um very high fat so that's my thoughts on that so lelu thank you for the Super Chat can carnivore heal nerve pain and pinch nerve in the back it uh it certainly can in some cases it can reduce the inflammation and it can reduce the pain experienced by this it's not going to decompress your nerve and so depending on how bad that is now if it's you have sort of a narrowing and it just sort of barely touches that nerve and that's that can be enough to really upset the nerve and cause a lot of pain even though it's not just smashed down um that can be enough and and and if that's the case then uh yes it certainly could help in to that extent that it could reduce the inflammation reduce the pain something like you do a steroid injection in that area reduces the inflammation reduces the pain but you know then that irritation can come back and and all that sort of stuff and then then the steroid shot wears off and the pain can come back but not it doesn't always so this sort of does that same thing this addresses the underlying cause of the inflammation and irritation and sort of settles that down now if it's if it's real compressed it's not going to it's not going to decompress that but it can it can help the inflammation side of things and I have seen people inve enough that they you know didn't necessarily need surgery or um people that have had the surgery decompressed the nerves but the nerves are just permanently damaged and they just constantly sending off this pain signal and you we do another MRI and you see like look this is completely clear maybe even do another surgery just to make sure there's nothing there that the MRI didn't pick up and they still have pain that and that unfortunately does happen and then you know you just have sort of look you have to sort of get you into like a a chronic pain clinic because you know there's no surgical option unfortunately we can't fix this those people I've seen do very well uh with a carnivore diet because that that that can reduce the inflammation and pain uh significantly because now it's it's very much decompressed and then that can help the nerve maybe heal but certainly reduce the amount of inflammation that's there for whatever whatever the mechanism people do improve does that mean everyone's going to improve probably not hopefully everyone will improve to some degree but not everybody will necessarily completely resolve it but I've seen a lot of really good um really good outcomes from that so it's definitely worth to try Super Chat from uh elmarie thank you for saying hello um hello and thank you for helping me and many others be at their best um with their health my psorasis dermatitis and restus legs are gone thank you well thank you I'm really glad to hear that it's nice to see you very sweet [Music] so super chat from Joseph 33-year old male weightlifting three to four times a week doing one meal a day so would amino acids be okay or should I consider two meals a day I do feel really good on one meal a day however I need to increase protein yeah I would just eat more yeah um I mean you can even if you want to keep it in a tight window you could it's less important on a carnivore diet or any ketogenic diet because the main thing about eating once a day or keeping within an eating window is that you're reducing the amount of insulin that your body's producing in the day so you're you're you're keeping your insulin level sort of down and and that's very good and very important for a lot of physiological mechanisms um you need insulin obviously you do but you just don't want it too high because that that can can cause harm um I would stay away from aminos um and I mean you could take protein you could do it but you you should not take anything that has flavorings artificial sweeteners or any sweeteners because those those are not going to be beneficial to you um the branch chain amino acids it's hard to find them without flavorings and sweeteners which you don't want I've I've tried them on a cornivore diet I don't I don't have nearly as good workouts I don't feel nearly as good have nearly the same energy um that I do normally and and the opposite was true when I was eating a more traditional diet I felt way better when I took the BCAAs way better and there was exactly opposite I felt worse when I when I went carnivore and tried it so I would not recommend that um there are Branch Shan amino acids that you can find that don't have flavorings and sweeteners they taste remarkably bad um you know trigger warning for people that are sort of sensitive the sort of thing but actually tasted like vomit you know that taste in your mouth after you you throw up when you're sick as a kid or or an adult um doing other things where you're you're vomiting you have that that strong acidy bile sort of taste in your mouth and it's just really awful that's what branch am amino acids tasted like without sweeteners they were bad it was really bad so um I mean you can try that if you want but you know it gave me an upset stomach just drinking drinking like that it tasted so bad that I just felt gross the rest of the day so that really didn't help me and um and you don't need it I would just eat I would eat twice a day yeah definitely you want to make sure that you're eating enough if you're if you're lifting weights and you're working out a lot and you're going to need to eat more than once a day generally I find that I generally need to eat twice a day um if I'm going to do that um and uh so yeah just give your body what it needs and you'll be fine okay so here here's a question uh from Dana uh mulax I'm sure I mispronounced that uh so question do you have any knowledge um that going carnivore can help with HPA access dysfunction I'm 16 days on because so far nothing is helping thanks um you know it depends on the on the HPA dysfunction help with certain things um it can certainly help normalize hormones in a lot of ways ketogenic diet have been shown to improve uh cortisol levels now if you're you know it depends on what what's going wrong um you know if you have if you have an injury to that area and you're pituitary and and uh um is just not producing the hormones that it needs to because there's damage you it may help recover some of that damage but depends it depends on the case depends on the person and so if you you know some people have to be on all their the different sort of hormones that their pituitary makes and their hypothalamus makes for life because of this sort of injury or surgery or some sort of uh you physical issue um and that could be the case you with with medical issues for this as well you know when you're when you're eating what your body's designed to eat you're going to work the way you're designed to work but some people can still have problems and that can certainly be HPA access dysfunction as well but it it has improved quite a lot of hormones that come through the HPA axis um if you have pan hypopituitarism you's generally reason for that and if it's if it's anything but uh dietary related then obviously there's going to be mixed results you know there's going to be other there's other things that play there you can improve cth hormone certainly because when you reduce insulin you improve your output and produ your production and and action of growth hormone because insulin High insulin levels block the secretion and action of growth hormones that's a major hormone there it can also um disrupt testosterone and estrogen and um cortisol as well so there there are people that get put on a ketogenic diet because they have too much cortisol and it actually ameliorates the the symptoms and effects of hypercortisolism um and in women if you're eating carbohydrates and your insulin is high it can cause you to produce too much testosterone and not allow you to turn that into estrogen which is normally what it does so now you have way too much testosterone not enough estrogen and that can improve as well so this can improve generally and that that's actually a major cause of PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome which is the leading cause of infertility in women so there's a lot of things that it can help depends on what your your dysfunction is you know if you have an injury to the brain in the pituitary you know it may it may only go so far but it can absolutely improve that entire access and all all the different hormones involved in that for various reasons and mechanisms at different levels you know at the pituitary level at the adrenal level at the ovaries at the testes all these sorts of things so yes it can definitely improve it depends on what the problem is though so either way it's uh it's worth a shot your body will will improve in a number of different ways and if it helps with that great okay Mike sweet thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy Mike sweet again update on um findings with my mom's diagnosis um Eartha I'm thinking urethra stage four cancer with high blood pressure low hemoglobin and low sodium I was wondering would there be a reason not to try carnivore uh well first of all I'm very sorry to hear about your mom um I hope she well I hope she I hope she's okay um that's really that's really tough getting a diagnosis like that um having those problems no I don't I don't think there's any reason not to try carnivore I think there's many reasons to try carnivore I think that's going to be healthi as for her regardless of her situation um just because she's human and you know meat is still the best thing for lions regardless of their medical situation generally it's even better for lies that have medical conditions because you obviously don't want to be feeding them things that they're not designed for their body body has more trouble with um when they're in times of stress and cancer is certainly one of those times so if you look at my video with Professor Thomas C freed um s YF r i e d you'll you'll see the mechanisms and the the canc biology um behind why professor caed and others like myself would recommend uh these dietary interventions especially when you're you're trying to uh address mondal dysfunction which is being shown to be a root cause in cancer and can help starve out the cancer because cancer cells because of their underlying dysfunction with their mitochondria nearly all cancers um they they require the cancer cells require 400 times the amount of of glucose that normal cells do and normal cells can run on ketones cancer cells really can't and so at least by and large and so I think that that's definitely something to consider I would I would watch that presentation and discussion with Professor seed and uh and go with that but no I I don't think there's any any reason not to try this I don't I can't think of any reason why it would would be a bad idea in your mom's case and I think that it would uh help her in a lot of ways and certainly make her feel better and feel healthier and hopefully improve her condition there but obviously there's no there's no guarantees and some sometimes there's U there's a point of no return that you can't even though you're doing all the right things is sort of not enough unfortunately so this isn't this isn't a cure all but it can certainly help your body improve in such ways that your body can recover from a lot of things but it's not going to recover from everything unfortunately but uh good luck to her I really hope that she does well I do hope that she gives it a try with cancer you need to be really on top of your gki glucose Ketone index so that's a ratio of your blood glucose and your blood ketones um there's a there's a there's a formula available on on Dr C Freed's uh published works on gki and how to figure that out and depending on your area and your units and uh I would do that you need to keep that below two under one if possible and you do that with combination of diet and fasting and so however you have to do that you just sort of keep that under and if you are using fasting you do have to have refeed days because you don't want people to lose too much weight because they you need food you know your body needs food so it's um but that's important that's an important side of things so that's what I would do if it were if it were me or my parents so good luck with that good luck to her Harrison thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy love your work thanks for all you do I've had a veric Casal since puberty 10 years ago have you ever heard or seen a veric Cil Improvement on Carnivore no that's interesting no I haven't um probably just because um doesn't come up all that often but uh that'd be interesting no I haven't I haven't seen that specifically improve I haven't had anybody basically tell me because a lot of these things are just people coming forward and talking about it what is interesting is um is uh different Facebook groups that have been around for 20 years 30 years some of these things uh at least 20 things like zeroing in on health and zero carb Health it's funny there was a there was a guy um I don't know what his MO is but he keeps tagging me in things and and and other sorts of people say oh this carnivore thing is just going to be the worst mistake everyone ever made and and then he's like he's like saying that we're taking all this cherry-picked anecdotal things and then his proof of that is and that people are having actually having problems with it his proof of that is literally cherry-picking you know one thing here and there from these groups he said that oh yeah I took this from a Facebook group because I was interested in it and it has hundreds of people in it and um and there's these people that are having that are having a problem okay so there's like one or two people having a problem and it's something that has hundreds of people so not the ones that have tens of thousands of people that have been doing it for 20 or 30 years and have had no problems such as you're describing um so that's literally cherry-picking and um and and it's just bit dishonest forget the je name because I don't really care but um you know this just how how these people roll really um but you can go to those the act the the Facebook groups like zering in on health and zerocarb health which have been around for for young and you can put that in you put in veric seal and carnivore diet and you should see there should be people on there and and see what they what they have um to say about that it could be that that a lot of people have had Improvement could be this one of those things that people like yeah yeah didn't really change anything which can happen you know not everything's caused you know as product of our diet so but a lot of things are so uh yeah I would check there and then uh if it does help let us know it'd be good uh good for other people too so thanks for that Julia Tilman thank you for the Super Chat I have several autoimmune disorders and had a benign brain tumor removed two years ago I've been on Carnivore four weeks down uh 21 pounds wow very good um how can I flush the contrast yeah so the contrast from uh MRIs just takes time uh it just takes time and abstinence from more contrast so so if you are on followup for your for your brain tumor benign brain tumor could be a manoma could be something else but generally this this goes for you know 20 years or so of followup and they're going to want you know galenium um uh contrast you know to go in with it uh you can refuse that you can just say look I really don't want that um there are some people that argue that you can see you know everything you need to see without contrast but it is a lot easier to uh see little points of you know growth when you have contrast um because there's contrast enhancement and so you have the things like okay well that's bigger that's smaller whatever that's a similar size but now all of a sudden there's this point of contrast enhancement that contrast is being taken up there and that could mean that that's an area that's more metabolically active and probably growing faster and and is is something to watch out for a bit more closely so that's generally why we want to use galenium but I agree it's not something that is really great for us and it can build up and it can cause problems it takes years to get out of your body if it really comes out at all um but if it does come out it takes it takes a long time so it's really just time eating properly you know not exposing yourself to different sorts of things your body you know has to have a hard time getting getting rid up and and avoiding the contrast so that's something that you're going to have to sort of figure out with your surgeon to say hey is this is this something I have to have to have they're going to say yes because that makes it easier for them but most most people will understand like this isn't really something you want to do you don't want this stuff you know having high doses of this stuff and regular galenium scans um you know too often because they they it does build up and it can cause problems so you know uh again you're the patient it's your body you get to decide so makes it a bit harder Maybe you're not you won't you'll miss some more subtle signs and that's a potential so that's a potential risk but the other side of it is you you risk the buildup of the of the contrast so um you sort of have to weigh that and make that decision um there are people like Andrew scarbo who actually wrote a book about um contrast Imaging and things like that he doesn't think you need any of this stuff um and he's got a GBM you brain tumor malignant brain tumor and um and so he he just gets it without the contrast and you can you can you can see pretty much well enough and he's been doing fine with that but uh yeah but that those are the drawbacks those those are the pros and cons you know it's like you may it may not be as as accurate may not catch more subtle signs earlier but you know you don't have the buildup as well so that's really it it's just time you got to get that out I don't I don't know of any protocols that you can get rid of that stuff but um there might be out there I just don't know of them but uh yeah good luck with that anyway bully Len swell that's the Monty Python reference uh thank you for the Super Chat greetings Dr J to your knowledge does having Hashimoto conceivably affect A1C levels and weight gain currently trying to adjust my Leo thyroxin uh dosage thanks for all you do it's it it shouldn't really affect A1c but it can certainly affect weight gain you know if you have thyroid dysfunction and you're a hypothyroid then you you can definitely put on weight certainly you can do that um Lal thyroxin you know you want you want to sort of adjust that by a your symptoms and be um be your your your blood test and you want to get again like I said earlier you want to get into a a range of your thyroid function test and your TSH that are in that optimal range not just the range that they have from the lab because most people are out of balance and so that's not helpful um also you feel that that you know your TSH is normal and your free T4 is normal most people stop there most people stop at the TSH um when they're checking this sort of thing but maybe you're not feeling as good as you want to and uh and then you check your free T4 and free T3 Lal thyroxine is T4 and that gets converted into T3 and that's what actually does the business that you want and so so some people don't convert T4 into T3 very well and so maybe they have all the T4 that they need and their TSH is is being lower because of that because of seeing the T4 but maybe your T3 is just bottomed out and you're going to feel pretty bad you're going to have hypothyroidism because that's you're not going to get the effects of the thyroid hormone that you need so you need to take something like uh slow release T3 so it's just the T3 slow release and you get that uh that level up and that's better and then there's the next stage of complexity which is reverse T3 like okay maybe you have normal serum levels of T3 but is that getting into the cell actually doing its job and we don't really have a good way of measuring that but reverse T3 is is sort of the best marker of that and so if that's elevated then that means that the T3 isn't getting in there and doing as much of a job as as your body wants so I would check the rest of that and I would uh make the judgment on with your doctor based on those lab tests and uh and and how you're feeling hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys uh thank you Dr chaffy what are your thoughts on supplementing torine and glycine I don't think you necessarily need to um and um you know you you get you get you know all that in meat you know some something like torine can be uh denatured when you cook it so if you're if you're if you're wanting to get more toine and things like that then um then just just cook less you know don't cook it as much may sear the outside leave the inside raw that sort of thing or rare and um you know I mean I haven't looked into it too closely but you know from from different people I've heard that you know toring and all these sorts things are actually really good for you and associated with a lot of positive Health outcomes and Longevity and things like that so it's good to have have you do make it is more better seems to be um but it could be that um you get you know I mean you you'll get plenty just from just from meat even if it's cooked as long as it's not like well done all the time if you just if all the meat you're cooking is well done all the time then you're probably not going to get all that much touring but I wouldn't um I wouldn't worry too much about it um just because you will get it and it's not strictly essential um but it can be conditionally essential you know if if you're not making enough of it or um or it just would improve your situation in other ways but yeah okay let me see how many we got I think probably at this point we're going to have to cap the super chats um just because um I have about half an hour we have sort of enough of these things built up that I don't want to I don't want to not not get at them so yeah all right so MSM thank you very much for the Super Chat uh female been carnivore for three days bloated bad all the time prior to carnivore met foran once a day 500 milligrams for three months no bloat 250 pound 215 pounds currently about 28% body fat so well first of all I wouldn't I wouldn't change any of your medications if you're on Metformin before I would continue taking the metformin metformin can cause GI upset um but it's um you know sounds like that you you tolerated that pretty well which is great um you know bloating is is generally relieved when you just go carnivore especially when you're getting rid of all the fiber and things like that so just make sure you know people say they go carnivore but what kind of carnivore are you doing only meat only water that's it if you're not then do that um and and just give it time you know your body your body can take time to readjust and and figure out what the hell is going on you know when you dramatically change the things that you're eating 3 days is very early I mean I give this at least 30 days to see how your body body handles it and your body deals with it so um I would just keep going with it make sure you're getting enough fat make sure you're getting enough meat in general make sure you're not eating anything else except meat and water and I think you I think you'll do well let's see here it's question from uh Laura Roselle I think she had a Super Chat that didn't get linked so here's the question um thank you for the Super Chat Laura 70-year-old female carnivore for one year 5620 pounds HDL is 113 that's fantastic LDL is 200 triglycerides are 42 but uh blood glucose never below 90 uh usually High usually 120 after eating any clues well your your blood sugar can go up a bit just with protein and it and it has insulin response as well I wouldn't worry too much you know you look at all those other things and those are all massively uh you know excellent um metabolic markers your HDL is is Hu huge it's that's amazing and triglycerides are very low I mean you have you have you know nearly triple your HDL to triglycerides so that's that's fantastic um and you know it depends on when you're you're checking your your blood sugar and all these sorts of things but I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about that uh you check your A1C you know if that's doing well if you check your fasting insulin if that's doing well you're doing well I wouldn't worry too much about about your uh specific um your specific levels of of glucose I I mean 90 is fine there's no problem with 90 going above a 100 after you've eaten that that's actually pretty normal as well I mean certainly like if you have have people eating carbohydrates going to go way above that and and then come down but um no I wouldn't worry too much about that you it looks like you're doing well and if you're feeling well and you're doing well in other ways then then that's fine mean you can also get stress levels you can get your cortisol level up if you're having a lot of stress in your life and things are a bit difficult that will raise your cortisol that will raise your your blood sugar as well and that can that can cause issues um I wouldn't think that it's causing too much uh of that though because your triglycerides are very low generally you see the triglyceride start to creep up if you are um if if you have too much glucose and you're having chronically elevated glucose and things like that so I would expect that your your glucose at other levels are F first of all under 100 it's fine um and after you eat it's going to come up a bit that's fine and so I wouldn't worry too much about that you know your your average overall is is really what we're more concerned about and your fasting insulin levels is something that we're more concerned about and um but yeah otherwise I don't think you have have um much to worry about from that it sounds like you're doing great which is good to hear uh ominus thank you very much for the Super Chat hello Dr chaffy my wife is carnivore and just had blood work done she has elevated ionized calcium and thyroid hormone she would love some advice thank you very much um elevated ionized calcium and thyroid hormone well I guess it I guess it would matter what levels I mean what they're elevated to again you know with with reference ranges they're they're generally too low because most people are low and everything um or you know things that aren't supposed to be elevated are elevated uh when they shouldn't be and so you sort of get these this imbalance of of the lab tests that aren't very accurate they aren't very helpful and so having elevated thyroid hormone I would bet you that that just means that her thyroid hormone is actually just in the level it's supposed to be you know if she has Hyer thyroidism is very elevated and she's having symptoms of that well then there could be something else going on like Graves disease or something uh but I have seen patients with Graves disease like every other autoimmune issue I've ever seen uh improve improve dramatically um so I would I would be suspicious that that that elevated thyroid hormone is really just like getting back into a more normal level and that um uh and if it's massively elevated then you just TR need to you need to start looking into things like Graves disease and those causes and other causes of hyperthyroidism um ionized calcium I I don't know necessarily why that would why that would be up I don't know if she's taking any supplements usually not advisable women that take calcium supplements I me this is one of those things that you know that that guy was talking about um with all sorts of things about saying oh oxalates aren't that big of a deal you can just take some calcium well first of all if you don't eat the oxalates in the first place you don't have to take the calcium second of all calcium supplementation in women has been shown to increase heart disease by 15% atherosclerosis by 15% so why the hell would you want to do that um so that's not a good option so ionized calcium I don't know why that would necessarily be up um unless she's taking you know supplements and things like that or or having high bone turnover but you know I wouldn't I wouldn't really expect that on a cornivore diet um so I mean you can sort of investigate that but it's not necessarily a problem I mean I don't really check for ionized calcium all that often so I don't know why that was specifically looked for so if the doctor has a suspicion on on something that's going on and that's why they checked for the calcium you know obviously good to check up with them on on why that is the thyroid hormone um it's either just her her thyroids improved and that's just higher than we normally see people because most people have have low-lying thyroid issues and this is just actually getting up into a more normal range but it could be something uh something more Sinister which would need to be investigated so um again you know a carnivore diet can help improve a lot of things but it's not going to it's not going to fix everything and so if people have underlying health conditions that are caused by something else then you know it can improve their overall situation it can make their body healthier in a lot of ways to deal with these sorts of issues but it's it's not going to help those things that aren't being caused by an inappropriate diet so getting back onto an appropriate diet doesn't fix every doesn't fix things that aren't caused by an inappropriate diet so definitely worth investigating and sort of seeing exactly where she is in the thyroid hormone uh levels and and do the rest of her thyroid panel as well if it is markedly elevated you know looking for things like Graves disease and other other sorts of especially if she's symptomatic you know with palpitations and rapid heartbeat and uh goes into atal fibrillation or something like that so check that out but I wouldn't I wouldn't see why uh carnivore di would cause any sort of dysfunction anyway in that case so um but those things would you know would do with a bit more investigation and looking into uh with her doctor common dog thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm 37 pescatarian 15 plus years heart surgery at 27 due to stenosis of root and regurgitation of bicuspid aortic valve on thinner with mechanical valve cornivore 2 months always been lean is stenosis an indicator of uh CAC not no not necessarily I mean you can get calcification of your your of your vows I don't know um specifically if that is also associated with with calcification in other parts of your body potentially um you know if you don't have the buildup of this plaque then there's nothing to calcify in the first place sort of the argument there is if you start getting you know at some point this these these plaques are going to calcify and so if you do start calcifying it means you have soft plaque already and then that's starting to calcify um but if you had um so it depends on what what the stenosis was caused by sometimes a stenosis of your valves is caused by calcification of that valve um if that's happening at 27 that's I mean there's something underlying going on there um and so I would um yeah I would wonder what that is but you can get stenosis of the of of those valves for other reasons besides calcification um easy thing to do is just check your CAC score that doesn't show you soft plaque it only shows you calcified plaque but um I don't know of uh connection between the two but there may be it depends on what the stenosis is caused by if it's calcification stenosis from calcification yeah maybe U but I I've never heard of um heard of that but I haven't looked into it either but easy enough to just check your C score Cookie Monster thank you very much for the Super Chat hi doc I'm 33 have familial hyper cholesterolemia dad had a triple bypass at age 37 was a smoker I've been recommended um pcsk9 I um can we get in touch for one-on-one what would you recommend uh well we could we can certainly do a one-on-one I have um I do make myself available for consultations I try to make everything available for free online so people don't have to to do consultations because I have I have to charge because it takes a lot of time but um you know so but if there are things that aren't being answered in my in my online things that people can access for free uh then or specific cases and things like that then then uh certainly can try and help with that um I have a link that I can put in the description here it usually is in the descriptions of these and everything else you can go down for do a um a private consultation for 60 minutes or 30 minutes there's a link for each and you can schedule that in uh but it's not cheap I you know has to I have to make this worth it to people so that that I'm only talking to people that are serious that seriously need help because I I don't have a lot of time uh to do this because I'm doing this sort of on the side of everything else and it's difficult but um you know just just for this I don't I don't think you necessarily need um a consultation I give you give you a piece of advice or my thoughts on it just now which which is familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with uh clotting disorders as well and so people that have that are more likely to have a clotting disorder and when you differentiate out between the people that have a clotting disorder and high cholesterol and the people that only have the high cholesterol it's the people that have the clotting disorder as well as the high cholesterol that have the increased rates of heart disease and heart attacks and the ones that only have the high cholesterol exactly the same as the rest of the population now your dad's a smoker obviously going to increase his risk he could have the clotting disorder definitely going to increase his risk but when you look at familial hypercholesterolemia there are increased heart attacks and things like that in the earlier decades when you get to about 50 it evens off it levels off and get to about 70 is actually lower risk for some weird reason but th those are the those are the broad population statistics and again if you separate out clotting disorder from just the high cholesterol it's really only ones with clotting disorder that are having a problem so it's not the cholesterol again thousand times it's not the cholesterol there's something else going on there and so you can get checked so you should get checked and see if you have that clotting disorder because that's a different treatment you don't treat clotting disorders by lowering your cholesterol you treat clotting disorders with you know anti-platelet therapy or anticoagulant therapy and so for that clotting disorder I don't I I don't actually know exactly what is that they get I just I just know that they get increased risk of um getting clotting disorders that you know you need to be on on an appropriate treatment for that clotting disorder and that will that will improve your your outcomes and obviously don't smoke Don't drink don't have sugar and all these other sorts of things and Seed oils and all that all that sort of stuff so I still think that a high fat carnivore diet is exactly what you want to do dietary cholesterol really doesn't affect your serum cholesterol um but if you stop eating carbohydrates if you stop eating food at all your LDL will go up so that's a metabolic difference that's not a that's not a a strictly dietary intake difference okay it's it's dietary in the sense that you change your metabolism based on what you eat but it's not that you eat cholesterol and your cholesterol goes up you stop eating altogether your cholesterol will go up so you know is so is is is fasting a a detriment to your cardiac health No in fact it's it's shown that fasting is very very helpful for many different Health outcomes so uh those are my thoughts on that I I don't think you necessarily need to to book a consultation but if you would like to uh should be down in the description of these of these and all my my videos as well but um that's what I would do I would get checked out for clocking disorder and if you do have a cling disorder I would um I would get on appropriate treatment for that and and don't smoke that's exactly what I would do okay so good luck with that Vince thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm 36 Days carnivore mostly grass-fed RI eyes when I go more than one to one gram of fat to protein um I still have diarrhea should I keep eating higher fat ratio to push it through or stick with one to one for now no stick with one: one so you know you you aim for one to one or two to one and see how much your body can take in your body's not only gonna your body has a limited capacity to absorb fat and so you know after a certain point your body's not GNA be able to absorb fat so that's fine it goes out great so it's an overflow valve so you're never going to eat too much fat because there's no such thing as too much fat in that sense because you're not going to absorb it it's very difficult for your body to absorb fat without bile so you can you can over absor absorb fat if you're taking things like ox bile but I I don't ever recommend people doing that um outside of very specific isolated um circumstances certainly not for most people so uh yeah just just eat as fatty as you can until you get soft stools and don't get diarrhea if you if you do get loose stools it's not an infection it's not a problem you're not harming yourself it's just inconvenient you know you could you know just might be just like oh God got to run so that's that's the main problem with that but it's not causing a health detriment any in any case um but yeah you just you just eat eat as much fat as your body can handle to where you're getting soft stools but not getting uh loose stools yeah that's fine turbine 215 thank you very much for the Super Chat does drinking water with your meal dilute stomach acid bile and uh deteriorating your digestive uh e efficiency uh yeah I think it does so you know you're just sort of going to water things down and it may not um be able to absorb it or digest things as well you'll probably do just fine but um some people are a bit more uh sensitive to this they have a bit of more digestive issues and so they just need to be a bit more careful and so they they just basically don't drink water for two hours before or after your meal especially if you're doing sort of one meal a day easier to do if you're doing three meals a day less less um easy but um still doable um but you know most people don't need to eat multiple times a day unless you have your gall bladder out and you need to sort of split up your fatty meals throughout the day so just do the best you can but yeah I think it does it does improve uh digestion and also it it leaves space in your stomach for meat and it may be that you're filling up physically that area of your stomach with water and now you're not getting enough meat in and so maybe you're undereating and so that's something to consider as well and especially people have had bypass surgery they definitely need to avoid water a for the for the um dilution but really for the volume uh reasons because you you need to you need to have as much volume available as possible for the meat that you're eating because you're going to be eating very small amounts because they've just butchered you unfortunately and I'm I I'm not I'm not a big fan of of um weight loss surgery I don't I don't think it's helpful maybe you know historically was well this is sort of the best thing we could do but I was always I like why are we cutting out major organs I mean like Jesus Christ you know that's not that's not the way to do this um and certainly not now I think you get mean even when you do weight loss surgery and um and and you don't address the underlying um eating habits that people have sometimes they make them worse because they can't eat anything well you just need at least 1,200 calories you just have to get it so so eat ice cream and drink sodas and just get calories in that's I mean that is just ridiculous that they would say that and i' I've heard them say that I've heard dietitians and I've heard um weight loss surgeons say that just eat whatever you have to just get the calories up  you are now someone has just come to you that you know with they had such bad issues with their weight management and control that they they've gone through this radical surgery and just chopped out and eviscerated themselves um and now you're telling them to to to make their eating habits worse what the hell is wrong with you um and people so they get worse eating habits or or they never change their eating habits right it's like OIC oh I can take OIC and I can eat whatever the hell I want okay okay for now uh and then in two years you'll gain back more weight than you ever than you lost before your body will be primed to gain more weight and metabolically less healthy weight and and you'll have even worse eating habits or you just die right which we're getting now more you know reports of people dying from taking OIC right so I mean what the hell are we doing here so it's much better to address the underlying cause of this which is just eating the wrong thing right she get better eating habits and and the problem is too that these people have tried every single diet that exists up until now you know and and they haven't had good results they've had terrible results and so okay I I just have to get surgery I guess right well no you know because you know they can do they can do a cornivore diet and not have this issue and so um anyway little bit of a of a tangent and a rant but um I think worth worth saying pure blooded Patriot thank you very much for the Super Chat day 25 arthritis gone slept all night first time in five years that's fantastic it's really good to see and um you know great to see that you're doing well keep it up uh you're just in that sweet spot now where your body's going to start really really really feeling amazing and you're going to do better and better and better as you go so I'm really excited for you um let's see here happy and healthy lifestyle thank you very much for the Super Chat uh 57y old female 5 foot1 146 lbs um total cholesterol was 277 LDL was 154 on keto carnivore for four months now total cholesterol is uh increased and LDL is increased as well doc says uh Statin now what do you say again you just fast you just stop eating those numbers are going to go up right um total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol have been seen in large population studies to actually be associated with longevity and there are a lot of studies like the Framingham study which I'm sure your doctor was taught probably the only thing your doctor was taught in medical school really the only one I was taught in medical school as far as these studies condemning cholesterol they actually show an inverse relationship between cholesterol and heart disease so the higher your cholesterol the lower your rates of heart disease and cardiac death and cardiovascular death right so when people's cholesterol went down death rate went up in the Framingham study but that was misreported by the American Heart Association which has been long bought and paid for by um you know the sugar companies and the different Industries to to push their carb fueled sugar agenda and to vilify fat so I would I would watch my video on um the truth about cholesterol and heart disease and I would watch my interview with Dr C motra um who wrote a book called The statin-free Life and then make make a an informed decision on what you want to do but that's very normal you you just stop eating entirely your cholesterol will do exactly that and um you know you stop eating carbohydrates it'll do exactly that as well because this is a metabolic issue your insulin goes down your metabolism changes and that's what changes your your LDL and total cholesterol it's not it's not eating cholesterol it's not eating saturated fat we know this from studies giving people 36 eggs a day for weeks and doesn't change their their cholesterol so dietary cholesterol really doesn't affect serum cholesterol so so what the hell is a problem I mean dog you know people get so uh you know they have two conflicting um ideas in their head at the same time they're like oh yeah dietary cholesterol um doesn't affect serum cholesterol but you need to change your diet because of your cholesterol what the hell did you just say you know you literally just said your diet your dietary cholesterol uh doesn't affect your serum cholesterol but my God you have to stop eating so much cholesterol use your damn brain or you know we can't be friends you know like this is just it's just ridiculous so I would watch those two videos and I would make make a more informed decision for yourself and even if you decide to go on it at least you're making it um at least you're making an you're doing it in an informed fashion and and that's always the the way to go always uh always learning uh thank you very much for the Super Chat hi doc have you read Peter Tia's new book outli if so do you have any thoughts about his claims about statins and cholesterol no I haven't read his book I probably should I just really don't have time uh at the moment um I have heard that he thinks that we should we should be on statens I fundamentally disagree with that um I don't think that cholesterol was a problem in the first place so I don't see why we should be trying to treat it and address it and lower it we've been lowering cholesterol with diet and um you know by giving high fiber diets which can pull out bile which can lower your cholesterol and um and um and then drugs and things like that that can do the same and all sort of stuff hasn't helped in fact the prevalence and incidence of of heart disease and um and heart attacks has gone up and it and it continues to go up right so I just don't I don't buy that and um you we've had sa for a long time it's not helping so it's not certainly helping the you know people developing heart disease and and having first-time heart attacks that is going up so if this were so helpful why isn't it helping Mark Washington thank you very much for the super sticker that's very kind of [Music] you Andy uh thank you for the Super Chat what would you say is the most convincing truth of carnivore that helps people realize it's not just a Fed what do you tell your patients I have a lot of family uh that are unconvinced thank you very much so I think the the main thing is it's just as this is our biological design and I I tell patients they say okay well what's the idea here I was like well the whole idea is that you know you go back to your biological Roots you know this is how we're designed to eat you know all animals have a biological design s cat cat tail here it looks like a rat tail but it's actually a cat tail um you know we have all animals have a biological design all animals have a species specific diet you sort of walk them through that and just say like look the same thing applies to humans humans are animals and we have a biological design you know and you can all humans are different all lions are different and if you take every single Lion on Earth and give them asparagus or gazelle you will not find a single line that does better on asparagus than gazelle because they're all lions we're all we're all humans and so it's really just pointing out that this is you know what we've been eating for 2 million years is by definition not a fat a fat is something that has only sort of flash in the pan it just sort of comes and goes two million years is not a fat you know what is a fat all the processed food crap that we're eating now because that didn't even exist 100 years ago right so that's by definition um more La a fat than anything else really plants in general that's that's a fat that's something it's a necessity that we've had to go through since agriculture because people just you know were having trouble getting enough nutrition just from hunting because the megaphon had died out and there's mass extinctions and things like that fine okay so you had to go to somewhere else but that doesn't mean that that we're biologically designed for us you just point that out and you point out that you know since agriculture you know 10,000 years ago um everywhere in the world at every time period everywhere in every example when population switched over to agriculture they had significant problems with their health and their skeletons shrank their brains shrank there you know they had all these different markers of of disease and malnutrition exactly when they switched over to agriculture right and we see this in current populations where the Native Americans and Plains Indians when they were eating just bison before we wiped out all the Bison unfortunately um they were the tallest human beings on Earth now they are not now they have a lot of these diseases and they're more likely to get diseases and on and um diabetes and cancer and heart disease and things like that they're far more likely to get that so it's um it's you know we see that right now we see that with the Messiah and the akuu Messiah eating a lot of meat and animal products akuu eating largely plants exact same disparity akuu are five inches shorter they're weaker they're more sickly they have more infections they um uh have have all sorts of problems that we see very similar to those differences and disparities um when you switch from um a hunter Society to a ga um an Agricultural Society so that's how I would point it out that this is this is bi our biological Design This is what we've been eating for 2 million years that's by definition not a fat so uh it's just that we've forgotten that we've pushed away from that and we've been in a fad now we've had The Fad diet of processed food and garbage which didn't exist that pulled us away from eating a lot of meat and predominantly meat so that's the fat it's not the meat meat always been there we've always been eating meat eating plants is new that's the new thing that's the thing that needs to be proven we've always eaten meat we've always had great health when eating meat and Better Health when eating meat so that's the norm that's the standard everything else is the fat everything else needs to be proven and they have not done [Music] so Mike sweet uh thank you for the Super Chat awesome thank you so much my parents were watching you're the best kind of person all thanks well I'm glad I'm glad that they were watching I'm glad that that helped and uh hopefully uh you all do well as a result we just sort of got um a couple more here guys and then and then I've got to run to to um run to the clinic uh Donna cfsm uh is indeed chronic fatigue syndrome okay great U instead of using medicine like Leo thyroxin is Homeopathy a good way to go for Hashimoto um I mean Homeopathy by definition is something that has you know is is there's no molecules of of anything in there besides water you take a small bit of something you put it into 50 gallon drum of water you stir it in a special way you take a drop out of that you dilute it again and stir it again and dilute it again and do all that sort of stuff and so that's the idea that you sort of get this molecular memory in the water um and then that can do something with your body now there is molecular memory in water um they sort of hold sort of a crystalline structure just by how the um you know the the the hydrogen oxygen molecules sort of form they sort of bind this is why this is a very light molecule should be gas and yet because it has this they bind to each other in a specific way sort of crystalline lattice uh it's a liquid at room temperature shouldn't be uh for that size of a molecule it should just be gaseous um none of us would be here if it were though it's very important that that it works like that um and so you can get sort of A disruption of that crystallized status so something goes in there and now it has this makes this Crystal form around it well if that is in a different form does that do anything for you maybe maybe not but it doesn't matter because when that moves away it only stays there for like a fraction of a second then it's gone so that molecular memory is not long lasting and then you drink that and you move it and you swirl it and you push it is interacting with other chemicals it just goes away anyway um so I wouldn't I wouldn't think so um the thing with with Hashim Modas is it's it's a two-prong disease a it's the autoimmune issue your body's making antibodies that are attacking your body if you have one autoimmune issue you're likely to have other autoimmune issues so you need to address that and and again the underlying issue there is it is eating the wrong thing your body reacts to it and I see people's antibodies come right down if they go onto a pure red meat and water diet and get rid of everything else they're very important um as those antibodies come down you can start getting improvements in in your thyroid but this is damaging your thyroid so you have you have direct damage to your thyroid and really the only thing for that is is replacing that thyroid hormone you need thyroid hormone it's very important it's uh it's used in every single cell in the body it's very very very vital and so if that's too low you have other problems and you can certainly be very tired from that and have low energy and other sort of symptoms as well so I would I would still take the medication I would still try to make sure that you're uh TSH is below 1.5 and your free T4 and free T3 are all in good ranges because Lal thyroxin again is T4 not everyone converts that very well into T3 so it's important to check your free T3 as well and make sure that's in a good range and if you're still having symptoms you're not feeling your best check your reverse T3 and make sure that that's not elevated sort of want that around 1 15 most people are double that triple that quadruple that and so um that can make a big difference and and for that again you you would you would get a more targeted dose of just like slow release T3 um but that's obviously something to work uh with your doctor on and if it's if your doctor's not you know that familiar with the the more you know indepth uh tests or doesn't think that they're necessary you can you can always find someone who is a bit more familiar with that and and understands a bit more that these reference ranges that we use from the lab are not useful uh in the in the slightest and so um you know seek someone out of of that description JG thank you very much for the Super Chat are there any teas that are okay to drink primarily uh for flavor other than water without negatively affecting your body um and have some added health I mean all tees are going to be from plants or going to be basically leaves leaves are you know more protected because the plant doesn't want you to eat this leaves because that's where it gets energy from right so that's why it has these tannins and Fates and um caffeine things like that these are all defensive uh defense molecules right so you want to uh try to eliminate most of that now if if you had some sort of tea that you felt you know wasn't causing too much of an issue you really light tea um then and you enjoyed that then that's fine a lot of people actually enjoy just hot water or you can make you can make bulletproof water something that my friend Serena did she goes by Serena carnivore on Instagram and she just takes the you know just hot water stick of butter in it blend it and you know just like you make Bulletproof Coffee but you're doing it with just water and you drink that so that's all creamy and nice and and smooth it's actually good and so um you can try that as well or bone broth you know that that's just a nice warm flavored drink that uh is good for you so any plant is going to come with to some degree is it all that much is it going to make a huge difference is it going to change your life you know maybe not um especially if it's a a more white tea that that's um you know as as light as possible you're just going to have less and less you know defense chemicals in there so just uh you know but just try it out you know there's going to have something in there you can try these other Alternatives that they're not really you know cutting the mustard then uh you know then and you want to use the tea and you find that that the effects it has are you know pretty minimal or or such that you you're happy taking them fine you know my mom likes tea and she's always loved tea and um and she U kept going with that for a while then she sort of came off of it for a while and then she went back on it for a while and then sort of maybe she didn't feel that on a day-to-day basis but she actually did notice that her it her oh she wasn't putting any cream or or um I mean sugar or anything like that it's just straight te it was actually it was actually affecting her blood sugar numbers you know she was diabetic and she had like perfect control and all of a sudden it's a bit it's a bit wonky so she was like oh damn it I I sort of have to avoid te I don't know how that's affecting her her blood sugar and Insulin things like that obviously something the caffeine and the different chemicals are disrupting something because there's no sugar in it right but the tea itself was was screwing with her diabetes so you know she had to come off of that again and she just sort of goes back and forth so it's it's really just up to you if you find that you're fine with it and it's not that big of a deal then that's fine but there are other options there's certainly other options that you can do and get used to I mean I I just you know drink water generally if I want something warm I drink warm water almost never do I just water's fine and um but you know if it's a cold day and you want something warm bone broth is a great option too so and they usually call that beef tea my my great-grandfather used to do that when you go to like a sporting event or something like that you have like a thermos full of just you know you know beef broth bone broth whatever and it's just beef tea and they just drink that and stay warm so that's an option too okay this will be the last one everyone um and then I'll have to have to run U Jesse riddle says Dr chaffy you are incredible only content creator that got me um to make the switch such love and respect oh well that's very sweet uh thank you very much for for that and um and I appreciate it and uh okay so that that's that's everything we got there guys um uh that wasn't really a question know that was just sort of a start when it came up but that's thank you very much Jesse that's very that's very kind of you all right everyone I've got to I've got to run uh to the clinic so I've got I've got patients coming in the next uh little while but thank you everyone um it's great to see you all um we're going to keep doing these sort of same time same day going forward um except for the next uh two weeks when I'm away um but we'll still be doing the premieres uh for the new episodes and things like that and that will be on Sundays and Wednesdays and so I'll be text chatting with everybody uh for those so please do uh show up for those and um and then we'll get the lives back going again in three weeks time and um maybe we can go for longer it just depends on work so so thanks everyone really appreciate it hope you have a great rest of your day and a great weekend take care depends on how much you cheat depends on how often you cheat depends on what you cheat with if you're going to be uh you know eating carbohydrates and sugar then obviously that's going to uh you know just get you carb addicted again you're going to screw your metabolism uh for uh at least 24 hours with the insulin Spike and you'll just feel kind of crappy and it's easier to get back into that rut and just keep eating carbs because you're going to eat carbs that's going to give you a bump and then you're going to feel like crap"
