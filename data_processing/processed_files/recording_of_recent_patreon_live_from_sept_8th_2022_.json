        "body": "you can hear me um okay so i have some um questions here uh that have been sent in which is great thank you to everyone who has sent questions they'll try to address all of these and then you know people are more than welcome to ask questions and make comments uh in the chat and that would be great and then we can uh you know do more uh questions and things like that there uh so a question from serena can a type one diabetic do the carnivore diet and are there any issues they should watch out for they absolutely can and absolutely benefit them uh you know probably a lot more than than other people because it gives really really tight control over blood sugar and so you have very predictable amounts of insulin that that you need to take they'll still most likely need to take insulin but it's something that uh you know when people are on this their blood sugar is very very constant because their body is producing a constant amount and and so you know they generally only need to get like a low level background dose of insulin as opposed to you know like you know dose after dose after dose with every meal and uh you know and larger and larger amounts of background insulin and things like that depending on what they're doing and when now if they if they ever went outside carnivore they would still have to do the same thing but they wouldn't have to do anything extra they wouldn't have to they wouldn't have to do uh you know like go above and beyond what they would have before so if they were to like say drink alcohol they would need to take you know some insulin when they did that um you know or have some carbs or something like that but you know as long as they stay carnival they actually would need a minimal amount of uh of insulin and so yeah it can be very very good for that you know we've actually been using a ketogenic diet since i i believe the 1800s late 1800s for diabetics type 1 and type 2 generally more just type 1 back then but that was that was something we've been using for a very long time to to help with that and there are studies uh with with animal models that are now being attempted in human models um called the fasting mimicking diet where if you fast for four days a month or use a fasting mimicking diet for four days a month minimum you know and then you can do it more if you want and get better results um you know fascinating diet is just a keto diet you know that they're talking about getting into a so-called fasting metabolism which you know anybody who's been listening to me knows that i don't think that that's a fasting metabolism i think that's our main metabolism our primary metabolism that's why we get so many benefits from doing that because we're actually letting our biochemistry work properly and and um you know so uh they've actually found that people can or or that in these animal models and these like rats and mice they're actually regrowing the areas of their pancreas called the beta islet cells that produce insulin so they can actually start producing insulin again so we'll see what that happens with uh in human models uh and then what have you but you know it's absolutely okay for um for uh type 1 diabetics to do and it's going to give them all the benefits that everyone else is going to get plus it's going to give them very tight control over their blood sugar and regular amounts of insulin so the chances of getting hypoglycemic uh are are going to be far reduced so yeah i think it's it's uh even more important for those those individuals to use it um so it says in regards to people who are a carnivore for a long period of time and have elevated hp1c they say is that because of the optimal diet maybe the red blood cells are living past the normal 12 weeks that's actually a very good question yeah i it may be you know i've sort of thought about that you know if things are sort of healthier and working better um they're not getting you know oxidized and damaged you know like red blood cells generally last around three months and then they just sort of get too stiff and craggy and old and then they get sort of beaten up by your spleen and you know and that's just sort of what happens uh and it could very well be that you know if your red blood cells are lasting longer that they'll just be around longer to get their their hemoglobin sort of you know oxidize and glycate it a bit more uh that that's certainly um you know a you know a reasonable uh question to ask i i don't i don't know if we have any evidence of it one way or the other um but uh it's certainly a certainly interesting thing to think about you know and i think that i think that's it's uh certainly very plausible um i've been carnivore for a very long time though and i just have my hvac tested and it's exactly in in the good range so i don't know if other people are doing something slightly different and that's sort of affecting it as well but um you know i i don't know i don't know how high their hp1c is getting like i've never really heard of someone carnivore especially a long-term carnivore that has like high hba1c to the point that they're like pre-diabetic or you know in the diabetic ranges but you know if they were i would i would i really wonder if they were eating any anything else besides just meat and you know exactly what they were eating because that's that's a bit curious to me um so tracy asks i'm on a mostly carnivore diet initially i lost weight but i'm stalled right now six weeks in what can i do to kick start the fat loss become all carnivore mostly carnivore is generally where people stall because they're stalling on the mostly part so whatever you're eating besides that you know just get rid of it there are a lot of things that can stall weight loss um you know like artificial sweeteners will stall weight loss uh sugar will and scars will stall weight loss even vegetables can still stall weight loss especially ones with lectins especially certain lectins can actually bind to your insulin receptors so even if you're not eating carbohydrates these lectins can bind to your your insulin receptors and give an insulin like response and then you'll kick into a fat storage metabolism as opposed to a fat burning metabolism so whatever you're eating that's mostly carnivore change it to 100 carnivore just pure meat and water make sure you're eating enough make sure you're eating enough fat so that your stools are soft um and you're not drinking coffee so that uh that's going to give you a false sense of you know just normal bowel function because if you're drinking coffee you're eating artificial sweeteners will stall weight loss but also it's it's going to they can all give you loose stools and so you know you can't really tell you know if you are getting enough fat because you normally look at your stools um to see that but if you're moving these things through because these things are irritants and then pulling osmotic diuresis into your in um into your intestines and it just floods out obviously you know things are going to be moving more quickly and and in a you know a unnatural sort of way and so you won't be able to see if you're actually dry constipated so i would i would suggest just doing that and then you know and eating enough you know you want to eat enough uh food to stimulate your metabolism actually when you eat more you know not overeat but if you're eating uh enough that your body wants and you can eat intuitively if you're eating purely carnivore then you know you you actually do stimulate your metabolism because you're telling your body hey we've got a lot of energy coming in we don't have to worry about this we're not living we're not in a famine we've just killed a mammoth times are good you know and so your body actually ramps up your metabolism and said hey we don't need to hold on to this we can really really use all this you know and um and so you know it's just like you know you've just things are good you're you're you're making a lot of money at work you got investments you got all this money coming in it's just like yeah you know what i may as well buy a boat you know it doesn't really matter right now but then you go into it into a recession the economy sucks and your investments aren't you know you know uh working out or you don't have them anymore they've all dried up uh you can't just go around running the credit card you know like you're gonna get screwed and so your body knows that and so it's not gonna start you know spending your savings if uh you know you don't have have money coming in so you can think of that as your body's economy and and being much smarter than than most people are and so you know if you you know something you know the less you eat you you will actually slow down your basal metabolic rate okay that's something that's that's well established and so maybe you can eat so much less that it overcomes your the slowing of your metabolism and so you end up having a net loss in weight but you're doing it at the sacrifice of your metabolism and your metabolic rate so i don't actually find that to be a a very desirable thing at least for me and um and then you have to keep doing it because as soon as you you start eating to satiety your body's just like right you know thank god you know now we can put on some stores because you know the next famine is around the corner so if you if you give your body what you what it needs eventually it's going to trust you and it's going to trust that you're not in a famine and it's going to going to you know get you down to a body fat percentage that's that's more in keeping with what it wants physiologically for you know times of plenty okay um what else therefore red blood cells have more time to accumulate glucose in the cell from linda talking about the the yeah 100 agreed i think that's that's very plausible i don't know if we can um i don't i don't i don't i don't know of any research that says that that happens though uh but it's certainly a potential uh potential thing and uh and serena's saying it's easy to overeat on corn upon carnivore under eat on carnivore it 100 is your hunger signals are so different you just don't feel hungry in the traditional sense and so you should go by taste you know you should you know as long as meat tastes good you know i think that that means you're you're hungry you know your body wants those nutrients so it's giving you a positive feedback saying get more of this in you okay and then eventually it'll actually stop you know you you have like a big old steak it will you know eventually it'll start out tasting amazing and then you know as you go it'll taste less and less amazing and then it gets to a point you're just like i'm not really enjoying this and you'll just naturally want to stop why it's the same stick it's the same piece of meat cooked at the same time the same conditions why why would it taste different if this is just a chemical response and just a one-to-one it should always taste amazing like that you should just overeat overeat overeat and never stop uh but it doesn't it doesn't do that and that's that is that is a clearly observed phenomena when you're eating a bunch of carbs and sugar you know you can just keep eating you compulsively eat because it changes your your hunger signals and you're telling your brain you're starving to death so um you know it's uh you know it's a very different mechanism and so now you don't feel you know hungry like you do in the tradition that you normally have and so you have to you have to make sure that you're that you're uh getting enough so i'm just gonna adjust this and um and olivia says you know and and get rid of appetite suppressants like coffee and apple cider vinegar yeah yeah absolutely you know you want you want to you want your body to be able to to tell what it wants and what it needs okay a question from maria hi doc i have a question for wednesday's patreon i was reading dr pran uh you gavin's post um [Music] kevin and he mentioned it is counterproductive to consume high fat diet and insulin resistance and also said that today farmed meat is higher in saturated fatty acids compared to our ancestral diet what are your thoughts on this please um i think i would have to see the whole thing uh counter productivity consume high fat diet and insulin resistance i don't i don't i don't know if he's ever said that well i haven't i haven't don't remember saying that i've spoken i know pran um pretty well and uh we agree on most things um and um i haven't haven't heard that statement i'd have to sort of see exactly what it what it said in that context but you know the thing is that eating fat doesn't doesn't affect your your uh it does it doesn't affect insulin so like if you're you know it doesn't give an insulin response so you you can eat a ton of fat it doesn't doesn't change your your insulin or your blood sugar at all like it doesn't have an effect on it um you know these are farmed cows fed artificial grains and things like that artificially fat yeah of course they are you know but if you look back historically we would uh be going after you know big animals with a lot of fat that that's what we that's what we were doing um that's something that mickey bandur uh was talking about um uh in his research and on on my pockets when i just interviewed him i haven't published that yet but we'll be you know in the coming weeks uh super interesting guy you know and he was thinking we were going after these megaphones so we had these megafauna that had more fat and so you made these mammoths and these you know giant sloths and things like that which i mean just couldn't have been hard to hunt like a sloth is you know just the easiest target in the forest with like you know a giant one you see that thing coming and um and so you know they had a lot of fat and we went for these things because they had a lot of fat and then all of a sudden you had you know when we started having less and less sort of megafauna that's when you start seeing the fossil record evidence of of cracking open the bones and getting at the marrow because you were giving it this fat we needed this fat and we also would go after the the prime uh the prime animals the ones that that were at you know the prime of their life they had the best fat content they were the healthiest those are also the best able to defend themselves and to get away so normally you know like uh you know wolves and and lions they usually go after like the young or the elderly or the sick or the sun or the dying you'll be your easier targets you know so they'll go after them you'll see someone and then like the stragglers are the ones that are getting caught our ancestors were going after like the prime guys the the biggest the best the strongest they had the best fat content that they you know and that sort of doesn't really make sense you go after the harder target unless there's something in that harder target that you really desired and one you know key difference there is that they have a high fat content uh we've always been high fat carnivores you know that's um that's pretty clear and when we you know when the megafauna started dying out and we needed to sort of supplement we weren't getting everything we needed uh that's when you actually start seeing agriculture start to kick in you know and um and so it's uh you know the domestication of animals and uh and uh the use of crops so you know i think i think that the evidence is quite clear we do need we do need more fat than other carnivores and probably because we haven't been carnivores as long as as other carnivores like wolves and and lions um and so that's uh that's that i don't i don't think that um i don't think that it's uh counterproductive to consume high fat diet and insulin resistance at all i think that it's perfectly fine uh i don't think it's gonna it's gonna screw with your insulin or your insulin dependency at all um but absolutely there are you know farmed meat is is definitely going to be have is going to definitely have a higher fat content is that a better fat content or not you know that that's you know that's that's a um you know that that's a point of of uh you know discussion and you know they could be they can be raised i don't know if there's if this makes too much of a difference i mean i you know when i eat it is a different fat composition that's that's true but um like just just simply you know there's going to be a lot more omega-3s in uh you know grass-fed and finished cows than in grain finished you know if you're grain finishing a cow for more than you know three months you you tend to run out of omega-3s you generally have omega-6s so you know that's something to to know about because you need you need omega-3s and you want more omega-3s and omega-6s you still need omega-6s they are necessary for life but you don't want a lot more of them than omega-3s um [Music] okay so jordan asks so what about not being hungry in the morning but are going to be doing physical activity would you force yourself to eat would you lean more towards fat or stick to the uh sort of uh 70 80 um calories from fat i would never force myself to eat and uh certainly not when i was going to be doing a lot of uh physical activity i actually feel much better physically when i'm on an empty stomach so you know even when i'm maybe a bit hungry i'll just be like no i'm not going to eat so i always played sports hungry i was trained hungry and and and i just i performed much better that sort of thing about it physiologically you're still in that sort of that fight flight you know you need to get out there you use energy to go get a kill make you know do a hunt and then get some food once you eat you can actually you know switch into a rest and digest mode where your your body's just just mobilizing energy differently your body says hey let's calm it down let's take it easy and let's you know uh let's um you know just rest and digest and also you pull a lot of blood to your digestive system to to break all this stuff down and that's uh you know that and that's a high energy dependent system you know so it takes a lot of blood and that blood's not going to the rest of your of your tissues okay so i think especially if you're doing a lot of physical activity i would definitely avoid that so certainly not don't force yourself um you know i find that i feel much better eating in the evening just because of that phenomenon i feel much better during the day having not eaten anything i'm much more productive i have much more energy i work out a lot harder even if i haven't eaten all day and you know then i eat a big meal and i'm just like oh this feels good i'm nice and then i just i just relax and i just pass out um if i were to eat a big meal during the day i tend to be more lethargic during the day just for that that exact reason and so especially if i'm doing a lot of physical activity you're working out i find it quite counterproductive to eat so especially if you don't want to eat don't don't force yourself how much would i eat i eat until i'm until i'm full i eat until meat doesn't taste good anymore um if i'm just doing my normal thing that's once a day usually about two pounds if it's fatty if it's more lean i'll i'll need more than that if i'm working out a lot i will just naturally need more food and more calories and more fat and more protein and so i'll tend to eat twice a day i could i could easily double uh that so i could eat you know easily four pounds of meat uh fatty meat and and uh you know sometimes a little more um depending and then now in those in that case you know i tend to stack on muscle pretty easily um so george says he ends up winding out winds up running out of energy especially outside in the heat um that could be other other factors um you know if you're not drinking enough water you're getting dehydrated that can certainly uh screw with you especially in the heat um and then you know also think about um you know if there's anything else in your diet you know you know artificial sweeteners coffees anything like that i think i think you know um you're probably not in that category but you know just think about it if there's anything that you can sort of optimize do that and then drink a ton more water uh you know but if you if you find that you have better energy when you've eaten a little bit and i would probably stick to a little bit i would probably wouldn't go until you full um if you find that you do better with that then you know do it that's fine that's you know that's just if that's how you that's how you feel better than do it physiologically it's um you know it is going to uh it'll likely be better for most people to not eat anything and not have blood going to your uh to go into your intestines to digest this food and uh and it will be available to the rest of your tissues but you know do what works for you uh i would i would start by 100 pure meat and water drink a buttload of water cool from gabe what is the max optimal size population for the planet if everyone ate meat uh base limitations of land meat that would be available etc that's an excellent question i don't think there's anyone that can accurately calculate that but it's a hell of a lot more than what people think and suggest especially if we're eating meat um you guys you guys i may have watched uh the one that i did on the video i did on regenerative agriculture that um uh it came that came out and got completely throttled by by youtube because you know how dare i talk about the environment and uh and cows being good for it um so maybe you didn't see it uh but i also i also interviewed a guy named uh dr peter baylor steph super interesting guy and he's a phd in forage agronomy and has a degree in animal nutrition as well which is actually real science we can't actually do you know randomized controlled trials where you take genetically identical populations of humans and separate them out into identical situations and change one variable and then study the results over the course of their lifetime uh you can do that with animals you know and so you know we can actually do have a really really strong uh you know scientifically based evidence for you know the nutrition of animals and so it's actually pretty damn hard um uh hard evidence so you got to understand that that you know obviously you know i've talked about how you know plants when you when you're growing a single crop you necessarily or any crop you have to necessarily destroy an entire ecosystem you have to you destroy all the plants and animals living in that environment and then you'd grow one crop and then you kill all the animals coming in that are trying to eat that crop and then you're dumping pesticides and fertilizers things like that you get rain that washes it off gets into the water supply it just pollutes everything and it's you know it's disgusting it's it's really really you know bad for the environment also where can you grow crops you grow crops on arable land unless you're like in the mountains and the step and then and you're making those tiered uh oh what am i called um [Music] christ anyway those those tears that go up like a mountainside like those rice paddies and you know steep areas of china or in the mediterranean and uh and they look really cool but you know this is trying to get flat damn land to grow some plants on uh some rice or some olive trees or something like that um and uh you know but but basically you need to do it on flat arable land well what competes for arable land is cities people want to live there so farms and cities you know you know cities show up where farms used to be and um and and as you know cities and populations expand you know farms get bought out and you know and they they build houses on them and that's how that works so you have this competition so if you look at if you look at the surface of the earth and this includes oceans obviously you know 70 something percent of the world's surfaces is just covered in water four percent is arable land not much okay so cows and livestock don't compete for land on arable land i mean you can put them on arable now you don't have to okay cows you know goats especially goats um you know sheep and bison whatever they can all go on forest land and rangeland which you can't grow cities on you can't grow crops on rangeland covers 15 of the earth's surface force is like 10 probably possibly vice versa anyway it ends up being about 25 between the two so in fact you can run animals on 25 percent of the earth and you can only run and you can only grow crops on four percent of the earth and that's competing with cities okay so it's actually way better to do animals you know you have way more land and the animals help the land okay the animals are you know recycling these nutrients they're eating down you know the dead wood and they're defecating and uricating and oh my goodness even their methane is recycling these nutrients you know it's not like they're just creating you know methane out you know de novo it's just appearing out of nowhere um that's a that's recycling of of these nutrients that gets back into the atmosphere and is then used again uh you know in the life cycle of different plants so this is actually a really important part of the world plants and animals have evolved together in a symbiotic relationship and you know like the big grasslands everything like that they you know develop with the big grazing animals like bison and cows and all these sorts of things and so you know when you get rid of them the grasslands die and the prairies die and the you know the the forests and the rains and all these things they start turning into deserts that's you know that's what the sahara desert is that's a man-made desert that was from improper farming techniques and uh and you know getting getting rid of these animals and things like that and just just turned to dust and that's what's happening in the middle of america during the dust bowl era uh when we were doing these farming techniques that just you know uh were inappropriate and they were losing a bunch of topsoil they got blown away blown away washed away all these things and we lost all our top soil and everything was going to hell and people figured out like oh crap this is this is from how we're you know farming and tilling the land improperly and we're able to sort of you know curtail that but you know that's that's farming cows livestock everything like that much better for the environment in fact they're good for the environment whereas growing crops and destroying the land is bad for the environment okay it's it's literally that simple um you know so everything they tell you you know uh in this subject you just basically reverse it you know they say no no we need to go plant-based because that helps the environment no no we need to go meat-based because that helps the environment and plants hurt it and they're saying that animals heard it like why would animals you know who that have always been on earth be just all of a sudden bad for the earth we're not an alien invasive species that came from a different planet you know like this is this is this is this is we all came here together you know and so uh the thing that's unnatural is farming you know is is growing crops that's that's unnatural that's something that's that didn't happen in nature you know cows don't do that lions don't do that we started doing that very recently okay so that is a difference that we've made a change in the environment and we have very serious effects on the environment because of that you know try telling anyone that when you've got you know 30 trillion dollars and you know agriculture you know money coming in every year you know paying lobbyists and things like that like good luck with that not 30 trillion but i mean really like many trillions like the sugar industry alone makes like 1.3 trillion dollars a year gross um you know gross profit so um you know that's just sugar you know so that that's what's going on here um so jamie you're saying triglycerides were normal pre-carnivore now everything is high except hdl is low any advice mostly lying for three months feel great very strange that's literally the opposite of everything i've ever seen normally your triglycerides would go down your hdl would go up ldl not not important allele high is actually good as long as you're not damaging it so you know you know generally when you when you have triglycerides up it's because you're eating carbohydrates and sugar or alcohol things like that and that's screwing with you screw with the randall cycle but it also you know you're damaging you know you can be damaging like your your ldl cholesterol uh transporters so it's um uh very strange are you eating high fat that's something that's important you know when you eat more fat and even saturated fat your ldl cholesterol goes up which is actually okay and your hdl cholesterol goes up which is really okay so i don't know if you're eating very very lean zero carb zero cheats what about your protein to fat ratio jamie high fat okay um all right um well that's interesting did you did you test directly before you started carnivore or was there a bit of a delay like did you get it just like thing from last year and then sort of this year you went carnivore and then you tested or did you test your cholesterol everything right before you started carnivore are now three months into carnivore i think jamie's typing but so you know it could be that you know you you blood tests are a snapshot in time you know and so you have to um delay six months okay so so things are snapshot time when you're when you're looking at um your blood test you get your blood tests here and then you know and then there's a six month gap and then you start and then you start something new and then three months into that is you know you're testing it well that doesn't necessarily mean that you know you know that was you know that that blood test was the same when you started carnival so i couldn't that could have changed um and so that's something to think about um and so you know either way you know i would just i'll just test it again as long as you're saying you know just just pure line diet everything like that you know just just keep doing that and um you know i would i would expect that to to improve i had another thing i was going to say i just lost my train of thought um christ what was i gonna say well whatever it was it was very pertinent to this discussion i just want everyone to know that um yeah but yeah so i i would i would test that prop um again i would just basically oh that was what it was depending on what you eat depending on what time of day depending on your exercise level and all sorts of things your cholesterol is going to be all over the place so it's it's not super accurate but just try to keep it as consistent as possible you know if you're if you know whatever you did on this test this last test that you did you know you did in the morning you did it fasting you're supposed to do in the morning fasting um did you work out the day before did you work out the day up all these sorts of things you want to re you want to replicate that reproduce that so you want to get at the same time of day you want to get the same fasting uh status and you want it and the same exercise status as well those are those are three factors that that make a big difference in this and then and they're just testing it in three months you know the test is a test is only as good as a re-test and so you know you have to you have to you have to test these things while you're while you're doing the experiment and so i think if you do that and you have a consistent sort of um examination of your cholesterol which gets very volatile with you if you if you test your cholesterol you know five times throughout the day you'll get five different results you know and and whether or not you're fasting you know especially if you're not fasting then it'll just be you know completely useless um so that's just something to be aware of uh so i would just test again in three months and you know reproduce those those uh those conditions and make sure that you're fasting um for that test and and just take a look i would i would be very surprised if it continued to trend in that direction so uh that's that's what i would say i wouldn't i wouldn't worry too much about it just now and uh because it may have been your triglycerides in hdl may have been you know way off in you know the you know the uh worst directions before you went carnivore we don't know uh and so i would just do that and and just be aware of the of the differences that that obviously eating will make in your in your cholesterol tests results and also exercise so try to reproduce those conditions and make sure you're 100 fasting you get a fasting cholesterol and at the same time of day that you did before okay so from melissa i've heard others like amber o'hearn talk about how we are different from other carnivore animals they are meant to eat high protein diet we are lipivores and need a high animal fat diet uh many of you best one 80 fat myself included what are your thoughts on this uh yeah i would agree on that and um you know that's something that um you know uh like mickey bandur dr mickey bandura was saying you know we haven't been carnivores as much as as other animals and so you know we we we need more fat we're not we're not as adapted to just getting a lot of protein uh you know wolves and lions they can eat very lean uh we we really can't and so when we have this relationship with you know the wolves that now become dogs you know we would give them the leaner meats and organs because they do they do well on those and we eat the fattier bits because we need those um plenty of examples of that i mean just look at the inuits i mean they see blubber you know and um and um you can you can even look at you know european populations um you're living in extreme conditions you know these these uh you know fur trappers and settlers and all sorts of things that was always very very important you know you're getting you know milk fat you know butter um and lard and all these sorts of things these are very very important things out on the prairies but also with explorers um if you read you know some of the some of the the accounts of um lewis and clark uh you know traversing across america you know and and you know you know charting it and mapping it um you know they they was very very clear that you know if you weren't if you weren't eating high fat you know you were dead and so like people that weren't getting enough fat those are the ones that were dying on the expedition and so the ones that survived the ones eating the just the fattiest cuts and they gave the leaner cuts the leaner bits and the organs to the dogs and um you know you know dogs wolves they're adapted to that they can they can survive on just lean lean protein and and get what they need from that like we can't really and that's just that's just a phenomenon and and for whatever the reason that that seems to be the case you know we we just need a higher fat content than uh than you know dogs and cats i just do um from crystal this is a bit a bit of a longer one but i'll read it out i'm wondering about all the supplements i'm taking um right off the bat don't take them unless you uh unless you have like a clear deficiency um i'm three weeks in and slowly starting to win off good i was taking like 10 to 12 pills three times a day along with special powers and tinctures hoping that they would heal me stop the inflammation or store my energy it's a good thought but it's more of a sales pitch than than a reality unfortunately unless you're just eating it just you know like a vegan diet it's just you know quite deficient in nutrients then i you shouldn't have to do that um always adding and stopping different things the latest and the greatest searching for the magic miracle supplement it's been years and thousands of dollars and i'm ready to be done good for you i'm so ready to just let me heal me i came from a whole food organic diet no packaged food but lots of fruit veggies and little meat unfortunately my immune system is weak i have a lot of food intolerances my hashimoto's has been fluctuating like crazy i also have the what i yeah well the mthfrg which i just think is just hilarious acronym acronym always it was a medical school i call that the mother effort gene um i'm going to be patient and give my thyroid time i heard you say nine months to a year for hashimoto's yeah i mean hashimoto's it you will get better it will help you'll you'll your antibodies will will start coming down and your thyroid function will start going up um but it takes longer than other autoimmune issues um and uh i've seen i've seen people resolve their hashimoto's short between that nine months to a year think some some people take longer you know i still do have patients that are sort of you know over a year and uh they still haven't completely resolved their hashing photos but i've spoken with other doctors that have definitely seen hashimoto's uh resolve as well and so you know this this yeah i don't think that's an uncommon thing so just stay with it um and but you'll get improvements all the time anyway you know i mean you'll just you'll just keep getting better and so even if you don't 100 resolve your hashimoto's uh you know in the first few months or even the first year or ever it will get better and you will be getting better so but hoping to stop uh the mo um stop most of the other supplements and just trust strict carnivore beef diet i had an immune reaction to pork and chicken recently uh so those aren't an option for a while yeah that's something that that um you know you hear about with autoimmune uh sufferers is that you know the type of meat matters as well and so the best you can do is uh grass-fed beef grass-fed red meat some lamb's fine too or even mutton probably better and chicken pork even eggs especially like egg whites seem to cause a problem egg yolks not as much apparently and certainly dairy is a problem uh for people with autoimmune so yeah i would for for people with autoimmune especially that you know it's a bit more important to be you know uh on that sort of you know red meat and water to the really optimal side of things probably has more to do with what the animal is eating than uh the actual meat itself you know and so you know if they're eating their natural diet they'll probably be fine but you know with farmed animals they're not eating what they would eat in the wild really um so this week i cut taking my supplements down to two a day and haven't noticed anything negative i'm thinking next week i'll start by taking them just once a day is that okay is there anything you recommend still taking uh while i'm healing vitamin d c magnesium selenium and take high doses of melatonin to sleep hopefully i can get off that soon anything else i might need anything else that might help sleep i guess i just need reassurance that i that i don't need to continue taking handfuls of supplements i just need to trust in me yeah yeah 100 uh crystal i think that that's very important to just you know just just trust and understand that this is what this is what we've all done is biologically you know what we need i don't think you need to take magnesium selenium especially not vitamin c and usually not vitamin d either unless you actually have an actual you know declared deficiency you know um you know if you're if you're not getting into the sun and you're not getting enough vitamin d from from the meat and the butter and the fat that you're eating which you you will get will get quite a lot from you know taking a vitamin d3 uh supplement i don't have too much of a problem with that um you know a lot of them will be in like vegetable oil or you know a canola oil base or sunflower oil base with a you know vegetable you know gelatin you know fake gelatin vegetable capsule which i would i would avoid if you can but you know at the end you get sort of drops vitamin d drops as well in a different suspension but you know you can you can just get out in the sun you know and i would encourage you to do that you know you'll get a lot of vitamin d from fat uh you know butter has a lot of vitamin d um if you react to the you know milk proteins and things like that in butter because you're autoimmune issues then you know you have to go to something else but you're like grass-fed tallow should have have plenty of vitamin d as well um magnesium some people you know australia is just apparently just the soil is just a bit deficient in magnesium and so it's just you know most people are deficient in magnesium and zinc but i'm not and so you know it's um you know i've been here for a while i got tested so you know that was that was what um you know my friend dr rensberg was saying it's like everyone is in australia unless they supplement our low magnesium and uh zinc he's like but you're not really you know and so and he said that yeah i'm not quite in that perfect optimal range we look at but according to the the normal standard tests and things like that i was absolutely you know in a very good range um and so he was he was quite impressed by that um i honestly i think you can just just stop taking all this crap you know just right away you know if you're just not getting sun uh and you have you know um and you have to take you know vitamin d3 it's not the end of the world i i don't think you just i just don't think you need to take the rest of that crap high dose of melatonin i don't know what you mean by high doses um you know some melatonin can be can be helpful it actually has been shown to help sort of regulate your circadian rhythm and help you produce growth hormone when you're sleeping give you better deeper sleep and and then sort of kick off that that nocturnal uh hormonal sequence um which is good um there are people that study melatonin they take and they you know he's like well i'm not a clinician i'm not a doctor i can't really say but you know i take i take a lot and to them that was 10 milligrams a night and they found from their research that that seemed to be a good good number um dr bransberg commonly prescribes melatonin for people even just to just help give them better sleep but also for that that hormonal uh response and so quite often be allowed three milligrams a night if you don't want that and you don't want to take it then just uh you don't need to i would just sort of wean down um and then eventually you don't really need to take it there are people like um i haven't seen his full arguments but i've seen dr hubermann from um you know the hubermann lab uh he's a he's a professor of ophthalmology and um and something else and i think teaches that like sort of you know neurology sort of things in uh at stanford so i'm a smart guy very well educated uh he does not like the idea of melatonin he thinks that's a bad idea but there's plenty of plenty of uh studies that show that military is actually quite good for a number of different reasons so i'll have to look into his his um discussions on that a bit more but uh certainly if you want to come off of that you can you know i mean i you know the good thing about melatonin is really not like it doesn't doesn't cause a dependency and actually can help reset your your rhythm so when people are like jet lag and they should go from you know one time zone to another you know they can um they can uh you know they can um to help reset their body clock by taking that but you don't need to keep taking it you sort of do it for a few days and your body's that back on that clock and then you you sort of come off of that so that that can that you can come off pretty quickly uh and the supplements yeah you just just drop them like a bag of dirt you just don't need to take that crap so yeah um very high fast way to go so olivia's saying she thinks she has magnesium deficiency because if she misses a day she she can get cramps yeah well potentially you know if that's if that's something that's missing in your diet just because of the area that you're in or you're drinking coffee and caffeine which can sap your body of magnesium then yeah i mean you'll do you'll have a deficiency and you'll need to take magnesium so that that is the thing so if if people are drinking coffee you're taking caffeine just be aware that you're you're going to uh have artificially low magnesium and you're also going to dehydrate yourself because obviously caffeine is a diuretic and so you're going to have that magic combination of lower magnesium than you want and you're going to be dehydrated which is a recipe for a lot of cramps um muslim feels horrible and she doesn't eat fat yeah me too yeah and that's the thing you know you need the fat um and l says she doesn't get restless legs anymore which is great yeah that's that's something that um has been a bit of annoying and people are getting these medications we're weird you know uh you know you know neurogenic like medications they're like heavy heavy medications just because your your legs feel a bit strange at night and and you know obviously that's uh that's a you know i don't know i think it's a big big deal to take any sort of medications like that at all but certainly not if you're if you're having seizures and things like that you can't stop them with diet then like yeah by all means you can get on one of these medications with like uh you know i think that that's um worthwhile because those are very dangerous but it's it's um you know it's a bit it's a bit concerning when we have to take very heavy medications just for our legs feeling uncomfortable and and that's and that's good that that your legs don't don't feel like that anymore and you don't have to worry about that okay from wendy um he replied on zoom saying the white spots on a kid on a kid eating carnivore and fruit was not likely due to the carnivore diet but could it be oxalate dumping maybe i i don't know enough about oxalate dumping to know all the all the particular particulars of that um but if the kids also eat fruit i would also get rid of the fruit um and uh but you know i don't know i mean this is we're talking about a kid hasn't had years and years and years and years and years of uh you know storing up a bunch of oxalates and things like that you know and you have people that are like 12-year 15-year vegans that go cornward and don't have any of the issues with oxalate dumping so i don't know why some people get it and some people don't uh when you would expect someone who's just been just eating just nothing but oscillates for over a decade you know you would imagine that they uh would uh don't oxalates right um so i don't know why some do and some don't and you know if a 15-year vegan maybe it's the 15-year vegan sort of gotten more used to the oxalates than being able to you know process them better and then the kid is just sort of new to it but i don't know um it's a hard one i don't i don't have any clear answer for you on that but the white spots you know you can get white spots for a number of different reasons and and um you know there are a lot of things that that happen that still you know don't have uh you know direct you know cause and effect nature to the things that we eat so i would just keep keeping open mind on that get rid of fruit uh any and any and every day of the week i would get rid of fruit and just and just see how it goes on a carnivore diet and if you still have these white spots i mean are they causing harm is he is he uncomfortable is he's sore is he sick is he having are there any other symptoms that are associated with those white spots are they just sort of you know just a white spot if there is like i probably wouldn't worry too much about it if there was some sort of skin changes as well it could be something indicative of some sort of rash or or what have you you know just get it checked out you have a doctor look at it um you know white spots can be can be anything really and so um it's uh it's important to have someone take a look at it and actually see it and just be like yeah that's nothing or like maybe we should do something we should take a look at this closer or do a test or to do a scraping get a biopsy and uh and things like that but i would imagine it's not that big a deal if he has absolutely no other symptoms i wouldn't worry about it too much um but if they persist i would definitely get them looked at by a doctor especially if he has other symptoms along with it and get rid of the fruit from kevin is morning coffee with thick pouring cream positive or detrimental if so why well the cream's fine um coffee's a plant um and plants are trying to kill you so uh yeah they're gonna be things in coffee i mean why do you have to add the cream to it because it's bitter as hell and you know it doesn't actually taste good objectively and we get used to it but i think that sort of like stockholm syndrome we start getting you know we fall in love with our abuser um you know kids do not like the taste of coffee like early on you know maybe some kids because they see their parents and they won't look up to them like oh i want to have coffee and they want that sort of thing but you you give a a small child like a you know like an infant you know a bit of coffee i mean they'll just be appalled that you you made them put that in their mouth it tastes bad it's bitter what is that bitter taste your tongue and your brain are sophisticated machines and they can identify harmful chemicals and they relay that back to you with negative sensation this bitter taste is the recognition of harmful chemicals and say don't eat this get this out of you this is bad for you that's what bitter taste is that's why you put sugar in it that's why we put a creamer in it because it covers up that bitter taste and so we can get this stuff down um coffee comes from a bean bean is a seed a seed is a plant's baby and all organisms protect their babies more than anything and so that is generally where you'll find a higher concentration of poisons and and defense chemicals and things like that and so you know and that's that's true for coffee as well as other beans as well um so you know is it going to cause such a detriment that you want to get rid of it i mean that's a personal decision i i would suggest just just stopping for a month and see how you go or even just you know two weeks you know i mean two weeks is going to be big because you're gonna have you might have some withdrawals might have some headaches and things like that uh to give a real good test i just get rid of it for a month and then and then see how you feel i feel much better and a lot of people that i talk to feel a lot better when they when they ditch coffee and um and then if you introduce it back in like you'll have a bit of a boost from the caffeine but you know it will it will you'll have to boost up and then you'll crash and you'll just feel worse actually after that so you have to keep taking the drug to keep your body going um i don't feel good when i do when i do that you know i feel good for the first bit and i feel i regret it the rest of the day and i normally don't get sore after workout at all i drink coffee i'm sore for two days you know so that's that's something i think about there are things in there that you don't want okay um tell us how you really feel uh yeah well i look i don't drink coffee and i i feel much better without coffee so that's how i really feel um from ganesha i know everyone's timeline is different when it comes to healing i'm strict beef bison landki salt water and tallow for september and beyond awesome um is there any way to know how long it may take for my energy to improve joint fibromyalgia pain to subside i got some relief from me 98 carnivore but i desperately need the relief from being 100 that's why i've even taken out regular butter and eggs everyone is different you you generally do see sort of the first couple weeks first month a lot of improvement especially on the information side of things because you're getting rid of all of these pro-inflammatory things um you know if you're having these problems i just get rid of all dairy whatsoever full stop and um and you know make sure you're getting enough fat it sounds like you're doing that um but you know you judge it by your stools if you're having you know soft stools and everything like that certainly get rid of all coffee everything like that that's what i mean it makes me sore after working out you know you know it's going to it's going to cause soreness and and people that are that are prone you know you know going to be sore you know and then if you have fibromyalgia and joint problems it's going to just you know stick on that nidus of inflammation and make it worse so i think you're doing everything right um you you will get you know good uh improvement and results even even early on within the first sort of month or so because you're getting rid of all these pro-inflammatory things so just just keep tuning it up and just get rid of all all you know ghee is is probably okay you know you're getting rid of like the milk proteins and things like that but if you just use tallow that might be even a little better and um and just keep it up you know i mean it it uh it will get better it does get better i'm sure it already has gotten better you're saying you've gotten some but you need you need more so just stay as strict as you can and you know really get rid of all plants and you know coffee certainly artificial sweeteners definitely and and dairy as well and now you will get better you'll keep getting better so just just stick with it um if you're not getting you know all the improvements in the first couple weeks or months you know that's uh you know that's unfortunate and i'm sorry um you know but i i would expect you to get a lot of improvement in that time and then things to to continue to get better and then you can start being more physically active uh you need to need to be physically active especially for joint pain and arthritis as well because the stronger those muscles are the better able they are to support that joint and the less pain you'll experience in that joint so i have bone on bone arthritis on my my kneecaps um and uh you know and that like on mri it's like this bunch of edema and everything like that it's just like it's bad i don't really notice it it doesn't really bother me um if i'm doing certain things uh you know it does but you know i've started you know if i would like to short squat down on the ground to like you know get at something you know i'm like adjusting something on the operating table i have to sort of get down very low that would that would hurt that would actually really hurt for a while but then i started uh just doing more deeper squats and bodyweight things like that and started getting my body used to going through all those levels and getting the muscle stronger supporting me at those levels it's it's not a problem anymore really and so now i do squats you know pass the grass all the way down even though my patella is this scraping bone you know so um because the muscles are are strong around that and protecting that i don't experience it as much and because of what i'm eating obviously i don't have all the inflammation okay so olivia um it was saying lately i have to agree now i am uh knocking caffeine relying i see this stockholm syndrome so it's good that you got off of that that's really great um and i think you'll you'll continue to get better and better and feel better and better as you go and and just have better energy levels you know i know you you work uh crazy hours and and you don't get as much you probably don't probably get less sleep than i do sometimes um you know so uh i think i think honestly i think getting off the caffeine is actually going to really help you with that and how you feel so general questions cramps um give advice to people having cramps make sure they're hydrated not necessarily go down the electrolytes root how much water should people be having how do you tell if you're dehydrated um i mean there's a few ways you know if your mouth is a little dry you know then you're definitely dehydrated you look a skin turgor it's not as it's not as helpful in sort of younger people but if you sort of look at your skin you should pull that up and with that if it doesn't or like here that should just snap back right if it sort of takes a little longer to go down you are dehydrated in fact you're very dehydrated and you see that and people that are they're elderly sort of pull up their skin like that and it'll just sort of it'll go up and then it'll sort of up and then it'll sink down like that that means they are very dehydrated so that's that's a big thing but um you know i wouldn't uh i wouldn't expect to see that some sort of sort of younger population that's a sort of late stage dehydration you know long later on there but you know you just you you just drink water taste you know good in your and that's the thing if you're you're forcing yourself going oh my god i don't want to do this money you probably had enough i would aim for about three liters um that's just i think that's a based on nothing but it's just i think just this thing is a good benchmark i feel a lot better with over a gallon i feel best with like two gallons a day uh that's just me um especially when i'm being active and in the heat and things like that i just feel much much better have much better energy when i'm doing that um but play with it you know and uh if you're getting cramps i would definitely say you're not getting of uh water that way and so you and i talked to a lot of people and they were saying oh yeah you know i get these cramps and this thing you know i get these headaches i'm like oh how much water you drink oh i drink like two 600 mil bottles of water a day it's like jesus christ you know this is like that's like that's you know that that that's you know that's like like you have to do like rash and water like if you're in the desert you're not to get to come to an oasis for nine days you know like you know that's uh that's that's barely enough to keep you alive almost you know so i would um i i would just uh you know whatever you're doing if you're having cramps do more of it you know people take a lot of electrolytes and they still have cramps and like oh what am i doing i need to take more electrolytes i'm like well first of all um you know unless you checked your electrolytes that you found that you were wanting and one or the other did you need to take them at all maybe not but if you're taking electrolytes and you're still getting cramps well it's definitely not the electrolytes right so up the water and so you know you know if you're getting cramps drink more drink enough drink water until you stop getting cramps basically um [Music] hair loss uh there's a few more questions i'll i'll go a little longer just to answer these um if i can unless i get a call from hospital that i might need to go um hair loss a few people experiencing this now uh can you review everything that should check on diet and then next steps well getting blood's done definitely identify where the issue is probably not honestly um i don't know if you're going to be able to get different blood tests that's going to help with hair loss um hair loss is a bit of a weird one that that's one that sort of cropped up recently you know professor bart kaye you know says that if you don't eat like a big bolus of meat you know sort of like a big one big meal uh at a time you know with high protein you know that that will sort of transiently bring you up out of ketosis and this is actually good and this can things help different biochemical processes in your body to transiently come out and then go back in and he said that one of those things uh that would would be a problem was hair loss um and that you could you could lose you lose your hair by doing that which is like okay that was that was news to me i i meant to ask him sort of the mechanism of that um but just sort of didn't get around to it during our last interview um and uh and he had to he had a an appointment just after that so we had to sort of keep it straight to the hour unfortunately um [Music] and um you know so so that's something to think about um [Music] you know barry ken berry was saying that um you know he has some things on on hair loss as well um but it was more to do with like you know if you're eating carbohydrates and having insulin resistance and things like that that can make people go you know prematurely lose their hair so if you're doing a carnivore i think um this sort of indirectly but he was saying that um i didn't see exactly what he said but someone had mentioned that that this was uh something that he said that this was uh you know possibly a transit transitory thing so it might happen at first where you're losing weight you're transitioning over but that should actually come back i don't know i do know from people that i've seen uh they've actually had the opposite issue like my brother um you know was starting to start to have thin hair and or thinning hair he wasn't like you know bald or anything uh i think like when went carnival and like dude has like hair model hair now like it's you know it's like it's like it was very impressive you know and it's just like you know he's like he's the hair they did you always he always actually had good hair but like now he's got like the hair that he had like as a teenager you know dudes in his mid-40s now and so he has he has actually much better hair now than he did previously so you know and there can be other things obviously involved um so it's hard to say it's it's something that um i you know i don't know enough about uh and so i'll have to sort of do some more more digging into that but those are some things that you can address as well anyway it's just making sure you're getting that big bolus of of uh meat with pro with protein and that'll transitly bring you out and things like that and see see what that does to help you um and obviously you know not not eating carbs uh does knuckle cracking cause arthritis or any other issues does carnivore help with preventing this um knuckle cracking so that that's that's certainly what people say um that's sort of bandied around um but i mean you know i mean that that that what is that that's that's not what chiropractors tell you of releasing you know uh air and co2 and that's nonsense of course it's not you know when you pop a balloon it's it's the popping the rupturing of the casing that causes that popping noise right um not if you just let it out you know it without popping it just pushes out um so that's the same thing so if you're if you're popping that and that's releasing this air then that would have to be you you'd be popping your joint capsule which is like a major injury cause major ligamentous injury and uh you know i don't see air blending to your the surface of your skin and things like that so that's that's not what's happening um so this friction is the the the joints are sort of cracking cranking next to each other and and uh and then there's there's a reverberation and sound because of that um anytime you're you're increasing the amount of friction um and uh on your on your joints you can you can break them down that's why i have uh arthritis on my kneecaps because i did muay thai kickboxing since i was 14 and i you did all these knee strikes and i was a kid and so i thought it was fun to just like knee and you know you know you you kick with your shin and muay thai that's what i sort of like numbing these things down so i was just kicking the hell out of a bag and people all the time and you know and so that uh that was um you know sort of easy for me to do and so i'd be like would be you know just you know drunk high school kids do stupid things and i just like take a poll and just wham you know like i could do it and the people was like you know funny and impressive and things like that so you know i did stupid things like that um it cost me because you can sort of damage that cartilage cause micro micro um fractures and uh and eventually that that even that little bit of friction will grow into big friction and all of a sudden it'll flake away and go away so that's that's the theoretical with with uh knuckle cracking but i think that i think the the uh the literature is a bit mixed in that it the literature is not mixed in the fact that that um chiropractic adjustments of the back and the neck cause harm that's not that's uh that that has been pretty well established in the literature uh in fact the number one call number one cause of stroke and stroke related death in people under 50 worldwide is chiropractic neck adjustments okay and how many countries have chiropractors not all that many okay and so you know this is worldwide now right because you have arteries that go up up your neck and actually from you know c6 all the way up into your brain you have your vertebral arteries and they go through in the actual bones of the of your vertebrae and so you crack your neck and you're twisting this you're getting sheer forces on the arteries that can actually tear those arteries cause what's called a dissection which is just a tearing of the lining and all of a sudden you it'll claw it off because your body's like shoot this is bad and it'll clot off and you can stroke out and this is this is this is your your posterior circulation so that's like you know that that's the the blood supply to your brain step you know which controls your heart and your lungs you just die like that so uh or it can flick off an embolism if it's not you know and that can stroke out your brain stem as well so uh yeah so a little little tangent to the arthritis and the knuckles thing but i think worth knowing anyway um personal sort of questions um are you able to tell us what the title of your book will be i yeah i don't know i mean maybe maybe people can sort of give me some suggestions and things like that um you know i could try you know things like you know like plants are trying to kill you uh it could be you know something like that and there was sort of more to it um one person suggested you know going with that and then you know like you know what doctors first of this time you know i have to look at what it was it was actually quite good it was actually quite a quite a catchy title um and so maybe start with something like that and um you know but i want to sort of incorporate somehow the fact that you know i'm really making the case that you know that that the diseases that we're treating nowadays are not diseases that these are toxicities and i that's what i really want that to be impressed upon people and that's the main reason i'm writing this book um if i could add anyone to mount rushmore who would it be and why uh well you know this may this may i don't know because whenever anything gets political everyone has very different views but i think um that ronald reagan was an absolutely brilliant uh um president and you know and he was he was much maligned in the media but people don't understand that he was he was intensely popular you know he won 47 states out of 50 in his first election he won 49 in the second election and he completely turned around the economy and and um and the you know the direction and lives of americans um before people you know say anything about him i think people should go back and actually look at the record and actually look at what he did and actually look at the speeches that he gave and listen to him speak himself i you know it's the man [Music] truly cared about the country truly cared about people and really knew his stuff he really knew his stuff and so you listen what he says the reason he was so popular the reason he was able to um to be as successful as he was because you know he had he had you know congress and senate against him his whole presidency but he was able to actually get things done because he was he was so on the point and he would sort of have these presidential addresses and he would talk about these subjects i think here's the subject here's the deal here's the thing here's why it's important here's what we need to do about it and people were like yeah damn right we do democrats and republicans independence everything they were just like yep that makes sense and so you know their representatives even on the opposing political aisle uh they they you know were like okay they begrudgingly went with these things um you know that that's whether or not you agree with all of these things that that's a very impressive political accomplishment and you're going from sort of the recessions and depressions really of uh of the carter era of the 70s and going to you know a very booming economy and and very uh successful um you know time of prosperity you know that's a big that's a big difference in benefit that that uh that he was able to provide and so and for a lot of other reasons you know uh you know winning the cold war uh getting the ussr uh you know to to fall and to bring down the you know the berlin wall you know people are saying that well gorbachev is
