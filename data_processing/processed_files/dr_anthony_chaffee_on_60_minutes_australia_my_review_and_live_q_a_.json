        "body": "foreign who comes in and don't get going on the 60 minutes recap and get the live questions [Music] hey everyone thanks for joining um today I'm just going to do a live to go over the 60 Minutes Australia interview that I did and that just came up this weekend or just last weekend so for those who haven't seen it you can go to 60 Minutes Australia YouTube channel I've links for that in well I'll put it I'll put it in this as well but it also have links in my uh different posts and everything like that but you can just go to 60 Minutes Australia and it's it mentions carnivore diet and uh it sort of lumps it in with uh different sort of fat diets and things like that but we'll get to that so the you know my experience with it was was really great it was really positive you know everyone on the 60 Minutes team was was excellent they were they were all really really nice people they were all genuinely interested in uh what we had what we were talking about obviously there's a bit of skepticism with something as as uh new and different as uh eating this way and that's totally understandable but they were awesome they were really really good uh we we spent the whole day in Sydney starting in the morning we did the interview face-to-face interview part we spoke for about 20 minutes and then we went off and did sort of like a workout on Bandai beach at the open air gym and then went and had some steaks at um I think massaria if I'm pronouncing that right just down on Bandai Beach which is awesome and the the owner met there and I spoke for a while as well he's a really nice guy and has a great set up there people hasn't haven't seen that that's it's like a butcher but you know you can go into like a normal butcher shop but then they'll just cook the steaks for you too so you can you can buy meat and go home with it or they can actually cook it for you and so um just a quick question there I just saw here someone said you know when do you typically see Improvement in health being on a carnivore diet generally pretty pretty soon so usually about two weeks you get most of this junk out of your system you feel a lot better and and then you start just feeling better and better and better you need to make sure you're eating enough make sure you're eating enough uh fatty meat get enough fat eat till full eat till meat stops tasting good and yeah but generally people will see significant improvements within a couple weeks and then they'll just get better after that so um the uh the interviews all went fine and and you know at first you know there was quite a bit of skeptical sort of questions like really and what about this and that but at the same time you know as as the day wore on and we talked about more things behind camera behind the camera people were getting more and more interested sort of you know sort of sent people different different links and things like that that they could sort of check out and what do you know at the end of the day when everyone's having their lunch everyone's ordered steaks and they didn't get anything else so uh at least for the you know the camera crew and things like that that you know at least they uh certainly seem to be interested in that as well so hopefully they'll look into that more and um but someone said I should invoice them for my time now it's um no you know the thing is though is that this is going to be met with skepticism from the mainstream of course it is you know and so you know when we um when we uh you know our first sort of making an appearance on the mainstream venues and things like that it's going it's going to be questioned that's just that's just how it's going to be and so we have to we have to sort of expect that and but hopefully just enough people will see that and maybe you know be interested or intrigued enough to then say okay well what is this guy that sounds really weird but maybe I'll go see what he has to say or maybe I'll go see what he has to say to see just how full of it he is and then they go see and they go actually you know maybe that that makes a bit more sense than I thought it did or that I thought it would so I think that's that's what we can hope for at the moment and even um and even when people even when people are are you know skeptical of this and putting out you know posts that are just like well is this really the right thing to do other people get interested and so I've had other news outlets um well one in particular that's um that wanted to you know do another interview with me to to talk more about it so that's good so it opens the door for more things now as for what they sort of put out there um obviously it would have been nice if they were very positive about it they weren't negative about it in the sense that they said this is a bad idea but they had they you know lumped me in with a lot of other groups that were not necessarily something that they were speaking positively about so I sort of got lumped in with with people that they were saying oh these people just they're just sort of after a diet fat to try to sort of you know get money out of people and you know sell their products or something like that where the whole idea with the cardboard that is there's no product there isn't a product that you that you have to have and that was one of the things that they talked about with that Dr Ed's character uh who people you know would probably know he did a video about me that he had no basis for doing just sort of made up a bunch of nonsense uh having not actually watched the video and so it was very easy to just do a response video to him showing that he was quite ignorant on that subject and um you know really needed to do a better job at uh of researching what the hell is going on and um hey Rory good to see you buddy and um so you know they were saying there's like yes well you know they come up with this problem that you have that you have and only their solution will fix it and so you know then they'll they'll sell it to you which is actually the vegan crowd because they say you know like like look at the um the game changers documentary they said that well you need protein and but you can't get it from me because meat's really bad for you and it's toxic and these people that go away from meat they do so much better and look at these just top athletes and they're so wonderful but you need protein so where are you going to get it well it just happens to be that um you know that uh uh James Cameron who's the executive producer of Game Changers just happened his own 140 million dollars worth of op protein company which wouldn't you know so you need protein can't get it from me just happen to have this product right here for you so that's not what the carnival guide is the longboard diet is you don't need these products you don't need to do anything you just need to eat meat you just need to eat the right thing and that was actually something the doctor had said say hey you know the secret to health is very easy you just have to eat right and move your body I agree with that we just disagree with what eating right is and um you know and uh if we're both sort of doing the same thing you know I think our results speak for themselves you know I you know I've been doing this for a very long time he's been doing what he's doing for a while and our results are entirely different so you know I think that that can uh tell you something there as well and um but the idea is the same you don't need a product you don't need to sell anything you don't need anything extra and we actually talked about that in that 20-minute segment and then we actually talked more at the restaurant and so obviously there was a good 30 minutes of our discussion that that didn't get used fine but we did cover this and we did talk about how you know there was a lot of you know cover-ups from the food industry pasting over you know 100 years of medical literature and Science and saying that that meat wasn't good for us and that was bad for us in order to protect their product and to push their own agenda and that's not good and that's something that's that's well documented it's in the peer-reviewed literature this is not a question this is not up for debate this is a historical fact and we have documentation of this in in the published literature so you know that's not really uh in question um so you know me saying hey you know you can we can actually we're actually spending trillions of dollars a year in America and around the world treating medical conditions that are a direct result of eating the wrong thing and all we have to do is eat the correct thing to our biologically appropriate design and you don't need any of these and we save trillions of dollars that's redirected and much more worthwhile and fruitful directions right so so I was arguing that you you can get away from these things you can get off these medications you can get a better life and uh Better Health and and save money save a lot of money uh by just eating properly so I didn't think it was entirely fair to lump me in with uh these other people that they were saying you know these guys are just scamming you and they're just trying to you know get your money and have have a product and things like that um and so you know that's uh you know I didn't think that that was entirely Fair now they didn't say that well this is Anthony and he's trying to sell you something you know but that was the premise of the entire show and so that sort of that sort of the sort of guilt by association in that uh in that regard so which was a bit disappointing but at the same time you know it got some people out there thinking about this sort of stuff and at least being you know made aware of it made aware that there there is a discussion and there are people sort of doing this and I think there was there's been a really good response to uh these you know you know these these videos by people going in and commenting and saying hey you know I've I've you know gone on Carnivore and it's changed my life I lost you know 120 pounds I've reversed these these illnesses I've come off these medications and this has really helped me this is really changing people's lives and you guys shouldn't be uh you know uh you know critical of it well you should be critical of anything but you shouldn't be uh you know derogatory and you should at least give it a chance and uh and allow people to to you know see what they think or at least look into it more you know it was great that they had me on for a conversation it would have been even better if they had you know actually published that entire conversation because I think it would have been much better for people I think it would have been interesting for people to actually hear the entire arguments I mean I think they did choose some good choice uh lines and good choice arguments that I made but they certainly weren't the you know the whole body of arguments and certain certainly weren't the whole you know the whole totality of our discussion because we spoke for 30 minutes on camera you know like 20 minutes in that original segment and then like another 10 minutes uh when we were when we were eating steaks and we're talking about you know these different you know these different facts that you know like the sugar companies paid off all these uh horrible professors and this is this is published in the medical literature and the general American Medical Association and uh you know and a lot of other things as well so I think it's important to have those conversations and hopefully this this opens the door and then subsequently The Daily Mail in the UK actually ran with a story basically taking sort of verbatim What was was said in in that and um and uh sort of published it but it was sort of funny they said you know this bizarre contention of eating only meat from a doctor hasn't eaten vegetables in five years or something like that I thought it was very funny and obviously people lost their minds in the comments oh my God what the hell is this but at the same time then people came on and and replied they were saying hey this is that there's actually more to it than this and there's actually something here and people are getting a lot better I'm getting a lot better I get it I've gotten improved my health by you know you know all these different metrics so it's really good I appreciate everyone who who did that who went on there and told their story and and said how how much this has helped them because it's really important when people see these these videos and these and these stories they're going to be very very taken aback me like this is crazy this goes against everything my my mommy told me and so therefore it has to be wrong and so um and so being able to go on there and people saying actually this isn't this isn't a problem you know your mom did the best she could but she was she was told a lie too and you know and this is this is how it is and people's lives are getting a lot better because of this so um you know so the um you know so I think that's great and I think getting that that conversation out there in the open air and talked about more it has been great so that's been awesome so if people have questions about that uh happy to field them or if they have other questions we'll try to try to field those as well and we can just have a have a bit of a talk I do have to go in about 30 minutes because I have an interview to do um but uh we can we can certainly chat until then um just uh a question here from uh vizian air why am I not losing weight I feel amazing by the way well the main thing is that you feel great the main thing is you focus on your health there are a lot of people that will lose significant amount of weight early on and that's great but you also have to understand that this isn't always the case that people will lose them away immediately but uh it will happen eventually you know if you have excess fat to lose that that's going to come off the people that have a lot of hormonal disruption and a lot of problems with their metabolism and their health that their body is saying hey you know we need to hold on to this because they've been starving and fasting and eating the wrong things for so many years that they're that their metabolism is just shot and their hormones are shot and they're in a state where their bodies in in a state of Perpetual panic and fear that you're in a famine because that's what you that's the signals you've been giving it is that there isn't enough food there is not enough nutrition available and so it needs to sequester and store and hang on to this extra fat because you're going to die otherwise right and that's it that's just how we work and So eventually those hormones like leptin will start normalizing and other things will improve as well your thyroid function will probably get better as well metabolism will start ramping up and and then all of a sudden the fat will start coming off also remember that it's not about weight loss you're you're worried about fat loss and body composition and so um when people are going on this it's actually a lot easier to put on muscle mass and you actually and people actually do increase bone density as well and that's something that people say you can't really do after 25 [\u00a0__\u00a0] I see it happen all the time um and so if you're eating a proper diet and especially if you're exercising you're doing resistance training you will put on bone density and and even if you're osteoporetic or a osteopenia you can improve your bone density even in middle age or late age I see it happen all the time and so uh don't don't don't listen to um people that say that because that's in the context of eating stupid things and eating the wrong thing and eating the wrong diet and not being healthy eating a whole bunch of plant-based blah blah blah yeah well if you're eating that you're not going to be able to put on bone density I agree with that and you're going to strip your body of minerals and uh yeah and your bone density will go down so don't do that eat a proper diet and your boat Nancy will go up your muscle density will go up and therefore your weight will go up as well and so you may not lose weight but are you not losing weight because you're not losing fat or you're not losing weight because you're losing fat but you're also gaining muscle and bone density and so that's something you have to think about as well so when I first started this uh I just stopped eating vegetables and I lost 23 pounds or 10 kilos in 10 days and then I stop losing weight I I lost no weight I stayed exactly the same weight for months after that but my body was completely transforming I was just stripping fat off my body and gaining a lot of muscle so I I just exactly matched uh my muscle gain and fat loss don't know why don't know how that that you know why it was just a perfect one for one like that but it was and so I gained uh no weight but I lost no weight at all but I lost a ton of that and so that could be happening as well so look at how your parents take monthly and I mean monthly don't take daily or weekly you need to just you give it some time and take monthly pictures you know in the mirror uh with you know sort of you know less clothes on so you can see your body and see the changes that are being made because you might be changing your body habits you might be changing your body composition you can also get a dexa scan body composition scan now and then in six months this isn't this isn't going to happen overnight for some people some and even for me you know I was it took eight months before I got to a stable body fat percentage and and then just maintain that eight months but you know what it was a dramatic difference all the time so I got I got a very very big results pretty rapidly just from like lifting weights and that I was back playing rugby as well uh and then I you know hurt my knee and I couldn't play rugby anymore so I um after that I was just lifting weights and that's actually when I started losing weight was when I stopped being able to play rugby and do squats because I wasn't I wasn't able to do squats I was able to run so my late I actually lost muscle mass which is why I lost weight and so that wasn't what I wanted to lose so you know you don't actually necessarily want to lose weight you want to lose fat and you want to put on muscle and you want to put on bone density so just be mindful of that but number one first and foremost think about your health you feel great that's great make sure you're eating enough make sure you're getting enough fat especially because this is an important nutrient it's not just it's not just a calorie Source it is a an essential nutrient of essential amino acids or sorry fatty acids and uh fat soluble vitamins so it's very very important to give enough fat it's very important to get enough meat and if you do that continually you will stimulate your metabolism to ramp up and you will lose fat and so you will but you know look at Kelly Hogan you know she has a very good story of it she actually gained weight and she thinks she was actually not only putting on muscle but probably putting on fat as well for about six months and then overnight all of a sudden it just things just started just dumping off of her she's been very very slender for you know the next 13 years and um and has been you know you know very good since that so you know and being able to maintain that that uh body happiness ever since then and that's and that's what people notice this is this is you lose the weight you gain the health and you can maintain it and sustain it for the rest of your life because this is not a diet you're not dieting you're just changing the way you're eating you're changing your lifestyle and that's and that's and you're going to perpetuate that so these are new habits these are new uh this is a new way of living and and that's how I look at it I'm not on a diet this is just how I eat you know a lion is not on a diet that's just how they eat you know cows are not on a diet they're oh they're so restrictive they're only eating grass they have good that's because that's the only thing that's food for them and uh and then that's the way they eat and so this is the way I eat and this is the way I think biological and humans are meant to eat and so you know if you are eating that way good things will happen and so even if you're not losing weight even if you're not losing fat right away eventually it will eventually will happen so focus on your health first and foremost how you're feeling your energy levels Your Sleep Quality you know medications you might be coming off of the money you're saving from not going to doctors and getting all these expensive treatments and all these benefits in your life focus on that as a distant second think about your body composition never at all does does weight on the scale make the list okay that is not something you should ever worry about if you're ever going to worry about something like that you worry about body composition not weight on the scale okay because the weight on the scale doesn't matter with your health matters and not everybody's going to be able to to get back down to you know an ideal teenage body fat percentage unfortunately um people's bodies are made a bit differently the things we've done to our bodies are different and so sometimes that you can't undo all of that but what you can do is you can maximize your health and you can maximize your energy and you can you can get off a lot of medications a lot of medications and you can stop in their tracks a lot of these chronic diseases and stop them before they start or in many cases reverse th em um David thank you very much you just give me a fan"

        "body": "em um David thank you very much you just give me a fan em um David thank you very much you just give me a fan Super Chat thank you so much I appreciate that all right so let's see if we have any more questions here oh goodness okay so Nat Lavelle asks uh Dr chafee what is your opinion on fruits for someone like myself who's extremely active and trains a lot you always mention that plants are bitter and don't want us to eat them but uh fruits are sweet so fruits are delicious yeah but but Sugar's a drug and that and that's the main thing so this is why yes you know if something tastes bad that's your brain and your tongue giving you a clear signal inside that there's something bad in there and it says don't eat this spit this out right um so if something tastes bad then I would say you really don't want to eat it that's a very good rule of thumb but that doesn't mean that everything that tastes good necessarily is good for you there are outliers like sugar and fructose in particular is very very sweet most of the carbohydrates are mildly sweet at best and well like I said when you go on a carnivore diet then your taste of sweet gets a lot stronger so like when I drink whole milk it's like I'm drinking ice cream it's crazy you know and I don't want to stop so I lit I don't let myself really do that but fructose is much much sweeter much sweeter and this is thought to be because we recognize that as something safe that we aren't that isn't going to kill us if we eat it right so we don't know of any plants that contain fructose that are acutely poisonous that will kill you that day if you eat it okay that doesn't mean there are no defense chemicals in it like citrus fruits all citrus fruits have purana coumarins which are UV sensitive and can burn your skin you get it on your skin like you're squeezing lines that are notorious for this you squeeze those they get on your hands and it gets in the Sun and you blister and get second degree burns um and if you eat them you'll get more more sensitive to these these uh to the UV light as well overall and grapefruit is another one um all citrus all citrus had these coumarines but specifically grapefruit is a good example because this is something that has to be detoxified you have to detoxify these if you're on a coumarins and your liver does this and there's certain enzymes that do that and those certain enzymes also are the ones that metabolize certain medications and I believe statins are one of them so you cannot eat grapefruit with a number of different medications because it will use up too much of that uh that that enzyme and you will end up either not metabolizing the you'll not metabolize the medications properly you should either have too much or too little right and so you can get toxic or ineffective doses of the medications that you're on so that's that's you know to do with that but whether or not they have those things sugar itself fructose in particular is not good for you first of all slams up your your insulin you don't want that that puts you into a fat storage metabolism as opposed to a fat burning metabolism it blocks proteolysis it blocks lipolysis so you are not able to be uh you are not able to access your fat stores if you if you raise your insulin up okay so you even if you eat fruit and you're active yeah okay look you're going to burn off those carbs great but you know what you're not going to be able to do is mobilize your fat stores for the rest of the workout so you're going to have to keep having those little orange wedges or juice or or you know Carby supplements to keep perpetuating your energy because once you run out of your glycogen in your liver and your muscles that's it you're tanked you hit the wall and that's it so if you're doing a shorter workout fine okay it's not going to be a big deal but if you're doing a longer or more heavy workout or playing like a you know a rugby game or you know AFL game NFL game whatever you're playing you're gonna you're gonna run out of glycogen and you're going to feel that garbage and so uh if you don't eat any carbs whatsoever you don't you don't fall into that trap and you will always run on your fat stores and you're not going to run out of your fat stores not not anytime soon anyway you can push yourself as hard as you want to and fructose has been shown to be addictive in the same way as cocaine heroin and meth and shown on MRI studies to kill the same areas of your brain as meth to the same extent as meth okay this is bad this is bad stuff and it also is metabolized and broken down into the same byproducts as alcohol so it goes into the it turns into the same offshoot chemicals break down chemicals as alcohol and so it causes the same damage from those chemicals as alcohol Okay so fatty liver disease sclerosis diabetes heart disease even implicated in things like cancer and Alzheimer's disease so this is not a good thing and so that's why I avoid so my hard rule is no plants no sugar nothing artificial that goes for sauces seasonings and drinks as well but obviously people can do whatever they want you're going to be less damaged by it if you're if you're um you know if you are working out active and you're just having some fruit maybe not as much fructose as if you're drinking fruit juice obviously that's going to be a lot more fructose and some of the fiber and things like that actually block the absorption of fructose fine but it's not ideal it's not exactly what you want to do and you get enough this stuff it will screw up your insulin and your metabolism so for me I don't think it's really worth it but to each their own um David asks d o you ever eat sardine and thank you very much for the"

        "body": "o you ever eat sardine and thank you very much for the o you ever eat sardine and thank you very much for the Super Chat David I appreciate that um do you ever eat sardines or fish to get your Omega-3s yeah sometimes you know I I do um I like sardines and so you know maybe I get them sometimes beef has has plenty of Omega-3s it has a lot more Omega-3s if it's grass finished so you know it's um it's something that some people do where they'll you know if they're not if they're not having all you know grass finished beef um that will have that will have a good omega-3 content maybe they'll just eat some sardines or something like that with their steak so that they have a good omega-3 to omega-6 or ratio when they're eating and so I think that's a that's a fairly decent thing to do uh you want to get make sure that you're getting sardines that are just packed in water uh without a bunch of seasonings and garbage and things like that especially not packed in oil because they don't pack them in fish oil they pack them in sunflower oil or soybean oil or some other god-awful seed oil so you don't want that but you know so you want to get it you want to get it in water um if you can and or you know Cod Liver I think tins of cod liver and have it in their own oil probably not a bad idea as well I honestly haven't noticed too much of a difference in How I Feel adding in sardines um to just eating beef but you know I mean some people that do like sardine fast and things like that they think that works really well for them I haven't looked into that too much myself um but you know you can experiment with things and if you like adding in fish and sardines you know go for it I mean I do like fish I just like beef more and I feel I feel the best on beef but um you know and if you're getting grass-finished beef you'll get you'll get plenty of Omega-3s that'd be fine um okay it was one look up here from Instagram greetings from Greece tell us about carb Cravings after eating beef and salt only how do you get over it well usually those um usually they go away so usually um you can uh you can sort of get over in the first couple weeks so carb Cravings will stay on because again these things are addictive especially sugar is addictive fructose is addictive just like cocaine and meth and again gives a dopamine hit to the addiction centers of your brain right so it's a drug and it takes a while to get over drugs and but it but just like any other other drug abstaining for a certain period of time you will get away from that chemical addiction and your body can recover and so for most people carb and sugar Cravings last about two weeks in general that's a rough sort of thing for people and um and so you feel good uh after that you generally don't need need uh to worry about it after that but if you are getting craving sometimes that can just be your brain say hey we need more energy we need more food and um and uh and so maybe that can be a hunger signal you have to relearn your hunger signals going on a carnivore diet and so it could be that um so it could be that uh you're just hungry and so if you're getting those carb Cravings maybe think okay am I hungry maybe I should eat meat and so you eat meat and you go wow this tastes good that means you're hungry if meat tastes good you're hungry it doesn't taste good you're not and that's how you should that's how you should relearn your hunger signals uh meat tastes good when you're hungry and your body's giving it positive feedback right it gives positive feedback with sugar as well the difference is the sugar is a drug and that things that are drugs give you positive feedback and then they take give me more give me more give me more give me more give me more they never stop right but if something's good for you like me and it's giving you positive feedback as you give it more that positive feedback is less and less and eventually it goes away and then you don't have any positive feedback and your body just goes yep we have enough stop eating in fact if you keep eating meat after that it will start tasting bad and you will not enjoy it so you know it's uh that's how you tell the difference between uh something that's good for you giving you positive feedback something bad for you just give me a positive feedback that's bad for you giving you positive feedback it's going to keep giving you that feedback it's not going to go away like a drug right so if you are if you are having carb Cravings eat more right and make sure that you're eating enough and generally when you eat enough especially fatty meat and you eat till you're full you eat until meat stops tasting good generally you won't really have many carb cravings and after about two weeks they just go away and you'll be good after that so go od luck with that uh David thank you very much for the"

        "body": "od luck with that uh David thank you very much for the od luck with that uh David thank you very much for the Super Chat I just said awesome uh thanks a lot doc great point no problem glad I glad I was able to help um Cali Cali girl asks do you recommend counting calories if you want to lose more than 100 pounds on Carnivore no I don't recommend counting calories ever I recommend just listening to your body your body knows what it wants and knows how much energy it wants and you will you will find that probably aren't eating all that much in comparison um and so you know it's um it's actually okay so you can you can listen you know maybe some days you're you're eating a steak and it's just like this it really isn't enjoyable I don't really like this and um and that's okay you don't have to eat you don't have to eat that day but you should eat as much as your body is asking you now some people find that they aren't eating enough and maybe they count calories they realize like oh Jesus I am really under eating and I should really eat a lot more and so that can be helpful but I would never limit the amount of calories just because they're calories first of all calories are stupid metric really really really not great because these are complex organic molecules they have complex chemical interactions in your body there are dozens of different uh carbohydrates they all have ex they all have unique chemical properties and interactions there are dozens of different amino acids they all have unique chemical interactions and properties there are hundreds of fatty acids and they all have unique and individual chemical reactions you cannot you cannot boil these down to just the amount of energy that is released when you burn them because that's what a calorie is so that's not a good metric we are not combustion engines we are chemical power plants right and so these you eat these things you can't just say oh a calories of calories a calorie is a calorie because that that's honestly just insane and so you know if someone is saying that and they're a doctor and they've taken Biology and they've taken biochemistry and organic chemistry like they need to go back and and revise those books because that is a remarkably ignorant statement that it all comes down to just the amount of energy that's burned off from from burning these sorts of things there's a bunch of calories in Wood all right does that does that mean anything significant to us no because they're they're bound up in ways that we can't access and don't matter to us but there's a lot of calories who cares so it's important to um it's important to understand that and it's important to understand that uh you know these are nutrients your body's going for nutrients that is a nutrient proteins are nutrients these vitamins and minerals are nutrients and your body wants nutrients it's not going for calories it's going for nutrients and so you need to give your body enough nutrients and nutrition and so if you are doing that you will actually stimulate your metabolism you actually have you um have your metabolism ramp up and you'll actually lose more weight you know we know this like they're you know bariatric surgeons and things like that will tell people after they've gotten a bypass um that you have to eat at least 1200 calories a day I believe that's for women maybe more from men but anyway for women it's 1200 I remember one telling me and they said below that you won't lose weight so why is that you're eating less calories and all and we're just combustion engines so you're eating less calories and you're not losing weight why is that well because we're not combustion engines we're very very complex biochemical creatures and so you actually reduce the amount of energy available and you're going to reduce your metabolism your body's gonna go hey we're in a famine we're we don't have resources we need to shut this down we need to slow everything down so that we don't run out of resources and die because it's about self-preservation your body is smarter than you are all right it's going to let us know what to do so you need to give your body what it needs and your body will do what it needs to do and it sort of it goes against everything we've been told but again all of this does and everything we've been told for the last 40 years is complete carbons and verifiably garbage so see for yourself um you know and and make sure you're getting enough nutrition you know your body will stop you it will start tasting bad when your body says that's enough and so you can listen to that if you're eating correctly if you're eating a biologically appropriate diet you can listen to your biology all right it's one of the major senses taste right and that and that will d ictate we'll tell you what what it wants to do okay um"

        "body": "ictate we'll tell you what what it wants to do okay um ictate we'll tell you what what it wants to do okay um super chat from uh Christina Perez thank you so much uh what is your experience with carnivore and epilepsy my son 17 is getting flat from his dietitian while his dietitian used to read a damn book because there's a hundred years of medical literature on the subject of epilepsy and ketogenic diets in fact that's the only treatment we had for epilepsy for God knows how many decades and before that it was fasting and I figured out that you can have this ketogenic diet and mimic fasting really fasting mimics ketogenic diets but we have literally 100 Years of very robust scientific literature and experiments showing that epilepsy is is helped uh to to a large extent and sometimes cured not always but sometimes cured by going on a ketogenic diet carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet unless you're in the fruit and honey Camp which I would not recommend for people I don't think that that's the right way to do it I think that sugar is not good for us and especially if you're talking about epilepsy or cancer or something like that absolutely not you do not want any of that stuff in your life and so if someone has epilepsy being on a carnivore diet is going to be exceptional for ketogenics right being a ketogenic state which is better for your brain you're feeling your brain in a better Manner and this this seems to help with epilepsy but number two you are also eliminating a whole bunch of other neurotoxins that can interrupt your your normal brain chemistry and um you know think about caffeine caffeine it was developed as a neurotox it is a neurotoxin it was developed as an insecticide to kill insects trying to eat the plants right that affects your brain and that can that can act an excitatory sort of manner that is the last thing you want to do if you have epilepsy if you have a predisposition to get your neurons so excited that they that they start a seizure um that is not what you want okay so I have seen a lot of people help with a ketogenic diet and I've seen some people that a ketogenic diet improve their epilepsy significantly but wasn't quite enough to get them over the finish line and then going on a carnivore diet seemed to help and then one gentleman mentioned that the caffeine thing he had he had a cup of coffee and all of a sudden he had a grandma seizure bad bad bad bad thing to do so he was like this stuff's toxic I'm not going anywhere near it he was keto this wasn't sugar-filled coffee it was black coffee right so that's something to think about as well and so if the dietitians say oh my God you know that's not good for you they need to read a damn book and that and that that really bothers me because they if someone is a dietitian working with epilepsy patients they should damn well know that um that is that is not a new thing that is a very very well established thing and it's not even and it's not even like oh it wasn't as good as medications no it was great in fact some cases was even better and you know there's people that are on four different medications and they're still having seizures and they go keto and uh and it goes away right um Johns Hopkins still uses a ketogenic diet to treat epilepsy number one Hospital in the world ranks quite often you know changes every year but you know quite often there there are the top hospital if not or one of the top hospitals in the world they still use a ketogenic diet or at least last that I checked I saw a paper from them I guess that's older now it's probably like 10 15 years old but you know they at that time they were still using a ketogenic diet this is in the damn literature it works the reason that they switch to pharmacology is a big influence by big Pharma saying hey you should do this you should just use medications it's so much easier blah blah blah I think and it is easier that's what people said don't worry about ketog diet we have a pill now they're safe and effective and it's easier it's easier to just give someone a pill instead of counseling them and talking to them and trying to get them to change their diets radically right and some people don't want to do that but you know what a lot of people are fine and I spoke to a lady her daughter was having seizures and um and I just sort of mentioned to her I was just like you know actually you know there's there are a lot of different uh there's tons of data on this where where you know for 100 years we have literature that a ketogenic diet can actually significantly help um uh you know epilepsy especially in pediatric populations and um and I just said so you know something you can look into just ketogenic diet just cutting out carbs I can actually significantly help uh epilepsy and she went oh oh really wow yeah no that's great yeah no we'll try that like that so easy it's no problem right um we don't realize how willing able and eager people are for straightforward Solutions like that and not having to dump in a bunch of chemicals in their body or their kids bodies and if they knew that there was a solution that is so elegant as just this dietary remodeling that is going to help them in so many other ways as well you know if you don't even try that I think that I think that that's um that's a failure of of the doctor and the clinician you know that after that you know if they were like yeah no it's not really working for me fine you know they're immense there and but that's a second line to me and then some people I've heard some people say that their neurologists say no you don't want to go on a ketogenic diet because if you come off and ketogenic diet there's a rebound effect first of all [\u00a0__\u00a0] that's not true um uh in fact the longer you go without a seizure the less likely you are to have a seizure again okay um and uh you know it's like it's the same idea with medication or if you come off your medication uh for epilepsy well then you might have a seizure like okay well then don't come off your medication right don't come off the ketogenic diet you know you're not going to have if you have like a candy bar once and all of a sudden just when you primed to have a seizure that's not the case you know if you if you go off of it and continue to stay off of it yeah you're gonna you're gonna undo some of the goods you did for yourself but um so anyway uh I I take Serious exception to people trying to dissuade people from especially clinicians from dissuading people to do do a ketogenic diet and actually get off meds and actually help themselves I mean I think that is just so irresponsible I honestly consider it malpractice um because you know these medications do cause harm they're not benign and they're not they're not free from a health perspective or a pocketbook perspective and so this comes at a cost to people it comes to the cost of their lives it makes them feel horrible they have you know it changes their cognition they're tired all the time they gain weight it's not good and so you know not being on these things is better if they if they can be I think it's they're very important if you need them but uh you don't always need them um okay so there's a couple other super chats thank you so much I I I'm gonna have to go after these two so um maybe don't give me more super chats um because I may not be able to answer them guys so um one from uh hendo uh says calcium scans 149 and 59 year old male no cardiac symptoms not diabetic 95 carnivore should I be concerned being on a carnivore diet no I don't think so at all um you know you're having that calcium scan um that's that build up takes years and years and years you know when you were not carnivore also you know that's a that's a that's a snapshot in time and so you take that picture now you stay on Carnivore that number can come down and I've seen it come down it comes down a lot of people and we even seeing on uh angiogram things like that blockages actually restore um Dr um Dr Sean O'Mara has done studies with over 6 000 patients looking at abdominal MRIs looking at visceral fat found that like blockage interest cerebral blockages uh actually reverse when you when you get that visceral fat down and he says not my words he says and he's the visceral fat expert carnivore die is the best diet to get your visceral fat down and then exercise you want you want high intensity anaerobic exercise like sprinting hit training so high intensity interval training or weight lifting those are the best best things to do to reduce your visceral fat and you reduce your visceral fat you can reverse these blockages and uh and uh uh calcium scores so that is um so that's something you should look at and think about it um and then there's"

        "body": "hat more regularly I think and um oh and just the last hat more regularly I think and um oh and just the last Super Chat thank you very much uh for that Sharon please please uh don't give me any more Super chats guys because I really do have to go in two minutes um but Sharon says my doc says I can't do cardboard because I don't have a gallbladder or your your doctor doesn't know um your physiology because gallbladder is not where bile is made the liver makes bile and your liver will still make bile um it just won't store it in a gallbladder and it'll just go out into your into your bowels right and so you just sometimes you won't be able to eat like a huge amount of fat at the same time it'll it'll just sort of go through you because you don't have enough bile because it takes you know 24 hours you know you're not you're not going to have 24 hours 48 hours of bile stored up in your gallbladder um or a week or two stored up in your gallbladder that you can push out in one go and get like a huge body of that in one one sitting so you might just have to split up your fatty meals throughout the day but bile's still there it's still being made by your by your liver and quite a lot of people form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is now patching of your common bile duct and acts exactly the same as a gallbladder so it has the exact same function and um you know and and so you you may not even have an issue with that so there are a lot of people doing carnivore and they just eat once a day eat a big fatty meal and they don't get diarrhea from the Overflow of the unabsorbed fat so yes you can absolutely do uh carnivore without a gallbladder um you will have uh you have no problem with that you just may need to split up your meals throughout the day and uh that's fine so it's easy to do um and then last question is can carnivore reduce colon polyps 100 that is that has been shown to be strongly associated with insulin resistance and so any ketogenic diet will have will reverse colon polyps and even skin tags basically colon polyps or skin tags on the inside right and so it'll help your skin tags your sort of dark discoloration under the axilla that can that that can be from insulin resistant High insulin chronically High insulin as well so you come off all that nonsense you come off the carbs and again when I talk about carnivore I mean a ketogenic carnivore diet I do not ever talk about you know having fruit and honey and things like that and not being in a state of or on a ketogenic diet you're not going to need ketosis all the time but you know you shouldn't be eating a whole bunch of carbs so if you're on a carnivore diet if I'm saying a carbo diet will help x y and z it is because you know if part of that is the is the keto part of it so there are a lot of studies there aren't a lot all this all these studies looking at carnivore specifically with you know helping something but there are thousands of studies showing that a ketogenic diet does these sorts of things and a carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet if done properly right so when I'm talking about that I mean I mean it as part of a ketogenic diet I mean carnivore diet as a subset of ketogenic diet so um so that's it so thank you everyone uh we're gonna wrap there I do want to do these more often and maybe go for a little longer similar date and time but um uh probably a little bit earlier probably probably uh be able to get on earlier if I can um and just last one I saw here uh do you eat one meal a day uh yeah generally if you eat enough fatty meat at one time I'm generally not hungry for about 24 hours if I'm working out more I usually eat about twice because I'm not getting all um enough uh you know not going to get it all in one go but yeah okay thank you all every everyone I really appreciate you coming on it's great to see everyone here thanks for participating and I will see you next time take care"
