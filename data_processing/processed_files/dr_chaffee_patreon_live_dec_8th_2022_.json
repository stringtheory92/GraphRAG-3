        "body": "foreign back for round two uh thanks everyone for for being uh patient with that sorry about the technical issues is everyone able to hear me now can you hear me now maybe not can people hear me hello hello hello [Music] type yes if you can hear me okay no I can't hear you Steve unfortunately yes okay great all right so we'll start off with uh the questions and as usual I think people have more questions um we can uh sort of ask them in the chat and then we can address them at the end or maybe hold them to the end and then we can sort of ask them or ask them and we'll keep track of them and go first come first serve um all right take it away Eleanor all right so Luke has two questions his first question is is what is the longest you can drive Brian's Steak in the fridge before it goes bad um you can well it will never really go bad it will just go very dry so you'll get um just too dry it will just turn into beef jerky at the end of the day so if it's salted and it's not touching anything then it's not going to go bad it's not going to grow bacteria and so it'll just get too dry and hard and it won't be a very nice texture or maybe a great texture would be trick is awesome but you don't want to do that to a nice steak I don't think and so I find that for like a big thick say like big big thick steaks um they're like you even as much as two weeks actually is okay it gets just a bit too dry after that thinner steaks but still thick like an inch and a half um probably good sweet spot is around five to seven days and that's what I think is like a good sweet spot for um texture and flavor but you know teach their own but that's that's sort of what what I do okay his second question was also do you recommend supplementing with leval anything else during pregnancy yeah I don't think you need to I think I think it's individual I think sometimes people are just going to need a bit different nutrients and pregnancy you're going to need sort of more of everything and while you can be fine just eating normal muscle meat um it might be that you maybe maybe need a little more liver every now and then so if liver tastes good and you enjoy it you know go for that's probably you know that's a positive feedback that your body you know wants those nutrients and so you can just listen to that and just have some of that um and obviously if you're you know deficient in something you should definitely you know uh you know take something like liver or even supplement if you have to it's very rare that people have to but um if you need to you need to and pregnancy is definitely one of those times you want to make sure you have all the right nutrients but yeah I mean there's there's plenty of people that have just done pregnancies on just rib eyes you know like the Andersons they did all their kids on just realized they've just eaten realized so it should be fine but if you like whoever eat liver and that's probably um you know a sign that your body wants it if it tastes good um the next question is from Mike and he has said Dr Berry just put out this video saying A1C doesn't include glycogen from fructose glycation from fructose and there isn't a test that does perhaps that perhaps that's why celadino brags his A1C is normal with so much fruit it's a shame there is no test it may awaken more people to fruit hazards can you talk a little bit about the reason why we don't see the effects of glycation from fructose in a in our A1c uh yeah so that was actually news to me um you know fructose is actually has has more um you know you know it is has stronger glycation sort of properties than than glucose as meaning that it it will physically fuse to other things at a higher rate than glucose will um but that was that was actually something that um it sort of makes sense intuitively like you you are you are measuring the amount of you know damage to your body from high blood sugar and high blood sugar is glucose right so that makes sense but I never really thought about in those terms before um so that's something that um you know it's just something that that I would have to look into the mechanisms and what they're actually testing for but it makes sense you know I mean they're looking for a glycation product of glucose and and um hemoglobin so that's just a very specific model molecule you know bound up damaged molecule that they're looking for but uh yeah you're right you know that's that's that could be a reason why um you know people who eat a lot of fruit and honey aren't necessarily seeing the full Repro repercussions and ramifications of their actions just yet you know but you know they could and you know when you work out a lot you will burn some of this stuff up you will turn it into glycogen and you will make um you know energy out of it and you'll use that energy so you could offset a lot of the fructose that that you're eating as well but you know it's it's not going to be perfect and it's not going to be as good as it could be but uh yeah it would be interesting to get a test that that could uh test for that more but um yeah so just yeah I guess that's the thing you know if you're eating these sorts of things you just don't be fooled by a lower hpa1c because it's not necessarily um the full picture [Music] and he asks uh burn in or boneless which do you prefer do you eat the cartilage around the bones of the meats I saw this in one video of a messiah man cleaning a bone like it's no one's business yeah yeah I've always done that I was like a kid when I had like drumsticks and the chicken I would just I would just eat that I would eat the cartilage around the outside and on both sides and yeah I always love the cartilage and yeah I love well I mean like any steak but like stick on the bone like a rib eye I could be Tomahawk like it's just I don't know it's just more Primal you just have it on the bone you're just like gnawing on the bone chewing on the bone I'm like a dog or something like that just just gnawing and chewing on this thing and um and yeah I I chew uh as much of it as I can often so you know getting all the little bits and cartilage and connective tissue and things like that is uh is great I just I like it I always think of it as as uh like meat meat gum you know you're just you know just chewing and chewing and chewing it's just this great meat flavor I always like that as a kid beautiful burn in or burnless he asked as well I said I like both but I but I but I like the bone too it's more Primal yeah I like gnawing on the bone as well yeah Steve uh has the next question what are your thoughts on adult stem cells being released after or around a 72 hour fast uh in Brackets bar k has mentioned this so you know that's not something that um I've looked too deeply into I'm more of sort of like the the the big picture sort of kind of guy like this is just how we're supposed to eat and this is just biologically what we're supposed to do and and it's cool to find out like all the different things that our bodies do during that time but at the end of the day I'm just happy that my body does it I just let it let it do its thing um I also don't know if that's comparing a 72 hour fast on a standard diet with carbohydrates versus 72 hour fast versus a fasting mimicking diet like ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet and is there a difference you know a lot of these a lot of these tests with a fasting mimicking diet you know we have a lot of tests or studies that look at fasting and show a lot of benefit like Stem Cell release and they test these against fasting mimicking diet right they call you know so you're mimicking fasting by going to a fasting metabolism which is just ketosis right so they actually find that that you can actually get the same effects just from being in a fasting mimicking diet right so it's really more about the metabolism that you're in rather than abstaining from eating and and depriving your body of nutrients it's more that you're keeping away things that are harming your body and then you get you know your body works better so I I've spoken to people about fasting I should talk to Bar K I don't know I mean if anyone's going to know about these studies he would but a lot of people like Dr jayquish Who is very knowledgeable in this you know they they they haven't really um known about any any studies like comparing like keto diet to just fasting and is there much of a difference they're the only studies that really look at that are the fasting mimicking diet studies looking at fasting mimicking diet versus fasting and in those studies depending what you're looking at I haven't seen one look specifically for adult stem cells but those ones that they found that you actually have the same benefits from from fasting mimicking diet as a fasting diet and sometimes you actually had better effects from a fasting mimicking diet because you're still getting nutrients you're still getting meat you're getting things that you need and that your body wants and you're also eliminating out all this other stuff your body doesn't want and it kicks you off into this um you know abnormal metabolism that your body doesn't want to be in and so you know when you're in ketosis when you're on a keto diet a fast American diet you'll still release stem cells you'll still go through autophagy and your body will clean up these these um CNL cells and just just sort of clean house and your body's going to do that anyway and I think that um you know you just eat meat and slit your body get on with it and I wouldn't I wouldn't have any reason to doubt that your body's just going to be doing that and releasing stem cells uh just as it would if you're fasting so um but that's something I should talk more about because maybe maybe he has has some information that shows it actually just not eating at all is better than eating meat during that time or is it just a metabolic thing it's a good question but uh you get most of the benefits just from not eating carbs and not eating other plant junk that we're not really designed to eat and just eating the right things um this is a general question uh what do you think of the antioxidant took a feral took a feral as an ingredient in food so tocopherol is just vitamin E so vitamin E is good and um so I'm you know if it and it comes in your food then then that's great you know it's um you know it's a vitamin that we need that's good for us and and that's great you there's there's just a one thing that I would say about tocopherol is that it could be feral could be talking feral acetate it could be called by a number of different things um obviously you know people who push around that vitamin is really good for your skin it is but it can actually be mutated and and changed with UV light and so it's actually not a good idea to have moisturizer or sunscreen or lotion or even just vitamin E put on your skin and then go out in the sun you want to you could put it on after the Sun and then and that can that can help protect your skin and and help your skin recover from the exposure to UV light but when you go in the UV light it can actually damage the the vitamin E and can actually mutate it into something that's actually quite harmful for your skin and actually increases your risk of skin cancer by by 20 fold okay so that was that was I don't have a study for that that was just taught to me by the professor of Dermatology uh when I was in medical school and I just of all the of the entire module of Dermatology that's the only thing I ever remembered so it just sort of stuck with me but um but that's uh that's just something that I always remember so I always always keep an eye out for tocopherol anytime I'm looking at moisturizers or you know back when I you know I never use sunblock anyway I never really was a big fan of that that was another thing with sunblock there's a ton of chemicals and like what do these chemicals do okay they block the UV light but what else do they do they have other properties and they soak into your skin and they get in your body and they have they have other things that they do to you and they're not necessarily good for you and um I remember learning as a kid you know we never use anything more than SPF 15 when I was a kid when I was like yeah you know after this it doesn't really do much benefit and you can get all these other chemicals it's not good for you so we only we would never use anything more than SPF 15 living in Southern California and then we relearned that when I was in medical school so the second the only two things that I remember from uh Dermatology was um was that after SPF 15 SPF 15 blocks 85.5 of the UV light and so that's pretty much as good as you're going to get and you get up to like SPF 30 is blocking off 99 and then 50 is 99.3 percent and then SPF 70 is 99.5 and you know SPF 90 is 99.7 so you're getting diminishing returns you're not really getting much bang for your buck and you're getting like five times the amount of chemicals to get that um that SPF so it's um you know it's just there's no point you know and um you know so we're going to use sunscreen which I don't I just use Tallow at this point and just be my skin moisturized and healthy and my body takes care of the rest but if you were to use it you know anything over SPF 15 is probably not a good idea and also look on the back more on the front for vitamin E or tocopherol or anything like that um because I just I would just avoid that in general uh when I go into the Sun but after after the sun's great and then your food's fine I wouldn't add item you know I don't think you need to you know pour Vitamin E oil on your on your food or anything but um yeah if it's in if it's in there it's great yeah I mean he's good okay does Carnival help mnd uh someone of neuron disease is um that's a good question um there's there's no real data on that there's there's anecdotes um and there are people that [Music] um you know that have you know had some benefit from it you're going to benefit right so you there's like a thousand different reasons a thousand different ways that you're going to benefit from uh you know getting on a proper human diet a proper biologically appropriate diet okay your body's just going to work better in a lot of ways um and so it's going to benefit you in a lot of ways anyway even if it doesn't help the the mnd um at the moment it's just anecdotal there there have been people you'll be like I do get a lot of messages and talk to a lot of people I'm in a lot of these forums and there are people that have benefited from that that we've seen is it because their body's just doing a lot better because they're just healthier in general in a lot of other ways or is it because their disease process is improving I don't know uh that's something we need to study need to look at but you know proper human nutrition is still proper human nutrition even even if you can't reverse something you know horrible like mnd um so you know it's still beneficial to eat an appropriate diet and um and let your body uh be as healthy as it can be genetically um okay all right so Olivia said she sent a couple more questions and emails that's fine so yeah uh does vitamin D need to be taken with fat for absorption it's better it's better to because it's a fat soluble vitamin and like the other fat soluble vitamins like vitamin A vitamin E vitamin K these are good to take in in salute you know with with fat you know that's why they're generally like vitamin D would be in in like an oil base right same with vitamin E you can just get straight Vitamin E oil as well but like um vitamin D will come and you have to look at the capsules like if you're if you're taking like a supplement because vitamin D like they almost always use stupid seed oils like sunflower oil or something like that and because they because you know most people that just eat meat or omnivores or whatever they don't they don't care if it's had some sunflower oil whatever but like a vegan really cares if it's like you know um you know plant-based um or sorry animal based uh you know gelatin or whatever you know so you'll see all vegan capsules and all that sort of stuff because it's just no one else no one else normally cares but the vegans care and so it's just it's just getting a larger market pool but now like everything's sort of done that and now you can't find things that are actually normal oils and normal fats they they're always in in these um solution with sunflower oil so that's another reason maybe you know vitamin D supplementation isn't a great idea unless you like actually need it um but you'll get you'll get a ton of vitamin D from animal fat so you know and like you know grass-fed butter plenty of vitamin D in that so you you usually don't need to supplement with vitamin D on a carnivore diet okay the question there a friend who suffers from early onset Parkinson's disease do you have any good references that could help me convince him to try carnivore so there have been there have been studies with keto showing that that keto can help um with Alzheimer's and uh Parkinson's and autism and migraines and seizures and psychiatric disorders and so many more so you know that that we do exercise you know we don't really have very good robust studies just on a carnivore diet itself there are a lot of different there are a lot of different pieces of information and um and just facts about the human body and how we work that you sort of Cobble together you know you like pieces to a puzzle you say like okay the humans are carnivores and this is this is the way we should be eating at least that's that's the puzzle I'm looking at and maybe it'll be other pieces that are just like oh no that's actually just a hoof to this other thing you know so it's um but you know we don't we don't really have a lot of big studies to look at carnivore specifically however if you look at the at the um studies on ketogenic diet there is a benefit and higher saturated fat higher LDL cholesterol protective against Alzheimer's protective against Parkinson's and so you know and then different plant toxins like lectins can actually track up your vagus nerve get into your brain into the substantia  and damage those cells those are the those are the the cells that that secrete dopamine into the um uh into you know the um the the different parts of your brain that that uh sort of disinhibit movement there's a whole big complicated pathway called the direct and indirect pathway um that has to that that all sort of correspond that correlates through your um Thalamus and your Thalamus is trying to you know tell your your brain to like yes move go do something you have all these little other parts of the brain saying stop it you know so you don't have like unnecessary movements or like you know just uncontrollable sort of movements called um uh Correia so like uh Hutchinson's Korea Korea however however you want to pronounce it depending on what country you're in and um so the thalamus has to do with that and then the dopamine goes up hits these areas inhibits them from inhibiting the thalamus and the thalamus gets a signal it says okay go move and so that that has to do with initiation of movement so when you take away the the substantia Nigro and they can't release dopamine then there's always inhibiting the thalamus so Thalamus is just telling your body don't move don't move don't move don't move don't move so it's really hard to initiate movement and get going and that's what and that's the the classical uh physical signs of of parkinsonism is that you you find you're sort of rigid and you just sort of locked in and you just it's very hard to start moving and you'll have some Tremors and things like that as well um so lectins can track up your vagus nerve and actually get into the substantia and damage them if you already have Parkinson's is that going to help you by getting rid of this well it may not reverse all the damage that was there but it can stop more damage from happening there's a study in Denmark I believe Denmark where they took they took a look at everybody who'd had a vagotomy where they cut the vagus nerve up from the gut and between for like a 20-year period so there's only thousands and thousands and thousands of people who had a vacotomy and Dish looked at them and compared them to the rest of the population and say okay what are these guys chances of getting Parkinson's and they found that the people that had their vagus nerves cut were 66 percent less likely to get Parkinson's okay so that's interesting you know there's other things that are going to going to contribute to Parkinson's that's not the only cause but it's it it you know appears that that's a contributing factor so increasing your saturated fat increasing your cholesterol getting rid of lectins getting rid of carbohydrates and letting your brain run on its proper fuel which is ketones these are all going to contribute to proper brain health and help anyone with Parkinson's and will it reverse Parkinson's it's not gonna it's not going to reverse all the damage that's already done for whatever reason there might be other disease processes they don't have anything to do with food that are going on that you may not be able to stop a reverse but all those ones that are contributory from not eating the right things and eating some of the wrong things those are going to be helped and so and again there are a thousand other ways that going on a proper human diet is going to be beneficial and so they will they will see those benefits as well yeah uh great all right so I'll find some of the questions again there will be sent just bear with me one moment okay I'll read that yeah uh a question from Mike uh question about protein to fat and VV and then nutrition at ancestors would have received from their fat stores when doing naturally extended fats in ketosis the fastest yeah protein to fat and VV I'm not sure what you mean by VV maybe you can type it in and let me know of course I'm at protein fat and BV okay nutritional ancestors would have received from their fat Stores um yeah so yeah what's that oh you can beat that part okay read the next one yeah I understand that when storing when storing the body converts protein to fat but only those that it can't use for building EG if 50 of every amino acid is present but only 37 of our name uh Janine then only 37 complete profiles can be used for building and the 13 extra of all others will become energy possibly and if not then stored as fat and I understand it has and I understand it to be that it's how to to access Pro excess protein becomes fat instead of new construction or repair am I correct um so yeah so the thing is is that like yeah you need a certain complement of amino acids amino acids are not the same and they're not interchangeable um you can you can sort of make and create and sort of adjust them if you have certain certain aminos you can sort of turn them into other aminos you can you can sort of build um different proteins some some you can't those would be the essential uh amino acids those ones you have to get from your diet you can't make those yourself other ones you can make so it depends on the protein um and sometimes you can take those proteins that you have excess of you can turn it into other non-essential proteins that that you may need um like uh yeah there's there's a bunch of them I think like lysine is another one where it's like it's like a rate limiting step so if you have um sort of think of it as like creating like a barrel right and you have these little you have these little planks that come up and make a barrel right so if you have all these planks and they're all the right you know the right length to make a normal sized Barrel but then just one of them is just short well it's going to leak out and like all the water and that Barrel is going to leak out at that point it doesn't matter that all the other ones are the right size that one's not and so it's true that you do that you do have rate limiting steps now some of those things you can make and you can sort of build up but that's that's why protein is so important because it's not just you need enough grams you need you need specific ones and specific portions and so so that's true uh and yeah you know sometimes if you if you're gonna have sort of excess proteins you can turn them into fat as well um most of these things you you know um you generally turn amino acids into glucose as as a part of um uh it's it's generally like a demand driven uh uh reaction as opposed to a substrate driven reaction right so I have this much protein my body just goes oh it just turns out all into glucose that doesn't really happen it's generally if your body needs glucose and this is the excess generally you don't use much protein as uh energy you use some but generally you won't Well you certainly won't um catabolize your own muscle tissue generally to make energy unless you've like completely run out of fat and you're just completely emaciated and then and then you get into big trouble but yeah you um will predominantly use your fats and so if you're in a fast like you like uh going back to the beginning of the question you know our ancestors are running on fat and so you eat a bunch of foods your body uses a protein to rebuild and repair and then you know whatever is extra will get stored in your fat and that that's your gas tank that's what you're running on for the next couple days and then you know you go back to the gas station and you fill up and that's what eating is right so you don't need to eat every day you don't need to eat you know multiple times a day certainly and our ancestors didn't always do that some did you know we had like you know with the big Mammoth Hunters you took down you know herd of Mammoth and you dried all the meat and you had that I mean these people were eating for years you know potentially and generally they would have they would have an abundance of food if they got one of these big pills they called it like a like a drop like that Native Americans did that with Buffalo so it was like a buffalo drop and so the big herds of Buffalo hundreds of millions of Buffalo were you coming through they'd scare off you know a few hundred off of a cliff they'd all fall and die and they would they would eat on that for the year that would feed their whole their whole village and their whole Community for the rest of the year and so that's what we we have evidence of our ancestors doing that back like millions of years with mammoths and so this was this is a long long long uh long-standing tradition of hunting is uh is the drop method and so you know you had people that had an absolute abundance of food but they didn't necessarily eat every day they didn't necessarily need to you know so you just you just fill up and eat a whole bunch like the you know the Mongols with Genghis Khan the Mongol horde you know it was very regular for them to go five days without eating and then they'd eat 10 pounds of horse meat and and you know drink horse blood and things like that maybe get drunk on fermented Mare's milk and you know and then that was fine and it actually gave a huge advantage uh you know in war setting because they didn't have cook fires they didn't have to like they didn't have to stop all the time they didn't have to stop three times a day for food to you know boil up a bunch of you know mash and Grains and and uh and feed that out to the men and then keep going you know they could just go and go and go and go and go and they didn't have campfires they didn't have any way for the enemy to see like okay there's a big massive group of people coming towards me because you see all the smoke see all the fires at night but they knew exactly where you were and so these these people it was just like it was just you know an absolute Terror being um on the other side during this uh during this time because they would just come through and just come out of nowhere and just sack you had no idea when they were coming so there's a huge advantage to that and yeah so you know you you eat fat and meat and your body rebuilds the protein that it needs and then you you know put the rest in fat and you run on the fat so you're running on your fat stores and um and that's what we're supposed to do and that's what you you know you will do if you're on a carnivore diet so yeah can you read that one please uh does the fat release uh does the fat release later when in King when in ketosis then have have the full Amino profile being released or is there another process that occurs you know that's something that's a good question uh it's an excellent question I've uh that's something I'll have to look into but you know we'll be able to make the aminos that we're able to make I mean some some aminos are like I said essential but at the same time you know it's um you know there are stories of people like you know that guy in the UK who just didn't eat for nine months and lost like 500 pounds and just took like a multivitamin every month and just drank water and um you know his skin actually shrank down with him so he didn't have like loose folds or anything like that and you know he wasn't eating anything obviously his body was able to uh you know either make the protein that he needed or just didn't need a lot of protein you know might not be able to you know build a bunch of muscle if you're not able to uh get in all of the requisite aminos but obviously whatever he had on him at the time whatever he was able to make was enough to sustain what he was doing which is interesting which is very very interesting um so that's something that um you know as far as I know you would still only be able to make the aminos that you know you're able to make and then the essential amino acids you just have to sort of recycle those because you you the reason that they're essential is because our body we can't make them and so yeah so I would imagine that the ones that we are um that are essential we'll have to just sort of recycle and sort of keep track of and uh and and reuse so that that's a guess but that would that would just sort of fit with that anyway okay and it's very hard to read the light in your face okay this next one's from sorry I don't know how to pronounce your name Matthew okay similar to Mike's question I seem to remember Dr Berry saying that the fat we stories contained within edible sets of course which are not 100 fat they also contain protein otherwise they'd not be cells and so when the shrink losing fat they get smaller and protein is liberated to be reused is this correct yeah it's been it's been a long time since I've looked at that but like I mean it's certainly um you know I would I would imagine I mean your body needs to be able to store protein as well and so you know it's it's um it's probably that's the case that's something I'll have to look into again it's been a long time since I've um looked into that I mean that's like like college Years so um I don't know exactly but I would expect that's the case yeah back here so on vice versa that's what it was yeah it was about protein fat and vice versa yeah um okay so yeah so I think that's it did anybody else have any other questions that gets in the in the comments we have a couple um so Roger asks or says that two months into carnivore beef salt and water I get a bout of watery diarrhea mid-morning bio supplements don't help lipase doesn't help any ideas otherwise I feel great well there can be well first of all I wouldn't I wouldn't take any bile supplements like you need I mean you need to take any supplements lipase either um you know if generally you can just change the amount of fat that you're eating and that can that can control that you know if you're not you know drinking coffee or taking caffeine or using artificial sweeteners or anything else that can be um you know act as a laxative in your body if it's just you and you're just doing the same thing that you were doing then your body's uh probably just adjusting to the amount of oh you could be responding to something else and just be a bit unwell um or it could be that you're just eating more fat than your body the body wants the other side of it is when you eat way too little fat then you can actually get quite watery irritated diarrhea and um and sometimes you can get even um called spurious diarrhea or overflow diarrhea where you actually get so constipated because you didn't get you know nearly any fat so you have this hard dry lump and then there's just this watery stuff going around it because that's it's just all liquid and you can't push this cork out and then sort of like the watery stuff comes out around that um and that can happen and then you go through alternate bouts of constipation and watery stools and so those are those are different things to look out for um yeah that's a good point the Olivia said so if you tag me and say ask Anthony chafee um it highlights for me so I can actually actually pick it out in the in the chat which one um it's hard to believe that there are thousands of times more natural plant toxins than synthetics yep it's it's crazy do you feel this science is pretty well settled can you share Bruce Ames and any other research yeah so so Bruce Ames was a professor at UC Berkeley and uh and he was looking at specifically uh well in that that paper that I talked about in uh the plants are trying to kill you specifically we're talking about alar they were trying to they banned a number of pesticides in the 80s saying oh these things are poisonous they are that that is the whole point you're trying to poison bugs and other animals from eating this stuff that's the point uh plants do it too that's that's kind of the whole thing and so he was looking at this and he and he showed and he identified different toxins that were in Plants he found 42 different toxins and 20 of which were found to be carcinogenic in uh animal models like rats and there are far more toxic chemicals in these plants far more when I was taking cancer biology 11 years after that study was published we had we had found 136 just in Brussels sprouts right just brussels sprouts and Ames had found 20 in all the plants he was looking at overall okay and so however many were in each plant I don't know but um but that's that's what they found so obviously they found a lot more and so we looked at them by weight right just a hot the amount of the moles that are in there and um and compare that to how many ssis that were sprayed on them and it was there was way more way more natural toxins that were in there probably even more than that because he only knew about a select few where there were more that he didn't know about so um I think that's that is pretty well established you know the idea is is that okay well well how bad are those things you know um there's more of them but does that mean that they're worse for you well he did that as well he did that part as well he found that looking at um of course you know the the carcinogenic nature of these things he found that that things like mushrooms uh were 500 times more likely to cause cancer in rats than they are right so at least for alar you know the the plant toxins are way worse you know is that is the same for uh um glycophosphate I don't know you know that that's a good study to do as well I mean that stuff's pure poison as well but the point is that all these things are bad and that you know it's not just it's not just humans that have gummed up the works it's just like we're in just the Garden of Eden and it's only the things that we've done to that that's made plants bad plants are bad because they are bad because they don't want you to eat them they die if you eat them most plants will kill you most plants will kill most animals a cow will get killed by most plants a giraffe will get killed by most plants there are 364 340 000 species of plant in the world you know quality one pandas eat one cow's horses crazy animals be grass that's it they eat specific grasses they don't even need all the different kinds of grasses so it's very very specific what animals eat animal diet a species specific a species appropriate diet is very specific and especially in herbivores you know because they can they can really only tolerate certain plants and other plants are will kill them and so it's it's not surprising to me that these things are have more poisons and they're more poisonous than the pesticides which prey on them I mean most of most of these plants will just kill you so there's a ton of poison and this poison is very potent right I mean like Hemlock you know like water hemlock is like the most poisonous plant in North America like half a leaf will kill an adult right you know so you know kids like sort of chewing on the stems and things like that have died you know so this stuff is toxic toxic toxic and it's meant to be this is not an accident and so you know you just have to be cognizant of that and and yeah it's and pesticides do we spray on like yeah they're not good for a reason they kill the things that are trying to eat your crop that's the point but you know what also kills the things trying to eat your crop your crop because that's how they're designed and that's what GMOs are right because there are animals and insects that actually are adapted to being able to eat certain poisons safely right and so you put in the ones that they're not able to break down and eat safely and now you've made a more robust plant that's not going to be able to be eaten by other things but guess what it's now even more toxic so that's the problem that you run into when you eat plants and then when you you deal with all these things in general I'm going to say that for the class yeah um someone has asked is there any benefit to not eating close to bedtime or is that a myth uh so that's that's um I I think my views on that are that they're even close to bedtime thing is really only in the context of if you're eating carbohydrates if you're eating carbohydrates your metabolism is all screwed up your insulin goes up insulin will block growth hormone will block the action of growth hormone growth hormone is is a peak secretion levels are two hours after you go to sleep and throughout your your rest this helps you you know grow and rebuild and and um and repair from the day and so when you eat a bunch of carbohydrates well you're stuffing in a bunch of fat everyone knows that but what you're also doing is you're blocking the action of growth hormone which is one of one of the key hormones in your body and you know and throughout the day if you're eating that's the thing too you know you think about like bodybuilders oh you have to eat carbs you have to eat carbs you have to eat carbs like well okay but you're blocking your own growth hormone so it's a good thing these these guys are just taking like you know liver King levels of growth hormone because their carbohydrates are blocking its actions so they need a whole bunch of it that could have been exactly why I don't know if people saw that but they talked about you know that liver King emails how he's talking about he was just taking like an insane amount of growth hormone to the point that that you know Derek from you know more place more dates was saying that he knew he knows guys training for the Olympian uh Mr Olympia that are on less growth hormone than liver King was okay that's nuts right so uh but dudes drinking maple syrup all right so that's that's blocking the action of the growth hormone he's taken he's just like I don't know what's going on I'm just like I'm a hyper under responder you know hypo responder and so well you're shooting yourself in the foot by eating a bunch of carbs jacking up your insulin and blocking that action so when you're eating carbohydrates and you go to sleep then you're going to do that you're going to block your your own growth hormone you're going to screw up your own circadian rhythm in your hormone cycle and so I think that's a detriment on top of all the other detriments you get when you're eating carnivore diet you don't it doesn't matter right in fact it's actually optimal because you go throughout the day you're not eating you're just you're charged you're ready to go your body's like go out hunt kill get something and get your food get your get your nutrients and then you get that food and your body just goes right shut it down rest and digest and you go to that rest in digest mode and you naturally become lethargic and tired and sleepy and you just feel wonderful you just Drift Off to Sleep just like a lion they take down a buffalo they eat it and they pass out for 16 hours you know there's a reason for that and so I think if you're on a carnivore diet or even keto then um then it's actually you know fine to eat right before you go to sleep that's what I do I eat big meals right my biggest meal will be right before I go to bed at the end of the day because if I eat earlier than that I feel much more lethargic I don't have as much energy throughout the day because my body's saying what are you doing we already ate we already have it just chill out take it easy go to sleep have a nap and I I can't you know like I have things to do and I don't get very good workouts as well so I find that I I feel much better throughout the day I have much better energy throughout the day and I sleep better at night when I eat later on and I think that's why um [Music] so yeah Paul oh that's great thank you Olivia for putting up that that research that and many many other links are um in most of my videos so any any of the ones talking about that or you know plants having toxins or the carnival versus vegan diet and all those other things look in the description of my um of my my videos and I'll I'll put it up here as well um I'll put resources in there so if I'm talking about specific things specific studies or like a specific topic I'll put like a just a bunch of studies and links for that topic to to support that sort of my bibliography and the the plants are trying to kill you talk that I did and uh at some low carb Down Under the I mean I don't have control of that page so I didn't get to put in my you know my bibliography but uh there is a bibliography at the end and so the last slide you can pause it on there and you can sort of see you have to type it in yourself I'm sorry but it's uh they're they're most of them are are there on that last one and that one is too um so okay another question from inlight connect this pattern uh hoped carnivore might help with one thing one month in um I can start the day super stoked and productive then I eat and lose all enthusiasm Focus usually around 11 or 12. there you go perfect example illustrating my point you eat during the day you're going to get lethargic your body's going to say like yep shut it down go to sleep chill out and that's exactly what's happening so if you're going to eat during the day if you have to then I would I would eat a partial meal like a half meal a quarter meal something like that just something to take the edge off but not enough to like fill up and and get lethargic like that because I I that happens that is what happens and you know and if you you know take down a buffalo and you eat the whole bunch of thing you're not you're not going around you know running marathons after that and so that's why I eat towards the end of the day and if I eat during the day like I'm working out a lot then my body just wants more meat and because it's trying to build more meat and so I need to eat more than once but I'll have to eat sort of half meals or else I'm you know I'm screwed or even like three-quarter meals but just don't fill up don't don't Max yourself out or you will get lethargic and you will want to go to sleep um from Natalie how do you explain to a vegetarian vegan or otherwise that we are not adapted to eat vegetables like animals are even uh two specific veggies and fruits well you know it's um you just sort of talk about what I spoke about earlier which is you know that food is very species specific and you have to have you have to have the Machinery to break down certain chemicals and safely and to extract certain nutrients uh we don't have those Machinery there are a lot of nutrients that are bound up in Plants we cannot access and that's on purpose because the new the plant does not want you to profit by eating it and so it's gonna it has all these nutrients and so you're looking oh wow look at all these nutrients that are in blah blah blah yeah fine they are not available to you and that's because the plant wants to lock that away so that that any old animal that comes and eats them doesn't doesn't benefit from that and get all these sorts of things so you you have to have like the hardware to to break these things down so you can you can sort of explain that and just say hey you know these are species specific and and you know point out all the animals in the very specific diet that they eat and point out that you know you have animals in the zoo if they eat you know anything that they don't eat in the wild they get very sick they get the same sickness we do they get so-called human diseases right obesity heart disease diabetes cancer liver disease arthritis autoimmune issues they all get the same thing so do dogs and cats it's because we're not feeding them what we're supposed to be feeding them which is meat um and you can also point out to them that even if we were adapted and even and even if it was appropriate for us to eat plants none of the plants that we're eating now are what we evolved on because none of the plants we're eating now existed when we were evolving we all did all the animal all the plants that we were eating now are bioengineered either through you know um you know forced selection or um or you know bioengineering with with like GMOs and things like that or cross-breeding all sorts of different things so none of these things are natural none of these things existed ten thousand years ago 50 000 years ago certainly not 50 000 years ago and so these are not things that we would have evolved with no animal on Earth Eats the variety of plants that we do none there isn't a single animal on Earth that eats as many varieties of plants that we do so even if we're supposed to eat plants we are not supposed to eat all the plants that we're eating okay so which ones are we supposed to be eating well it's hard to say because none of these things existed 50 000 years ago or you know even in you know the Garden of Eden or whenever because we created all the crops that we're eating now like none of these things are natural none of the fruits that we're eating are natural you know they're all adultered in some way adulterated and so that's where I'd start anyway it's called bcmd yeah I carnivore three months in shouldn't my body have adapted by now to start using my fat storage as an as an energy source and thus reducing the swollen fat cells so you're like uh yeah I mean look you you are you are using your fat stores if you are eating a strict carnivore diet you're not drinking any milk you're not using a lot of dairy you're not using using artificial sweeteners um and uh and you're doing other things that are that are healthy you're eating enough you're getting enough meat getting enough fat you're getting enough sleep you're taking care of yourself in other ways just by not eating carbohydrates and anything else that will screw with your metabolism like artificial sweeteners uh or you know monk fruit sweetener sugar or Stevia or all those other uh products that are you know oh it's not it's technically not sugar therefore it's okay no it's not okay it's absolutely not okay um don't eat them don't eat any of that stuff just eat just eat meat but if you are just doing that then you'll you'll go into ketosis in 24 hours because your insulin will drop down to a certain level and then you'll start running on your fat cells and so that will happen you know it's it's three months I mean I look I wasn't even you know very overweight when I started backing on Carnivore this last time um I had definitely had excess fat and excess weight but I wasn't I could you could still see my six-pack you know even though I was 270 something pounds you know and like I'm like 2 30 now so like there's a big difference and um but I you know it wasn't wasn't all that fat um it took way longer than three months for me to get down to a steady a steady state and a steady uh body fat percentage I think it was like six or eight months something like that before I sort of stabilized and um anyway I didn't have all that it wasn't all that much you know to lose so you know you really need to be you know just mindful of that and and also um you know just just listen to your body and just just focus on feeling good you know being on the scale and just just focusing on the weight is not a great way of doing this because a you're going to replace fat with muscle so that scale may not change all that much and that can get very discouraging and say well I'm not losing fat I'm not losing weight right not the same thing you you will be losing fat and you don't necessarily lose weight at the same time so I would uh just be mindful of that just focus on your health Focus On Healing focus on feeling good and just focus on this being part of your life and you know not worrying about it and just the rest will come the health will come the health is most important the weight will come the fat loss will come it will happen just eat what you're supposed to eat as much as your body wants you to eat and it and it will happen eventually you know some people take a lot longer to lose fat you look at Kelly Hogan you know you know she was she actually put on weight for the first six months but she felt great she felt better than she ever had and she was she was doing a lot better she's like okay I'm just going to trust the process I've got all these people that have done it all before and like I believe it I I believe what they're telling me and so I'm just going to trust it after about six months something just snapped and all of a sudden you just just started shredding uh excess fat and she's been very slender ever since and and you look at her and be like you know she she looks like one of those people that was just like you've never been fat in your life you've never been overweight in your life you've never struggled with weight your whole life there's no you know you so you can't talk she did she struggled with her weight you know quite quite a lot when she was um when she was you know um you know teenager and young adult and but she hasn't since and that and that's why so uh just give it time uh let it happen just let your body do its thing it will it will come it will happen just be patient and focus on your health more than anything you know from Rita from Rita things are not running smoothly I have high blood pressure I'm new to carnivore this month eating butter and fatty meat tired feel better when I fast and don't eat okay well that's fine you don't have to force feed yourself certainly don't do that if meat and fat don't taste good don't eat your body's telling you hey we don't we don't need anymore sometimes you'll eat a bit and you'll think like wow that's not enough but then you try eating more like meat and eggs in your body and it just tastes horrible you're like okay I don't like that stop eating okay your body's giving you negative feedback and saying don't eat this right um as far as high blood pressure so that most of the time that that can can significantly improve on uh even just a ketogenic diet a lot of times this is from insulin insensitivity in your in your arteries because it's um your arteries respond to insulin so you hit it's linen they and they expand a bit and so that will reduce your blood pressure and now it's just it doesn't so much insulin for so long just like I don't trust you I don't trust your signals I'm not listening to you anymore it takes off all these insulin receptors and so then it's just like nope not listening not listening not listening and um and it just stays you know small and and um and rigid and then the blood pressure goes up so when you get rid of the carbs you start getting more sensitive to your insulin then then they become more compliant and they start actually you know responding and growing Contracting in response uh to different physiological measures that you know your body knows how to take care of much more than we do and so that that will that will help you know being a bit tired there's a lot of reasons for that a lot of reasons that could be that I actually do an episode on that um how to carnivore episodes on my YouTube channel um you know like why we get tired like like frequently asked questions sort of thing I forget exactly what it's called but it's uh you can find it on there and uh and we talk about you know why people generally get tired sometimes people will drink milk or have a bit of carbohydrates they'll retire um but at the same time uh you know like the other things too like if you eat a lot and get tired and so if you're eating you know bigger meals in the beginning of the day your body's just gonna say hey shut it down sleep um like you say you feel better when you're fast okay so fast during the day eat at night it's not even really fast really because you just you generally don't need to eat more than once a day um especially when you're when you have to lose your body just will just want less and fat because it doesn't need to to do what it wants to do and start using your fat stores as well so try eating at the later at the end of the day add an extra just an hour in the morning that can help wake you up it can help get you going um but whenever you can work out just do that I find that I I work out better later in the day about just how I feel just because I'm probably just used to it I've always hated waking up always good for me and and but then I was loved after school shorts and always played Sports later on and so whenever you want to work out just do it then and um and just make sure you're eating enough make sure you're getting enough water um eat later in the day don't eat any carbs don't eat any drink any milk things like that so a lot of little things that you can do but the main thing is you just keep going with it because that's another thing about being at keto adapted sometimes it can take up to three weeks usually it doesn't take more than that almost everyone will be keto adapted after three weeks you'll still be in ketosis after 24 hours as long as you're not you know eating any carbs at all and but it can take you know up to two three weeks for your body to to get used to running on these new fuel sources okay and so just keep with it stick with it if you're tired sometimes you're not eating enough sometimes you're not eating enough fat you know you're you're eating butter and fatty meat and that's great make sure you're getting enough of it okay and just eat later in the day so those are those are a bunch of little little tips and see if you can maybe go back and and write them down and try to use all of them but I actually go through a lot of those in that video so you can try to find that video as well um so this says we had our first Discord Meetup yesterday and uh oh very good oh yeah that's right yeah Mike and uh and Crystal um map in Vegas that's awesome so that's good I really like that uh the Discord group has um has sort of taken off the way it has and that everyone's um you know finding it helpful and and a nice community and everyone's uh you know getting along and being nice to each other that's really that's really good that makes me happy uh what's the other question I had a so from Paul ladendorf I had a digestive analysis done and it showed I was not breaking down protein and fat well would you recommend a comprehensive digestive enzyme with protease protease protease lipase lipase and bile yeah uh well it just depends you know I mean if if that's something like a permanent issue that you're just not able to do um uh sure but I wouldn't take bile your body makes enough bile you know you're going to add in bile and you're going to absorb more fat than your body actually wants and you'll run into trouble and you just you'll get more fat than your body wants and you'll and then that can be too much fat you can actually you know then have more than energy than you want you put on weight things like that and um you know the proteases and lipases potentially I mean that's not going to hurt you um if you're just taking a little bit here and there but you know you you generally people catch up right so if you aren't eating as much fat protein Etc um you know previously and then you go into and you start eating a lot more of these things then you know it can take a bit for your pancreas to go like oh okay yeah yeah we need this stuff so um so I don't know how long have you been doing carnivore Paul because uh generally that will sort itself out in the first few weeks um if it's been months and months and you're still not you know making a whole bunch of it and you're feeling symptomatic and you're feeling that you're not getting enough and you're not feeling well or whatever then yeah maybe but um but if you're feeling good and you're eating and your body's doing well then I don't I don't think you need to worry about it just let your body do its thing uh I'll read a lost my sound uh well it'll be it'll be on the recording Rita and also there's I did a how-to carnivore video where Simon and I talked about you know some of the the common sort of frequently asked questions and pitfalls and one of them was energy and uh and getting enough and some people being a bit tired on a carnivore diet um so Paul yeah so just over a month give it some time you know your body is probably you know now making um you know making more and more uh of the pancreatic enzymes that you need certainly going to be uh doing a file I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about the bile um extra file um just because you know your body makes a certain amount of bile because that's how much fat it wants to absorb so if you're adding in bile you're going to absorb more fat than your body wants you also get constipated because you need that excess fat that your body can't absorb to get into the stools and it keeps it soft and so it's um it's uh you know it's an important sort of process to sort of let your body do its thing and have a bit excess fat that your body can excrete and also I just I you know unless you have some sort of you know like actual issue that your body is just incapable of making enough bile or making enough pancreatic enzymes you have pancreas insufficiency then I I just just let your body do its thing it'll catch up and uh and whatever it gets to should be should be enough but you know if you're worried about it you know like in three months maybe check it again and just see what happens I just and again if you're feeling good and you're not feeling like anything's wrong just just trust it and just let your body do its thing okay all right um if anyone has any last minute questions want to sneak them in before we wrap up we can do that otherwise we'll say bid you would do hit you okay all right um so Olivia just says just a message to all patreons or all patreon members who are not yet in the Discord chat including all the new joiners um yeah please do join the community uh there are instructions sort of pinned to the top of um at the patreon homepage and I'll tell you how to join the Discord and that that's automatic sort of thing through the the patreon thing so you it'll link to the patreon account and get you into this uh dedicated um you know series of chat groups with all the um the different Discord or different uh patreon members in just just our patreon community and we talk about all sorts of different things at the book club that's where you submit your questions for these Live Events if you want to get them answered and and many other things and also just a just a nice way for people to to chat and talk to each other and encourage each other and support each other through their their health Journey so uh definitely do that and use that as a resource because it's um it's a very good one so okay all right everyone I guess I think we'll leave it there um thank you very much for everyone who came on I hope that was um uh you know beneficial and interesting for people and thank for everyone who submitted questions and thank you very much for L uh for helping me out reading the questions appreciate it welcome thank you so okay thank you all very much and uh have a good night or a good day take care"
