        "title": "Dr Anthony Chaffee LIVE!",
        "transcript": "hi guys nice to see everyone um we're streaming live on Dr Anthony chafee's YouTube platform and mine today so thank you for joining us today and we're just going to be talking about a couple of topics so the first one is actually chafee's um amazing news appearance which is quite insane to watch I really enjoyed that one it's nice seeing like all the comments Below in like the Articles and stuff like oh yeah carnivore diet rules and that sort of thing so it's nice to see all this all these people supporting it and actually siren up to I think is the daily mail to sort of um you know put my little comment in my little two cents so yeah appreciate coming on today no you're very welcome man it's good to see you again and uh yeah the the yeah the 60 Minutes thing was um it was great to see everyone you know sort of going out I think they were probably going to be a bit surprised by by the amount of people on Carnival who came out and said hey you know actually this is this has really changed my life and you know in so many different ways I've lost all this weight gained all this health got off medications um it's not about making money it's exactly the opposite you know it doesn't cost you anything it's just a matter of educating people on how how to eat and what to buy at the grocery store there's no products involved and so it's the antithesis of you know all the other ones that they sort of lump lumped Us in with lumped me in with which is you know just trying to sell weird products and things like that but of course that's not what it is and you know it would have been nice if they had kept in some of the things I said on that because we did talk about that and we spoke for about half an hour on air or on the camera and then from like hours behind the camera and so they knew my position they knew that I thought that this was this was something that well this was something that I knew uh got people off medications got them to save money and and that I thought that was a major issue with the health care crisis was the healthcare crisis really was that people were getting sicker and sicker and sicker and we're getting you know more and more people dependent on the Health Care System the sick care system and medications and like that's just a that's a multi-trillion dollar uh a year expense that isn't getting us anywhere we're we're we're spending trillions of dollars buying things that are making us sick and trillions more dollars fixing the that and managing that sickness and that and that's a complete waste of resources and also people's life and time so they're not as productive they're not as they don't have as much time to dedicate towards their career their family and and you know curing the actual problems in the world so I mean it's in just such a massive waste of Human Resources life talent and money and that's what I was saying I was saying that this is this is something that we can we can get away from and we can actually save trillions of dollars and redirect that towards something more useful and so of course they go like oh yeah this is just a scam trying to make money it's like kind of miss the whole point yeah remember speaking um offefa extensive period of time lost till we chatted and um yeah kind of show you Dr Anthony chafee isn't a guy that's trying to make loads of money and he's not a show he's not trying to like steal from you guys he is um promoting good solid information and he's getting the right people on to talk about the right topics which make a difference to People's Health outcomes so yeah I did find that quite um quite bizarre sort of from my sort of position like knowing who you are and how you kind of work so yeah yeah I mean there's not much to sell is there like what are you gonna sell like I don't know beef protein powder it's not there's not a lot in the market to really promote so yeah I get that no and those are all those are all adjuncts yeah they don't have anything that you need you don't have to have that stuff it's just something it's just a product that isn't isn't meat only and if you want you know something like that like the carnivore bar or like you know a meat only beef only you know whey protein only and nothing else you know protein powder you know those are those options which I think is good you know because once once you do start entering the commercial Market well then then these big companies have to take you seriously if there's no commercial benefit for them then they're just gonna like paper over it and try to try to push their products so you know if they look at that and go hey actually there is there is a financial um you know there's something to be gained here financially then you know they're going to be more likely to switch gears you know someone is to say hey maybe they spot a trend and go like hey why don't we beat the curb and and get on top of this right away you know and help promote it then we'll be you know the big dogs in that space you know that that would be uh amazing if they could do that it sort of happened with keto they're bigger and bigger companies making more keto products unfortunately a lot of them are you know highly processed a bunch of you know different you know chemicals and and artificial sweeteners and things like that unfortunately which are not really much of an improvement but um at least it's something you know at least they're you know things are moving in in that direction but at the end of the day what it what it's really about is you know getting people healthy and having them just eat meat just eat food and that's the whole point you know you don't need a specific product to do this you just need to buy you just need to eat meat and just don't eat all these other things that's it yeah it's hard to get people away from this um particularly younger folks like myself later and be like this consumerist approach like what supplements do I need to buy what extra protein powders do I need you know what herbal extracts do I need to support myself all these different things like honestly like when I speak to most people I say how would you feel before taking them how do you feel after take them was there a noteworthy benefit and oftentimes it the answer is no so I think save your money buy some steaks and um have some eggs if you like as well you know yeah yeah exactly and that's it that's all you have to do and you know I talk to people and they ask about what supplements you need and what this you need what that you need like you don't need anything it's like it really is just eat meat don't eat the other things and that's it and it's you know I like it because it is simple you know some people uh will say well oh that this sounds really boring you're only eating the same thing like what what animal eats a very diet you know they all eat boring monotonous diets and yet they love them they really enjoy them they taste great to them because that's what's giving them the nutrients are like this tastes great I want to eat this and that's what meat tastes like to us you know it's just it's amazing all the time and then it stops tasting amazing and you know yeah I'm done I don't need to eat anymore but when you're hungry it tastes fantastic and so yeah if you know I I have always only wanted to eat steak anyway that's always been my preference I've eaten all the other things because I felt I'm obligated to or I've been forced to by my parents when I was a kid but if it was up to me like I would have only eaten meat uh when I was a kid only I never wanted to eat anything else maybe garlic bread my mom made some killer garlic bread a lot of butter and a lot of garlic and it was just like that was delicious but that's the butternut growing up like now I don't really have a taste for it like if it sort of mixes in I'm like nope nope don't like it but you know just because it covers up the taste of meat and like I like the taste of meat I don't want to cover up the taste of meat so uh but yeah definitely you know the butter definitely helps with that yeah that's cool stuff um one thing I went to which maybe about a month ago at this point was the public health collaboration in Sheffield in the UK and basically what this was was a a talk with different featured guests special guests like yourself Dr Sean Baker lots of like top people in our Carnival kind of space um there's some also there was also some people in the vegetarian plant-based Community as well um and you delivered a very slam dunk approach I believe um for the the carnival argument and the what happened was on the Saturday is like the main event which is what actually stayed for to make sure I watched because I'm I'm I can't sit down for very long so I thought I'd tie my sort of fleeting periods you know so um and it is like a full house honestly um Dr chaif was in a position where he could sort of see everything that's going on he basically had a screen in front of me could sort of speak to the person that he was debating with um free Zoom because he's unable to make it um because of different circumstances but I just remember seeing Dr chafee's um hand raised on Zoom like all the time like this guy's got it wrong this guy's got it wrong this guy's got and he's like the same thing over and over again like and I was like so I said I sat next to my friend um Ben Hunt who you might know and he sort of ran out up to the people that front the organized and said Dr uh chafee's got his hands up there make sure you don't you know neglect him because you know he's got some good insights here um you did deliver a really good presentation and I'm glad you did because you had a limited amount of time but you really went into depth and I was quite shocked at the amount of information you could pack into like was it 10 15 minutes and you still have more to say so um I just remember watching you and Dr chitty the Cherry was a plant-based Advocate um and he was like he's watching you talk and he's like um yeah yeah but he didn't have any real rebuttal and then he mentioned The China Study then the whole audience went oh you know so yeah I think that I think that's good that people are more aware of the flaws and things like The China Study and you know eat Lancet and the blue zones and things like that because it's you know it is it is something that they go to and say hey we'll look at these studies this this really supports you know plant-based eating and you know on the surface it does I mean they certainly made the case for plant-based eating in that but I mean there there's a lot of problems with them and there's a lot of uh just you know assumptions and guesses I mean one of the one of the things that he said that I had sort of meant to bring up it ended up just not you know it sort of felt out of place by the time I had a chance to he mentioned with the The China Study said well you know what they found is that people in cities were had much worse you know Health outcomes and and heart disease and all these sorts of things uh than people in the country and the people in country were very very healthy and and that's because people in the you know in the country were just eating very simple plant-based food and people in the city were uh were able to afford meat I was like well true but they're also able to afford cigarettes and alcohol and junk food and processed garbage and candies and cakes and sweets and all these sorts of things so you know and it's almost like out there and the friend is there's pollution there's all these sorts of different things well some guys out in a rice paddy out in the middle of just God's country and just beautiful area with fresh air Green Grass and you know walking around Barefoot and just just just loving nature and loving their their you know environment and hard life you know but also hard work and they're moving their body and they're exercising and unfortunately the the plants weren't the ones doing them Unfortunately they were poor and they couldn't afford uh meat and that's and that's what they had to eat as a result was was uh plants you know and that's that's the history of humanity since agriculture was that the people who could afford it got meat and and people who couldn't uh would would eat mostly plants and they were generally uh shorter less healthy less well developed died younger I mean that's been the story up until the 20th century that the upper classes were healthier and lived longer than than the other uh classes of people and there can be a lot of factors involved in there I think that it wasn't it wasn't no small part because they they were able to afford meat as well and they afforded other things too but they also got uh you know access to meat so you know I mean I mean and that's something that we saw you know you just before and after the Agricultural Revolution right before the Agricultural Revolution people were you know taller had larger brains wide straight Jaws perfect teeth no cavities and and and no signs of like poor wound healing directly after the Agricultural Revolution brains are 11 smaller they're five inches shorter uh they have evidence of poor wound healing different sorts of you know tuberculosis um scars and infections like in their spine evidence of that crooked broken ass teeth small jaws wisdom teeth aren't in they're all impacted teeth and and messed up you know cavities and missing teeth and all these sorts of things so you know that that's a that's a stark contrast immediately after we know that we started eating a lot more plants so that that's actually quite compelling evidence to me you know maybe not so compelling to other people but I think if if that doesn't at least make you think about it then you're in a spot of denial honestly because that's that's a very clear contrast we have as a population people were eating a lot of meat some plants they were gathering things like that after the the after the megaphone died off after the last ice age people that didn't have hundreds of millions of Buffalo to to hunt like the Native Americans they you know they had to go to other means so maybe they they had livestock maybe they had other sorts of things but they also moved to plants and Agriculture and in those populations you know they did worse you know and so you know they they maybe had some animals and then Hunter gathers this and the other but then they moved into more farming and eating a lot more plants and their health suffered as a result of it and they weren't even necessarily the exclusive carnivores after that in fact that you know the the those populations were like on average five foot nine and they dropped down like five foot four but the Native Americans in in the 1800s as far as the 1800s when they're still eating buffalo they they these guys were like you know on average six foot four six foot five I mean most of these guys were pushing seven feet tall they were huge absolute monsters and there was a study that showed that the Plains Indians in the 1800s that were only eating buffalo maybe they had some other things sometimes but the vast majority of what they ate was was meat in Buffalo predominantly they were the tallest human beings on Earth right the average height of a population equals the average health of the population the average Chinese adult male is five foot six average adult male in America is five foot eight right about you know pre-agriculture when we were hunter gatherers right so still not all that great then we moved to more agriculture eating less meat not even processed plants just more plants not as much meat on average five foot four right big drop so it makes a big difference when you reduce the amount of meat that you're eating and increase the amount of plants you're eating it's just not as healthy it's you know and that's what the only real hard evidence looks at uh and finds and you know there's there's numerous holes in um in The China Study especially The China Study but also uh you know eat Lancet study I mean that was that was just garbage so one of the top well really the top uh epidemiologists and doctor and medical researcher in the world is and probably ever is uh professor John I initis from Stanford he had you know everything goes by citations and how many people cite your work and that's how relevant it is right and so he is one of the top 10 most cited people in any discipline of all time okay so and he's still he's still like halfway through his career right so he's still like this guy's got decades ahead of him and so and I mean he's just he's just really one of the one of the most prolific and uh you know and successful research scientists in history and he looked at the eat Lancet study and he you know and was and published something saying that the eat Lancet study is more science fiction than science right this is just this is all crap this is just all crap the blue zones that's another one um you know they say oh well these blue zones these people have a lot of centenarians people that live over 100 and they're all plant-based no no they're not no they're damn well not you know that's an assertion that they make but it's false I was just talking to uh Dr Bill Schindler who's uh who was uh a retired professor of of anthropology impaling anthropology at University of Maryland he was just in Sardinia uh which and he was in the epicenter of the first recognized Blue Zone in in the world and he said that these people not only eat a meat-based diet it's like a whole animal approach this is just all like they they just cook whole sheep and like a whole big chunk of cow you know just on a spit and they just cook this whole thing they sit down they have a whole family and the whole Community come in they all eat together and it's like raw cheeses raw milk and and just a bunch of meat and you know and they had plants but that as like a garnish as seasonings and like that's it they ate meat that's what they ate and they were extraordinarily healthy you know they would have like wine and things like that you know with their meals and everything but it was at what they ate was predominantly meat it was not plants it's not plant-based that's an absolute lie the only only population in the blue zones uh that that were plant-based is Loma Linda and that's because they're Seventh-Day Adventists who are religiously anti-meat because they're profit tests in the 1800s is all true I swear to God people can look this up their Prophet deaths in the 1800s had said she had a vision from God that said that meat makes you feel lustful makes you horny and lust is a sin and therefore don't eat meat so the meat is sinful don't eat it and so they face this entire religion around not eating meat and so they started the field of nutritional Sciences they have low Medical Center which is a medical school run by and four seven-day Adventists I remember looking at this it's in California I remember looking at this when I was applying when I was applying to medical schools and just looking at it and it just said it just said flat out you cannot apply here unless you're in The Seventh-Day Adventist Church and you need a letter from your Deacon or whatever saying that you're you're part of the church and I know as I thought that and I thought that was interesting so that's who they are and they you know they started the field of nutritional Sciences in in 1917 they wrote the first textbook on nutrition at University level education nutrition in 1925. still in print it's uh the most recent addition is still being used in colleges and they have they are they are hugely successful you know Kellogg's cereals that's Harvey Kellogg was a seven day Adventist and so you know they they own like I mean they they are fabulously wealthy they're one of these they seem to be one of these you know people behind the curtain you know that that are pulling the strings and they don't need to be out there in the Forefront you know like you and I saying like hey this is this is wrong they're in behind and they're orchestrating all these things they're they're spending hundreds of millions of dollars you know pulling the strings of industry and and media to get what they want and to influence people in the way that they want to push their products but most importantly to push their agenda and so you know you look at that and and you start to realize why nutritional research and nutritional studies are just complete and under garbage it's because it's being it's being manipulated Coca-Cola alone spends 11 times the amount of money on nutritional research than the NIH and Kellogg's does uh similar so there's Pepsi and Nestle and all these companies they just put out Drums of nutritional research that is that is just garbage and so that's what people well this study said that you know seed oils are great like I just couldn't care less I could not not care less what the Kellogg's you know what the makers of canola oil think about canola oil I just don't give a you know and so you look at the Loma Linda of course their their their plant-based they're the only ones in the blue zones who are plant-based right but it's not because they're plant-based that they're living longer you know because you look at you look at Mormons they don't they don't have these same dietary restrictions right but you know they do have restrictions on they don't smoke they don't drink they don't do drugs they don't take stimulus most of them don't even like drink coffee or caffeine or anything like that and uh and so on they have the exact same average life expectancy as The Seventh-Day Adventists in Loma Linda right and they don't have the same dietary restrictions so that's nonsense you know and one thing that the people in Loma Linda are doing as well is not smoking drinking doing drugs they're also not eating a bunch of processed garbage unless they're eating those impossible Burgers which I don't know why you would except I mean because I mean they probably have a hand in making them or funding them so they probably know exactly how toxic those things are so you know it's um it's nice that you know you get the whole crowd going you know groaning when he brings up The China Study you know as just an aside you know just as someone who was phoning in as well we couldn't hear the audience at all so I'm I didn't hear uh people you know respond you know with jeers and booze when the honestly yeah yeah he was very much in your favor yeah definitely yeah and um yeah so that's that that's interesting but yeah I don't think he would have heard that I saw it I think well no trying to study and still great or whatever like if it was there in person then he said the China said he might have been a bit uh you know put off by that I you know I don't see how you could be you know by um you know crowd turning on you like that but uh but it is good that people are starting to understand that and understand that you know when people bring things up it's like it's not that's not a compelling argument yeah one thing that was flagged up to me at that point was everyone there for the most part was someone that's like a nutritionist dietitian Healthcare professional some sort of doctor researcher scientist um and a very vast majority of people were in agreement with the carnival diet so it's not the side the scientific Community the the health based practice you know these sort of people aren't going towards plant-based it's not the consensus and I think what would have been a really good point at the start um if either you're Dr Baker said it obviously going back in time you can't it's hindsight but like you might have said what is the hierarchy of evidence in your mind then they would have said you know clinical trial mechanisms epidemiology whatever then you have points at the epidemiology just said that's an absolute waste of time it doesn't tell you anything um so it's very bizarre looking at that um just I'm interested do you have any kind of talks behind the scenes with any of the plant-based folks like after the fact at all was it just not not from the conference no I had didn't really talk to any of those you know um uh chitty and I just sort of you know chatted you know exchange niceties you know beforehand and um you know and that you know that was it and just sort of were pleasant to each other it seems like a very nice guy um and and I you know and and the thing is is I have I have absolutely no doubt that he really means well and and really does want the best you know for his patience and is really trying to come through you know from from an evidence-based perspective you know he's he absolutely comes across like that I don't think he's one of these page chills you know he doesn't he definitely does not give the impression uh to me of that he does seem you know quite Earnest in his approach um and so you know you can have a conversation with those people you know because you you all want the best for your patients you'll you all want to find out what's the right thing and that's what he thinks is the right thing this is what I think is the right thing and we can discuss it and that's and that's really really okay so when you get the problem comes when you have these people that are just a idea ideologically driven that's just like no this is the only way and um or you know the the plan is going to die and you're evil and blah blah blah blah I mean like you can't you can't have a rational conversation with people who are irrational um or the ones that are just you know they're you know they are being driven by um you know different motivations besides actually trying to help people you know you have you have to have that common ground of actually being Being Earnest and you know caring about what happens to people and what happens to you know uh you know the world and just understanding that like there are right and wrong ways of doing things and and let's try to figure out what the right way is for everyone to benefit you know so if if you're talking to someone who's not really not really working on those with you know with those uh with those tools then yeah there's just probably just no point really talking to them except uh for you know showing what uh you know how dishonest and and incorrect they are so that other people can see that and go like maybe I won't listen to what this guy says yeah completely um it's funny about the debate because I actually asked to be on a panel of people to talk about different Health practices nutrition practices um in my local area so my my partner Sophie's Auntie was running this wellbeing Festival um she's plant-based it's a predominantly sort of vegan plant-based community that would go to it and I thought you know what I'm gonna do um something in the fashion of Dr chafer here and I'm going to do a planter trying to kill you sort of presentation honestly I swear to God and I actually I'll get to this point a bit later but um what happened was we had a dry run so basically as we're chatting now just off air kind of not in front of anyone um a chat so I present to my argument said you know I know you guys are of a different mind to me it's completely fine um I've been asked to make a presentation based on health outcomes my own experience and what I know what the science does or does not say and I basically explained to them all the things that you kind of said in a roundabout way um not everything that much detail but I had about 10 minutes so I just pinged all the obvious things basically um speed specific diet all that sort of stuff and um so we're good to go for the the festival the panel they're talking about or maybe about two three weeks from now and two of the panelists out of I think there's four of us in total went to the the organizer and said I don't feel comfortable with him being on the panel oh Jesus and basically I I said something I I appreciate you've got a different Viewpoint to me so I'm not trying to like force my opinion on you but I'm going to present the facts as I see them and then you can make her own decision up um I provide a very balanced argument I said you know there is a toxicity to different plants um the lower sugar ones the lower five ones are going to be probably less detrimental for the most part so it wasn't like I was just saying just eat one thing because I was going from it from from over here you know um and basically yeah they the promoter unfortunately she was she had a handful so it's either she upsets me who's almost like a distant family member or she upsets two of them and they won't come to a talk again and I sort of said you know what I'll just I'll just sit out um so what I end up doing was I made a post about it I think a Youtube video um got quite a few views on that one like Carnival kicked out of Health talk that sort of thing then yeah I made then I actually presented my presentation um as I would kind of like how you did um so it's not nearly as good as yours of course but our meals a 20 minute long video um it's got a similar sort of type like the demonization of plant Foods or something or animal Foods something like that um what super special mentions you uh Dr Baker everything like that and yeah it's quite a popular video so it's funny looking back and just just realizing um there's always going to be pushback against you based on like you said ideology people don't want to be told they're wrong and um fun enough they were promoting like plant extracts and vegan supplements I imagine and you know vegetables and stuff so it just goes to show I wasn't trying to sell anything guys I was just trying to give some information out and of course I run a new job consultancy and it would be helpful for me to promote that but the chance of me getting a lead from that will be so slim in a vegan sort of you know Festival so it's just it's just funny to see but I'm glad you had that platform and I hope that these discussions between yourself and people that are plant-based Advocates who can continue well you know it is a shame that they didn't let you speak because obviously you have to have those conversations and if you if you can't be challenged and you can't you know go up and have a conversation with people then how how much do you actually believe in your in your side you know um and I think that's the problem they probably don't believe all that much because it was it was never in question for thousands of years that meat was the most important thing that we could eat and and that humans were carnivores and as far insofar as we were known to be apex predators apex predators are carnivores that's that's just like a definition in terms if you're an apex predator you're hunting things you're eating other animals in fact you're the most dominant and you know Hunter you're the just you're just the most dominant species so apex predators are really definitionally carnivores and we've known that humans have been carnivores forever and that's what we you know taught in school um probably up until now God knows what they're teaching kids in school who knows it's it's all insane at the moment but when vegans were sort of pushing this you know in the in the 80s it was just well if that makes you fat don't eat it so people want to go plant-based oh plants will make you fat plants don't have saturated fat they don't have cholesterol okay so that's better for you and um you know and you can just eat as much plants as you want you won't get fat because there's no there's no nutrition in it there's no calories there's no fat and so there you go you're not going to be uh getting fat if you if you just uh if you just don't eat fat obviously that was wrong you know the obesity rate exploded after that and and people got a whole lot worse and um you know but but people were still saying like yeah we were hunter-gatherers all clear size and we had you know Mammoth drops going back over a million years Buffalo drops Native Americans all Primal tribes they were just all Hunters they were all just you know just hunting and eating animals and uh you know still going on to this day but now they're starting to argue say well no actually not only is it like an ethical thing and all that sort of stuff but no no no we we're actually herbivores I mean that's just what we evolved on this is our biologically appropriate diet is carrot sticks and then that's just what I mean it's just like oh my God no and so you know if you if you truly believe that then then you should be able to defend it if you if you really know your stuff and you're like no no this is definitely it you should be willing to talk about anybody uh to anybody about it and just be like well no this is this is the evidence this is what it shows and uh and you both present your evidence and maybe you don't convince each other but you know you you give the audience something to think about and uh and if they're not even willing to do that if they're so threatened by alternate thoughts then they can't they can't believe what they're saying all that much yeah completely agree I think we've covered all this for you now um yeah it's nice to go over that anyway just to recap it really I know you've done it already but it's great um I don't know if you wanted to do some questions in the live chat at all there's quite a few hip hop yeah yeah you can do that um I actually just saw one that caught my eye it's um from yeah just from a person called by John Boy that says Dr chafee I'm six months in uh I'm presuming carnivore and I don't think I'm fat adapted I still have a liquid I'm assuming stools and I've not had solid movement since I started so um just to address that that's a common thing that people come up with um sort of need to know a little bit more about that though because most of the time uh people are are still eating things that aren't 100 carnivore and can can influence their bowels coffee and tea are both laxatives right artificial sweeteners are laxatives and so sometimes people have coffee and tea and put artificial sweeteners in it and then they're they are you know confused as why they're having massive running stools uh so that's a major one and when you when you cut out fiber from your diet then you you're just pushing liquid around instead of this big clog of you know you know two by four this have to have any pass through your colon um and so that's the thing so if you're eating anything else besides just meat and water get rid of it and um and see how you go um it's not about being fat adapted that that's not fat adapted fat adaption is that you're you're able to run on your body's own fat and make ketones blood sugar and liver glycogen so you know that that's already happened because if you're not eating carbohydrates you're still alive then you're fat adapted right because you're making the energy you're not you haven't dropped dead uh from a lack of that so um you know which is not never going to happen like your body's not gonna not gonna do that so um that uh you know you are fat adapted that's not a problem you know having runny stools is not about being fat adapted that's either from having something that's a laxative or from eating a lot more fat than your body can absorb and then it just goes out because you don't absorb it your body doesn't want to absorb every ounce of fat that you eat it wants to absorb because the amount of fat that it wants for its needs and then it doesn't want the rest right so you have you know bile and it's really hard for your body to absorb fat without bile and so when you run out of bile fat goes out a little bit will be absorbed not much and so um that can be liquid now the other thing is is that if you are just eating meat and just eating fat and you're sort of pulling back on the fat and pulling back on the fat that usually works for most people um but then there are some people that just for whatever reason just find that they have a difficult time with more liquid fat like rendered fat like like beef drippings or Tallow or something like that and that just seems to go through them very quick and the solution for them is to eat solid fat cellular fat that's in in the tissue and then you chew that up you swallow it and your it takes a longer for your body to break down that cellular structure and get it the fat and so it's sort of like a you know a time delay medication a slow release medication that that just weeps out a little bit at a time and then your body can absorb that and trap it down better and so and some people actually would eat the fat uncooked and then cook the steak up and eat that afterwards and they find that and and the people that have had those issues with just they really can't figure out what's going on with loose stool they've done all the different things that I've recommended there uh they find that that works so I I haven't seen anyone that has not resolved their issues going down that stepwise regression yeah I think the same um there's lots of things we can do to sort of help our absorption I think I mean what I got to a point where it's I like to try everything that they put out you know the other influences and things like the high fat 80 20 all these things I can't speak on it unless I try it you know I can't just work on I've run eight days it's not always the best indicator of what's good and what's not um basically me obviously I'm quite a heavy chap I you know need a lot of energy um I was eating I think up to 380 grams of fat per day on a high fat approach and my protein was something like 180 grams so you guys can imagine how much butter that is basically um my body did not adjust to it very well it took about two weeks but after that point it's fine but bear in mind guys I'm quite young so for someone else you might just add 10 grams per day or every few days so you just up it that way um I find a lot of people overdo the protein I think as well um but it's you just got to find your satiety support that's what I think people have a a protein and a fat kind of grammage that they need and oftentimes they come for a background where like my mum for example she's not carnivore but she's more animal-based now she could not do a high fat approach she's been on a low-fat diet for the most of my life she'd have to really transition to it so that's kind of how I'm going about it and like I said the the raw um unrendered beef fat works well we had a question actually about um meal timing and meal volume which I'm gonna Chuck up um sure so uh Pro rhyme I'm guessing Primal Mike said I ate two pounds of steak for dinner so me and ghee and I still feel like I could eat more when I'm done should I cook more or add one more meal during the day uh no just keep eating yeah if you're if if your body's telling you yeah keep eating then I would keep eating especially especially in your evening meal sometimes during the day if you are eating a big meal you'll just get naturally lethargic you're you know directing a whole a lot of blood and resources to your digestive tract to digest and absorb this food that blood is not available for your brain and your muscles so you're going to be a bit more tired you're going to be a bit more lethargic and your body's going to want you rest take it easy rest and digest so uh yes definitely I try to cook more meat than I think I'm going to want to eat and I eat until I get to a point where I go I'm not really interested in eating anymore I don't really want to eat any more this doesn't really taste good anymore or I'm not enjoying it I don't get to the point where it's just like this is gross I want to stop some people do that I don't think that's the right approach I think you just eat what's enjoyable you should always enjoy it I don't think we should start giving ourselves you know a a a you know that sort of negative relationship with food it should always be positive but you know if it is positive keep going right if you're eating the right thing right if you're eating sugar it's a it's a stimulant it's a drug it's addictive of course it's going to give you a positive feedback all drugs give you positive feedback and the difference between drugs and something good for you the kids positive feedback is that if it's good for you that positive feedback will Wane and eventually it will go away and you won't get any positive feedback and if you keep doing it you'll get negative feedback and it'll actually be hard to do and I've seen people do that just because they said well this is this is how much I cook this is how much I normally eat that's how much I need to eat and they just force themselves to do it so you don't need to do that but what you should do is you should keep eating if you're if you're hungry at the end of that or you're still if you're still like man good to the last bite cook another one and um sometimes you need you need to cook sometimes you'll you'll find that you'll get to a point where you just ate as much as you wanted and you know and that's uh and and then you're still hungry another time during the day and when I'm working out heavily you know you might notice this as well um that that I can't I can't get everything I need in one sitting I need to eat twice a day to get to get all the nutrients I want uh what my body wants when I'm when I'm really working out a lot so you know that could be a thing too but you always I think you always maximize meal time especially in uh the later meal and you might even have to eat more than once during the day but you at least eat the capacity once yeah I think that's good advice yeah it definitely gets rid of um some of the Electoral issues that people seem to have like I know a lot of people I speak to especially like maybe middle-aged women they're more like the four or five meals per day maybe no functioning or gallbladder um they're splitting up their their meals into tiny little amounts and they're like getting palpitations they're getting cramping all these sort of things um so this brings me to a next question actually which I thought was quite a good one um hey Dr chafee said in your videos that meat has everything we need as humans but I hear from many Carnival sources I should supplement electrolytes what is the truth now I'm confused oh yeah no you don't need supplements no if you're eating if you're eating your biologically appropriate diet you don't need to take supplements if you if you need to take supplements and by definition your diet is deficient right now there is a difference between a wild moose or a buffalo and you know a grain uh feedlot cow there just is um most people actually do just fine on on the feedlot cow but you know some people will you know maybe need to add in a bit of liver or something like that which is much more nutrient dense if you look at the the nutrient density profile of regeneratively raised grass-fed and finished beef it's you know depending on the farm you look at it was anywhere four to five times the amount of nutrients you know micronutrients right so like the you know the the vitamins and minerals and things like that so we we know that there are more nutrients there but the vast majority of people will do just fine with you know just store-bought meat that's uh you know finished up in a grain lot then for those that that that's not quite enough add in a bit of liver you don't it doesn't need to be much just you know a bit every week um or every few days or something like that and uh and you should be fine and then you know if you are you know you're going to do better but if like a few months down the road you check all your blood work and you're like oh actually you're deficient in something now first of all most people are coming from a state of deficiency so I can take months and months and months and months and months to drag your way out of deficiency and so check it now then check it in a few months and see what the trend is but you know if you are just consistently low like wow this isn't really picking up it's just a bit low on whatever it you know and and liver's not doing it you know adding a bit more liver isn't isn't uh covering that or a bit of heart or a bit of other organs aren't covering that you know you can take a supplement at that point the amount of people that I see that need to do that are few and far between I mean it's like I've never really had to suggest someone to start taking supplements you know like year on in someone who's on Carnival ever ever and uh you know everyone who I've tested whose blood tests I've checked have all been just you know completely optimal and uh you know and uh you know it and they didn't start that way you know they started out pretty deficiently but if you're if you're coming from a point of nutritional deficiency just add in a bit more liver that's usually more than enough that will catch you up and then after a few months you probably don't need to eat as much you don't want to eat too much liver because it can it can lead to hypervitaminosis you can get too much of a good thing especially with the fat soluble vitamins uh can just be a bit much in your your system can get overloaded yeah very well said yeah I'm not a biggest fan of um electrolytes either I think the only outside of an obvious deficiency for some reason um maybe someone that's transitioning it's like a keto diet maybe it might be useful but it's not a long time fix there's something that your body has to um upregulate itself with I find out I mean I don't really know anyone that I work with that takes electrolytes at least I don't know so um yeah well and and sorry I didn't really try to address that specifically but yeah I I mean when people need electrolytes it's first of all few and far between but if if the theoretical time is going to be early on when you're when your insulin is lowering and getting to a more normal level once it's at a normal level and your body sort of gone to a state of homeostasis you're really not going to need these things and so it's um it's something that uh you know we should you know think about in those first first few weeks or a month at most and uh and then really not too worried about too much most people will say like well I'm having I'm having electrolyte problems I'm you know I feel like I'm having low electrolytes it's like okay what does that mean to you and uh oftentimes we'll say well I just sort of feel a bit off and that's electrolytes I'm like well it could be you know but it but it may not be I mean you know electrolyte deficiencies get very very specific things like you know low sodium gives makes people very confused they get seizures they go into a coma and then they die it's very specific uh low potassium you get heart arrhythmias and get atrial fibrillation you get this massively fast racing beat that is just all over the place it's very irregular and uh and then you have a heart attack or heart cardiac arrest and you die so it's like this is this is not like you know a small thing like oh I just kind of feel a little off maybe but you know it's uh it's usually much more else than that uh when you actually have a deficiency um and then you know you can get cramping with magnesium I don't really see too much I've never seen anyone with with clinically diagnosed low potassium or sodium in the hospital you have to be very sick to get those things out of whack um because it makes you very sick and your body really really tight regulates that um I've never seen someone in the hospital with low potassium or sodium who's getting cramps never never in my life not once you know and so you know magnesium yes you know when people get cramps in the hospital we check their magnesium you know but more often than not it's dehydration and so more often than not people are saying oh I'm having electrolyte issues I'm getting these cramps you know and they're like I'm taking all these electrolytes it's just still not working should I take more what should I do I was like well if you're taking electrolytes and it's not helping it's clearly not the electrolytes is it you know could be you know but if you take electrolytes and it's not helping then it's not the electrolyte so you have to think of something else you know go down the list and and I I think hydration is probably the main thing that people neglect yeah I find myself hydration um or need for it seems to go up if I steer any way away from the carnivore diet which goes it corresponds with your ideas about the insulin it definitely seems to make sense um more in selling your blood more sodium probably needed more water all that sort of thing um we've got some super chats which I'm gonna Chuck on the screen now yeah I'm so after a lifetime of toxic exposures do you think Carnival being Elimination Diet can trigger some major herxheimer or detox reactions Azure body is clearing out all the garbage that that's a very good question it depends on if your body is sequestering these toxins in different tissues some of these things are fat soluble um and so it's it's thought they can store in your excess adipose tissue and then if you start losing weight it'll start releasing this out at that point that's certainly theoretical I don't know how real that is I've only heard people speak about it in the abstract that that's something that that that could be a problem I've never actually seen anyone present evidence saying hey here's a study that shows when you start losing weight you know the dioxin levels in their blood goes up I've never I've never seen anyone present that I haven't gone looking for it either I haven't looked and scoured the the literature for that but every time I've heard someone talk about it it's always it I've never heard them reference a study it's always a theoretical like this could happen so it could happen um is it better to perpetuate you know the that body fat and all the things that come with it like metabolic disease and diabetes and cancer and and heart disease and all those sorts of things probably not and so you know I still think that that going on a carnivore diet and eating the appropriate diet is going to be the best thing I mean you don't just neces you don't just lose massive amounts of weight you know just overnight I mean it does take time and so you're going to be you know getting these things out but yeah I mean you know if people are losing weight and these are expelling out these different toxins and things like that that's something to keep in mind if all of a sudden you're like I'm actually not feeling great I'm sort of feeling worse you know there's a sort of a question there someone's saying that you know what about carnivores they've been in carnival for like a year year and a half and all of a sudden they start getting joint pain and this and the other um first of all really I've never seen that like maybe like one or two people have heard about that and and and generally that's thought to be like oxalate you know dumping or something like that that you know is this delayed response and especially in carnivore I spoke to Sally Norton and she said that um carnivores can get quite delayed response to that because there's not much calcium you know with people that don't do dairy if they're just doing meat and water and she said that that lack of you know high volume calcium uh actually seems to to not strip out all the oxalates so it's not it's a it's we sort of don't get that same response uh but it can happen down the track and then also you start increasing the amount of calcium you eat and all of a sudden it starts stripping out of your the oxalate out of your body and start getting more issues and one of the classic signs of oxalate toxicity or oxalate dumping is uh joint pain that sort of thing and causing um non-uh you know non you know like pseudo gout sort of thing it's one of the five causes of uh gout basically you know uric acid crystals being one of them now they call them gout and pseudo gout but oxalic acid is is one of the oxalates or one of the pseudo gal uh things so that could be but I mean the amount of people that I've seen have problems years down the track is just I mean maybe one you know like maybe one and then it's sorted out so some people are just having you know just other issues that just sort of they're like okay well maybe this is carnivore and it turns out it's not and uh it's fine but you know it depends on toxic exposures depending if those are fat soluble depending on where they're built up and so but that's that's a theoretical is that you can have this these toxins sort of sitting in your fat tissue and if you you know and if you lose weight very quickly it could you know increase that to a point that your body has a difficult time contending with it that's there's a potential for that so just be be mindful of that and um you know and if you think there's there's a problem you can talk to your doctor and say hey I think I might have some some toxicity in my blood from these different exposures can can we run some tests and see what's going on you know may not be possible to test for all things but you know anytime you're you're feeling pretty rotten it's it's important uh it's important to get your doctor involved especially if you're thinking that you have these sorts of toxic exposures yeah doctors are useful for getting some tests guys so don't um they think people like us are just saying don't speak to a doctor they don't know anything you know they do have their uses they're not they're not all the same evidently so yeah excellent uh we've got a couple more Super chats we've got one from my friend Tom um could you interview Harry sopanos please um have you heard of harrispalness.jv no no I don't think so why not no I don't know um sound familiar who is that he's um he's a good friend of Bart k and a friend of myself um he's very knowledgeable and he basically he he cured himself of severe heart issues um quite a few years ago and his whole thing is obviously the carnival diet intestinal Health all the life hacks all the buy hacks he's very no-nonsense he really reads into the mechanisms reason to proper studies that I have um you actually posted something in the chat I can't find it now but it is about the gallbladder and sludge and things like that I think and he's very insightful he's one of the people you do need to get in your Channel um okay I highly recommend interviewing him if you have the opportunity to so I'll write a note now yeah and um yeah and so is he does he sort of have a Channel or or YouTube plays or is he a doctor a researcher or or a disease on his own or how does he how do people know about it sure so he's basically a citizen scientist he's a civilian um he's not a doctor or anything but he does have a YouTube channel which is just Harry sopanos okay and that's literally it and he's got he donates like eight out of his time every other week basically for live q and A's so he does like a four or five hours stem he take yeah and he asks everyone's questions yeah oh very doesn't last for anything either he's um yeah you'd like him a lot honestly if when you speak to him just make sure make sure you've got like three hours perked yeah right like a question you know he he really gets into the weeds so honestly very useful yeah no that's that's great yeah I mean you know man after my own heart I mean I I sort of feel bad sometimes because people say oh yeah this is going to be like a 45 minute interview in my head I'm like no it's not yeah it makes sense you know because yeah yeah I think it's important to get into the weeds and to get into details like that so that's great yeah no I'll check him out yeah it's amazing we've got 405 people live in the chat right now apparently oh that's great yeah apologies if we've not got to everyone's questions I'm addressing the super chats just because it's the way people did to do things um yeah so vegetable oil has a half-life of 680 days is there a way to get it out rapidly probably not eat it I think yes yeah yeah I think that's that's probably the way to go um you know half-lives are half-lives it's hard to sort of um you know get around that um I don't know is a short answer I don't I don't know um if there's any way they could speed that up as for you know you know it might be that you're the more healthy you are maybe the quicker your body can clear these things out but you know half-life you know I sort of wonder where that that number's coming from you know that that's sort of how long the half-life is in your body you know these oils you know get get used in different ways in our bodies and and uh you know the the the um the molecules that mimic cholesterol for example get you know used up in ways you know in in cell membranes and things like that which is where cholesterol is supposed to go and uh you know gets used in different things that cholesterol is supposed to be used for and really messes it up and your blood cells actually become more brittle and they die uh much quicker they don't last as long and all these sorts of things so it's um uh you know is that 680 days is that the half-life in your body before your body sort of works these little bastards out I don't know um and anytime they test that sort of thing it's going to be in the context of a you know standard American diet so you know is that 680 days for carnivores if you're if you're just giving yourself an abundance of actual healthy animal cholesterol and fat will that replace this crappy stuff that that your body doesn't want your body seems to be able to recognize this stuff and not like it macrophages you know they make these foam cells they they suck up cholesterol and things like that they actually really like the cholesterol they don't like to give it up but they will spit out the the plant cholesterol as a plant sterols really quick they just don't like this stuff they just spit it out in fact the there was a study looking at autopsies of people that had like you know big uh arterial plaques and their aorta and other sorts of areas and they found there was actually it wasn't it wasn't animal cholesterol that was in the plaque so it was actually the plant sterols that were in the plaques right so that's something to think about as well that just you know there's this part of this disease process that these things are involved in as well um and that your body doesn't like them that's trying to just sort of shove them in areas and just you know get rid of this crap and keep it away from it so you know I would you know I would hope that being on a carnivore diet and having a big abundance of fat and animal cholesterols your your body is going to you know get rid of the less desirable plant sterols and and oils and and replace it with with the good stuff but I I don't know for sure I don't uh I can't think of any study that I've seen that would would say one way or the other but you know I I'm at least in this for the long run I'm not I'm not just doing this for a year to try to you know get better health and then I'll just go back to eating like crap and then just just come back to it you know whenever I'm just feeling down in the dumps you know I've I've been doing this far longer than 680 days so that that's me that's I'm really happy with that 680 days because I'm way way past that there's none of that crap in my body anymore uh if that's that's the thing if you're going by like five half-lives you know to get you know none of this stuff out of there then you know you maybe have a bit to go but you know the majority of it it's going to be out for me and I never I never use uh you know vegetable oils much at all so I don't think um I had much of that that in me but uh yeah I think just the main thing is is that it takes as long as it takes I have I don't think there's any good way of figuring out how long that's actually going to be especially in people that are doing a carnal board diet and so just just realize it like you know the best thing you can do is just not add any more in in your body and it will eventually go away and that's good news because you're just going to keep feeling better and better it's not it's not the end of the road on feeling better you know you feel you know so much better like a thousand times better in two weeks your body starts working ways it never did before after you know six months to a year you're just like you're just a whole new person and just feel amazing and now look you've got you're just going to keep getting better and better and better because you've got uh you know more things for your body to work through so just look at it as a positive you know you're just you're you haven't got all your your Christmas presents at one time so you know something to look forward to yeah but by denomination I think if people follow this for like five years they'll feel substantially better obviously I think like the most initial thing to me I see with people is the digestion improves a lot so not sort of having a tummy rambling like a Civic kind of feeling you know um they call it GERD and stuff like that I seem to notice that it gets put into a mission quite quickly yeah we've got a question from Karsten bornman basically he's asking about beef and if everything is contained within beef that we need for mitochondrial health I'm guessing he's talking about like maybe CoQ10 and cofactors something like that maybe uh yeah well no everything yeah everything you need is is in beef in in the proportions that you need it so yeah I know and and the the big thing with mitochondrial health is is not adding in things that harm them and there are you know you know I talk about my my professor of cancer biology who talks about all the different carcinogens that are in Plants I was talking to uh Professor Thomas C Fred who's professor of cancer biology at Boston College and uh and he was I sort of mentioned that you know my experience with that and why I stopped eating plants in the first place and I mentioned the carcinogens and he and he sort of said and he said to me he's like and you know what all of those plant carcinogens do they all damage the mitochondria so you know that's the main thing with mitochondrial health is just staying the hell out of its way and just just letting your body get on with it a major part of this is is just not eating carbohydrates which raise your insulin which shut down your body's ability to go through autophagy and mitophagy and replace these these old decrepit cells and these old decrepit mitochondria and and recycle them into new healthy cells in mitochondria so that work better and and Trigger um and Trigger um myogenesis and you know the creation of more mitochondria more younger more youthful healthy mitochondria which makes you younger and more healthy and and you can literally age backwards and this is why you see people going on a carnivore diet after you know months or a year or whatever I mean they look 10 years younger I look 10 years younger than I did when I was when I started this at 38 you know but I guess that's a matter of opinion if I look if I look 28 to people but I definitely look younger than I did then and I look younger than I did then right I don't think I looked 38 at 38 anyway but I certainly look a lot younger now than I did then and I feel much better I feel like I did in my early 20s when I was you know playing rugby and doing carnivore and and that was the only time in my life that I've ever felt this good and so you know that's the main thing yes you have absolutely everything you need in beef in the proportions that you need it you know if you want to add in some heart and some kidney and liver and things like that sometimes go for it and those are going to be very good for you but do remember that these things come in proportions right there is there you have an entire cow a buffalo you're gonna eat that thing it's going to take you two years to finish all the meat on that cow it has one heart it has one liver it has two kidneys right so and a lot of intestinal tract so you know that may last you a while you'll be in chitlins for a while but you know it's um it's uh it's something that you should keep in mind as far as that proportionality is concerned you know eating you know 500 grams of liver and heart every day it just doesn't doesn't make sense you know because that's just not that's not the proportion that you would ever find that in the animal and there are people like the Inuit who don't need any organs at all because the organs of predatory sea mammals are uh very very very nutrient dense to the point of being toxic and so you can't eat polar bear liver at all it will kill you with the amount of vitamin A it has so and you eat enough seal liver as well that'll kill you from the vitamin A2 so just keep that in mind but yes you have everything you need in in beef and then if you're only eating beef that's the main thing because you're going to eliminate all the things that are harming your mitochondria very well said um this came up and it made me quite amused more muscle here than every vegan YouTuber influence combined yeah how much of a task that is but we need to have Dr Baker on now then when we're set I think yeah it's huge man have you have you met him you were at PSC yeah yeah he's a he's like he's like taller yeah you've met of course haven't you yeah yeah and and you know the thing is that he's he's six foot five I'm I'm six foot three you know it's only sort of change so when I saw us in in pictures sort of next to each other I was just like oh all right I actually you know stacking up pretty well I look I look uh you know like not not too much smaller than him but like next to him like that that that small difference uh to me it was just like this guy's huge you know it's like I don't know what it is but like you know when you're when you're looking at someone who's taller than you especially when you're used to being as tall or taller than other people like it's like it's a noticeable difference like you see and so he and he's just he's just a big dude so yeah yeah I agree I remember just getting up to him and um it's weird I mean I just saw him under the like a spotlight in the the stadium sort of thing I just saw like the shadow get around his biceps and his arms and his legs I was like back there it's quite quite bad quite bad um yeah anyway I've got one question if do we have much time left at all I don't want to interfere with your sleep or anything no it's all good okay um well I've got a loved one that I'm quite concerned about right now and they're going through quite a tricky time and I'm trying to basically propose them to be more carnivore more animal based things like that um is there any kind of ideas that you have them based on that information so how would you support Mental Health um alleviate depression anxiety and like how does a diet help that well I mean you know it sort of our proposed the last question it it comes down to the mitochondria it appears that when you when you make your mitochondria more healthy your your body becomes more healthy but your brain becomes more healthy as well and that's very important for mental health the mitochondria really what run yourselves um and um people think everything's from the DNA and that's because when we discovered the DNA everyone was just like oh this is it this explains everything DNA is everything that's a code for everything that's a code of life that's everything without realizing that yes that's the code but who's the programmer who's the who's the people taking that information and doing something with it right so I think of the DNA as the blueprints and the mitochondria as The Architects they're the ones using the blueprints to go and build and make and they're also the construction workers they're also the workers they're going around they they move around the inside of your cell and they go to this organelle and that organelle on this part of the thing and they release ATP in order to trigger a response because they want this thing to do its job and so here's this energy you go do your thing and kick it off they just bouncing around just flicking around um you know turning things on and off and using energy and ATP to do that and so when you have these older cells are broken down they're not making as much uh energy or they might not making it as fast or they're not moving as quickly you know the the saying goes you know day late and a dollar short it's just it's not going to work right now you have hundreds to thousands to sometimes hundreds of thousands of mitochondria in each cell and so you certainly have you know hundreds or thousands in your neurons and you have hundreds of billions of neurons to trillions of neurons right so this compounds very very quickly those just little delay little delay little delay not quite enough energy not quite enough ATP going not quite enough of this neurotransmitter going and the neurotransmitter is going a little late and it's turning things off a little late turning things on a little late or or or so or too fast sometimes sometimes that can be a thing because you can be more excitatory because you're not inhibiting things because you know it wants to inhibit some things and it doesn't slow it down so it's but basically it's just it's just getting mixed signals and so when you're when you're doing that trillions of times over there's problems and what uh Professor Chris Palmer from Harvard has been doing he's a professor of Psychiatry at Harvard and he's been he's been curing people with even schizophrenia major depression OCD bipolar um uh schizoaffective disorder OCD I already said um you know anxiety major depression beating myself but I don't want to miss anything and even ADHD autism things like that he's in really dramatically improving People's Health mental health through this and and their physical health as well and you can do that with a ketogenic diet you can do that with a carnivore diet he even did carnivore for a while and I think he's just really just mostly like high animal you know based keto now but yeah at one point he was doing carnivore which is a ketogenic diet unless you're you're sort of eating you know fruit honey and things like that which I don't think is a great idea is when I say carnivore I mean the ketogenic version of carnivore and so by doing that you will allow your body to recycle your mitochondria make more mitochondria and and make them work better and if you're mitochondria are working better your cells are working better and your neurons are cells and so that's a big deal so there was a study that looked at ketogenic diets and mitochondria and they found that after three or so months on a corn or a ketogenic diet carnivore diet whatever that people had four times the number of mitochondria in their cells and they were four times as effective right so there's this massive compounding of benefit that you get right so you have four times as many mitochondria and they're all four times as effective so they're working better and you have more of them to do the job so that that has been shown in clinically tested with with human trials to significantly improve mental health and serious mental health disorders that people thought were just unexplainable uncurable only medications can help the medications are not as helpful as as uh we would hope they would be they can they can Jesus they've saved many people's lives but there's only about 10 percent of people who get really good effects from these medications only about 10 percent and you know you know another 10 20 30 percent of people that get partial results and there's about 50 of people really don't get much benefit at all and so it's really not a great treatment just dietary changes and improving your metabolic health or mitochondrial Health by other means such as weight lifting and getting outside in the sun and doing all these sorts of Natural Things I have been shown clinically to be much much more effective than medication without all the side effects that's great advice yeah I think completely the same um just sometimes you have to takes a bit of a doctor to sort of you know the authority kind of starts you know it definitely helps I've noticed that myself I came from a background of horrendous mental health um chronic fatigue as well and it the mental health side of it did clear very quickly to be fair on the carnivore diet um the fatigue though is taking some time but saying that I've had spine fusion surgery all these other things so yeah a few things I think is I'm a happy guy I'm a happy guy um I'm much rather be happy than fully able I think um so yeah I mean the last time we spoke does chafer was like five six months ago and since then I've made Leaps and Bounds in my own personal Journey so I'm great grateful for the advice of you and other people as well it's um definitely a tremendous help wow you're very welcome and and that's great to hear you know and that's the thing we were talking about this just gets better and better as you go you know your body still improves your health you know keeps improving and um you know I I still feel better and better as I go you know it it's been great I I sort of Wonder you know you know the the magic isn't as dazzling now because it was just such a stark contrast on what you know how I felt before and then after I went carnivore again I'm like oh my God why haven't I been doing this my whole life and now I'm just used to it that's just my life I just always feel awesome and like and and I'm like great this is great um I'd so you know I sort of Wonder I was like well I don't want to take this for granted but I just I I have not lost sight of how good I feel and uh maybe I don't uh you know see that stark contrast about how bad I used to feel but um no but it is really good and I I keep feeling better and better and I just you know I'm just really happy that you're getting getting more and more beneficial results but I'm sure that'll just keep going what if you don't mind me asking like what sort of things change like what has been going on since I saw you last yeah so since last time um I've been more attentive with my YouTube channel I've had some portions of good luck in a way and that's motivated me to sort of try a bit harder you know because I I was very sort of bitter pessimistic person but I'm not like that anymore really not and people notice this around me so it's um it's amazing honestly and you just kind of said about how you've the the stark contrast is less evident now because it's been so long kind of thing um and we had a question from Andrew Taylor which was did you have any iron toxicity or perhaps any other toxicity when you went full carnivore did like before like the oxalate thing was coming about um did you notice anything with your body like your skin detox symptoms iron toxicity Maybe no no for me uh it was just all Aces uh my yeah I just felt amazing it was sort of after well I just started feeling better and better you know from day one as soon as I started eating a lot more meat and it was just like skipped all the nasty ass plants and things like that like instantly I was just I was just loving every meal that I ate I was finally satiated I was finally feeling like I was getting proper food and my body felt good that way my workouts were just getting better and better and better and um I I so I just felt a lot better and then it was sort of after two weeks that I noticed that I just it was just such a huge contrast from where I was before that I felt just absolutely amazing and um you know and that's when I was you know that's when I did that you know I started noticing that I just wasn't getting sore and I was like oh that's really weird and and then I did that big crazy workout where I did 32 sets of squats or heavy legs anyway with 20 sets of heavy squats at the end to failure and I just did that for like four hours I just like I'm just gonna see if I can wear my legs out and just see if that makes me sore because I wasn't didn't I couldn't wear my legs out before or I didn't wear my legs out before so maybe that's why I wasn't sore that's why I was like all right well I'm just gonna I'm just gonna over I'm just gonna go until I'm I'm done and I can't do it anymore and then I'll see I couldn't get to the point where I was done and so I ended up capping it at 32 just because I was like well that's that that's enough I'm not I'm not just gonna do the jewelry thing yeah and because I was like I really just saw my body I was just like I could literally just keep doing this the rest of the night as long as I gave myself a few minutes rest and in recovery I could just go and do the exact same amount over and over and over again that's what I was like that's enough for this and um and the next day I was actually quite worried because I've really overdone it on leg workouts before nothing close to that but you know like a good you know 12 15 sets of super heavy legs you know even in the middle of rugby season when I was like in really good shape and my legs were really strong still I could just me I was in so much pain and just like just hobbling and couldn't walk for two weeks I mean I was just done this is before I went carnivore the first time when I was like 19 uh 20 just turned 20. and um and so I had uh been worried about that and I was like oh God I'm gonna be I'm gonna be crippled this is gonna suck and um the next day I was fine it was like I'd done nothing and I was like walking upstairs I was just like okay that's weird it's like I did nothing and I was like okay I'm taking two steps at a time like yeah I mean I guess I could feel something you know my hamstrings are you know sort of said that there's something's been done yesterday but easily do it again there wasn't any soreness or stiffness so I'm like all right I was gonna go hiking went hiking with a friend went up this horrible mountain called Mount Si it's just terrible switchbacks the whole way up but it was it was fine I actually had a fine time with it and um you know did that it was like a three-hour hike it was just just huge huge thing uh and then after that I was like right I feel good I'm gonna play some rugby and I went to practice that night you know and so you know and that was after two weeks and I felt that much better where I I you know I'd only been back from Bangladesh for like a month and I I just felt so much better and you know my health was just through the roof and my physical form was so much better and I just kept getting better after that just kept getting better and better and better and um so thankfully I didn't I didn't experience you know any oxalate dumping or any toxicity you know dumping or I certainly didn't get any iron overload that's something I don't really see in clinic and uh you know some people's ferritin will go up a ferritin can go up and down for different reasons ferritin is an acute phase reactant and it can respond to inflammation or different stimulus uh depending on how much you're working out and different things that you're doing it can it can raise or lower your ferritin so that's not that's not really what you want to look at if you're if you're worried about iron overload and I really haven't seen people get iron overload on on just a meat and water diet that's interesting yeah I've only heard of it maybe maybe twice people with those genetic conditions um they've had to like have their blood draw and things like that base it seems quite rare to me personally um my mind's in a normal range as well um it's funny you're saying about like athleticism and stuff so we had Tilly sports day yesterday and she's now six years old and there was um there was enough time this year to do like a parents race so you can imagine me like a sort of stocky six foot one guy I was like well I'll give it a go um remember it's something I'm not really meant to be doing right now because my hips not in great Stead just do it you know it's um I'm competitive by Nature so for me not doing it would have been a I'd look back in time and regret it not doing it um yeah it's funny you said because people always make this argument about needing carbs for either a long distance or short distance I was like I'm gonna prove this wrong so I demolished the race and um obviously I won but um yeah so it's just a short like 50 50 yard dash sort of thing um then people will still make Elegance against it so it doesn't count or this over there all you need to do um and carbohydrates and things like that I mean you've obviously spoken to lots of different people now from different angles have you met have you met people that are militant about the carbohydrates especially for the more explosive sport to talk um it certainly still in you know people's lexicon especially when they're you know they're playing sports or like sport trainers and things like that they're really nervous about that now I've spoken to a lot of people and you know I explain all this stuff to them and uh and and some people just like yep sounds good I'll try it and they and they do great and they do they always do great in their athletic performance and endurance goes way up every time um there might be a bit of a lag in that adjustment period the sort of the fat adapting period where they're making you start making enough ketones and blood sugar and glycogen things like that maybe they feel a bit run down like Ryan Talbot who's the NCAA uh track star uh All-American decathlete uh two-time All-American decathlete you know he was saying that when he went carnivore he sort of had a bit you know I guess you call it keto flu or whatever where he's felt a bit off but he said it didn't actually impact his performance and his training he did it mid-season uh which is you know pretty bold you know I mean I I had no problem I did that as well and I felt fantastic from day one some people a bit worried was oh well maybe my my performance will sort of go down a bit if you're eating enough and you're getting enough fat and you're eating to satiety I I've not really seen people struggle uh athletically it's usually people that are under eating that they they sort of get a problem but even then you know I mean people do well fasted you know they fasten their athletic performance goes up so um you know it's it's something that you can maybe you know people will be a bit nervous about it so I've spoken to sort of people and they're like oh I don't know I don't really want to mess with things you know mid-season or you know suggest that the players sort of mid-season especially you know professionals you know they this is their job you know and they need to and they need to keep that that level of performance up or they aren't going to do well and so I suggested to do it one like um uh you know athletic director for one of the AFL teams here in Australia you were sort of talking about that he was he was sort of interested because they're director of rugby uh went carnivore and he was a Hall of Fame AFL player and he says I've never felt better I just feel fantastic you know this is something that that you know we should get the team on and so the athletic director was interested but you know cautiously interested and um so I put him in the way of you know Professor Tim knox's work on on all of this which is you know world-class sort of stuff showing that you don't need carbs you just flat out don't anyone who took biochemistry should know this that you know once you stop eating carbohydrates after 24 hours you make all the carbohydrates that you need and you make ketones it's great you know so you don't you do not need to eat these things and um you know how many civilizations you know have you know never eaten carbohydrates have been you know insanely athletic and uh and hail and Hardy so um so he was he was a bit interested but he was sort of like you know is this something you really do mid-season I'm like well look you know that's obviously something to be concerned about it doesn't have to do that I mean most people do fine uh but I understand the concern you know maybe get your your Bench Warmers the guys who aren't starting guys who are sort of going out maybe maybe see how they go it's like hey you guys want to try this see how you go maybe all of a sudden they're just ramping up and they start taking out the starting player spots and go okay all right let's get everybody on board with this so there's ways you could do it you know there's safe ways you could do it where like if you you needed to transition and someone you know had a bit of a lag for a week or two well if this guy's not even playing you know uh and he's just practicing who cares you know he that guy's got time and so you know if I was that person in that position where I was just like well I want I want to leg up on athleticism or something like that I mean I would jump on that and um you know so you know that's something that people can think about but you know there I've the only people that really just vehemently push back or just like you know just like the Bro Science guys on on you know the internet and stuff like that oh well blah blah blah you know just say something ignorant that it's just like well actually no that's completely ridiculous and and you can say why but you know most people when you explain this stuff to them and you go through the biochemistry and how this works I'm like look this is this is in Biochemistry textbooks that's not me this is not my theory this is this is a fact you know and all animals are in a state of ketosis they're all making their uh well you know the ones that aren't drinking nectar and honey and things like that I have no idea what their biochemistry is like but you know herbivores and carnivores you know that and herbivores that eat fibrous food and carnivores that eat other animals they're all getting fat and protein they're not getting carbohydrates so they're all in this so-called ketogenic State no one is is uh you know questioning their athleticism and their exercise endurance and things like that I mean these are just you're just raw wild animals that are just you know rip badasses so um that's what we're supposed to be you know and um and it will absolutely benefit everyone's athletic Endeavors just born on like it's just not gonna and and it's better too because you tap into your to your fat stores when you eat carbohydrates you shut that down your insulin goes up it shuts off your access to your fat stores so that's it you can run on your blood sugar and your glycogen if you have enough of that to get through the end of the race or that activity or whatever you're doing yeah you'll be fine but like but if you don't if you're playing like a longer game you're going to run out of glycogen and you're going to hit the walls you have to keep sucking down sugar and re-feed and getting carbs and things like that which you can do but if you just don't eat carbs in the first place you make all the carbs that you need and you know as fast as you need them like this is a very very quick process like there's not like a lag that I just like sit there and like for like five minutes and then you replenish your glycogen then you go out back out there is making this constantly or you die like I mean there's just like your body is going to make this stuff for you so yeah we you know there's limits to a certain extent but like honestly I can tell you from my own experience you will not be able you when you get in shape when you're pushing yourself in shape you know you will not get to the point that you're you're going to be able to outwork your body's ability to generate energy that's just it's just not going to happen you know you're not you're not going to be able to work that hard that's not going to happen yeah well so Professor Paul K makes the point um your muscles will always have energy it just might be that the transition when you're working off your you know your blood glucose versus fatty acids or adipose tissue if you're not fat adapted it might take a bit longer so what you're saying is just pick one substrate and ideally pick the right one yeah yeah it makes sense your body fats you know you've got heaps of energy you know from body fat on your whole body what's your glycogen going to be like some of my size maybe 800 grams something like that that's not going to get me for a well never God forbid I've never done a 20 mile race but like a 20 mile race you know it's not it's not going to work I'm gonna need gels and things so yeah yeah well that was the thing I think you know I was talking to uh uh Richard Smith you know goes by keto Pro um and he was saying that uh you know you when you carbo load and do all that sort of stuff you have like 15 000 joules of energy and glycogen in your liver but you know even for like you know just you know someone like URI that doesn't have like a huge amount of fat stores you have your upwards of 150 000 joules of energy you know in in a slim person right so even even a slim person is going to have more than enough energy to go through any race and uh you're just not going to go through all that uh you're just not you know and so um you know if you're doing some sort of like insane like five day Merit it was actually a race it was like a five-day tour it was just as long as you could go but it was the the circuit was like sort of like 6.6 k and you had to finish it in an hour under an hour and if you finished it in 40 minutes you could take a 20 minute rest and then do the other one but you had to make it in under an hour in order to qualify for the next one and you just keep going until you can't make it uh or stop or give up right and so the guy who won it was a guy from Western Australia who who literally ran for four days straight and um Jesus I mean it's just crazy he ended up doing it was something like something like 670 or 680 kilometers straight he just just kept just kept running and running and running and running it was absolutely crazy you know so if you do something like that okay yeah maybe maybe you need a refeed you know maybe just take some butter with you some Tallow just you know eat that down as you're going and just give your body some energy but um you know if you're doing anything less than that you're gonna be fine yeah well set we had a we've got a question from Doc Phil to Convoy in the chat which is quite a good one um it's very tricky to Define what you'll see so basically what you said about not using glucose using um fat basically he says if your body fat is too low protein can't convert to glucose quick enough of course from that we need to identify what two low body fat is then also in that instance would you just say okay have a stick of butter or something as you're running um yeah I'm guessing below like six percent body fat or something for men yeah the thing is you're talking about those kids in in Africa and things like that with like the big belly and things like that you know there there are just in in uh you know Dire Straits and they've got ascites from from the starvation and they're and they're actually catabolizing their own muscle tissue that's that's a very different state um and uh so that's you know that that's not what we're talking about so as long as you have fat stores you will run on your fat you're not you're not gonna actually uh you know cannibalize your own muscle tissue uh to get in to get into that so you won't need that so that that is correct but it's going to be very difficult for you to get into that unless you're like truly emaciate it or doing that stupid long 690 uh K race you know you you're you will still have fat stores available you know like even people with you know five ten percent body fat are gonna have weeks of of energy available to them uh at just for normal functioning and then so if you do like high level exercise you know obviously that's going to go through your stores quicker but I mean literally you have weeks of energy available of normal living and and you know so it the the idea that you're going to cut through that and and have to revert to protein is uh it's unlikely but if you do yeah exactly eat some butter something like that get some Tallow swallow that d own and um I think you'd be fine it was just a just um"

want to go Carnival is a risk thanks um you know I don't know uh specifically about that but my my um just because I haven't come across it but you know I've my my general my general feeling is this which is that regardless of the you know genetic you know individualities of of each different person they're still human and so they still biologically are going to have you know a optimal diet that is human the same human diet and so I still think that that's a carnivore diet so maybe their bodies work a bit differently you know in certain ways and maybe they can't metabolize things just as well as other people and that that can make some logistical issues uh down the track but I still think that optimal for one human is going to be optimal for another human and um you know so I still think that that would be beneficial for her maybe she just has to address how she eats fat how much she eats and and how she goes about that but I think that's a you know a practical uh issue that that she can just test by trial and error and then see how she goes but at the end of the day she's human and humans are supposed to eat meat you know and this I don't know how long that you know you could sometimes you can you can trace back like when that that Gene sort of popped up in in the population and and you can sort of see like you know where that is it's like oh okay this this happened about 20 000 years ago okay well that's fine you know we were in the Ice Age 20 000 years ago and we were eating mammoth so you know obviously it's not it's not that big of a deal if uh if it survived an Ice Age so that's something you can think about as well sort of when that thing popped up and um yeah and that's pretty much it but you know it doesn't matter what your specific genetic abnormalities are or idiosyncrasies are you're still human and and humans are designed to eat meat yeah it would make sense we've got to this point just by the off chance we've you know Nature's very clever isn't it really that's chafee it's not going to make mistakes I don't think it's funny we've got to this point and somehow these sort of things crop up and I wonder how much of it is like epigenetics versus Diet versus something else I'm not sure yeah um right I think we had one point about basically what can we do to spread awareness of the carnivore diet with whatever capacities we have so I remember the first time I spoke to you you had something like 60 odd thousand subscribers now you've more than doubled it so you've reached more than you know two times more people yeah it's a significant amount helps in it Yeah well yeah well it's not what's just nice that you know people are are more people are becoming aware of this and and looking into it and becoming interested in it and and looking at all the the the other people that are succeeding with it as well it's uh it was sort of nice to hear you mentioned people going on the 60 Minutes uh thing and saying hey hold on a second you know carnivore should be lumped in like that carnivore saved my life it's done all these sorts of things for me that's great and people see that and they go like okay well look I have those same problems this person has and you know I can um you know and you know if it works for them maybe it can work for me and then give it a try and and that's what a lot of people are doing they're seeing they're seeing the comments they're seeing people discussing you know uh and a video on autoimmune issues or something like that you have the discussion on the video but then there are all these discussions going on in the comments and people talking about their autoimmune issues and how they were benefited by that and other people see that go like you know I have that you know someone talking about how it you know you know put their Ms into a mission and like hey you know I have MS you know what did you experience what did you see and other people go like yeah it worked for me it worked for me it worked for me it worked for me and that can be very powerful for people because nothing's supposed to do that nothing is supposed to be able to put Ms into remission um you know both sides a heavy heavy heavy medications that are very detrimental to your health that was actually one thing you know I was thinking as well with with jdap for his question um there are a lot of resources around in in the carnivore Community there are a couple Facebook groups have been around for 20 years or so such as uh zero um zero carb health and zeroing in on health so I would recommend joining those groups and going in there because they have search functions first of all you can just ask the question hey you know my wife has this does anybody else have this whether it's been has anyone else experienced a carnivore diet with this condition and what did you see what did you do what did you find there might be people that answer there there probably will be but a big thing is that basically every question Under the Sun has been asked in that group so you just go to the search function and you just and you just search for a couple key terms like that and you will see thread after thread after thread if someone exactly asking that exact same question and the discussions that have happened and if you don't find something in there then you ask a question and and you'll get answers you know and it may be that you know it's it's rare enough that not that many people have tried it but most people most people will find answers to their questions and and that's something that you can do you know I don't you know we don't have like studies on like specific on that specific disease and carnivore specifically so unfortunately anything we talk about is going to be anecdotal in regards to some of these things but that can be quite powerful you know it you know you're just seeing what other people's experiences are they have that genetic issue they tried it and improved things or at least didn't harm them they handled that very well great you know they didn't get any health negative Health outcomes lovely so that's reassuring and then you try it yourself and you see if it helps and if it helps great and if you're finding that it's not really helping and things are getting worse okay well then you adjust you try to figure out you know troubleshoot you know you know am I doing everything right am I eating enough am I eating the right amount of fat the right amount of lean meat am I getting enough water are there other conditions in my life that could be affecting this as well and and what else is going on you troubleshoot all those sorts of things and you know see where you're at at the end of it but most people have have gone through this there are hundreds of thousands millions of people really around the world who have have done this now and come to this now uh over the years and most likely there's someone who's had that condition and probably multiple people that have had that condition and have tried carnivore and you can talk to them about their results so that's what I would suggest uh as the best way of of uh getting getting a better answer than that yeah well said I mean the circus search function all these sort of forums and groups is very helpful you found myself I was going through I think it's like the meat Hills website something so I was looking for anecdotes of autism anecdotes of chronic fatigue anecdotes of spine disease um I found something around that for all of those so it's quite if not that informative sometimes it is very inspiring and I thought these people are doing it so you know why not me yeah yeah exactly and you know but that is exactly it you know it's like there are enough people doing these sorts of things that have the exact same problems that we all have and they're getting Improvement and so it's it's obviously worth a try to see if it works for us and if it if if you don't find that it's you know uh working for you and you don't like it you can always stop you know it's not going to kill you and uh it will almost certainly make you better yeah what's your heart limit by the way Dr chafe because we've still got loads of questions left I think um I can probably go two more questions okay um we've got one here from Tony Ennis so hey guys love the conversation can you tell me why I'm not losing weight I'm a six foot male maybe 25 body fat I'm doing straight Carnival for the last three months I want to take care of a lot of butter fat in addition okay uh well you know I mean the first first of all first and foremost really you have to to separate weight and body fat percentage in your in your body composition right um because they're different things and so you know when I when I was doing this I stopped eating vegetables and started eating more meat I lost 23 pounds in 10 days so 10 kilos in 10 days but then I didn't lose anything I stayed the exact same weight uh for months and months and months and months and months I didn't lose any weight but my body composition changed I mean it's before my eyes you know I was working out a lot I was lifting weights a lot I was starred I started back playing rugby and so I was I was replacing the fat I was losing with muscle and so my weight didn't change but my body absolutely changed my body composition changed dramatically and so that's something you have to you have to look at so if you're not losing fat okay there can be other other reasons for that um on it for three months it's early days probably you know most people lose some weight early on especially on your water weight and made with fat and things like that um there are some people that have been doing yo-yo dieting and starving themselves and or eating you know vegan sort of things and and their bodies have just been sort of you know in the state where they've thought that they're in a famine and your body doesn't know the difference between you just trying to diet and uh and a famine it just knows we're not getting the nutrients we need shut down your metabolism slow everything down your body's very fiscally responsible you know if you get your hours cut at work and you're making you know uh 25 less than you were before you know the right thing to do is cut your expenses and and and costs and your output by 25 as well most of us don't do that most people go into debt and like you know I haven't get into going to credit card debt bad idea your body doesn't do that your body your body just shuts it down right and so you'll you'll find that when you've done that your metabolism slows down the output goes down and it can take a while for that to ramp back up and you just need to eat enough you need to eat enough uh sounds like you're definitely eating enough fat you don't have to just eat a whole bunch of butter though you should you should really be getting the the you know the fat that you need from the meat if you if you're eating really really lean meat you know melting some butter into a steak is not that big of a deal I don't think that you need to just you know uh eat a ton of butter I think that you can you should just eat a ton of meat really and uh and there should be fat with that meat it should be fatty meat it may be butter on the meat but um either way um you know look at body composition not weight ever um but really what you need to be focusing on is your health how do you feel how's your energy how's your mental state any medical issues or anything like that that have been improved the athletic endurance that has improved if you're working out you're definitely going to be putting on muscle if you're not losing weight you're definitely losing fat because you're you would be gaining weight if you were gaining muscle and you weren't losing fat right and so I would look at that so focus on your health first and foremost focus on how you feel and and and your well-being that's the most important thing even if you never lost a a an ounce of fat that is always going to be worth it because you're going to be in Better Health then very distant second body composition are you losing fat and just staying away because you're putting on muscle right never at any point does weight make it on the list because it's just it's not important it's body composition right and so if you're not losing fat you need to think about it a few ways are you eating enough are you eating to society are you eating what exactly what you're supposed to eat are you just eating meat only drinking water or you still drinking coffee are you having artificial sweeteners are you having some Stevia or monk fruit sugar or something like that um are you uh you know getting proper sleep are you stressed out all these sorts of things can affect your cortisol and your your ability to you know stimulate fat loss and things like that and um you know and if you're doing everything right and everything's perfect but you're really just not losing fat it's most likely that you have slam down your metabolism from from years of eating you know the wrong thing and and dieting and fasting and trying to starve yourself and it's just going to take time to ramp back up and your hormones are probably going to be way out of whack your leptin is probably going to be very elevated in that circumstance and that takes time it does come down and you wait we'll come down and um you know and so you'll just you'll just reduce that and uh that will start to come down start to come down start to come down and eventually those hormones will get into balance your metabolism will slowly ramp up especially if you're working out especially if you're lifting weights especially if you're eating as much as you feel comfortable eating and and eventually that fat will just start pouring off of you it's very rare that people really don't lose any fat at all but it happens but it's it's you know it's uh it's in though it's because of those reasons but those fix they get themselves sorted out and So eventually uh it'll come right so focus on your health focus on how you feel and the rest will just happen on its own and you know lift weights Sprint and uh be happy yeah like that you've pretty much due to detail everything I would um without giving a consultation I don't really think he could really figure out what it was and that's it was mentioned the point about body composition I'm the composition consultant yeah I'm not the weight consultant so you know we're always dealing with muscle muscle um gain fat loss that's why um but if you're really stuck honestly come to my channel we'll look at my content book consultation you don't have to buy anything but you know to give you a proper idea of what you should be doing I'd advise that very much um yeah yeah and that's the thing you know uh consoles can sometimes you'll go through like all this all those you know I'm just sort of speaking in generalities these are some of the things that people run into or they're eating a lot of dairy that's a big one that that really slo ws people down um yeah and thank you very much for the"

        "transcript": "ws people down um yeah and thank you very much for the ws people down um yeah and thank you very much for the Super Chat Tony that's really uh um really nice of you thank you uh but yeah that that's a big one a lot of people stall because they're eating is way too much Dairy and way too much cheese and things like that I do see that a lot and then they'll stall their fat loss and so something to think about really want to get down to Bare Bones just eating just meat and water that's it and you eat to satiety you don't necessarily need to eat a ton of uh butter but having some butter every now and then is fine yeah I could ask what my channel is guys um it's just competition consultant just type in I come up um you'll see my logo as well um we've got something about mouth taping oh yeah oh that's a that's a yeah that's really good um I just saw that as well um you know math paper is a really good idea it's uh there there have been a ton of studies showing this that people that are that are sort of more mouth breathers it actually changes the structure of your face and like the tubes and things like that and it actually actually it has uh Health ramifications as well and kids will have this mouth breathing um as a kid and they'll it'll change their their shape of their face they're called the adenoid face and they and their cheekbones are sort of sunken and flattened in their face elongated [Music] and they have this like just weird look to their face then you you tape their mouth you encourage nasal breathing during the day and you tape their mouth at night and it actually changes the physical structures of their brain and they become more attractive they become more uh classically attractive at having now what I mean by that is that they and is that they have the proportionalities to their features that when you get these things these golden ratios of all these exactly this this space between here and your eyes and this and your nose and you know the the upper lip in your nose and your chin and all these sorts of things these are these ratios that for whatever reason we look at that and say that is attractive and that's what people generally think of as attractive when we get these averages we had a whole bunch of people you average all their faces they get this these average faces those are ones people say those are the most attractive people ever so like that's like the hottest thing I've ever seen in my life and so those averages so it has has those these this proportionality and there's just these perfect ratios between their features and when you when you go to mouth taping you go to nasal breathing you get that and and so children's faces actually change and and there's you know different sorts of things that are actually suggesting that adults faces can actually change as well I have a problem with that because I've broken my nose so many damn times it doesn't work and so it's very difficult for me to breathe through my stupid nose and there was six months of my life in my you know uh late teenage teens early 20s where I was yeah or the 20s that uh I could not breathe through my nose I could not do it I dumped Afrin in both nostrils and sort of you know tried to get something through it was I was straining as hard as I could really couldn't get any air through and I dump all this Afrin in there all of a sudden I could breathe and then um and that so I'd get through a rugby game like that and um and then after that it would lock down it would have a sort of a rebounding effect where lockdown's so tight it would just be painful I'd just get these like pressure headaches because it was so so locked down absolutely terrible for six months and then I was able to get surgery and um and um yeah and um you know and so so that was awful but uh but no it's it's uh it's actually really healthy it's a really good thing to do and especially for kids but even adults it's just very beneficial in a lot of ways it surprisingly a surprising amount uh I mean this is like generous more like you know like like nitric acid oxide and things like that you know I mean it's like it actually has physiological benefits to everyone just breathing through your nose which is crazy so yeah no I I think that's a great idea for people to to tape their mouths if they um if they feel their nose breathing at night and for kids especially it makes a huge huge difference okay just my about diet and like um facial shape so Maddie she's about 14 months old now she's well ahead of her peers in terms of like her abilities um she's also got a how do I explain like a proper shaped jaw like a human jaw not like an alien kind of balloon head like a proper jaw and you think well that's all the meat we've been given that yeah yeah and that's going to transfer to the rest of her life she'll have a uh you know appropriate jaw shape for you know the goal of eating proper food so yeah yeah definitely um well cool that's a lot I think I'll be running yeah yeah well that's great um yeah cool well yeah thanks everyone for for coming on I know it's a different time than I normally do um but hopefully that was um uh you know different people in different areas of the world were able to um to join that so that's uh that's sort of good too because normally yeah you can't you can't you can't make it possible for everybody all over the world to to make it into these unfortunately yeah me and Dr chafee me and bar k the hardest people to speak to because it means one of us is early one of the Slate every time so yeah I appreciate it take your time out from your your bedtime and that sort of thing um yeah do you want to plug anything as well for people my channel and vice versa so I know you do a book club and groups and things like that maybe yeah well you know you know for people don't know my my Instagram is just uh Anthony chafee MD and my YouTube channel is Anthony chafee MD and I have a patreon Anthony jvmd and that and we have like a book club uh for patreon members that we do every month and we read you know various books um like you know Sally Norton's toxic superfoods uh Jane buxton's um uh the great plant-based con which is excellent and um we just got finished reading uh Malcolm Kendricks uh Dr Malcolm Kendrick's book uh the clock thickens basically arguing that this has heart disease has nothing to do with with uh cholesterol it's just really like a clotting issue and causing damage and all that sort of stuff so um and then this month we're reading uh Professor Ben bickman's book you know why we get sick and so it's we're lucky enough to be able to get the authors on uh to discuss you know at the end once we finish the book and sort of tell them what we thought about the book and ask questions directly of the authors which is which is pretty amazing but it's nice you know it's nice that that I have this platform and I'm able to sort of you know sort of get in touch with those people and and bring them on and Olivia who helps me with my patreon stuff she has she you know she's one of the um uh the board members for phc public health collaboration and so she has has ties to a lot of these people as well so she's been you know uh and she runs the book club as well and so she uh is able to get a lot of these these guys on too that I'm not in contact with so it's been I think he's been very positive for people and I certainly be positive for me I've really enjoyed them as well and um yeah and so if people want to see more of my videos just go to Anthony chafee MD on YouTube I have a playlist for people getting started just called carnivore Essentials and you can sort of go through there I think I've sort of curated a
