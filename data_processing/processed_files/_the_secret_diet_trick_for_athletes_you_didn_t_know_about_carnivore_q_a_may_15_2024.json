        "body": "[Music] hello everyone thank you for joining me for another live today is May 15 uh 2024 so thanks everyone uh for joining in um so yeah should have a bit of a of a different time today as I had a couple other appointments this morning and so thank you everyone for joining on I think there's going to be a bit more people joining as we go go um while people get the sort of the message out if people could uh hit the like button if they're on YouTube or anywhere else hit the like button and leave a comment that can help drive up the algorithm tell it to send it out to more people and let them know that this is going on um let's see so I had a question here from from gag gooth great name 64y old ma male um Dia AMD in Left Eye um maybe diagnosed or diabetes diabetes something in the left eye uh four months ago um IIA I don't know what that means anyway strict carnivore for the last two and a half months blood pressure down uh blood pressure down 15 lbs um and others other sorts of improvements Vision almost completely back to perfect wow that's amazing anybody you know that has gotten off injections I um for I don't well I don't I don't you know treat you know eyes so I I don't know specifically about like the injections and all these sorts of things but I do know from speaking to Dr Lisa Weedman that who is an opthalmologist has been doing Carnival for 15 years she said that you can absolutely reverse macular degeneration and improve eyesight and all these sorts of things by going on a carnivore diet ketogenic carnivore diet and and presumably that would mean getting off treatment for that as well but I can't tell you 100% because I don't treat that but uh she but that video will be coming out with her soon and you can certainly see a lot of her videos in her and her content she makes a lot of videos specifically about the eye as well because that's her that's her forte so um I would check check that out but yeah I've spoken speaking to her and speaking to other opthalmologists that are sort of in this space doing keto carnivore or even just um and more ancestrally appropriate just getting rid of processed foods and all that sort of garbage that this uh absolutely helps macular degeneration and other Vision issues some people people find that they don't even need glasses anymore that actually fixes their stigmatism which is pretty amazing it it's not doing it for everyone I know plenty of people that do carnivore that still wear glasses but every now and then you see someone saying that yeah they actually have a lower uh prescription it lowers their prescription or they come off and don't need glasses anymore at all which is great uh so you know that would have been that would have been nice for you know my family members that that needed glasses and um you know uh got uh you know and then some people you know got lasic and things like that and you know maybe it would have been perfectly fine without uh without that if they went full carnivore but who knows either way it does seem to be helping people and that's great that yours is getting better and if your vision is getting better that's the only thing that matters doesn't matter what anybody else's vision is doing if yours is getting better and so you know work with your doctor work with your opthalmologist and if you're getting better and there's no issues you could potentially come off your uh injections but if um if you still need them you still need them so just work with your opthalmologist and hopefully hopefully you don't need them anymore but that's great so you know thanks for sharing that uh Vision coming back is a major major thing so uh that's that's really great to see we do have some super chats as well I have about an hour so um it's uh is I'll get to everything that I can um but if if we're sort of getting flooded with questions we might have to uh limit the super chats just so we can get to everything because I'm I'm actually flying out today going to um going to to the speak at the phc conference Public Health collaboration conference in the UK and so that um I'm flying out tonight and um and we be gone for a week so we won't be doing another Live this week and the ones next week might be moved around a bit so want to make sure that we get to everything today while we have the time so carnivore Clarity has sent a"

        "body": "hat you want really Andress uh Perez thank you for the hat you want really Andress uh Perez thank you for the Super Chat I am an elite marathon runner currently dealing with a stress fracture on my foot and outer knee also dealing with low testosterone can the carnivore diet help cure me and better my running I think so absolutely well I can it absolutely help with wound healing and help with uh you know just your body working better in general having less um less inflammation experiencing less pain and will definitely help with low testosterone that's i' I have every single every single one of my male patients we test testosterone I mean just that's a bit of a specialized practice in the metabolic Health side of things and so I check people's testosterone that's a that's a a baseline test that I that I do for U actually men and women because women need testosterone just like men need estrogen just need a different levels and so when I when I put men on a carnivore diet their testosterone improves invariably um there's one exception that proves that rule and that was a gentleman who's just very stressed out and um even though he dealt with stress very well he still had a lot of stress in his life so he wasn't he wasn't like a stress freak or anything like that but there was just you know he was just in a very stressful situation it's still early days so I would expect his testosterone is going to keep going up and um uh but everyone else literally everyone else has gone up and so you know and I would expect his his is going to keep going up too there are other things as well you know you're doing Marathon running you know longdistance cardio can actually suppress testosterone that is an unfortunate consequence of that type of event uh and Training Method sprinting weightlifting does the opposite that can actually boost your testosterone boost your growth hormone and lower your cortisol whereas you know marathons and long-distance cardio can lower testosterone lower growth hormone and increased cortisol so it's still really good for you but it just sort of has that that sort of opposite effect when while for for what those hormones are concerned um but uh there are there are a lot of people that do um our Elite endurance athletes both cycling and running that have come to this and are doing better and better there's a gentleman named Charles Washington who has been doing a carnivore diet for well over 15 years he runs the zeroing in on health uh Facebook group and that's a carnivore group that's a long-standing carnivore group he may be close to 20 years now and he runs he he runs marathons regularly on Carnivore and you know gets his best times doing that and does them fasted doesn't even drink water on the day and feels much better doing that so you can take a look at him H I don't think he has a YouTube channel that I know of but he has that Facebook group and he's pretty active there and you can just go into the zeroing in on health uh Facebook page and you can just do a search for his name or marathons and all that sort of stuff and things will come up a lot of things will come up and so uh yeah and just as an athlete in general your endurance will get a lot better your uh energy levels will get a lot better you won't have to do a bunch of refeeding you won't have to do you know take in a whole bunch of you know sugar syrups and gels and all that sort of stuff and drinking sugar water and Gatorade and all that garbage and um and that can also help your testosterone as well not not taking in all those carbs and jacking up your insulin which which is going to screw up the rest of your hormones and get them out of balance because insulin affects over 100 different processes in your body it doesn't just drive energy into cells and that's something that people forget uh or maybe never learned and so uh that that's something that you can't ignore so uh you will make you a better Runner it will give you better endurance it will give you better energy you won't crash out in the middle of the race you won't hit the wall you won't have to refeed and do all that sort of stuff you'll you'll regenerate your glycogen faster on a cornivore diet in in a state of ketosis uh than if you were drinking sugar water and gels and that's been shown in clinical trials in athletes um Dr Paul Mason has a video on that talking about ketogenic diets in athletes and he talked about these sorts of things and um Tim NOS Professor no from South Africa who know was a big Runner and a marathoner and and uh and one of the top sports medicine doctors in the world has been talking about this for 15 years about how he was wrong about needing carbohydrates as an elite athlete it's actually the opposite you get the exact same output and potential output on carbs or making your own carbs running on your fat but you have an unlimited capacity nearly for uh energy mobilization and energy production when you're running on your fat and you don't have to just keep sucking down sugar water and things like that so is a huge Advantage I've noticed this as well as a rugby player massive massive Advantage both to my endurance and my explosive power and and I could just go I could just go and go and go and go and go and I was just you know I would just Sprint and you know I'd be like running and just be like okay I'm just going to keep running how long is that like okay well maybe I'm just going to I'm running really hard and okay maybe I'll just Sprint the next Mile and I just Sprint a mile I could have kept sprinting more and I was just like okay now I'm just running really hard okay Sprint a half mile Sprint another Mile Sprint two miles it was just like I just couldn't wear myself out it was just I did I would just get bored it was just like okay I'm just G to stop because I guess I should just stop because eventually you're supposed to stop and I was like I'll go do something else now and that was the only reason I stopped wasn't because oh my God that's all I had in me I could never I could never get to that point uh once once I built up the stamina anyway so but that that was because of the diet you know I was that was you're never going to get to that level uh on any other diet so yes it will absolutely help and um it can help your testosterone certainly and uh can and also help you heal from those stress fractures hopefully but you know rehab that properly obviously and then when that's better you get going again and I think I think you'll find that you uh do much better on a car or die so good luck with that so A couple comments here that have been flagged um deand man uh says absolutely love Dr Cha's analysis and way of looking at things well that's very kind of you thank you very much and D was saying Dr chaffy is never late nor is he early he arrives precisely when he means to uh just like just like gandal I think that's the reference but uh yeah um I'm I'm actually very regularly late and I apologize for that so um and I do mean to get here on time just sometimes t hat time is later [Music] um cyprien thank you for the"

        "body": "I have a bit more time nav thank you very much for the I have a bit more time nav thank you very much for the Super Chat hi doc would carnivore help my aunt who has anmo also known as uh divix disease a rare autoimmune disease um also are you going to the UK yeah I'm I'm flying to the UK uh tonight actually um I'll be there for a bit uh less than a week um obviously travel time it's like 24 hours in each each Direction so um I don't know what devic's disease is I haven't come across that before but um if it's an autoimmune disease then I would I would be willing to bet that it would help significantly by going on a lion diet and um and uh you know with with just really sticking to red meat and water very high fat just red meat just water and cutting out absolutely everything else that's what that's what people with autoimmune issues do best on from what I can tell autoimmune diseases are your body reacting negatively to plant toxins and other sorts of industrial toxins that your body's making an antibodies towards and you're getting cross reaction with your body and so that's what I've seen happen with with every single um autoimmune disease that I that I've treated or spoken to people who have tried this that they when they go on a cornivore diet it significantly improves and when they go on to like a red meat and water diet only that's when they they get the best results and so that is um uh that is exactly what I would do and I would give that a try and that's you know that that sort of fits that that model if it is our body reacting to different toxins and making antibodies towards them and not actually be sensitized to our own body that's what you should see if you stop eating those toxins then it should um it should then your your antibod should go down because that's what your body's reacting to if you react to something and now your body sensitized to your own body well they're they're not going to just go up and down they're just going to go up until that part of your body is destroyed but that's not what happens they do go up and down oh we don't know really what's going on here I do your body's reacting to something else that your bringing in your body and it's and it's attacking that and you're getting hit in the crossfire right and so when and the and the proof of that is you take these things out of your diet antibodies go away and we can measure that you can't measure every antibody for every autoimmune issue but you can measure for for several and you can see them just go right down and so you know I would absolutely try that I don't think for a second that it's not worth trying um and I would I would be amazed if it didn't because every single autoimmune issue I've ever seen responds extremely well to a cornivore diet and does best on a red meat and water diet only the so-called lion diet so good luck to them and let us know how he goes Dr Ashley whan um a very nice uh comment here Dr chaffy thanks for the presentation any issues with carnivore for patients with renal failure no actually I see patients with uh you know ckd4 and five improve significantly and even get back to normal re renal function the the literature that I've found in speaking to nephrologists on the subject they they see that they say that the it's actually the opposite of what we sort of grown up thinking which is um uh we've been told that by some people some people still practice this that that higher protein diets are actually harmful to the kidneys in fact that's not what the literature shows the literature shows the opposite it shows that that higher protein diets actually improve kidney function and that's certainly what I've seen I've seen very well it's high fat diet because you proportion of calories and grams is typically higher of fat than protein but it is typically higher much higher protein diet than you would get on a standard diet any other sort of diet so it is a higher protein diet and I do see people doing much better on it and you're also going to improve kidney function because you're removing out different nephrotoxic elements such from Plants such as oxalates which can be D directly damaging to the kidneys as well so you're removing out a lot of things that can cause harm you're and you're improving the nutrition and increasing protein and increasing uh different available nutrients that are going to benefit the kidney I have seen a number of people uh narrowly avoid uh dialysis by by going on a carnivore diet and um uh either patients friends or just and countless people on the internet um a great place to to look is are those older Facebook groups that deal with with carnivore diet they specifically called zerocarb there were that's what carnivore was called before it was called carnivore it was zero carb so zeroing in on health and zero carb Health uh they do great and they do they they've been around for a very long time they're very strict and so they get much better results and so they uh they have a lot in their in their um history so you can go into the search function and you look up you know kidney disease kidney failure um dialysis I've seen three people now and I haven't been as active on the Facebook groups i' I've seen three people in those groups uh discussing about how they they come off dialysis that was the first time I saw that was probably six years ago was in one of those zero carb health or zeroing in on health and and this lady had been on Carnivore you know just red meat and water for nine months and her doctor were telling you're going to kill yourself and she's like I'm already on dialysis I already have zero kidney function you know I'm already on the transplant list what more do you want from me you know this is not this is not going to make my kidneys worse anyway and after N9 months she actually came off dialysis which is shocking it's normally that's a one-way Street it's just like you once you once you make that decision you go on dysis you're never coming back well for her at least she she was able to come off and and I've seen two other people that's not that many people so presumably most people that are on dialysis probably have permanent damage that's not going to recover but a couple people may be in that boat maybe just right on that bubble there's another gentleman I'm I'm in contact with now who who is on on dialysis but he still makes urine and by since going Carnival he has been making more and more urine so he's giving it a year and and if he's able to come off dialysis in a year then you know then that's great and if not then you know he'll go down the transplant route but um it's very promising and and I have absolutely seen people in the pre-dialysis stage improved dramatically uh so yes it's it's um it's very safe and in fact it it generally shows significant Improvement so hopefully uh you see that as well in your practice which I would expect that you would becaus e that's that's what happens Crazy K thank you for the"

        "body": "e that's that's what happens Crazy K thank you for the e that's that's what happens Crazy K thank you for the Super Chat hey doctor uh does ground beef have a lot of vitamin B12 in it uh it's all I usually eat yeah it's got a ton usually enough if you have an absorption issue or you have MTH hfrg mutation you may need a little more in your diet and uh and liver is a great option for that uh liver Nature's multivitamin so I don't think you need too much most people don't need any at all um they'll get you know Ample Ample nutrients from from their diet but it will bring you over the line if you're sort of on the lower end of optimal and then some people that have um nutritional malabsorption issues that is very important to make sure that you're having things that are more nutrient dense such as such as liver and organs and uh just check you know so you know you've been eating you've been eating ground beef for however long check your B12 it's um the reference ranges are completely wrong because they're just the average for the community community is sick and malnourished so that's not really a good uh good level to check at but people have done studies looking at 25-year-olds in good health no issues um you know not overweight all these sort of things very different reference ranges very very different reference ranges and and then other sorts of researchers have looked at things and saying hey this is this is really where we're optimal and so you know if you look at those sorts of things the you know the 25 year olds that are healthy and um and studies that have looked at you know what's a more optimal range for things very different from the reference ranges so in Australia and most of the rest of the world besides America you want to be between 800 and 1200 that's what we go for at my clinic anyway and in America the in those units so translate to 1100 to 1600 so typically you want to be on the higher end of the of the scale for them if not above um and above below 400 in Australian elsewhere and Below 540 in America that's actually a critical deficiency you can actually uh get demyelination of your axons and you your brain will shrink and your spinal cord can thin out as well and an Oxford studied that in 2008 they showed that um that people under that certain threshold um and it was you know basically under 400 um that they uh that their brain shrank by 5% after five years right so that's not good and yet the refence range goes down to like 130 in England up to 540 in England and so that that's clearly not what you look at just look at these reference ranges as if they were um as if they were the optimal range well that's optimal that's where you want to be you want to be in you want that number to be black you don't want it to be red or in bold so if it's too high oh that's too high oh no too low oh okay now we got to do something about it um but if it's that oh that's normal everything's fine so we're treating those reference ranges as if they were optimal reference ranges as if someone else set out and said this is where you want to be but that's not what they are and that's not what they're purported to be they are averages they're just averages for the community and that's all they are and we need to treat them as averages and then say okay well that's the average that's what everyone else is doing but everyone else is fat and sick so maybe I don't want to be average okay what's optimal then oh that's very different okay so that's uh that's that's something that you need to know about uh but yeah you typically get all the B12 you need just from from ground beef ground beef is the same as any other part of the cow as far as the muscle meat's concerned you'll get the same amount of B12 from a from a fancy steak as you will from Crown beef um you'll get a lot more in liver and so if you check and your B12 is not optimal add in a bit of liver doesn't need to be much but uh but it will it'll be good uh let's see uh adicha Donata if I'm 17 if you're 17 so are you 17 and I get a reasonably full fully Carnivor diet can I grow from 5 foot1 to 6 foot if anyone in the chat can answer that'd be great as well uh well you may you may not but your growth plates should still be open at 17 and if you go on a cornivore diet you will you will have a better chance of doing it than you would if you don't I typically see people in that age range as teenagers or younger Sprout up when they go on a carnivore diet and have absolutely remarkable uh growth uh and so uh yeah absolutely you you very well could do that you could very well grow taller than six feet um you know 's uh son is 14 and he he went carnivore like eight months ago and he's shot up I mean he's grown like six seven inches you know he's he's like looking look at me in the eye now he's not as tall as me but he's getting there and um and he was you know overweight and he had you know some carrying extra fat and um was shorter and they just just sprouted up and it was it was actually pretty pretty dramatic how quickly he grew and how much he grew and he's still growing you know so uh yeah it can make make a big difference and your growth plate should still be open to 17 some people do close prematurely but you know as long as you're not your growth plates aren't closed you can absolutely Still Still grow so yeah and so if you are still growing I would probably expect you to grow more than 6 feet um but uh you got to be strict you got to do it right and uh you'll get the best results and your testosterone levels will go up your growth hormone levels will go up which also make you grow and uh and will make you much healthier in general and a much better athlete as well so good luck with that so there's a comment from uh bm7 tri8 I've learned so much in the past couple days thank you so much Dr chaffy your older videos are packed with great information well thank you very much I appreciate that yeah I almost didn't continue on making videos um because I just I just I I said some of the things that that I wanted to say and I got things out there that I thought were important and I didn't want to sort of you know drown out the message and just sort of water everything down by just sort of putting too much out there um you know so I'm glad that people are finding the back catalog but they go into the uh you know playlist it's just the podcast playlist you know the plant freemd podcast playlist on YouTube and then just the podcast you know that has the sort of the more more important ones the interviews and especially like in the early earlier ones those the ones I sort of okay what about cholesterol and what about this and what about that and just sort of specific topics we're talking about and and then I also have a playlist called um getting started on a carnivore diet something like that and that I sort of have a curated list of of the videos I think are probably the most important ones to know about or or at least you should you know the at least very important ones anyway so yeah so I'm glad you found the the back catalog and I'm glad you like them uh there's someone else here that actually found that they didn't need their glasses either so fine dendu says that I no longer need glasses I noticed and I sit on a screen 10 hours a day that's that's fantastic uh so that's really really cool that um that you found that as well there does seem to be something there and it's uh I don't know what it is yet I bounced it off Dr Weedman and you know she she wasn't quite sure exactly uh what was going on well she had done a lot of other videos on on these sorts of things that can improve um but as far as you know people fixing stigma isms and and things like that you know like some people are going to improve and some people aren't and so we don't really know exactly you know who the patient population is is going to be that that is going to improve on this but you just try and find out you know that that works that's that's worked for quite a long time so keep going with it uh Frank calaby had a question here um said hi doc blood show high creatin level doctor says stop carnivore says that I'm CKD stage three B blood seven months ago all good and I'm confused drink more water you're dehydrated it's not the carnivore diet um if your creatinine is going up it's because you're not drinking enough water um your crine is not going to go up on a carnivore diet because of a carnivore diet it'll go up because of other things um so you drink more water there can be other things going on too there could be some other process happening if not from meat though uh meat May raise your Ura because you're metabolizing the that nitrogen group and then that turns into pneumonia and that gets turned into Ura and that gets passed out through your kidneys so you say oh Ura goes up oh that's bad but your Craton is staying the same and youra goes going up independently that's that's uh not related to kidney function and um you know and like I said earlier the data actually shows at higher protein diets actually improve kidney function and so Ura may go up but it's not going to raise creatinine and so um that's going up for another reason and it's almost always dehydration that's the first protocol crine goes up you drink more water very simply you don't make your kidneys work as hard so you don't have to concentrate urine as much to get out all the all the all the crap right so your kidneys are working a bit too hard right now drink more water and help them out that's it again um your your doctor obviously has your best interest at heart but he just isn't aware of this data and the literature on the fact that higher protein diets improve kidney function or on all the hundreds of thousands of people on a cornivore diet now who don't get kidney problems and in many people with ckd5 ckd4 reversing their kidney disease so uh drink more water and you'll be fine bet and then just check your kidney function again in a month drink a buttload of water whatever you're drinking drink more you know double it try anyway I don't know how much you're drinking but drink a hell of a lot more water and then see what you're doing also seven months is a long time you're going up and down you don't know what's going on in that time check it again in a month drink a buttload of water and then check it again in a month graning will go down don't worry about that hey everyone really happy to announce a new

        "body": "hed but maybe there's one down the chain uh there is a hed but maybe there's one down the chain uh there is a super chat from Robert Walcott which I appreciate and the question was down further um so thank you Robert Robert says I'm a type 1 diabetic so on Carnivore I will sometimes get low blood sugar what do you recommend to eat to recover from a hypo I'd probably stick with milk probably I'd probably I'd stick with animal products you know any p in a storm if you're out in the middle of nowhere and the only thing they have is a soda you know get a soda it's not ideal but you know it's not something that you're doing every day it's just something that you're doing to avoid uh hypoglycemia when you're not feeling well if and you're symptomatic you know if your blood sugar is a bit low but your ketones are high and you feel fine you know is that is that the end of the world if you um if you have ketones your brain is going to be running properly and they've done experiments on people which they probably shouldn't have done where they they raised up their ketones uh and then started dropping their blood sugar and they found that actually drop them down to a level that they would normally be in a coma perfectly fine no issues didn't feel bad fully compos MST answer questions easily all that sort of stuff so you know go by how you feel if you feel great and your ketones are up or or at normal levels and and you feel fine fine if you do take too much insulin that could could suppress your ketones and suppress your blood sugar and so you might you might not feel fine drink some milk you know grab some whole milk raw milk if you can you know treat yourself but um you know I I would probably stick with with animal products myself um but if you don't have access to milk then you know get something else you know other other sorts of of easily easily absorbed carbohydrates and then you know just dose the insulin appropriately if you are getting you know the right titration of your insulin you know it should be easier on a cornivore diet you're not having all the swings and blood sugar so it should be much easier and hopefully you don't have as many hypo or or any hypos um but but if you do I'd probably go milk and then just you know just hopefully don't you know have the issues with the you know the the too much insulin in the future so yeah good luck with that hopefully hopefully it doesn't come up but that's what I would do hi doctor 62y old carnivore mostly since January feeling better but noticing skin issues contact dermatitis uh arms back and chest um I also had an acdf surgery uh could it be related um I don't I don't think well I don't think it's going to be to do with acdf uh that's a sort of a spinal fusion so you go going through the front s for anial uh surv vcal disectomy infusion so you're going through the front here sort of make an incision there and you get because your spinal cord is actually or not your spinal cord but your spinal column is basically dead center in your neck so you can sort of get to it any sort of angle and you just go through this way you sort of Peel out the the disc from the front and get that compression off the spinal cord and then you stick in a um cage and then fuse it it's actually pretty elegant and you don't have to cut through and destroy all the the posterior uh elements to the to the to the spine which is good that's better for the Integrity of the spine and not having future problems but I don't think that would cause uh the skin issues I mean potentially you know people having anesthesia different exposures in the hospital they can sort of get weird reactions you know anything possible uh most things are possible not anything and um but carnivore shouldn't do that I you can get sensitivities to all sorts of things at any time but most people find that their their skin issues get a lot better um I would try to cut out the other you know you have mostly carnivore you probably cut cut out the mostly part you know get to only carnivore and uh also use proper moisturizers like Tallow moisturizers animal fat-based moisturizers emu oil moisturizers you know I I use um the stone and spear guys that's why you know I'm I'm partnered with them great stuff it's just you can get it without all the without all the scents and things you can get it with sense but I just get it without the sense you can also get soap and all that sort of stuff I find that that that's really helpful for skin especially the Tallow on your skin my God that's like the best thing you'll ever put on your skin and so maybe put that on there and uh you know change your around you know try to get get rid of these different exposures because your body's reacting to something and so try to get rid of those something I don't I would doubt that it's something to do with with your surgery though or the carnivore it's something that your body's sort of reacting to now probably on your skin different moisturizers different soaps different shampoos different something try changing them around try going you know try putting on on Tallow you just use cooking Tallow you know and that that's really good for your skin you know and um and so you can use that as well and and see if that helps and then try to eliminate out all these different exposures that could be kicking this off and triggering it good luck w ith that Benjamin uh Haver thank you very much for the"

        "body": "the affirmative carnivore thank you very much for the the affirmative carnivore thank you very much for the Super Chat I shared three weeks ago that my sister was diagnosed with um uh early onset Alzheimer's at 46 good Lord I'm so sorry if I give her Ketone Esther and she shows Improvement could that mean she is inst resistant she is almost certainly insulin resistance resistant either way um uh but yeah you know if you give her a ketone Esther and she perks up you know that that could show that her brain works better on ketones it is going to work better on ketones you know and so regardless of insulin resistance you know that that should help and you know a lot of people in their 20s find that that their brain fog goes away when they go on a carnivore die large part of that is going to be that their brain's now running on ketones and so you can try that you can try Ketone Esters they taste awful they taste absolutely awful and so she may not want that uh but you can certainly try they almost always have Stevia or artificial sweeteners which I don't like I don't think that they're they're good for you and also you know just whether they're they're benign or not they didn't exist 50,000 years ago during the last ice age so I don't think I want I want that putting going in my body so um so I try to avoid those sorts of things but even with the stevia is disgusting uh thank you Melissa and um and uh you know so to just you know I just don't just don't like them um but yeah you can try that just try giving some Ketone Esters and um and see how she does I she will get better if she goes on a carnivore diet she will get better um will she get all the way better I don't know but will she significantly improve I have no doubt of that in my mind maybe that she doesn't maybe there's something else going on maybe something further but it would be the exception and not the rule so I would I would and she will improve all the other ways that everyone else is improving anyway she'll just feel a lot better her brain is running on Keeton your brain is going to work better and she's going to get rid of all these things that can actually significantly uh harm her and cause uh different sort of physiological uh damage and distress so it's definitely worth a shot it's definitely worth trying and then see how she goes good luck with that hey everyone if you need a little extra help getting started on a carnivore diet and my online resources that I have for free aren't enough for you you can go to www.how carnivore docomo challenge where you'll have online Resources Group support weekly Zoom meetings as well as the ability to chat live with myself Simon Lewis and the others in the challenge who can help you and support you and give you extra advice and help you along the way so if that sounds like something that would be beneficial to you then please go to howc carnivore be in the UK we can go Liberate the cat you know come and take it all right see see what happens and um but yeah so uh he is here though he's very cute and you should uh you should come meet the cat at some point um yeah I I I looked it up too neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder um immune system damages the spinal cord and optic nerves yeah so that's that's um that I would I would bet money large quantities of money that that would improve significantly on a cornivore diet we see it with Ms you know we see that so that's the devic disease we were talking about we see that with Ms we see you know damage extensive damage to you know the spinal cord and and the brain and and the white matter and um we see extensive damage heal and repair and these lesions reduce and optimize and so you know what's what's happening there if um if if it's not a if it has nothing to do with diet right so the carvvo diet the lion diet especially you know significantly improves autoimmune diseases in general from what I've seen so uh I I haven't seen someone with devic's disease try that but I would I would be very willing to bet large amounts of money that it would improve and so it's um it would I would be very surprised if it didn't so just really strict just red meat just water that's it and uh see how you go it looks like low carblow drama Vision improved as well optometrist were surprised um and have a blast in the UK yeah thank you very much I will try and uh Vicki had a lot of good improvements started 6 weeks ago and uh was 227 is now down to 197 already that's really great really good job and um it said thank you for everything and down 30 pounds in six weeks that's amazing good job and you're very welcome I'm really glad that that's helped um oh this is kind of cool it's saying that a lot of medical doctors are getting to know me in South Korea that's pretty that's pretty that's kind of fun to learn um well that's great and I'm just I'm very happy every time you know any doctor you know has an open open enough mind to sort of think about things like differently the most doctors I know really want to help their patients and really want to know the things that will help their patients they study a long time and work very hard to learn all these things that can help people and uh and so it it makes perfect sense for them to go like oh okay yeah let's look at that and see see what can help people and there's something new that comes up you know saying like okay let's look into that some people think that if it wasn't taught to me in medical school or in residency it wasn't worth learning and that's unfortunate but uh most people aren't on that and that's good Daniel graph says hi Dr cha I was on the call on the Adonis school I was tired and very nervous to meet you plus my broken mic and uh the negativity in chat um still you made me feel comfortable thanks oh no problem and so don school is um um something I've sort of helped out with every couple weeks will go on and and do sort of a carnivore Q&A session with some of the people with uh people know Hamza he's a sort of an influencer on on social media and he has a a group that called ad Donna school and and sort of helps people um you know optimize and you know improve their lives in different ways and uh and he started doing the carnivore diet and he asked me to sort of talk to people about a carnivore diet as well and um so so I did and uh it's been fun and a lot of people sort of uh it's sort of a new group of people to to be introduced to a carnivore diet but a lot of people are trying it there and and having exactly the results you that everyone else is getting and um which is great to see so it's uh yeah it's good to see and uh yeah it's been fun it's it's a good group good group of people and uh you know a lot of good questions and good good positivity uh the chat you know I think I think people just you know mess around in the chat so don't don't don't let that bother you you know just just uh just let it roll off uh one thing I learned from playing rugby and playing you know team sports is that everyone's going to try to get a rise out of you and the last thing you want to do is is actually let them get it um because as soon as you start being like Oh hey you shouldn't say that it's like blood in the water and they just they just go after you and then everyone's on your ass and you're just like whoop just made that way worse on myself best thing you can do is just not care and just let it just roll off your back and just be like oh yeah yeah whatever and just s laugh and just be oh yeah yeah that's it that's me did that and then be like and it pisses them off and then you win because they're trying to upset you and you're not showing that you're upset and then eventually you actually stop being upset by it and it bugs them and like so actually you win that one so um don't worry about the chat uh um so this was from bm7 tri8 Soh so far into this live you're answering uh most all intense questions on my mind
