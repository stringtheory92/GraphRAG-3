        "body": "[Music] mom had breast cancer cut out at an early stage avoided chemo the cancer was caused by high estrogen she eats lowfat High plant-based diet and also suffering from weak bones she has also had gallbladder removed uh help please yeah so you know I mean it is the case that you know plants use estrogenic disruptors they have um hormonal disruptors and a lot of those mimic estrogen and so soy milk or soy in general has a lot of estrogen so 3 ounces of soy has about half the amount of estrogen that a fertile woman would make in a day and about you know uh eight eight or nine times as much um uh estrogen as the birth control pill so it's a lot of estrogen uh in fact this is in the published literature that men have actually grown breasts by drinking as little as a classes of soy milk a day or as much as a classes of soy milk a day because that's horrifying but that's how much estrogen is in there flax seed as well tons of estrogen and a lot of other things as well have high estrogen meat does not have high estrogen meat has unpro un hormone treated non- hormon treated beef for 3 ounces of lean beef has about 1.3 nanograms of estrogen in it hormon treated beef beef has 1.9 nanograms okay so it's a 50% increase but Soy has 200,000 nanograms per 3 oz right and a birth control pill is 35,000 and a woman makes nearly 500,000 so you know big difference there you know meat does not contribute to to um UNT estrogen levels it just it just optimizes hormones in in everybody um if eaten on its own so lowfat not a great idea either you need the fat it's very good for your body it's very good for your brain your brain's made out of it um and she has weak bones because she's doing that unfortunately the body is is made out of meat and we need certain specific nutrients really from meat that are going to help us build and maintain meat and we we can't do that from Plants we don't make we don't you can't it's very difficult to turn plant tissue into animal tissue it's completely different form of life and um you know some animals can do it but we are not those animals and so the reason she has weak bones is because she's eating these plants they have a lot of antinutrients things like oxalates which strip out the calcium from her blood and so in order to not die her body strips calcium from her bones to raise her calcium levels in her blood again because under a certain level of calcium your heart stops goes into tetany just locks up it just cramps it's like a giant muscle cramp but it's your heart right so that's game over right there and so that is is a direct consequence of eating these plants and getting these antinutrients in the plants and so if she removes those plants she starts eating fatty meat which is what we're biologically designed to eat she will reduce her estrogen load from those phyton phytoestrogens and she will improve her bone density I have seen people with osteop ois elderly ladies with osteoporosis reverse that in a year of a carnivore diet with resistance uh exercises the resistance is important because you're pushing through the your body heals in line heals and grows in lines of stress so you you work on a muscle in a certain direction you're working that muscle that muscle grows it's working the bones in there too you're you're stimulating the bones to grow and to support that direction of movement and force and weightbearing right so you need the you need the stimulus but you also need the the right nutrition and you need to stay out of your own way you know look up pottinger cats it's very interesting they fed cats cooked meat and raw meat and massively different Health outcomes the cooked meat cats were far less healthy and each generation they got smaller and smaller brains less developed skeleton smaller stature and um and and poorer health and less bone mineralization so exactly the same amount of calcium in cooked meat as raw meat but just something about the nutrition changed and their body wasn't able to mineralize the bones properly went from like 14% first gener you know starting out to then 7% big drop and then the next generation was 3% and and the researchers said their bones were like the consistency of foam rubber when they looked at them on autopsy that's pretty crazy and some of these poor little kittens had like upwards of 30 fractures at any given time it was horrible and that's what you're doing right if you you disrupt how your body normally works your body can't work properly and so even if there's enough calcium available your body's just not able to regulate it properly like the like in poers cats so that's what you need to do no gallbladder why why does she have no gallbladder because she's been eating a lowfat diet your gallbladder stores bile but it concentrates there because you don't necessarily get you know predators don't necessarily eat every day and so you have to you have to sort of store this upu and concentrate it so that you have a lot available so that when you do get food you can absorb a lot of fat you can absorb as much fat as your body needs in that one go and if you just don't eat fat or eat very little fat it sits there and it gets more and more concentrated and what happens any hyperconcentrated solution at rest forms crystals forms precipitate right that's what bile sludge is that's what gallstones are and so that's why she had that you know if you eat enough fat as in as much fat as your body has B for it's physically impossible to form a gallstone even if you were going to form a stone in one day which you don't that wouldn't be compatible with Life you'd be dead in the womb that that you know even then if you just ate enough fat that you had all the fat that you had bile for every day it still wouldn't form Stones you couldn't do it there is no no bile in the gallbladder to form a stone so unfortunately the reason that she doesn't have a gallbladder anymore is because she's she was following the diet that she is currently following right now and so that hasn't done her any good and I'm sorry to say it probably led to her cancer as well if you have healthy mitochondria you can't get cancer a lot of these plants have have toxins that directly damage the mitochondria and there's a lot of other things as well um there's there's um genetic issues that can cause damage to the mitochondria also other environmental things but also just not being in a ketogenic metabolic State you you your insulin is high all the time and you can't go about autophagy and replacing your mitochondria as they getting sort of broken down and broken down and broken down you eventually you need to replace them you say okay well that one's that one's junked we need to scrap it and make a new one right that's called autop that's part of autophagy it's called mitophagy and you don't need to fast to do that you just need to stop eating carbs because it's in High insulin blocks autophagy and so if you just get your insulin down you're an autophagy and mitophagy all the time and so in three four months on a car on a carnivore diet a ketogenic meat-based diet like a carnivore diet Studies have shown that you'll have four times the number of mitochondria and they're four times as effective so you'll keep your mitochondria healthy you'll keep your body healthy you keep your brain healthy and and you generally won't get cancer because you're not you're not doing the things that insult your body to the extent that they're going to get cancer having a gallbladder removed now is still not a problem going carnivore even high fat carnivore because her liver is still making bile it's just that it's making it in a just dripping out constantly so she may have to split up her fatty meals if she get eats a you know more fat and she gets basically loose stools from that that's because her body just wasn't able to absorb that fat and it just comes out fine okay so don't eat as much fat split that up throughout the day but a lot of people form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is an out pouching of the common bow duck it works exactly like a a gallbladder does and so she may have that so if she eats a big meal with fat in it and she doesn't get loose stools doesn't like you know running to the toilet you know 30 minutes later then then that's probably what happened and she'll she'll be fine so just just listen to her body but hopefully she hears this and listens to this and gives it a try because I think it will absolutely revolutionize her health it's all about what we um are designed for humans have been cooking meat for at least 800,000 years over an open fire and potentially using ovens um 800,000 years ago and cooking with fire potentially as much as 1.5 million or even two plus million years right so that's a long time that's that's 500,000 years minimum"
