    "transcript": "[Music] all right hello everyone uh thank you for joining my live for today May 10th or May 9th in America thank you very much everyone for coming by it's good to see you all I did end up doing a makeup uh video answering the rest of the questions so about nine super chats that I didn't get to last Wednesday and so I went through them later on and answered those and made a video and I'll be putting that together and that will be released so for those who um didn't get their uh super chats answered last time they have been answered and they will come out in the next several days or something like that whenever whenever I get it edited and put together so just keep an eye out for that and um hopefully hopefully you guys see see the answer see the the answers um okay so I'm going to start with uh question here this was a super chat that didn't isn't coming up here on streamyard but it's from uh Beth brocker good to see you Beth um and thank you for the Super Chat Beth asks what beef cuts are fatty enough on their own besides riy I'm getting tired of adding fat trimmings on the side well things like brisket uh the four quarter sort of chopped like the chuck steaks things in the front towards the animal that uh generally ends up being a fatter that fer part of the animal you can also get things that have like a thick fatty C like you get like a rump steti that has a fat uh a thick fat cap just depends on how the butcher cuts it so talk to your butcher just ask them to leave big Ridges of fat on things um and then that usually helps a lot and then so instead of you know trimming things off and putting in a bag of trimmings for you to have it just fats just still the meat and you don't have to it doesn't have to trim it off and then get the trimmings and then cook the trimmings it just comes with the steak uh but Chuck is really good for that and brisket is amazing for that so I know people um that even just eat brisket like steak they just cut brisket up into steak it's cheap as hell and it's very fatty and tastes good it's um you know some some it's just cat freaking out um sometimes the you people think it it's a bit more tough but if you're you know cutting it against grain and cooking it up um I haven't tried it myself but from what I've I've been told by people who have actually that's actually fine you know I mean it's not like you know like a Tender Loin or something like that but not not many cuts are so things with a bigger fat cap tell the butcher not to cut it off um brisket Chuck those sorts of things and and ground beef you know you can get your butcher to make a very fatty ground beef beef it's pretty good lamb chops are really uh very fatty too the four4 chops again that would be like the the version of the sort of the chuck steaks in um cow I think would be similar equivalent to the or like the shoulder chops things like that in in Lambs would uh be very fatty too and they taste good too and they're cheaper so those would be those would be some good good Cuts you can try try and other questions here um how to determ oh yeah and how to determine if it has enough fat if there's no nutrition label yeah probably isn't going to be on on a whole meat you because it's it's going to vary between cuts so um you just eyeball it and and you see how it affects you and you see by taste as well maybe you add some butter to that and um and also by you know your your your bowel motion so if you're you're getting dry hard stools and you need to up the fat so whatever whatever Cuts you're doing aren't aren't uh cut in the mustard and you need to add something more to that and so either getting more fat in the in the in the cut or or adding butter bit of fat trimmings things like that so Al leici a question is it is it okay not to eat fish how would you get Omega-3s well there are Omega 3's like DHA and EPA now it depends on the type of Omega-3 you know because you know people will tell you there like well there's there's Omega-3s in plants and it's like yes but that's like saying there's water in vodka you know it's like yeah it's not uh it's not really what you want or liquid in vodka vodka is a liquid therefore and water's a liquid therefore you know drink Vodka because all you need is liquid you don't need Omega-3s you need DHA and EPA which are Omega-3s but it's it's different you don't just any any omega-3 won't do you need these specific ones so there's ala and plants and that's not good enough it doesn't doesn't do anything uh for your brain maybe like a 5% conversion at most but some studies actually show that there's that you actually lower your DHA when you eat more ala so definitely not the the way to go so uh animal fat in general will have them will have DHA and EPA generally if they're eating what they are supposed to eat like a cow eating grass they're going to have more DHA you know a lot more DHA uh to uh the omega-6 ratio especially there was um something I saw from Dr Paul Mason in one of his lectures where he discussed uh study that looked at grain finishing beef and after three months in a feed lot so 90 days uh they seem to have uh very little Omega-3s if any after that so keep that in mind a lot of a lot of meat is grain finish now and um you know so depending on how long that that's that's uh done for it could be that have less Omega-3s but the grass-fed and finish will definitely have DHA and EPA um you can have little tins of sardines things like that um and other sorts of things but grass-fed tow if you add that grass-fed beef trimmings those things will all have DHA and EPA but yeah it's fine not to eat fish I hardly ever eat fish uh there are some people that I just saw um someone friend of mine interviewed someone about basically how we should really be eating fish and how important that was to like grow our brain um because of the the DHA and EPA in there farmed fish won't have any because fish get um fish up the food chain get their DHA and EPA from the other fish that they eat and so you take them out of the food chain and you start feeding them grain and rice pellets and soy and garbage like that there's no DHA and EPA in there so they're not going to get it they don't make it they get it from their their food supply too we don't make it either and so you need to get it up the food chain properly and when you dissociate your food from the food chain it's not as nutritious as it's supposed to be for us either so so uh keep an eye you know think about that don't buy farmed fish it's um it's a pretty nasty uh process anyway it's not really good for the fish it's not really healthy for them it's not really nice environment and um the meat is not good for you so it's certainly not nearly as nutritious I mean it's it's better than nothing uh it's better than plants but it's not it's not good and um so I would I would you avoid that uh and just get wild caught or just beef really if you can get grass-fed do but you know I don't think it's I don't think it's required for absolutely everyone especially because you know we're talking about coming from other ways of eating and you know any any port in a storm you know any meat is going to be better than every plant and so just get the meat that you can afford that you have access to and that you enjoy makes you feel the best and you know if you can add grass-fed butter that's going to that's going to get you some DHA and EPA grass-fed Tallow same thing so you know those sorts of those sorts of measures will really help as well okay Jonathan Davis had a question carnivore one month down 20 pounds and loving it awesome I have five kids and wife doesn't want birth control due to hormone issues what are your thoughts on vasectomy messing up my hormones or any other ideas it shouldn't mess up your hormones unless they you know roughly manipulate your testicles or something like that and and maybe there's something to do with that I I I don't do those surgeries so I don't know if there's any sort of literature on that um being the case but if you were it would it wouldn't uh it would likely be just something temporary you know unless they really messed up and and damaged your testicles but it's it's just it's just cutting the you know the vast difference so there just a tube coming up from the the testicles and you just cut cut take out a big chunk so it doesn't just you know Rec you know reconnect uh very easily and then tie off the ends uh it's pretty pretty straightforward so um it shouldn't it shouldn't mess up your hormones though it just uh you know makes you sterile so that's uh that's up to you um if you guys want to do that and um you know it's understandable with you know the hormonal birth control there are other things non- hormonal iuds things like that copper coil that can have its own problems that can increase um you know menstration cause more U bleeding things like that and then there's the the weekly hormonal iuds like the Marina and the what's the other one the kylina say even less U progesterone in it and that's supposed to work locally but you know vasectomy is pretty you know it's pretty uh effective and it shouldn't mess up your hormones anyway so if that's the way you want to go I don't think that will will screw you up in that way um tell them to give you drugs to knock you out though I've seen that U some people say it's like it's not that big of a deal but um you know the ones I saw when I was in medical school did not did not uh not make give me any interest in getting that myself anyway um Sharon Francis uh has a question over from uh Facebook hi doc I'm full carnivore is it okay to eat a few berries per week blueberries r berries um I mean you can you know if that's what you want to do I don't just on principle that they have things in them that you don't want oxalates tannins these sorts of things sugar I don't want sugar not as much sugar and raspberries there are some in blueberries obviously or else they wouldn't be sweet and um and uh but there are these other things as well so you know if you if you want to do that you know and and you know just try it out I mean I would I would stay away from it for at least a month and then you add in just blueberries see how you feel and but really pay attention to how it makes you feel and feel and and to your health you itchy on your face or sinus issues or aches and pains or anything like that you just just keep an eye on it because sometimes people are affected in in subtle ways and sometimes unsettle ways so just be mindful of that and so you add these things back in and if you say oh okay well you know I like them and it and it and I don't feel worse and uh I feel fine then you know fine if you continue to do that and you have more and more that that's going to build up and I think that that's going to be you know a net negative uh but you know if you want to and you that fills you with joy then go for it they will have things in it that that aren't good for you um which is why I just avoid it because you know I I I separate out you know my entertainment my you know my my my pleasure reward sort of uh you know uh activities from from eating like I love steak I've never I've never not enjoyed a steak but you know that's not why I eat it I don't eat steak because it's enjoyable I I eat steak because it's U food and I want the nutrition I want the food um you know so blueberries raspberries you're going to have some of these little things you're going to have uh you know the different antinutrients they're going to block out different absorption different things that you you may not want to do and have bits of little toxins the more you have the more toxins you'll get and um just but see how it makes you feel you know and if you if you like them and you enjoy them and you don't you don't see that it makes uh too much of a difference and you know that's perfectly up to you um just remember that in the while we a we wouldn't have have been having berries and fruits that were this sweet raspberries aren't that sweet but you know blueberries and things like that and other berries cherries those are things are very sweet and and we would only have them seasonally and locally and we'd be picking them ripe if you pick them green which almost every commercial uh fruit is picked green then it's going to have a higher concentration of toxins and you pick it or separate from the plant it's stuck there in the pl in the fruit it can't go anywhere it doesn't just break down into deg grade the plant has to pull out those toxins and when the seeds aren't ready it has more toxins in there to stop things from messing with it so just remember that you know so if you were going to have blueberries raspberries I'd still try to do it in a more ancestrally appropriate sort of way like if you had you know blueberries at your house in your garden I sort of eat the ripe ones and then you know for the few weeks that they're around and uh and that's it and uh and otherwise just you know just eat the animals that come in your yard maybe but um uh uh that's you know that's my opinion on it but you know you're free to do whatever you want you know I I think I feel much better when I don't touch anything else I mean even like Pepper or like you know some garlic seasoning or something like that at a restaurant it's like I just feel far better when I avoid all of that stuff and um so I do on principle and uh and and I don't I don't worry about it I don't think about it because it's not something I want and the thing is when you start dipping in on things saying well maybe I'll have a bit of this well that's okay maybe I'll have a bit more maybe maybe this other thing I'll have two or maybe this other thing I'll have two maybe this other thing I'll have two it's a slippery slope and then because you're introducing these things slowly but surely it's sort of a buildup and you don't necessarily see how how negatively it's affecting you and until all of a sudden you're just sort of in the middle of it and you're back eating all all sorts of stuff and then you're not feeling great you like oh how did I get here um so just be careful because that happens too and sister spellbinder said thank you so much for all you do uh it helps so much you're such a blessing well thank you very much that's very sweet of you to say I appreciate that okay um all right uh there a Super Chat from sjck thank you very much for that hey Doc is it necessary to chew me 30 plus times before swallowing or is it just a myth I can't imagine our ancestors doing it PS thanks for everything I don't think you necessarily have to do it 30 times exactly I couldn't imagine you know any animal counting in its head how many times it chews it you mean just chew chew an appropriate amount of time I think we just say that just because some people you sort of scarf things down a bit more quickly and it's just more of a choking hazard um you primarily but also you know the more you chew it more you break it down it it it it should be able to get broken down by the different acids and enzymes in your digestive tract so no I think I think you just you chew a sufficient amount of time to get it properly broken down and uh and then swallow but whatever whatever is comfortable for you and so that you don't choke and uh it's comfortable I think is fine I I certainly haven't heard anything about that in medical school anyway so it's I think it's just a just a get it in people's heads to chew enough Damen Williams thank you for the Super Chat good evening uh you told your story about uh dosing your brother with vitamin C with such Joy it was so funny do you have any other pranks or chapy stories uh to share thank you yeah that was funny um people don't remember that my brother my brother um we were going skiing or snowboarding up in Washington state and he uh we were like getting ready to go and we we always he's my older brother and we there's always there's always some brotherly tension and conflict and and uh you just sort of mess with each other he's like trying to you knower dominance and and I'm trying to tell him that's not it's not not the right place for it like go somewhere else and um so he said yeah why why don't you and he always had this look on his face when he was when he was going to mess with me and so I like I mean I saw it since I was a kid so I just like you could see it on him and he's just like like yeah why don't you go upstairs and get me some water and he like yeah give me some water yeah I put some vitamin C in it and I was just like all right and so I was like yep all right that's fine look could you vitamin C and instantly I knew what I was going to do and it was already some boiling water there and um and so I just just put boiling water in and like just and just like half half a mug of vitamin C and just fill it up with boiling water and uh and sort of make a super saturated solution so if people take chemistry if you if you heat up a solution you can dissolve a lot more in there than would normally go in and then if you're very careful about it you can you can cool it down um back down to room temperature and you know possibly even you even below without it you forming precipitate and crystallizing it's actually kind of a cool reaction but if you if you drop um if you drop like a bit of crystals in it'll actually they all like form out and it's sort of interesting sort of science experiment um and but you can make the super saturated solution so there you go stay in school kids you can you can learn how to you know prank people and um and so I did that and I like God knows how bad this was and like it went down and you just looking at like all right there you go and he just looked at me and he just like he he sort of knew it was coming that I was gonna put more in it and he starts drinking and like to his credit he just like just took it just like just pretending like wasn't there and I'm like all right I like we both knew what was going on we didn't say anything it just like hands back like yeah thanks I was like all right fair enough and we're just driving up not not talking about it and like half or half hour 40 minutes in and he's just like how much vitamin C do you put in there I was like dude like half the bottle I can't believe you drank that he's just like yeah it wasn't good like now my stomach's really really killing me and uh FES to say he had just a epic diarrhea for like two hours after that like just just stuck bathroom and um so I can't I'm uh I can't think of oh I can't think of anything now I'm thinking was that one but U no we yeah we would just mess with each other and um I'll try to think of of one if it comes up but um uh damn it what are some of the other things we did to each other now I'm just thinking of the times we we fought and and try to beat each other up um ah I can't think of anything at the moment but um but if if it comes up with something I'll I'll I'll definitely uh share it with the class as well but uh yeah just things like that come up you know you just sort of mess with people and we did that a lot in in the rugby team as well and although a lot of that was just messing with people and um and just seeing if they get a rise if you get a rise out of them and if you did it was like blood in the water everyone eyes are yeah it's good just don't do that just never show anybody on on like in that sort of scenario with like rugby players and things like that that something that they said has has pissed you off because like that's the only thing you're going to hear for the rest of the month um but yeah I if I think of something I I'll tell you guys uh metabolic paramedic thank you very much for the super chat um I know long Co has been termed postviral post viral fatigue or something like that have you any experience experiences in success training anyone with long covid or have any advice about using carnivore uh to treat it you know only from what I've heard from other people um I have I have seen a number of people that have reported back that they have had long covid and went on Carnivore and and that seemed to help eventually I mean these are things that that don't just clear up overnight but you know over the course of weeks and months they said that it it helped after that um could that be just a normal progression and it just they coincidentally started carnivore sure um but you know nothing had helped until then and they were you know feeling pretty rotten and tired at that point um and so you know a lot of people have reported that it's certainly worth a try it's going to help you in a lot of other ways you know and sometimes you know when you have a condition like that and you you change your diet dramatically by going on a carnivore diet and you and your body and your brain just works so much better even when you have long covid just superimpose on that you still feel a lot better and your body works so much better and so so it's it's already going to be an improvement even if that thing the post viral fatigue syndrome or long Co has has stayed the same your body is going to work better with that Affliction and so you're going to feel better you're definitely going to feel better overall and hopefully it's uh ends up getting getting uh better and and and whatever the hell is going on that's causing you to feel that way goes away and certainly people have reported that so it's certainly worth it to try it and um and if um you know and hopefully it does help that but it it will help you in so many other ways anyway that you'll feel better either way you know I have no doubt about that like you'll definitely feel better either way so definitely worth giving it a go good luck with that hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just your meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys Remy Hogan doctor Lions as other carnivore animals usually eat their whole prey raw they eat the bones as well which contain calcium so uh is eating only the flesh enough assuming one eats only meat so I don't think um lions eat much of the bones I don't think their jaws are strong enough I do know that the hyenas can can uh Jaws are strong enough to crack the bones and so there's one phenomenon that you see um you know where the Lions will go after the fattier parts of the kill and they'll but they'll tend to lead the the hind legs the you know the the hind quarters because they're they're very lean they're usually much leaner part of the animal and um so you know cats do well with with leaner meat they don't they don't need as much fat as we do but they do need some fat and um so they go for the more fattier parts of these animals which you know can can run pretty lean too but tend to leave the hind quarters uh the Native Americans tended to leave the hind quarters too interestingly enough I learned that when I was a kid and it sort of makes sense that they sort of stripped the high cour that was said at the time well they would leave this part as as an offering to the spirits and this that and the other maybe they did but um it just happened to be that the part that they left was the part that didn't have nearly as much fat and uh it was sort of dead weight you know you don't want to you know you're out in the middle of the woods hunting you've got to you know pack back you know 300 lb of meat you know you don't want to you want to bring the stuff that's just not as as useful and so you just bring back the more Choice parts of the animal and um so the Lions tend to leave those as well and then hyenas come in they'll eat that part and then they'll crack open the bones and they'll get it to marrow which is where the fat is so um uh yeah no meat is actually fine organs add to all of that um you know you can you can make bone broth and all that sort of stuff but you don't have to I mean there there are plenty of animals that are carnivores that that don't eat the bones certainly um some too I mean we're looking at like an owl like I mean it's it's it you know eats mice and then it just pukes out these owl pellets that are just all the all the fur and bones and things like that so I don't know how much of that uh of the the calcium they're getting out of that either but no you get you get plenty of this stuff you know and um I I don't think that lions eat a lot of the bones I don't think they they crunch them up bones and all um and they get plenty of calcium from from just the meat you know the majority of of bone growth happens after lions are weaned off of their mother's milk and onto just meat you know and a baby lion certainly is not crunching bones right and um and also where's the mother line getting the calcium to make the milk and um you know I yeah so I don't think they actually do crunch up the bones hyenas do um and they eat it raw do we need to eat it raw no not necessarily we've been cooking meat for at least 800,000 years if not 1.5 million years or two million years plus um so whatever happens to meat when we cook it we're well used to it cats can't do that they have to have torine and other um nutrients that are cooked out that are denatured when you cook meat and um so they don't do well on that they have to they have to have raw meat but we don't so yeah know just eating eating the flesh is is great um some people because of absorption issues or from you know having you know MTHFR uh or something like that may need a bit more organs or maybe the meat that you're eating is is grain finished and it's not as healthy as it could be and so you know it's not wild Mammoth anymore and so you know you might need a bit more of the nutrient density from something else to make up for that fact if you're eating Wild game and you're eating regeneratively raised grass fan and finished beef and lamb the muscle means probably everything you need when I was just eating Costco beef and I checked my my nutrient levels after SE after a few years on Carnivore I was I was actually in optimal levels for all of these things um and when I when I check people and check their blood work I mean it always improves it just gets better and better and better but you know especially when you're first starting out you you are you are going to be nutritionally deficient you just are and so getting some more nutrient dense things like adding in a bit of liver kidney and heart little organs or whatever or taking dedicated supplement like very low on magnesium or something like that or extremely most people are exquisitly low on B12 to the point that the reference range is now the average for the the depleted population so if you're in that reference range for B12 you are low on B12 that's just a fact there was a study out of Oxford in 2008 they showed that for like P moles Pro leer such of UK Australia and other other countries apart from America that's their their numbers that below like 320 um which is fully within the normal range by the way there's a lot of things that say it's like if it's above 130 it's normal right um okay so below 320 or so they track people for over five years and they found that uh they their brains shrank by over 5% on MRI and they did they did annual MRIs so no that's not that's not an acceptable level of of B12 that's a that's a true deficiency you actually get demolation of your axons you get nerve damage you get brain damage you get brain shrinkage um and and that's half or more of the normal reference range so I do see people's numbers go up unless they have some that pernicious anemia some other reason why they're not absorbing things but which actually more common than people think U at least you know partial you know may not be fullon they just don't absorb anything but absorb very small amount but either way if you're in that level you should probably just get a shot I mean you should not keep yourself in that level you shouldn't just wait months for that to come up um and you should add in things like liver that have a lot of B12 in it early on and then you maintain that with your diet and you just make sure you say okay if am I eating just muscle meat is the muscle meat that I'm eating sufficiently D nutrient dense so that I'm getting everything that I need if it's not you're add in some organs that's it that's nature supplement early on you should probably should include organs um you don't need much just just a small amount and um but you know do do that and um and or use supplements because you will be deficient you will catch up on just eating muscle meat like you will but it can take while and so if you want to speed that process up and and feel better faster you know add in some organs add in add in a bit of supplements but you don't have to you know I mean what the the meat is far more nutrient dense than anything else you've been eating and it's not coming with all the anti-nutrients uh from from plants and coffee and things like that that will block out the absorption of all these nutrients so you're actually getting everything out of it uh that you need that makes a big difference you know there's a study with um oysters and they're just looking at zinc so this is so some of things that they ate it with blocked out the absorption of zinc but it's going to block out the absorption of a lot of other things too but specifically they were looking at zinc so oysters have a lot of zinc and so they gave people oysters and they checked their blood levels right afterwards and you know went up significantly right and then they gave uh people oysters with like beans or whatever and it only went up a quarter of the amount so it's 75% reduction in absorption so that's massive so just something that you eat this with all bang you're you're missing out on 75% of the nutrition and it's not just going to be zinc it's going to be a lot of other things as well that you're not absorbing properly uh even medications I had a I had a patient that was um taking her thyroid medications um after she had coffee and she was hypothyroid on medication she just wasn't absorbing and so I said okay you need to stop taking the coffee you just take your thyroid medication before you do anything else at least half an hour before you take anything else drink anything else just let your body absorb it and instantly bang up into normal levels you know so it was it's a it makes a big difference what you take these things with what if you drink coffee and you take you know uh different vitamins and minerals you're not going to absorb that um and it's certainly not going to absorb much of it and um so in that study with the with oysters you know they with beans only 25% of the rise right so 75% was blocked out but then they give them like tortillas I believe corn tortillas or something like that and it was Zero rise in their in their zinc so they absorbed nothing of the zinc right so it was it was um you know very telling you know what you eat the stuff with makes a difference and when you stop eating that stuff all rdas right it just oh you have to eat this much a day well do you have to eat that much a day or do you have to eat that much a day because you're eating with a whole bunch of other crap and you're not absorbing it right or you're not utilizing it properly and so when you don't eat it with all that stuff what about then you know you're taking a whole bunch of oxalates and other sorts of things that strip out calcium from your body you need a lot less calcium if you're not stripping yourself out of calcium and and you're actually absorbing this stuff so uh yeah if you find just eating muscle meat if you're early on and you're nutritionally deficient you know there there are go for the more nutrient-dense things to catch yourself up but you may not actually need to do that most people don't need to do that to maintain very good levels if not optimal levels so good luck with that and just eat what eat what makes you feel good uh as far as meat is concerned Jules Anderson thank you for the Super Chat it's very kind of you hi Dr C 58-year-old Aussie female Aussie long-term carnivore nice no coffee for 20 days have toxo plasma Gandhi parasites um no gut symptoms but very fatigued no meds any tips how do they die I eat organic meat liver eggs thank you um jewels from South Australia well I'm I'm glad to hear that you've been doing this for a while it's great to see more and more long-term carnivores and and people thriving doing this um so you have sort of you know toxo or other sorts of parasites um and and it's not sort of shifting on its own I mean we do have a ner an immune system response to parasites that is there for a reason but at the same time um parasites have way of of dodging our immune system as well I mean that's we're designed to deal with parasites but parasites are designed to deal with us and our immune systems too so if you are not shifting this I I probably would look into um you know taking medications for that there's a lot of very effective medications that aren't really harsh on your system that work very very well they're very very safe and um and and can just clear the stuff out of you um it's uh I I don't know uh when this sort of picked up but you know you can have you can have these parasites in your body for years or decades and not notice it and it doesn't really you don't really know that it's causing a problem until at one point then you get a diagnosis so um either way you you know if this is if this isn't really clearing I would I would just I personally would go and talk to your doctor and talk to my doctor and uh and try to get on something you know go to a parasitologist someone who deals with this specifically and and get on a treatment regime you know to get this stuff cleared out it's generally pretty innocuous um treatments most of them and most of them are very very safe and they're used sort of all over the world for decades and they're very effective so that's what I would do um and that can hopefully get this out and you can get off and running and feeling great as a carnivore so good luck with that a question from uh Facebook four months in any help for estrogen well it depends on the person but I see a lot of of women make a lot more estrogen I've seen I've had several patients in their mid to late 50s who have come out of menopause and started having periods again and started making completely normal amounts of estrogen so you know just keep going with it just eat really fatty meat don't eat anything else just water and fatty meat salt to taste and um you know just remember that your hormones come from cholesterol so you know if you don't want you don't you want don't want to avoid the cholesterol you don't want to do things that lower your cholesterol and um because that's what your hormones are made of that's what your estrogen is made out of so you know just do that support your body as much as possible um there can be other reasons why your your body isn't making as much estrogen at at some point women are just going to stop making as much estrogen from their ovaries uh but just carbohydrates raise insulin insulin blocks the conversion of testosterone into estrogen when make testosterone first and that's turned into estrogen so you stop that and you you you raise your insulin you you block that and you mess up with your hormones so just getting rid of that should help but you know at the same time there can be other reasons why you're not making estrogen you know age I I don't think that that 40s or even early 50s is uh is the normal time that we should be going through menopause I think it's later than that um and I've seen that but um you know at some point you're probably not going to make uh normal amounts of estrogen at some you know I I I don't know of anybody in their 90s that are that's still um you know fertile and things like that uh So eventually that's going to catch up but at the same time um it it's a lot later than than we think so I would uh you know I just hope for the best and if your body is you know give your body the best chance that it can to to heal and and recover and uh you know and if it does it does if it doesn't it could be something else going on it could be that you just sort of pass that point that it's going to recover but um you know just check it every now and then and uh and see how you go a lot of women when they're still in fertility ages you know they'll see a lot of disruption of their period potentially within the first four or five months and then things sort of stabilize out some people don't notice any differences at all some people do but um just see how you go anyway and just just check and and hopefully yours does so good luck with that NAB thank you for the Super Chat uh hi doc I hear you don't salt your Foods is that true um what are your reasons someone doesn't need to salt and someone does need to Salt yeah that's a good question I think early on people may need to Salt because when your when your insulin is high you know it's it's drawing in more more electrolytes in at the level of your kidneys so you're storing you're retaining more and your kidneys have to work harder to get out the appropriate amount of of salt and other electrolytes so when you go away from carbohydrates and your insulin levels start coming down you don't have fasting uh insulin that's way too high you know insulin resistance and you're not getting these insulin spikes and all these other sorts of things then the idea is that your your kidneys may be you know over over spilling these electrolytes and you may need more salt to compensate but just because but you know when you were born you didn't have insulin resistance and you didn't have insulin spikes because fetuses are in ketosis breastfeeding infants are in ketosis and so it's um you know even you know there is milk in there but you know then then um you know most people in the wild they're eating meat you know that was the traditional way of doing it Lions the same way so your insulin levels are going to start off fairly low you're not going to start off with insulin resistance and eventually it's going to creep up and creep up and I had you know your insulin should your fasting insulin should never be above nine uh you know if you know if above seven um and uh yet I see people with fasting insulin one one U gentleman was 44 yesterday and a couple months ago 72 you know so that's that's fasting right so all the time it's up there he didn't he wasn't born like that right so that massively elevated insulin that's affecting how many electrolytes are staying in or going out right but it had to work up to that so if his insulin just went to an inappropriate level and was just like storing all this stuff and and his kidneys didn't respond and to to maintain homeostasis and eliminate electrolytes another way he'd be dead because his electrolytes would be way too high and when your potassium gets too high your heart stops you know that's what lethal injection is you anesthetize people and inject them with potassium chloride and their heart stops right so that is um a known consequence of getting your electrolytes completely out of balance like that and then in exercise your potassium goes up to like sort of otherwise lethal levels which is a bit strange so you know we don't really know what the hell is going on with that but uh under normal normal circumstances other than that that's that's a that's a bad bad idea so his body had to had to get used to his insulin level going up to 72 fasting right so I can get used to it coming back down from 72 fasting and so your body's going to and actually his after six weeks his on a carnivore diet his fasting insulin went down from 72 to 35 massive difference and he didn't uh you know go the other way and and die from hyponatremia and hypokalemia and things like that so your body adjusts one way or the other some people in in Studies have suggested that they would spill out more salt than they than they uh was good for them and they needed to add a lot more salt in so I think that's an early thing um maybe down the track some people may have still have some electrolyte imbalances and things like that but you just check you know and you just and you see what that what's going on and you need to add in a bit more salt or potassium or magnesium fine do it most people are low on pot on magnesium anyway sodium and and um potassium are very tightly regulated because they have to be and um so but you know a lot of people are pretty low on magnesium so I just salt to taste early on I salted more the thought is is that we started adding in more salt when we uh started eating more agrarian crops and we needed more mineral salts there's a lot of long-term carnivores that the the real old school ones that called themselves zc or zero Barb before the the moniker of carnivore was was attached to this way of eating um they they uh didn't use salt and they they just didn't salt anything there's plenty of sodium in meat and um there's a lady Dana Spencer who's like 16 plus year carnivore and she started the Facebook group zerocarb health and I I like that one and zeroing in on health that's with Charles Washington because they're they're both great they're very EXP experien and knowledgeable and they're they're very interactive on there but it's also a very strict uh Facebook groups they just was like look you want to eat something else you do that but you don't talk about it you know because that just confuses people like this is what we do it's just meat it's just water you're not fasting you're not eating plants that's it that's what we do here you want to do something else go somewhere else um and I like that because I think that helps people a lot more and then you and you see Real Results you see people on on different carnivore groups and they're just doing all sorts of crap oh well I didn't really find this benefit I yeah because you weren't doing it right you go to those those ones that are really strict they're just meat only water and they have they have they have the most incredible results and so you know it does make a difference and so that's that's what that's where you go if you really want to see real results but uh they don't use salt and Dana posted uh just recently a post about the sodium content in meat you know per ounce or whatever there's plenty there's plenty of sodium in there and so we and again we we we we create homeostasis in our bodies and and retain the amount that that we need so as long as you have some Supply uh you should be fine my taste just ran that way so I just salted to taste early on you might need a bit more salt because of the reasons I mentioned uh but eventually your body is just is just there and and so I just wanted less and less salt so salting to taste became less and less salt until finally I didn't really want salt sometimes I put some salt on there sometimes it might be salt on there from a restaurant um it's a bit weird because you know if I if someone else is cooking and they put salt on things or we get uh you know meat from you know from a restaurant or something like that there's almost always salt on it and so it generally tastes too salty but then I go back and some tastes not salty enough it's like that's a bit weird but yeah I I tend to not use any salt and uh and tend to prefer it when there's no salt on things like if I get meat from a restaurant now it just tastes way too salty um so but that's just but still though just salt to taste you know I think that's that's perfectly fine uh be more mindful of it in the beginning when you're transitioning and um and uh otherwise just you know if your if your body doesn't want salt you don't don't need salt there are reasons and arguments on why you don't want to have salt so just you know take a look at those Stanley is a guy named he's sort of nicknamed The Bear he was like a 50 plus year carnivore white guy and he was the the sound engineer for the Grateful Dead for just years right and um yeah I don't know so he did a lot of LSD and only ate meat so I don't know it's a bit of a unique character um it would be great if he was around he apparently died in a car accident unfortunately was very sad but um he he gave a lot of knowledge because he was doing this for a very long time and um and he talked about salt and how it's like actually you don't want it it's not necessary in a lot of different ways and and um and sort of thought it can make you eat you know overeat and eat too much and um be a bit addictive like you know sugar and things like that so there are definitely arguments out there that people you can go find and look at I just go by taste and um and yeah so I don't I don't salt very much anymore anyway well I don't really add salt to anything myself um but so the salt that I would get would be from someone else salting it if I'm if someone else has prepared it or if we're at a restaurant that's pretty much it but that's how my tastes run it tastes too salty if I had any salt so that's just me you probably might run that way too who knows just see how you go Tina newbie thank you for the Super Chat lost 80 pounds on mostly carnivore leptin is under seven uh is is this why I stalled uh still at 190 for weeks well first of all that's fantastic 80 pounds is is amazing um you saying your leptin is under seven or over seven um usually the higher leptin is uh can be a reason for for slow weight loss but you know when and it it depends on units because I I don't know where you are so um I don't know if those are the same units that I use but um in any case elevated leptin can be a sign of a slowed metabolism and it can be a slower start a slower burn if you've already been losing a lot of weight that's probably not what's holding you back because your left is just going to keep dropping and dropping the longer you're on a carnivore diet um could be other things in it you know anything slip back in any dairy artificial sweeteners uh berries other sorts of things just you just dairy in general certainly milk uh because of the the lactose or even yogurt and kefir and those sorts of things just cut them out just cut all of that stuff out just go right down just fatty meat and water add a bit of organs in there your body wants nutrients it doesn't want calories calories come along with the nutrients and so uh you can think of it that way so if you're eating more nutrient dense things you tend not to be all that hungry as long as you're getting enough nutrients um salt that's another one people argue that salt can actually make it so so you uh overeat and you eat more than you actually your body actually wants so I don't know the veracity of that but that's certainly uh something that's spoken about um and uh there are a lot of other reasons too like if you're uh exercising which you you ideally should be you're going to put on muscle you're going to put on bone density and that's going to offset the fat you're losing so don't worry as much about the weight as as much as your body composition and how you feel first foremost so just number one how do you feel are you feeling good are you feeling healthy number two very distant number two body composition you know are you losing fat but gaining muscle that's what you want that's the ideal and so you may look different your clothes may fit differently and if you got a dexa scan it may may show that there's a significant difference and um and then basically nowhere on there is is the scale because it's not important because what's important is your body composition and your health and so I would just keep going with it remember this is a long-term game this isn't just this isn't just a crash diet and then you go back to doing what you're doing you're doing this for life because this is the healthiest thing for you to do for the rest of your life so you just do this and you let your body go the way it's going to go any little cheats any little additions will screw you up promise you that you know I see this in people all the time that struggle with their weight and they're doing really really well and they're really just eating meat they're having a little bit of this they're having some nuts or maybe a little bit of whatever and it's not until they really just cut everything out that they actually go keep keep losing weight so you really just have to cut absolutely everything out everything even vegetables especially vegetables they're disgusting and um you know I lost 23 pounds as soon as I stopped eating vegetables and started eating more meat and that's another thing too are you eating enough are you eating enough fat if you're chronically undereating or you're fasting or doing these sorts of things because everyone tells you you have to not eat fat if you want to lose fat you want to not eat all that much you want to be in the chloric deficit just throw all that nonsense out that is that has not worked ever in history why would it work now just eat what you're designed to eat eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good this will encourage your metabolism will ramp up your metabolism and your body will say like we don't need this excess fat and we'll we'll let it go now so uh and I've seen people do this they've tracked their calories they've tracked their intake they've tracked their fat content and they've tracked how much they were eating and they tracked their weight and when they started reducing their uh what they were eating they could actually put on weight because their body slowing down the metabolism so they're saying hey look we're in a famine and so we need to actually store things we're not going to use things we got to store them because you know may get to a point that we're that we're uh stuck and we need this and then they started eating more and weight started coming off fat started coming off so it actually does matter your metabolism actually does matter it's like oh the law of thermodynamics we're an open system we're not a closed system there's not in a vacuum humans don't exist in a vacuum and a calorie is not a calorie because we don't burn these things first in formal so the entire principle is flawed you you're not burning these things so it's oh this energy if this heat is idiotic right you can have all the energy stored up in these chemical bonds and just not absorb them and just crap them out what do that do right so oh but the law of thermodynamics is in the toilet all right so you know this is this is not applicable um that's something that just people just latch on to so they can sound intelligent well but the law you don't know what you're talking about it's not applicable to the system and we're not a bunson burner so we're not burning things we're not burning calories and producing energy as heat um so eat fatty until it stops tasting good don't eat anything else and um and do work out you know because high-intensity exercises anobi exercises resistance training sprinting will help you lose fat it will put on muscle though and so you will you will offset the scale so be as strict as you can eat as much as your body's telling you to eat until it stops tasting good because that's how you know that your body doesn't want it anymore is when it you get that bite it just tastes like cardbo board then you move on with your day and and exercise and then don't worry about the scale worry about your body composition and your health first and foremost and you know some people after years and Decades of harming themselves with different ways of eating and starving themselves they're not going to get necessarily get back to their the body shape that they had when they were 16 um so it's uh it's just one of those things but your body will will do wonders and so just put it in the in best position possible possible to do just that and and you'll do fine and you'll be very healthy as a result so good luck with that knum Knight thank you very much for the generous Super Chat I appreciate it hey Dr chaffy I'm starting carnivore my trainer has me drink a mass gainer for muscle growth within 30 minutes after what are your thoughts about how to replace that on carnivore or do you have a certain product to use uh steak just fatty steak cut up you know just cook up a big big fat ribeye something like that put some butter on it cut it up into chunks take that with you to the gym soon as you finish just eat it you know you just get that right away it's it's everything that you need the mass gain is a bunch of carbs and sugar and that sort of [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah you'll gain Mass you you'll gain mass in a fat ass it's just G to it's just arbs it's just going to put on fat you're not going to put on muscle like you will put on muscle you know but it's not going to be because of the carbs like you'll put on muscle because of the work that you did and the protein that that you eat um you know you you do raise insulin insulin does put uh carbohydrates as as well as protein into your cells but you know what you already have insulin and protein does give a bit of a bump of insulin as well for exactly that reason and so you know the idea that just oh if you don't eat protein with carbs and you're just not going to get the you're not going to get enough insulin put in get to your protein in your cells like who told you that uh what was that where where was that written down that's missed that day on biochemistry class I guess it's complete another nonsense you know so I mean what 70% of animal species are carnivores and they I guess they're just not they're just not getting any protein because they're just they're not eating with carbs um that's nonsense so you don't need carbs in order to build muscle in fact it's counterproductive because you're just putting on fat as opposed to muscle and you're getting intramuscular fat you're getting uh more glycogen storage and deposition and water retention as a result of that so you look more bloated you look more bulky but that's fat water and glycogen it's not muscle you know so if you want to put on lean muscle mass you just eat meat you just eat fatty meat and uh yeah absolutely so the same thing that you'd eat at any other time you eat then right so if you want to if you want to you know the you call like an anabolic window straight after uh working out and some people say that that's a thing some people say it's not a thing I don't really care one way or the other if you find that you like doing that and you and it benefits you do it I I you know I think of it you know and uh I I don't think it's it's farfetched from an evolutionary biology point of view because you know when are you maximally abser exerting yourself as a carnivore when you're running the hell away from something fighting for mating rights or hunting and trying to physically dominate something and kill it that's when you're working the hardest physically and so what happens directly after that big large exertion you get your kill you eat your kill you know so maybe there is something to that um either way I don't think it's it's unnatural to eat directly after you work out for that exact reason and so you know if that's what you want to do then do it but just do it with meat always do it with just fatty meat if you're in a stretch and you're in a bind and you and you just don't have access to that at that moment there are proteins protein powders that only have animal proteins like whey protein or egg protein or beef protein that um that I I have one of them um I I think I've used a quarter of it over the last three four years something like that and it would be for exactly that reason like I just worked out and I wanted to go and I want and I didn't have time to eat I had to go you know back into the hospital I had to go you know do something and I was like okay I'm just going to I'm just going to and grab some protein and then get on with my with my day um and that's it but I I wouldn't do any other products of that I just eat meat really you know you can get you can get those protein shakes that don't have anything else um but I would really make sure they don't have anything else you know so some things that have whey protein and that's it that's a single ingredient um or you know egg protein that's it single ingredient beef protein icelet that's it single ingredient if it has more than one ingredient besides animal protein don't get it they tend to cost more even though there's less in it don't know why probably just because you know there there's not as much of a market for it and so people are willing to pay more but there aren't aren't as many available but in any case you just eat meat if you're planning ahe and you're planning on having this muscle Gainer and all that sort of stuff you know just just just bring a steak just bring chopped up steak just eat crush it down and uh and you'll do great you'll you'll you'll SL on muscle you you'll uh uh yeah you'll find it's easy very easy to to put on muscle actually more easy to put on muscle now than ever before um if you're working out hard is making sure you're eating enough so eat right after sure make sure you're eating enough after that maximally until it stops tasting good you have to do that a couple times a day to make sure you're getting enough meat um or else you'll you'll miss it and uh you won't uh you won't build as much muscle as you can you don't you don't need to be in a caloric Surplus that's nonsense a surplus means Surplus to demand mean you're going to store as fat so again you want to put on mass fine but you want to put on muscle that's a different story so you don't need a surplus you need enough so you eat until it stops tasting good your body's going to tell you uh when I start working out I double my Hunger easily and so I'm eating like you know two 2 and a half pounds of very fatty meat a day and then I start working out goes up to four four and a half easily you know and um and that's that's pretty normal and when I do that and I'm eating enough slamming on muscle I'm at 44 and it's easier for me to put on muscle now than it any period in my entire life except 20 to 25 when I was also doing this exact same diet and um I was jacked and when I was down in um well before that when I was in Seattle I wasn't lifting weights as much but I was like my legs were like tree trunks just because of the amount of of running and sprinting I was doing and um and and I every now and then I would go do squats it was just like am I and I was squatting what was I squatting 495 I us sets of 10 it was just easy but it was like but my it hurt my back so much it was like I didn't use weight belt probably should have used the weight belt um but it just put so much pressure on my back and I was just like I couldn't do more weight than that because it hurt my back so much um and uh or put a lot so much pressure on my lower back which I've always had problems with my lower back um for whatever reason and uh but for my legs it was nothing it was nothing you know I could I could squat that easily so I use like sets of 10 and then I'd breast I do like four sets of 10 just from my sprinting workout I didn't I didn't squat much at all just every now and then I just would throw it in there but just because the amount that I was sprinting it was like six to eight hours a day I was just at a dead Sprint and um you know in interval right because break in between sort of drills and games and plays and things like that but uh massive massive gain then when I was down in in Arizona for a year uh and I was with friends that were you know regularly in the gym I started getting back into like a regular lifting cycle and so it was just like four days a week rain or hail it's never rain or hail in Arizona so that's easy um that uh that we were in the gym and I I got Absol abely massive I got absolutely ma jacked um so and now it's the same thing you know if I'm if I'm working out consistently and I'm eating enough you know I get absolutely very easy to put on muscle I just put on muscle very easy and you'll find the same thing eat enough to eat enough meat you don't need supplements or or products yeah you don't so good luck with that man you you'll kill it and hello from my sister Rosland hello Rosland nice to see you um there's another one here um so Rossa said highly valid about the part of the animal but there's also um the part where the intestines are humans may have been avoiding infection as well um don't know what that's referring to um highly valid about the part of the animal I don't know maybe we're talking about organs and and different sorts of things like that but yes I agree absolutely Rosland 100% and let's see so yeah um I don't know what that's referring to though sorry but good to see you uh Steve large good to see you buddy thank you for the Super Chat just want to say thanks I'm saying the course and is paying dividends slow uh but slowly well that's awesome um well you're very welcome and I'm really glad that it that it's it's getting better it does it just keeps getting better and those and those benefits do ramp up the more strict you are the more consistent you are the better you are and and when you're eating um fatty meat you're eating enough of it you do really well and and it just gets better and better as you go your mitochondria get more plentiful and more um and more you know and replace and get more uh useful and uh and your body just gets better and better and better more and more adapted and so you'll do great so keep it up and your hormones get a lot better and when your hormones improve it's not just like oh my my testosterone's up my growth hormone's up it's now okay for the next six months that they're up now you start seeing really good results because of how it affects your bod hormones are slow acting long acting they take a while um to to to really see full effects of those things so it's just keeps getting better just keeps getting better the more and more we do this so you know good luck with it and you're doing great and just keep it up um so Shane Patterson thank you for the Super Chat you recommend uh 2 to1 ratio of fat to protein most Stakes are under one to one if butter is not okay what do you suggest I do to get my ratio up to two one butter is totally fine butter is fine for almost everybody some people with very sensitive and severe uh autoimmunities maybe not to see how you go most people with autoimmunity seem to do fine on butter ghee is fine too that's another alternative or tallow animal fat and fat trimming is from the butcher so yeah most most meat is is trimmed to a fault and U but the benefit of that everything being trimmed to hell is that they have a lot of fat trimmings at the butcher and you can usually ask for that and they'll they'll give them to you generally for free I have seen people charge a small amount um typically if they're going to use that for sausages and things like that but you know sometimes they like the offcuts they just throw away quite often the butcher will so for either for very cheap or actually just give it to you because they they actually have to pay to get this stuff taken away so you know ask your butcher uh if this the price isn't isn't um meeting your expectations you know try calling around to other butchers we we did that here in Perth locally in America I most butchers will just give it to you because they pay to get it taken away so they're happy for you to take it um and um so when we spoke to some butchers here you know some were were a bit more unreasonable to charge like $20 a kilo and we're like no thanks but then the other on are very reasonable it's like five bucks a kilo like totally fine happy to pay that um you know especially for like grass finished you know grassfed and finished ones which like dark yellow fat fantastic and I ordered that now from from you know my new sponsor the Stockman Stakes they have that I think they call it like Tallow or whatever it looks like Tallow brick on the picture but it's actually packs of fat and uh and you just cut that up in chunks fry them up you eat them they and they taste great my mom used to do that when she trim off the fat from steaks because it was all about the oh low fat low fat but she would cut that off and then she'd sort of fry them up and it just smell amazing and you sort of have some of these things they just tasted so good um so those are the things you do butter is totally fine try the butter if it's um if it's working for you and and you feel good on it then just just do that just do the butter and um but there's also the fat trimmings from the butcher Tallow lard duck fat ghee all those sorts of things are options too so good luck with that uh Meredith Campbell um thank you for the Super Chat can I still try carnivore struggling because of lack of stomach acid uh because of Nexium for Hiatus I have diverticulitis to please help no you can you can definitely still do that the Nexium may or may not be as necessary as well because when you're when you're eating carbohydrates again your insulin goes up and what people don't understand when they talk about well this is a normal reaction you just eat carbohydrates your insulin goes up and that just drives the energy in cells this is a normal process and you can say that all you want but it's not normal at the levels that we're experiencing when we're eating exogenous carbohydrates because blood sugar is not supposed to go that high that is toxic to humans that kills us eventually that's what kills diabetics that's what makes their organs fail they lose their vision and they get their limbs chopped off and eventually die that's because of high blood sugar so no that is not normal at that level and then the insulin goes up to combat this because it's toxic at that level and then the insulin goes up to yes drive this energy into cells oh well that's normal no at levels down here that's normal levels way the hell up here that's very abnormal and things are going out of balance specifically because insulin doesn't just drive energy into cells insulin does over a hundred other things in your body that are very important and so when your insulin's at five which is very nice place for insulin to be it's affecting everything at a five and then you eat some pasta or bread it slams up to 35 and expecting everything at a 35 that's abnormal that's not good for you and then you get insulin resistance and all of a sudden you have you're fasting insulin is 72 like my patient a few months ago and his unfasted postprandial uh insulin is probably over a hundred you know so that's that's going to affect things very negatively one of the things that it does is insulin increases the acidity of your stomach acid so you can get a lot more reflux and problems um um you more reflux and problems with stomach acid and things like that the hiatus hernia that's a structural abnormality that can just make things you know so that things structurally are so that that you can have more problems and potentially get up back into your esophagus and regurgitate more easily and um but either way you know the neck seem is sort of offsetting that but when you stop eating carbohydrates it will actually go back to a more normal now it'll be still be very acidic but it'll be normally acidic it'll be it will be appropriate for our anatomy and physiology so even even if you have uh are on Nexium you can absolutely still do a carnivore diet you don't you don't have to you don't have to in fact it's it's still going to be easier to absorb and digest any meat than anything else because that's the easiest thing for us to digest you know plants don't get digested we just don't break them down we don't have the enzymes to break down cellulose no animal has cellulase it's the microorganisms that that eat the fiber and produce fatty acids and protein as result of that so it's um and um and so uh you know is perfectly fine uh to do that uh to to eat that on on a Nexium that's fine don't don't worry about that just eat meat eat fatty meat and uh until you know it's comfortable if you're getting a bit of upset stomach maybe eat a bit less and see how you go diverticulitis is you know that's what do you do for diverticulitis you go on a low residue diet anyway so low fiber no fiber so you can rest your bowel and that's what a carnivore diet is have you know very little of that is going to go out in waste and so you know you're gonna actually do a lot better with that anyway so yeah all these things are actually totally fine on a carnivore diet so good luck with [Music] that okay um all right there's just a a good good comment here from sir praise the sun uh where do lions get their Gatorade pre-workout and pancakes for carbs and how do they Sprint like I don't know that is a mystery of the ages um you know how they they they actually exercise without all the Pre-Workout and carbohydrates and car bloing and things like that I mean where they where do they get their glycogen I you have to have carbs for glycogen I mean it's it's impossible any other way um yeah you know how do whales you know swim for you know thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of Miles um and don't eat for eight months in a row damn it where are they getting their carbs there must be like big soy plantations down in the sea that we're just not knowing about so obviously yes a good good point uh people just don't I think they just don't like to think anymore I certainly taught not taught how to think anymore and sometimes taught not to think just no no no just trust the experts just trust the experts oh but not those experts no no no no just these experts the ones that we want you to listen to I'm like oh shut up you know you need to think for yourself if anybody's telling you no no no no no just blindly follow who we tell you to do you know that that's just mini Hitler they're just trying to gear up for totalitarianism uh they're trying to get you you geared up for that as well so you know don't don't talk to you know Baby Hitler baby Lenin baby Stalin baby Ma just just ignore their ass you know oh you need to listen no you need to shut the [\u00a0__\u00a0] up you know and I'll listen I'll do what the hell I want and I'll listen to myself thank you very much um sorry for swearing as I try to tell you guys I normally SW swear way too much so the fact that I'm I'm I'm being this good this consistently for this long I think I I deserve some sort of recognition for that maybe rosling can let you know just how rampantly I swear on a normal basis so um you're welcome uh s Goan 90 thank you for the Super Chat hey Doc if we are true carnivores why are we able to metabolize carbs sugar or um develop the ability to do so in the first place thanks uh well look we weren we weren't always carnivores we had the ability to to eat these sorts of things historically and so does give a survival Advantage because we have we can eat other things we can survive on them um and when when you're looking at things in evolutionary terms you don't lose the ability to do something unless it confers a survival advantage to do so so because that's just that's just how that works because the ones that don't have that trait tend to die off and they tend not to have kids and so it's that trait that actually is a big survival Advantage so you know making having the ability to break down carbs and sugars and and absorb them is is uh you know an advantage to anybody because if you don't have that ability then you you're limiting more resources and um in a famine period you trying to eat something else you know that's not that great but you know pretty much any animal can absorb simple carbohydrates you know not all animals make amales but most of them do and um and so they can still break down starches some don't have amalis in their saliva but they can make it from their pancreas and either way uh they can they can absorb they can absorb carbohydrate simple carbohydrates like simple sugars and and there are carbohydrates in meat I mean there's glycogen in meat and and so you actually do get these things on a carnivore diet so you actually do need this stuff uh on a carnivore diet because there are carbohydrates that you're going to break down and absorb as well it's just not the mass quantities of these things that that we see in you know processed carbs or you know starchy vegetables and things like that or fruit you know very sweet um unnatural sweet fruit that we've we've uh arranged you know and bred and and intensively bred to be much more sweet so plenty of animals do plenty of carnivores do still have that ability we're no exception it does confer a survival advantage to to be able to eat potatoes and survive um it's just not it's just not optimal but also there are carbohydrates and meat and so you need that ability there too break down the gly and uh and certainly absorb the simple sugars and you know I mean look at you look at your cells I mean there's there are carbohydrate components to uh many proteins to many receptors to many parts of your cell to many parts of of the animal and so that's important you know that's important to be able to contend with that break it down and absorb it so yeah that's not actually abnormal um you know i' I've seen some things where they say that that you know like lions and big cats don't make amalis in their saliva but that doesn't mean they don't make it in their pancreas and I've seen other ones that said that they do so I I don't know about that I think it's generally generally accepted that they they don't but I have actually seen some that that said that they did so you know it's um either way it doesn't really matter if we have you had that ability because we were or biver before you don't lose that trait unless there's a survival advantage to lose that trait um but also I mean even herbivores I mean look at gorillas you know they're they're not eating carbs they're not they're not eating like roots and tubers and starchy vegetables they're eating fiber and that fiber you know amales won't break that down you know it won't won't do any of that it's um the bacteria in their gut that is in their in their hind gut which is their seeum which is very very very long or equivalent is the appendix because that was a survival advantage to lose that we did have a very elongated seeum presumably and then that shrunk down to almost nothing because that's very energy dependent and so we traded our gut length for our brain size and we needed more nutrient-dense food uh meat and so we that did uh give a survival advantage to lose that big useless gut that we we weren't using anymore um and so we have a much smaller one so they have a big hind gut and the bacteria eat the fiber because only bacteria and protozoa and these single cell organisms that can even make cellul a termites don't even make cellulases the protozoa in their gut that eats the the cell cellulose and produce cellulase and as a byproduct they produce saturated fat and then the microorganisms die off and they get absorbed as protein so do gorillas have Amala do gorillas have the ability to break these things down why they don't need it they're absorbing saturated fat and protein so it's the same thing you know we need fat and protein Lions need fat and protein gorillas need fat and protein and we get those from our food source that's really the main thing some of us have some amales some of us don't doesn't really matter you still just need fat and protein that's the main thing Shane Patterson thank you for the super chat um GF been trying to increase meat girlfriends has been trying to increase meat but says she has low appetite for red meat and feels sick when eating only meat um even one meal any recommendations yeah you look we we're conditioned to think that this is really bad for us women especially have have um taken that to heart um and uh there some seems to be some sort of psychological reason for that that you know they're just more much more um much more likely there just much more coachable and people say this too it's just like you know when you're when you're coaching girls like they they really pay attention they really listen they try to try to do what you you tell them to do and like guys sort of do whatever the hell they want so you don't have as as much coachability in some guys and and so you have to you know that's why you know being being able to learn being able to be coachable is is uh is a good trait you know that coaches look for in young athletes um and so but you know girls women seem to have taken that and saying okay well this is bad for me I'm not going to do that okay makes sense and if believe that that's the that's the right thing to do uh guys are a bit more headstrong like yeah screw that and so I like it I enjoy it so I'm just going to do it a bit more hedonistic and um that can be good in this circumstance when you're being lied to and you're just let trusting your your Natural Instincts and the other side of it is that it could be very bad because you end up doing things that are bad uh in any case we train ourselves and condition ourselves to think that meat's bad and to think that um and to think that Fat's bad and we and we have a psychosomatic reaction where it just it it makes us physically ill I would get that in my late 30s when I knew that this was the right way to go when I would eat fat I just couldn't do it and I had to slowly work myself into it and so that that's what you do just ease into it you know it's uh just just a little bit more a little bit more doesn't have to eat if it doesn't taste good if she feels unwell don't eat that's fine your body's your body can can tell you that if if meat doesn't taste good you're not hungry and you'll eat a lot less you don't need nearly as much and so you just eat fatty meat till it stops tasting good if you can't eat big chunks of fat you you cut a small piece of that fat off put it with the lean meat eat that together and you say like okay that actually tastes good together and um and you can do that and you just recondition yourself and really decondition you know that programming you know that we had of listening to The Experts and never eat fat because Fat's so bad for you even though it has never been bad for us ever in human existence um and then the argument goes well but we weren't living all that long says who the Census Data didn't say that in the 1800s if you made it to adulthood you'd live that you know s very similar length of time that we live now it's just average life expectancy from birth was 38 in 1850 because the infant mortality rate was so high and 50 years later it was a lot higher than that because infant mortality or the total life expectancy from birth was a lot higher because it was um it was the infant mortality rate had had uh improved significantly and so um you know it's completely false all people were just weren't living long enough in the 1800s and before that to uh to experience these diseases like really have you have you read a book because they were written by people and some of those people actually have um biographies and you can actually see like how long they lived you know how how old was Mark Twain how old was Sam Adams when he died how old was was John Adams second president of the United States born in the mid 1700s died in the mid 1800s he was 91 all the founding fathers look them up they're all in their 80s and 90s when they died Ben Franklin was 64 when the Revolutionary War broke out and then funny enough I I seem to recall that the minimum age required to even apply for the job of President of the United States was 35 isn't that well that's funny if everyone dies at 35 that's funny age to set a minimum and I'm pretty sure we've had presidents in the 1700s and 1800s which is funny that because these these people are so smart and they know so much and surely they they'd look it up right and they'd understand that there's historical figures that we have clear documentation of that were much older than that and there's what was it Socrates is that who I'm thinking of who uh was in his 70s when they had to kill him and he was so sharp that it just pissed everyone off in Athens so they had to kill him by eating a plant by the way they made him drink Hemlock so I mean that's just nonsense that people weren't living long enough to um to experience these these diseases that's just ridiculous and I just spoke with a with a gentleman uh Dr Verma from India he's an Emergency Physician over in India and he said he treated a a boy who's 17 years old came in with a heart attack 17 yearold kid had a heart attack right vegetarian by the way vegan vegetarian and of this mostly plant-based Nation every says oh but and plants are so bad for us and meat is so good for us explain India India explains that you know 20 years ago the average person in India only ate five kilos of meat a year a year right I eat more than that in a week way more than that in a week you know and um and then in the last 20 years it's actually dropped down to 3 kilos a year right and the metabolic disease rate has actually sprung up in that time it's gotten worse right um he said something it was like 30% of people have metabolic Sy metabolic syndrome and disease and 30% 30 30% of people in India had diabetes full-blown diagnosed diabetes and this is very you know so a lot of people living rurally they may not ever get that diagnosis they may not have access to healthare so diagnosed diabetes 30% that's three times the diabetes rate of America is slovenly Americans who just eat a whole bunch of processed meat and processed foods and and red meat oh you know these guys are eating three kilos a year a year and a lot of them aren't eating any and 30% they have three times higher uh diabetes rates so it's just Flatout ridiculous that that people even make these intentions they're either complete Liars or just too stupid to to uh just too too stupid to to take any advice from anyway uh either way these are not people that you need to listen to if they're so flagrantly incorrect by either intentionally or because their brains don't work that like this is this is no one you want to take advice from anything else you know I mean people get things wrong and that's fine you know and and so you know I just I agree with some things that people say and I disagree with other things that they say um that doesn't mean that I hate them you know broke clock is wck twice a day you know but um but some people when they get these things so intensely wrong and it's so easy to look up it's um you know it's just like okay well what else are you phoning in you know like we just can't really we just can't really trust anything you say at this point like anel Keys the guy's a known fraud he was defrauding people for the majority of his his career when did that start when was he when did he start being a sellout I mean presumably had to do some good work in order to sell his reputation and integrity but when did that start can you trust anything he did because he's unscrupulous maybe he cut corners on other things maybe he just did things to publish them just so we could just so we could get some recognition fits the profile you know there people with Alzheimer's they say well this beta amalo plaqu that's what doing there's there's this there's a landmark paper that came out you know supposedly proving that showing that and turned out it was total fraud it was total garbage and that just came out last year so no that has nothing to do with it and they just defrauded people just so they could get the reputation just so they could publish a landmark paper and get their name on the map and um and you know get everyone tenure and everyone's all happy and patting each other's back and now they've got tenure so can't get rid of them but it's fraud it's absolute fraud and uh so when when did the fraud start with with anel keys who knows just don't trust anything he says don't trust anything he does and um you know and uh and the same thing with these sorts of things so long story short we've been conditioned to think something that is inherently untrue and we're getting psychosomatic responses as a result of that so just lead into it just just ease into it you know eat what tastes good stop eating when it doesn't taste good feeling a bit nauseous just stop you know if if she has to sort of do a slower transition and include some other stuff too just eating more fatty meat and less of the other stuff is already going to make a big difference and if you start easing into that and eating more and more meat and getting used to the fat you know eventually she might be able to just drop everything else you know but don't you know you don't want to force it you know because you know it might be that she just goes too much and goes no no no no no I'm not doing this and just mentally can't get her head around it and then you know might might just uh not really want to do it and not be motivated to do it so you know just it's okay it's okay to ease into these things too so good luck to to to both of you uh Robert uh farinelli thank you for the Super Chat good ways to get heavy metals mainly lead out of my body uh just uh demoed some plaster in an old house and probably got a good dose of lead paint dust e that's not good uh you know prevention is is the best treatment right so it's just obviously I'm sure you're wearing masks and all these sorts of things but you know hopefully just a try to avoid those sorts of things and do wear all the protective gear that you can to avoid any any exposure um things like lead heavy metals you know they they're actually very good keting agents um that you can you can talk to your doctor you can always if you're worried about that I would get tested I would test your heavy metals you get blood tests to do that um sometimes they like specialized Labs that that do that and there are some doctors that specialize in that sort of thing but if you end up being high on these things hey your body is going to work these things out uh eventually for most of these things and you have those forever chemicals and those aren't going anywhere apparently but the things like lead your body can get these things out uh as long as you you stop the exposure and allow your body to work normally on a carnivore diet right and so that can help but depending on on what level you are is probably it might be a good idea to use a Keating agent um depending on your level so just uh get a check get a blood test with your doctor and if your levels are high um for that or other other heavy metals that that have a keying agent that can that can help pull this out of your body um you know might might use that but uh you know just talk to your doctor about that as well otherwise your body will work this stuff out you just have to stop exposing yourself to it and if you keep exposing yourself and sort of building up and building up then you you might need some help from your doctor so don't you know I I like doing things naturally but there are there are medicines that actually really do help people and and those are great you know I I I don't have anything against that side of of pharmacology I just you know the the new iteration of pharmacology where they're just trying to make things that help chronic symptoms and it's symptom management so that you can live with a disease they're not trying to cure a disease something like lead poisoning you know only you know it's not it's not too much research going into that there's you know there's a reason why you know we haven't had any new breakthroughs or any new significant Research into new antibiotics in the last three decades because that's you cure something you have okay they're on for two weeks and that's it you know that's not paying the bills you know something they have to take every single day for the rest of their lives that's what buys the Yachts right and so that's just that's just you know good business you know like that's the direction you go that's the product we're going to make because that's what's going to make us the most money that's what's going to make us the most successful so that's what's happening so we just need to recognize that and uh and go to other places but we do have really good medicines for acute things as well and so you know what we need to do is we need to get rid of these chronic diseases ourself because they're not going to cure it for us we need to do that ourselves besid there's no medicine that cures this anyway the medicine is eating right and just not exposing yourself to poison like lead but also plants and so when you stop doing that you just get healthy then all of a sudden there's no market for their their drugs really you're going to force them into doing things that are actually useful to people because they're very smart people and they can do a lot of good for people we just need to CH shift the market over so that it's not profitable for them to to perpetuate chronic disease because there is no chronic disease we're going to get rid of that right that's what we're doing here um so but there are good things that your doctor can help you with and and that is definitely one of them good luck with that hope it's okay hope you don't didn't get too much uh in your system the alus thank you very much for the super chat um hello doctor I'm hypothyroid um male 39 years old 5 fo8 Oklahoma 242 carnivore for 30 days lost8 pounds is goat meat enough because I can't get beef since I'm Hindu yeah goat's great yeah I mean it's ruminant right so it's very very nutritious it's very good for you and uh yeah absolutely you can definitely do you can definitely do goat or lamb and that's totally fine too uh so yeah absolutely and and you know well done you know you're already losing weight um you're doing well you're hypothyroid make sure you're working with your doctor to get any sort of thyroid support that you need if you need it and uh hopefully this this helps ramp up your body's ability to make uh to make thyroid hormone you know I don't know why you're hypothyroid you know do check you know do you have Hashimoto is there is there a reason an underlying reason why you're hypothyroid is it just because the way you're eating is just slowing things down that's very common but uh Hashimoto is a is an autoimmune disease and that gets better too but I have over a 100 patients with Hashimoto and I'm sure I'll see a few today and um and antibodies just come right down especially with red meat the ruminant meat so just goat yeah so goat's fantastic so definitely definitely can do that uh nap thank you for the Super Chat how many hours of sleep do you get not as much as I'd like um I generally work till about midnight or or pass and then I'm doing admin and emails and messages and and scheduling things after that so I don't get I don't get enough sleep because it's just too busy at the moment I'm I'm G to have to have to sort of uh look into that I'm GNA have to sort of cut back on the on the the consultations and the interviews that I'm doing because it's just it's just every single day I'm going till midnight and then I've got then I've got all all I get so many messages every day uh you know five different email accounts and Instagram and all these other sorts of things it's just I just can't keep on top of it and um I would like to get seven to eight hours of sleep at night I'd like to get as much sleep as my body naturally wants and I wake up naturally every day without an alarm that's what I would like but um I don't always get that so but at the same time because the way I'm eating I I can handle it a lot better but uh yeah uh uh do get as much as you can do try to get uh to the point that you're not um that you're you're you're not waking up with alarm and you don't need to wake up with an alarm because it's um it's it's much better for you to get a proper amount of sleep it's very important for it's very good for your brain and your body and everything else so uh yeah so so so do that don't you know get as much sleep as you possibly can and I think L's in the chat so Hi l um I'm not seeing where chat is down here let me see where are where are you show yourself there we go hi everyone hello hello Ellie Melly nice to see you uh travel peeps thank you very much for the Super Chat very generous of you um been carnivore for one year I'm type two on Bristol stool chart eat lots of fat uh drink two to 2 and a half liters of water daily have reluctantly added plant ferments for microbiome uh any tips to get to type four uh or help things flow easier uh more fat right so if you are having dry hard stools it's not enough fat by definition every time um so you know if if your if your stools aren't aren't passing more than once a month you'll still get uh Dry soft stools or or or soft stools um if you are um soft stools for um what was I going to say soft stools um you know regardless just because there's there's enough fat in there right um what is going on here sorry one second Ah that's what that is and um so yeah so you just need to keep eating eating fat you know water I would probably generally recommend people drink a bit more water um the plant ferments you know you can do that but just remember that you know once you have established a microbiome that you just perpetuate it with the things that you're eating so you don't have to keep doing that you can um you just get the microbiome and then the meat that you're eating perpetuates that you know so the Inuit when they're just eating meat they have very very good microbiomes your oral biome changes as well and that changes the quality and character and type of bacteria that are in your mouth you're chewing food you're chewing meat that that goes down as well so um um and so um sorry just have to do this um and so once you once you get to the point that you have an established oral biome and microbiome you don't need to keep doing that with ferments I don't think um and a lot of people don't don't use ferments uh either way and their and their uh microbiome ends up becoming very very healthy after several months as well and very diverse so uh I you know just check you know and then you can see where you're at and you know do you need to do keep doing ferment also remember fermented dairy that's legal too and um you just want to get get fermented Dairy that has as little carbohydrates as possible zero if you can um but yeah but if you want if you want softer stools you need more fat and I know you're eating a lot of fat but it's a lot more fat than than you than you think um is how much you need so just good luck with that just keep keep ramping it up and you'll get there um we do have a number of Super chats or maybe we'll we'll cut off the super chats for now and um I have about an hourish uh to go and um and uh if we have more time then we have more time and if we have uh we can open things back up and answer other questions we can do that but just for now just so we don't get stuck like last time uh we'll just stop the super chats for now we'll just go through the rest that we have and see where we go or see where we're at Greg Emerson thank you very much for the Super Chat hey Doc is there a reason you don't eat eggs and do you think eggs are optimal for a carnivore diet or should we just stick to meat I think eggs are actually uh you know honorary meat it's got all the the nutrients that you need to turn into to meat right it's going to turn into a baby chicken and so that's going to have a lot of nutrients so I think eggs are actually great it's just that some people don't don't tolerate them well they may react to them negatively pasture raised eggs from chickens that are just eating bugs in their natural diet are are um going to be much more healthy and much more nutrient dense than uh anything else so even like free range all that sort of stuff doesn't mean anything just means they have access to outside but they generally don't go outside they stay in the barn where it's warm and all their friends are and their food is um they have little doggy doors where they could go out they almost never do and so you know it's it's a bit of a it's a bit of a of a trick uh but pasture Rays the supposed Bo to be out on grass and just just eating outside they'll still probably get feed though so you never know but that's the thing with eggs uh I do eat eggs I I don't eat a ton of them uh I think it's just just out of convenience because it's uh it's a lot easier just to grab a steak and put it on the grill and and eat it you know whereas like eggs you're going to like I need like a dozen eggs to get going and so just you know just making a dozen eggs and cracking them all and doing all that it's just a bit more uh effort and I'm lazy so that's probably why but I I don't have a problem with eggs I I do fine with them I do feel the best on beef but if you like eggs go for eggs and you're not as long as you're not reacting negatively to them you know go to town that's totally fine um but I feel best on beef and uh sometimes I'll add a couple eggs to my steak and and enjoy it but um just eat what you enjoy EG eggs are are great eggs are you know honorary meat they have all the nutrients that you that you need to make meat and that's what we're going for we're going for nutrients that make meat because we are meat so yeah go for it zo thank you for the Super Chat do you think about what do you think about ior mechon um there's people blocking people for discussing and saying it's um it's poisonous mixed with certain plant Inhibitors so I don't know about plant Inhibitors or anything like that um I understand that people were were being having comments timed out because they were being rude especially to my sister which is a noo uh be rude to my sister you can [\u00a0__\u00a0] right off and just don't follow me and don't come here because I don't need you I don't want you and you're not welcome uh and so if you do that and you're rude to my sister or my friends or my girlfriend you're going to be blocked and you're going to be out the out the window um Ivor meon you know has a lot of research on it is extremely extremely uh good in various circumstances and um and is very beneficial it's used I think it's been over a billion doses have been given around the world and so it's one of the safer medications that have ever existed and it works for many many many many things and so uh it's very beneficial it depends on what you're using it for I mean medicine's you don't need to take medicine just for the sake of taking medicine you take medicine for the specific outcome that you're trying to achieve and so if you have an infection or a parasite or something like that that ivrin would help with you know even viral infections have been shown to be uh benefited by Ivermectin um and uh that that's something that's now being recognized it was made illegal in many areas you weren't allowed to prescribe it you could lose your license if you prescribed it uh for people um you know during the lockdowns and everything like that and now it's recognized that yeah actually that's it actually works really well you know and there's you know even at the time there was like 60 uh randomized control trials showing that it was very beneficial um so that that's what the data showed and and there were more than that there there were over 90 just uh you know controlled trials showing its benefit large ones and so I think it's very it's a very good medication but you know you take medic medication for specific medical issue um and so yeah so that's the thing it's um you know so I don't I don't know about the the discussion about it being poisonous or mixed with certain sorts of things you know medicines are poisons they're just poisons that that that give a benefit um During certain circumstances um that are that outweigh the negative outcomes and the negative as aspects so uh uh that's that's like any medication so you know you you would take these things for a specific issue you know if um you know if I had some sort of infection or exposure or something like that that that could help with I would I would happily take that um because it's uh you know it's been been shown to be helpful for certain things and I wouldn't take it for other things I wouldn't just take it just to take it um but uh yeah I have I have no problem with that and I I saw early on uh during all the the craziness that that IV mechner was actually very helpful and then there was leaked government documents that actually said they knew that even though they made it illegal after that after that um you know document they uh not that it was released but that when they wrote it they said that it was very beneficial and actually was a cure uh for these sorts of things and um and and yet they still made it illegal which is I think is just criminal I mean I think that's that's literally crime against humanity you're withholding something that could be potentially life-saving for a lot of people in favor of other things that are just still on patent so that you can make your cronies more money uh that's disgusting and um you know and and and people like that should be held up in you know International court for crimes against humanity and uh you know and uh we you know should should be should face Justice for that because people died as a result of that and not being allowed to get that my cousin was one of them and um you know had she been able to get those sorts of things maybe she wouldn't have maybe she would have but um she didn't get the chance you know and so a lot of other people's family members died as well and so you know I have uh I got a lot of time for iveron anyway but like any other

because the thing is is that most of the time you'll you'll naturally be doing something along those lines where you'll be eating in a in a shorter amount of window or maybe only once a day I typically eat once a day twice a day at most um if I'm working out especially and um so that that people say like oh well you're intermittent fasting you're doing that it's like well no I'm not because what fasting is is is intentionally withholding food from uh when you're hungry and you want to eat but you're like no I'm gonna I'm GNA I'm going to abstain that's what fasting is just not being hungry is just not being hungry you know if I'm only hungry once a day and I eat once a day and I'm fine that's not fasting but it looks like it it looks like you're intermittent fasting so that's so that's the the yes part of it the no part of it is if you're intentionally withholding food and you continually do that and you do that you know day after day after day you're going to slow your metabolism down and you can actually stall weight loss and again it's not weight loss it's fat loss that you're looking for you're not looking for weight loss you don't want to lose muscle and bone you want to lose fat and so if you lose fat but you put on muscle and bone you're not going to lose weight and so you need to remember that and uh quite often when people are having a stall it's not actually a stall it's that they're working out and they're replacing they're fat with the muscle and bone uh then you can do things like take OIC that horrible poison that's been foed across the planet um again to make billions and billions and billions of dollars the research on OIC for weight loss by their own estimate was that you'd lose weight generally because you felt so sick and just nauseated you couldn't eat and then after that after about two years that that uh those symptoms would go away your appetite would come back and because you just been eating just little bits of chocolate and candy the whole time because you couldn't stomach anything else um and you basically just starved yourself for the last two years now you have horrific eating habits and uh and your appetite comes back and then you eat a whole bunch of garbage and then you end up putting on more weight than you lost initially and the weight that you lost wasn't just fat what they showed was that a large portion of this was actually lean body mass was muscle mass and bone density which you just can't afford to lose at any point in your life especially when we get into to middle and late age uh but I mean kids I why would you Jesus why would you do that to kids so you use a lot of lose a lot of lean body mass and then so you're losing weight but you're not losing the weight that's healthy you're losing really un you're losing uh weight that is very unhealthy to lose and then when you put weight back on because you have such horrible eating habits you put on fat you're not getting back the muscle and bone you're just getting back fat you're getting back more fat than the muscle and bone that you lost so after two years people tended to regain more weight than they lost um so that's not good so it's not about weight it's about body composition and really it's about health so you just eat what's healthy for you and and the the body composition comes as a result of that and that just happens down the road that's a consequence that's a secondary outcome the prim primary outcome is your health that's what the most important part of this is and um and if you if you intentionally withhold meals and intentially withhold from eating you will slow down your metabolism and you can stall and you can actually start gaining weight eating less you know bariatric surgeons will tell you that like women in particular if they eat less than 1,200 calories a day they will not lose weight so they have to eat a minimum threshold to actually be able to for their body to actually let go and um and and and let go of that excess fat because they're they're storing it because like no we're going to die we need to save this and because we're trying to save you so your body doesn't know it's not a conscious being it just it just it's taking inputs right so the input is that there's no food available okay we're in a famine we're going to shut it down and so that's what's going to happen so no I wouldn't do that I would just eat until fatty meat stops tasting good if that's once a day it's once a day if that's twice a day it's twice a day if that's 32 times a day it's 32 times a day it won't be you eat until you get that bite that tastes like cardboard typically when people are losing weight that's one going to be once a day twice at the outside but just make sure you're getting enough enough fatty meat until it stops tasting good you generally won't eat all that much and you'll you'll look like you're intermittent fasting but you won't actually be fasting you'll just be eating when you're hungry and that's what you do and that that's the other thing you know when when you you do these tricks and gimmicks you're fasting and starving and doing all these sorts of things eventually you get to the end of it and you just go okay well something's got to change because this isn't sustainable or the OIC and you're losing weight and now your your appetite comes back and now what happens now your pattern of behavior and your and and how you're you're functioning is now in congruent with a healthy lifestyle whereas if you're just eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good you can do that at any day at any point at any stage in your life because at different times you're going to need more or less and if you're just listening to your body and eating until stops tasting good your body's going to tell you what it needs today it needs 4,000 calories tomorrow it needs 3,000 next day it needs 4,000 now it needs 2,000 now it needs 5,000 it doesn't matter it's going to change on different on different days if you're losing fat your body eventually gets down to a stable body fat percentage you're going to need more that's all there is to it because you're not you're not going to be going on your fat stores anymore you need to actually get more energy and and nutrients in to run your body and maintain your your body fat and so that's what you do and your appetite goes up and so by the time you get to that stable point now you're you have the eating habits and the lifestyle that are going to be conducive to perpetuate that right so that's really important to just uh lay down patterns of behavior that you're going to be able to continue and perpetuate for the rest of your life to continue to get maximal results and the most benefit out of um out of your uh out of your life and on your health voy Bernard uh thank you very much for the Super Chat uh doc on Aon diet the D the D is working extra great okay okay wife wife thinks um very nice it's like a reusable booster rocket uh what's going on with the vascular system so uh first of all you can be you have hormonal changes that that can be um true but also you know early sign of um atherosclerosis um and um you know different sorts of you know hypertension other sorts of things can be um can be erectile dysfunction issues and um so yes it can help with your vascular system it can help with the um response to you know because the thing is you you have to you have to dilate out your your arteries in order to gain and maintain an erection and so uh one of the reasons that people can get uh high blood pressure just sort of idiopathic high blood pressure uh is is due to insulin resistance and so you have chronically High insulin and you're getting insulin resistance and now insulin actually one of the 100 plus things that it affects is also the the um expansion and contraction of really expansion of your of of your vessels your arteries and so when it listens when it's insulin sensitive insulin goes say oh okay that's going to go up and and expands out and your blood pressure drops so so once you get insulin resistance it's just like no we're not listening to you anymore we're just going to stay closed and um and so you get high blood pressure but what you also get is a erectile dysfunction because now those things aren't dilating out to allow more blood in and maximal blood flow into into the phus and to gain an erection um and then uh obviously testosterone things like that uh are going to improve i i i regularly see men's testosterone go up dramatically um that was I thing what we what was that question before I actually meant to talk about like stress and things like that but you know it's um um you know it's very true that you know that uh hormones can get better but also stress and these sorts of things can can affect all these things negatively getting better sleep all these things can can help you and get get um things working better in a number of different ways and um but also with with your testosterone and your hormones and stress and sleep are involved that as well and so when people address their sleep address their stress and start exercising doing you know vigorous Anor robic exercise uh they do better and their and and their testosterone levels get a lot better so I see that regularly people significantly improving their testosterone some people as much as doubling or even tripling their testosterone levels in uh in a number of months you know four to six months it's it's incredible absolutely incredible so that's G to that's going to affect things as well and so but yeah I can definitely effect and and sort of reverse out of these sort of creeping metabolic issues and um and then you see the results in a lot of different ways you know sort of uh the uh the you know retile dysfunction issues can can be sort of a Weather Vein of other things going on and um you sort of say like oh okay or like a canary in the coal mine that that's something that gets affected first and so that's getting better because a lot of other things are getting better too so glad to hear that glad that that the wife is uh is pleased so it's great uh cyprien thank you for the Super Chat hi four months carnivore and my boo smells like Tallow and butter how long will this last it's bothering me girlfriend says she can't smell it but I can um you know I mean Tallow and butter aren't all that offensive you know it may be that you you smell differently do remember too that when your hormones change your your odor will change too your pheromones change your body odor changes uh when your testosterone level goes up your body odor will change and so uh when and when you're charged up you actually secrete different uh pheromones and scents and things like that and so you're you're charged up either aggressively or sexually that actually changes your odor and so that can be a thing too it's not necessarily butter and Tallow it could be because your hormones are changing and that's affecting the way your body smells and so uh that's not necessarily A Bad Thing butter smells nice that's just my opinion but I'm not wrong and so I you know it may be different but it's it's probably not uh that much of an issue um some people have noticed that some people have noticed that you know they have a bit slightly different odors and changes in their in their own scense but that um it's not as it's well it's not it's not uh you know necessarily a bad thing you know because again your hormones could be changing and that that could be a sign of things improving um it's it's hard to say if that's going to change or not I don't know it's not something that that people typically go into and talk about not everybody really notices their own their own odor that much or that it's changed and so I don't I don't know if that's going to change too much if it's a hormonal issue and you're and you're stabilized your hor hormones probably will stay um but it might go away or might stay it's hard to say but um if uh you know if it's if it's not too much of a big deal I probably wouldn't worry about it it's just your body doing what your body's supposed to do and and so you know just it just sort of is what it is and I'm sorry that it bugs you but um doesn't sound like it's the worst thing ever you know if there some sort of horrible you know you know noxious ammonia sort of cat piss sort of smell like I can see the problem but but you know butter and Tallow you know it's pretty innocuous and um so you know hopefully it changes to to something that you're more that you're more uh comfortable with but you know if not then you just understand that this is just your body working and your hormones uh stabilizing and probably improving so that's actually probably a good sign that your your your body odor is changing because that means your body internally is changing as well and like very likely for the better so uh you know good luck with with all that wish you the best shuriken LM good to see you buddy I haven't talked to you in a while um thank you for the Super Chat as well uh Anthony is my case I went um in vacation and I and I screwed up very bad ate all the Forbidden foods and it sucks I'm sorry you don't have to apologize to me it's you're you're you know you're the one that's that's getting hurt by this you know not me um I I went back urgently to control my diabetes plus keep taking the pill for my heart valve too thank uh thanks to you Louis um Louise uh well look I'm glad you're back on it you know these these sorts of things you just take them as a learning uh experience and so you know when you um when you uh slip up and you go on vacation and you do that just see how it affects you you know if if you go in and you know if you're you're eating all this sort of stuff and it's just like yeah I actually feel fine I feel great well look at that you know that's fine it's not going to happen though you're going to feel worse and you're going to notice it and when you when you see that contrast between you feeling really good and now you don't feel really good and you say like actually I don't like that I don't like not feeling that way I like feeling strong healthy energetic and and uh and significantly less pain and having much better blood blood sugar and diabetes control that's what I like that's what I want uh it can you that can help motivate you in the future to stay stay uh on track and I mean that the thing people say well you need a lot of discipline for that like well you know first maybe you know it's a very new way of eating and it's very different but if you understand the principles you understand why you're doing it it's a lot easier because you're just like yeah I'm not going to eat that crap um and then when you get going with it and you see that contrast and you have those experiences when you do go back and say oh maybe I'll try this and you see just how negatively affects you then it can it can really really really help you move forward because you have don't no interest in doing that again so look at that time when you were eating that stuff see how you felt see how long it took you to get out of feeling like that and get back to feeling good again and how how much it affected your diabetes negatively and how long it took to normalize that and get back to where you were before and then you just look at that and you just go like okay yeah I'm I'm not doing that again I have no interest in doing that that's where I'm at I have no interest in eating any of this garbage because it is garbage and it's just not going in my body you know it's the whole idea of you know body's a temple and you should you should really respect that more than anything it's true you you you are your body this is this is you we think of ourselves as detached conscious mind but we are not we are part of this body this living flesh and so whatever spiritual connotations people want to draw we are of this flesh and this is our body and if you want to spend your entire life in pain and suffering uh that's your business but I have no interest in doing that and so I'm not going to put anything in my body that's not going to benefit me or my body because I am my body this is me and so no interest no interest whatsoever in any of that stuff and so you know the longer you go with it and you see those contrasts you just keep reinforcing that it's like no interest in doing any of that crap and you'll do fine you know don't worry about it you know I'm not mad at you you're not kicked out of the club it's totally fine just when you have a slip up like that you just get back on straight away and uh and you'll be fine hopefully you're doing doing well it's good to see you it's been a while okay Nicholas green thank you very much for the super chat um let's see here do you need a multivitamin on Carnivore I've just been taking uh the off-the-shelf Costco multivitamin gummies for years not sure if I should stop or not been carnivore for only 5 weeks um so not the gummies don't don't do the gummies um you don't want the sugar you don't want the artificial sweeteners or whatever the hell else you know red 40 or whatever the hell else they they put in there that is just not fit for human consumption um you if you want to take a multivitamin you could some of these things are better than others some of these things are not really bioavailable so they say they have iron but there like iron filings you know it's like that's useless and uh other other things like that so when you're starting a carnivore diet most people are pretty deficient you've been taking multivitamins for years so whatever's in that multivitamin that you're actually extracting is actually bioavailable you're probably fine you know so uh you probably don't need to continue that I wouldn't do the gummies if you were going to take supplements you might take something specific to what you're deficient in so you get checked you check your B12 your folate your folate your um zinc magnesium vitamin D and um uh and then you just see if you're low on these sorts of things maybe you take those if you're really low on vitamin B12 you get a you get a you you take a supplement for that either under the tongue or an injection because some people have absorption issues they can't they can't absorb B12 due to pentious anemos and autoimmune condition it's much more common than people realize and um so so you just you just take those if you need them it most people are deficient and so the reference range ranges is is way too low so you want to be on the upper end of the reference range for these nutrients or above if you're if you're if you're normal for B12 I can guarantee you you're low because you don't want everyone's low and so the reference range is too low so I would uh just check just take a look and at the end of the day you know just add in a bit of liver you know if you're if you're really deficient in these things liver is Nature's multivitamin it's just it's there's nothing more bioavailable and access than the nutrients that found in in liver and so tons of B12 tons of folate tons of other sorts of things they're absolutely exceptional uh nutrients and they're very bioavailable so if you are deficient and most people are when they first start out you know add in a bit of liver just you know a few ounces you know 50 grams whatever you know just a day just do that for a few weeks and then you know bang it down to you know three days a week whatever and then check six months down the road see where you're at if you still need to have a bit of liver maybe you're just you know the meat that you're getting isn't as good as as grass-fed and finished Mammoth and so you know you need a bit more help with it and and organs are great for that you don't need much and most people don't need any it just takes longer it takes longer to get up there and you know maybe you won't quite get up into that optimal level without the organs so just check see how you go but you know eating just meat is is going to be way more nutritious than anything else you've ever eaten so you're going to improve you're already going to improve um it's just going to be faster if you add in a bit of organs and uh and if you're really deficient in in something then you could take that supplement but you may not be you know if those if those multivitamins are any good U the ones from Costco if they're bioavailable at all then uh you're probably fine if you were taking a multivitamin and drinking with coffee probably didn't absorb any of it at all ever um if you're eating it with a bunch of plants probably didn't absorb as much of it and uh if you're just taking it on its own on empty stomach maybe if if they were bioavailable You' probably be fine so just check you know most people don't need to just eat meat fatty meat till it stops tasting good if you're really deficient you add in some organs or take a dedicated supplement early on and then perpetuate that just with your diet but eventually you'll catch up unless you're like if you're really deficient then get out of the deficiency like you don't that's not safe to be at at so low that you're deficient you know if you're under 4 or 540 in America or you're under 400 anywhere else that's a real deficiency of B12 and you can actually get brain damage and nerve damage and brain shrinkage as a result of that that's not safe to stay there get an injection take a sublingual B12 uh supplement just get that and start eating liver just get the hell out of that situation and then check yourself for pernicious anemia um so because that's that's not safe to be at those levels other than that meat will get you there and it'll maintain you there bit of organs put you over the top so uh that's my advice on supplements Bachelor Jr thank you for the Super Chat well my life has changed I'm sitting here watching you cutting up a shoulder yeah well that's good well I'm glad to hear that I hope I hope you're doing well with it and I hope that um and I hope you feel great and just just keep going on in great health so thanks for thanks for sharing with that so right cantaloupe uh thank you for the Super Chat two weeks no appetite till lunch then indigestion so yeah look your your your hunger signals are going to be very different you know so you're gonna have to relearn that and um and you don't eat just because you have food in front of you you eat until it stops tasting good you listen to your body you start eating meat it starts going like yeah no that's all I want you stop there so even if you have more in your plate or in your your your lunchbox if your mom sent you to school with a lunchbox which is people used to do then um then you know you just leave it you just save it for later it's it's not that big a deal again you can have these psychosomatic sort of responses where we say like oh meat's bad oh Fat's bad oh god oh no like what the hell are you doing this is bad for you I had that even though I knew for a cold Frozen fat the fat was good for me and that that I needed to eat more of it and I shouldn't be afraid of it it still gave me that visceral response like no hold on a second we just spent the last 40 years avoiding this what the hell are you doing and and um so you just you just recondition yourself so ease into it uh and you'll be fine um you know if you if you just need a little bit at lunch fine if you're getting indigestion after lunch don't necessarily need to eat just drink some water and U you have you know dinner at the end of the day you'll be hungry um if it's an indigestion or or upset stomach because of that condition response it just you just have to ease into it and eventually that will go away and you'll be fine so just just take it easy and listen to your body cyprien thank you very much for the super chat um in a vicious cycle of carnivore six days and then having carbs can't help myself um it's very hard for me this coming from a man that did a 40-day water fast two years ago before my S sinus carcinoma treatment well you can always start with that you know you can you I don't recommend this typically but if that's going to help you get through the carb craving times you know maybe uh maybe that's what you do you just just don't eat anything for two weeks uh but uh that's not typically something I would recommend for people just remember that that the carb Cravings generally do go away after about two weeks right the addiction side of things go away and then it's just a matter of well I remember that that tasted good and then you just don't eat it if you are getting carb Cravens you're almost certainly hungry and you're not eating enough meat you're not eating enough fat and you just need to eat more more so if you get cravings and your body wants carbs and says oo that pizza looks good that bread looks good say okay I'm hungry so eat but eat meat eat fatty meat and if you can get through two weeks you can get through forever after that it's not it just goes away so just light at the end of the tunnel it's two weeks you've done 40 days so you'll be fine it's just the thing is if people thinking like oh my God I'm just going to have to deal with this forever screw it obviously that's not um uh you know that's not what you're going to be experiencing after two weeks you typically won't have very many carb Cravings unless you really are undereating significantly in the first two weeks you can get those carb Cravings but a lot of times it does have to do with Hunger because again our hunger signals are very different and we don't we don't um experience that the same way and so you just have to body has to tell you to eat somehow and so sometimes it's just like eat carbs eat sugar and that's how it how it tells you so eat a lot of fatty meat every day eat until you're full every time eat until it stops tasting good and then if you ever get you know the inclination to eat carbs just you know eat a lot of fat fatty meat until that goes away and uh it typically does and usually after two weeks you don't miss it and as long as you're eating enough you won't you won't have any problems with that so you know just remember light at the end of the tunnel you'll get there it's only two weeks it's not it's not that far you'll do fine Patrick Lee thank you very much for the super chat um hi Dr chaffy if we are true carnivores why does the taste of raw meat repulse many of us common vegan argument I think that's assuming a fact that's not an Evidence because raw meat does not repulse most of us you know we have know every Cuisine and every every culture has some sort of raw meat dish like Sashimi sushi steak tartar um steak Carpaccio in Italy um different sorts of uh uh dried Meats those are raw taste great who doesn't like beef jerky like get out of here and um and and those sorts of things so and what about all the people that like uh their meat cooked rare or medium rare that's what that's what raw meat tastes like by the way it's just rare uh rare is raw and uh it's delicious actually so you sear the outside insides insides Raw seared ai ai Sashimi the raw meat tastes fantastic actually and um uh and and even herbivores eat raw meat when they have it available um opportunistically so like horses well I've seen horses I've I have um a video of this on on my saved stories on like carnivores or something like that and um uh like the first one on there is like a horse eating a a baby chicken it was is pretty pretty jarring you know to watch that and then the mom chicken gets pissed off and Flaps in its face but just just crunched up this little baby chicken just okay just chew that up I've seen elk eat rabbits right that was weird they don't have the right teeth so it's just like chewing incessantly at it and there's this this these dead legs just flopping underneath their mouth it's it's it's it's a bit upsetting and like even the other elk that were there there was a video of it even the other elk were upset watching it there's like the the like the bull elk was looking at like like staring at this this um the cow elk eat this thing it's just chewing it up and is just like what the hell are you doing Martha and um you know but she was just munching away and just really enjoying it and I've seen I've seen them eat my sister tells me all the time you know there a lot of milk by their house in Washington state and um and you know they eat little ducklings and other little animals all the time she was just like yeah that was weird didn't never never knew that um so pretty much everything likes raw meat and we're no exception you know people people get used to cooking meat and all these sorts of things and we're told since birth that raw meat have an infection and it'll have you know bacteria and you get food poisoning you'll get parasites and all that sort of stuff people oh no no I don't want that that's psychosomatic I typically eat very raw meat you know I I sear the outside and leave the inside Raw does not like that and so you know we we cook different steaks but it's um that's that's how my tastes run and I absolutely eating raw steak absolutely where I get home and I'm just like really want something and I'm like waiting for the pan to heat up I'm like no screw this and I just e eating half the steak raw out of the fridge uh while I'm waiting for the pan to heat up and I cook the rest and you know take my you know my time with that enjoyed a bit more um so no raw meat tastes great try it it's it's it's perfectly fine um but uh you know in fact like you know raw fish tastes way better than cooked fish I mean think of the difference between you know seared AI or you know AI tuna or sashimi and a can of tuna it's the same it's the same animal right it's tuna and one tastes amazing it's delicate and flavorful and the other is uh like chewing on like cardboard it's disgusting you have to mix it up with you know like butter or some sort of fat just to get it some sort of flavor that's palatable and uh so yeah no it's total totally bad argument I mean they may not like the idea of eating raw meat that doesn't actually mean it tastes objectively bad it tastes objectively amazing and a lot of people eat raw meat so they're dumb uh but yeah I mean look at look at the inway they they e raw meat all the time you know and um and then nette and all these sorts of people a whole bunch of cultures do this like I like we already said there's already there's already already a ton of different different sorts of dishes in in every culture that they incorporate raw meat so you know locks you know what do you think smoked salmon is that's raw you know so uh yeah no so that's that's that's easily easily uh you debunked so ripe cantaloupe thank you very much for the Super Chat looks like the question is down here um and they say my question is I'm only eating once a day because I'm not hungry otherwise is that okay uh also I've been experiencing indigestion like symptoms with burping is this normal I've been lying for two weeks so eating once a day is is definitely is fine do remember that your hunger signals do change and they're much more subtle and so maybe you are hungry you're just not realizing it so eat H fatty meat until it stops tasting good if that if once a day is fine then that's fine if you're feeling a bit off or a bit weird or H don't really know what's going on there or you're getting carb Cravings or like something else besides me is looking good or a steak sounds really good ask yourself am I hungry right now try eating meat and if it tastes good then you're hungry keep eating until it stops tasting good and and just go on like that um getting a bit of indigestion and sometimes you can get some uh again that psychosomatic sort of upset stomach because you're eating something that you're not used to and you're and you're doing it in a way that your your body's not used to and so you just need to ease into that the burping side of things I've seen that a couple times times I don't really know why that is it typically goes away um just see how you go and hopefully everything just sort of settles down and um doesn't cause a problem but um you know the you've been doing this for two weeks which is great you're just about to get into like the really exciting time where your body starts working so much better and you start shredding fat stacking on muscle if you're especially if you're working out and you just start feeling better and better and better and better and better some people are a bit more Slow Burn on their weight loss or fat loss I should say um but but typically people lose a lot of weight even early on and they just feel a lot better anyway some people who you know because one reason their leptin is very elevated their fasting insulin's very elevated their all of this means their metabolism is very depressed it's it may take a little longer some people snap right back and their bodies recover and they lose a lot of weight really quickly and others it takes longer so uh either way just just keep going with it you're just about to get in that time where you're just starting better and better and better and better and better so I'm really excited for you because that's a very exciting time I remember that time that was my favorite time because I just felt it so good and it was just really exciting to see how much better I could get as I went um but yeah if you only need to eat once a week then you only need to eat or once a day then you only need to eat once a day just listen to your body eat more often if it's telling you to and uh and try to relearn your hunger signals because they can they can be very subtle and you it's very easy to undereat on a a carnivore diet so at least try to eat once a day if that first bite tastes like cardboard fine you don't need to eat that day but at least try once a day and uh and you'll be fine two three times a day it's perfectly fine too if that's what your body is telling you to do good luck hey everyone if you need a little extra help getting started on a carnivore diet and my online resources that I have for free aren't enough for you you can go to www.how to carnivore docomond carnivore challenge where you'll have online resources group support weekly Zoom meetings as well as the ability to chat live with myself Simon Lewis and the others in the challenge who can help you and support you and give you extra advice and help you along the way so that sounds like something that would be beneficial to you then please go to howto carnivore docomo your plants are trying to kill you message uh in an old book I read that a few fermented vegetables have probiotics do those also have toxins and is it best to avoid them they do have toxins the fermentation process does lower the toxic load and increase the bioavailability of the nutrients so that's better uh it's still optimal to avoid them though I would say if you're trying to get them for that probiotic purpose fine but remember that you when you establish a microbiome that's healthy you will perpetuate it with the meat that get you're eating and so you don't need to continue doing that there are also probiotics in live culture fermented dairy so you're can have fermented dairy as opposed to fermented vegetables that's what I would personally do that's what I've personally done I don't use ferments at all uh to any great extent not not plants anyway I do have occasional yogurt but it's but I I do it in the same way that my friend Dr shanara would do with recommend with other prob fermented vegetable probiotics which is little tiny bit put on meat chewed up together in the same bite so you're mixing that stuff into the meat so that you swallow that down and the bacteria survive your stomach acid which is you if you're just eating it straight probably won't happen and so when you do that um you can get that bacteria past the guard of your stomach acid and get that into your lower intestine where it's supposed to be and but once you have it established there it's established you don't need to keep you know you know planting crops they just keep going they keep they're they're they're you know uh they're plants that just keep keep growing and growing and growing so um they're you know not they're not like the the wheat that just like grows and dies and grows and dies you have to keep replanting them um you know these these will perpetuate themselves if you're just eating properly so and a lot of people don't use probiotics and they have excellent microbiomes so but the the fermentation um process does lower the toxic load yes um and those probiotics are fine you know if you need so you had antibiotics or something like that yeah maybe have some of those things I wouldn't take probiotics from the from the store because those have been shown to be pretty useless and so you know if either do it with fermented vegetables but I would really stick to fermented dairy that's what I stick with and um you not that I've had to take antibiotics uh in a very long time but uh that's something that people typically do is take is have a bit of yogurt uh for a week or two after they take antibiotics and that can just sort of replenish their gut microbiome and uh be be pretty healthy so that's uh that's what I do but then eventually you're just going to have an established microbiome and your meat's going to perpetuate that just like the Inuit they um they just have very healthy microbiomes and uh and so that just gets perpetuated also your oral biome changes and so that bacteria is going to get seeded into the meat and then swallow with each bite so if you have healthy oral biome that can give you healthy gut biome it's just when we're eating a bunch of plants and carbs and things like that you actually don't have very healthy oral uh oral microbes and so those aren't necessarily seeding the right microbes down to your gut as well so you know those sorts of things probably a good idea but uh but not in our case and certainly not long term I don't think you need them Leah ller thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat I appreciate it um brand new carnivore from Texas with uh with questions first your thoughts on fasting to help us lose skin from weight loss I have heard it's important I don't necessarily think it's that important I don't think you necessarily have to to um to fast at all um I haven't seen one way of the other on on fasting helping uh skin loose skin um people have fasted and their skin has you shrunk there's you know famous guy famous story in the UK where a guy I think in Scotland was very overweight and he just basically stopped eating for over a year and just drank water and took a multivitamin every day and he lost all this weight and he walked to work every day and just lost all this weight and it was very skinny and the skin came down with him now you can do that if you lose a lot of weight your skin will come down but if you gain it back up and then lose it and you gain it and you lose it and you gain it and you lose it after about the third fourth time the Integrity of your skin and elasticity just sort of gives up and so it just depends on where you are with that but um if you are if you are just eating the proper amount of protein and fat and all these sorts of things and eating the right things that should stimulate the the skin to come down as well um I you know people probably talking about like oh you need to fast for autophagy and this is going to break down the cells that is that is a really big reach um on what autophagy is for and does and also how it comes about because you get autophagy just from not eating carbs when your insulin goes down autophagy goes on and so it's insulin that blocks autophagy and so when you fast yes you go through autophagy because your insulin is coming down not because you're starving yourself and your body's trying to eat things your body eats the fat your body runs on fat that's what it runs on when you're fast and or when you're starving and um it's not just going around because it's it's breaking down the mitochondria and it's replacing them and increasing their number so it's not looking around Scavenging for materials you know it's it's it's making new things it's making new mitochondria it's making new cells and so no that's not what's happening there so I don't think you need to fast if you if you are going and you're on a carnivore for several months and and um and you're not really getting the results that you want you want to try fasting for periods of time go for it but uh I don't typically recommend it and I don't think it's necessary in this case um two will carnivore help nail skin and hair Health my nails are not in great shape yes absolutely it absolutely helps um all of those and a lot of people find that it's it's really really beneficial uh especially with skin and nails and hair the one caveat to that is that some people find when they go on to any ketogenic diet you have this metabolic State change it can actually trigger a Fallout phase in your hair and so you can lose a bit of hair it's very much more noticeable for women especially because hair is longer and so you squeezing your ponytail it's just like like oh that's not as thick anymore you're seeing it in the drain and all these sorts of things and you're like you know it's like a wook you took a bath in your in your tub or something like that and you're just like well this is this isn't good and um you know so it's uh it's it's temporary though so it triggers a Fallout phase it's not that the hair is dying it's that it's a Fallout phase and they actually typically grow back and they typically grow back thicker and so it's not necessarily you get more hairs but the hairs that grow back are thicker and so it looks thicker and Fuller as well and so you know that's something that a lot of people experience as well so just be mindful of that because some people do experience that do make sure that you have all your nutrients right so you check your B12 and your folate and your zinc magnesium and d and thyroid thyroid is a is a when people have thyroid dysfunction you know that's a very common cause of of having hair sort of fall out and not be supported you need you need thyroid for every single cell in your body and you need your thyroid hormone for every cell in your body and so I would uh you know just check those things if people are experiencing hair loss you just check your Bloods you check your thyroid you check all those sorts of things as long as those things are okay and everything's great like okay it's just a Fallout phase it'll come back um keep an eye on it and you'll see and your your hair stylist your Barber will look at it and be like yeah you know there's there's little hairs growing up and you have a whole bunch of these things takes a while for women to to grow back they do come back by and large so uh and yes your your hair skin and nails get a lot more healthy put Tallow on your skin probably the best thing you'll ever put on your skin is beef Tallow just straight up cooking Tallow unused cooking Tallow you know just scrape it out of a pan and um and just put it on your skin you your skin will never look better or or be healthier than if you use T on your skin good luck uh Rob thank you for the Super Chat looks like there's a u no question attached maybe down below Leah has a follow-up question though uh so thank you Leah followup question why is ruminant meat better than meat like fowl or poultry any meat that's wild that's eating its natural diets great but most animals that we buy from the store are not and they're not being fed their natural diet and so ruminant meat have a complex four barrel chambered stomach stomach and so they are going to ferment this food before they digest it and absorb it right so or as part of their digestion they're going to ferment it and then so they're going to ferment it before they absorb it fowl poultry pigs fish they're monogastrics like us they only have one stomach they don't ferment it before they absorb it and so the if they're being fed a bunch of plants that have plant toxins that they're not actually designed to eat they're not going to be able to detoxify those things as well and so it has to go into their body first and then their liver tries to detoxify this stuff but this stuff gets stored in the fat especially like in the like lenol acid much higher linolic acid levels and and they can um just build up it's not going to be as bad as eating the plant it is filtering out a lot of this garbage and getting out a lot of the nutrients but some of that stuff builds up up and so that's that's the main reason why so it's more nutrient dense it's also uh less uh has less of a toxic load and typically even when a ruminant animal is eating grains and other garbage that it's not supposed to eat either it's it's going to bring less of those toxins in it's not necess going to be as nutritious because it's not going to have all the nutrients that it needs which is from grass but it's going to be a lot better than the other ones and so it just depends on what your access is to it but you know a lot of people that don't need to worry about that you know it's typically for people with autoimmunity they have to be careful about non- ruminant meat I feel the best on ruminant meat beef in particular that's just how I feel the best but uh eat whatever meat that tastes good to you eggs all that sort of stuff pasture raise is always going to be better you know regeneratively raised you know eating its natural diet is always going to be better for you and the animal and so you know we vote with with our pocketbook and if you don't like how animals being treated in production Farms um then then don't then don't buy them don't support that sort of uh practice and it's better for you anyway it's more it's more uh nutritious however not everyone can afford to to make those um to make that differentiation and so don't Brak the bank on this you know just eat the meat that you enjoy that makes you feel good and that you have access to and can afford and um but yeah but that's why r at me is typically uh better I feel best on it anyway and um I think um I was talking about the the horses and El eating ducklings and uh no not the ducklings yeah I know it's very it was very sad his sister wasn't happy about it um but um yeah it happens so so animals animals eat other animals animal animals eat other things all animals are heterotrophs and so they have to eat something else something else has to die for for them to live and carnivores as well as herbivores and herbivores while they can turn plant tissue into animal tissue and turn it into fat and protein by way of their microbiome um they will still go after the easy the easy solution of a little duckling or meat or something like that and um because it's much more bioavailable and that that's what they're going for they're going for yep that's what I want you know I need I need meat I'm going to make meat in fact there were some cows that sort of a creepy story and pretty sad because the these cows were sort of kept in a pen and um you know ran out of you know food and forage and uh and they were just basically abused and so they were they were sort of locked in maybe you know whatever I don't know if it was you know sort of a barn enclosure or if it was out in a padic and they just didn't have nearly enough grass and didn't get get fed hay or anything like that um but either way they started dying and some of the cows started dying and I read this story about and they were very they were very subtle about it but they said that um that the cows that started dying off and then the only way for the other cows to survive was to turn to uh animal Source nutrition and so they started eating animal Source nutrition in order to survive and then they were eventually rescued and um but as a result they had a taste for meat and so you know what animal Source food is there right it's the dead cow that that you know died next to them and and there I don't know how their teeth got through the skin or whatever maybe had to rot a bit first before they could sort of tear it apart but basically they were eating the the other cows that had died you know sort of like that story of alive where you people you know crashed in the Andes and and um had to had to eat each other you know the people that died in the pl crash to to survive for the next nine months until they were rescued and um so the cows did that that and not only did they do that and survive and do just fine um they put you know bone meal and then blood and things like that into the feed for cows actually from the process broken down cows you use every single scrap of every animal that's process we oh well indigenous populations they would use these things they use every piece of it now we just waste it we don't actually that's money and so that gets used in fertilizer that gets used in feed and so you know cows typically eat you know uh get fed you know meat and things like that in their feed when they're in in sort of the feed lot because grain is not very nutritious it just makes you fat and that's why they feed it to animals that's why they feed it to us and um also because it's very profitable um and so you know same thing that happens to the cow is GNA happen to us they're going to make the cow fat it's going to make you fat like just use your brain and um and so these cows and now they had it taste for meat now they wouldn't eat feed they wouldn't do it and so they got rescued and they got taken out to another farm and they would not eat grass they wouldn't eat hay they were like no no I want beef now that's the good stuff that's what we want and so I had to start feeding it they had to keep feeding them um you know animal animal uh nutrition don't know what the hell they were feeding them um but uh you know I don't know if they were giving them sort of like you know raw you know you know like you know dog food food cat food those sort of raw meat foods but um it's interesting anyway and uh you know um yeah so so that was that was interesting I don't know what the hell they fed the cows after that probably pretty expensive to feed a you know 800 PB cow or th000 pound cow uh you know meat all the time that's a lot that's a lot of that's a lot of meat to to feed something but that that's a normal thing everything eats meat meat is not bad for anything I can't think of a single animal on Earth that uh is does not do well eating meat not even herb Wars and I would I would you know if anyone knows of any you know please let us know but you know barring eating like a poison Sack or you know an organ that's like chalk full of vitamin A or something like that but actual meat from another animal like is that bad for any other animal I would I can't think of a single one 70% of animal species are carnivores and even herbivores opportunistically eat meat when they can and and others are omnivorous so they're eating meat and they're eating plants meat is not bad for anything because it doesn't need to be plants are bad for nearly everything because they have to be so that's the difference and so when people keep telling you that meat's bad for you just tell them to shut up I mean it's just just don't even engage be like look this nonsense it's a tired ass argument it's clearly untrue moving on okay so Rob found this from Rob so Rob's question thank you you again Rob for the Super Chat Rob says on Carnivore for two years just diagnosed with Atri fibrillation and on um cazam and eloquest can I continue carnivore one 100% you can continue carnivore you can continue carnivore uh at really for any any medical issue in fact they help most medical issues uh so no you don't have to stop this in fact you know once you have something you know that you're you're treating you're dealing with it just it just helps you be healthier and uh in general and that's obviously what you want when you are dealing with any sort of health issue so adri fibrillation is just you know an irregularity of the heart and you go on medications to try to keep that more regular and the elois is to stop you from clotting because you can build up blood clots in the heart and that can send off you get massive strokes and things like that and so that's really dangerous so you know continue taking everything you as per uh as per your doctor for the aib and yeah absolutely you can definitely keep uh doing a cornivore diet um and uh you know and see how you go you know and and hopefully this is something that you know doesn't bother you and you know there are more definitive treatments there are oblations you can there's an atrial appendage sort of like size of your tip of your thumb and that's uh and that's what where this clot generally builds up so sometimes they'll ablate that and they just just shut that off and so you don't have anywhere for that to go through even with atal fibrillation you're not going to build up the clots like um like the like other people would with that that atrial appendage sitting there and and then quite often people are doing you know ablations and things like that and they they they don't have atrial fibrillation anymore um so you know I know a lot of people that do that very common and they can uh sometimes come off their medications because of that but you know it's a procedure things go wrong it is life-threatening it's very uncommon that that happens but it's uh in the literature it's I think few years ago six years ago when I was looking at it it was like less than 2% and obviously that's user dependent and so you can have some people that that have done th 2,000 5,000 of these procedures and they haven't had any fatal comp um complications or one or two obviously their ratios are a lot better those are the people you go to um or if the medications you're just doing their thing you know don't worry about it but yes you 100% can keep doing carnivore then one passive Marty dearo uh thank you very much for the super sticker that's that's very kind of you um and um uh there's some more Super stickers down here as well and so uh Eve thank you very much for the super sticker as well thank you for watching I appreciate it um and uh Hima esposa uh thank you for very very generous Super Chat thank you so much for that or super sticker that's very very kind of you thank you very much I appreciate you coming on and carnivore Clarity great to see you and thank you very much for the super sticker um there was another sort of question or two we're sort of done on the the Super Chat it's probably good timing because I have have to go soon um but there's there was one question sort of popped up here that might is probably worth worth addressing and it's from Becca FX which is is there a way for someone on human dialysis to get into key h ketosis on Carnivore can carnivore actually help in this case does anyone know thanks uh yes you can you can absolutely do carnivore or or keto on um with on hemodialysis uh probably even better too because this is something that can support your your renal health and and you're getting rid of all these plant toxins such as oxalates but there are many others that directly damage the kidney so you're getting those away and in fact Studies have shown that higher protein Di actually improve kidney function um so you you hear people like like I mentioned zero carb health and zeroing it on health uh earlier in the in the uh episode they you go there you look up dialysis go on their search Chat goes back 15 years 20 years some of this stuff and or so and um I don't know exactly how long they've been going on but a long time they've been going on a long time and you look at some of these things and and you look up dialysis or kidney failure all these sorts of things you will see tons of people who improve kidney failure absolutely I mean I've seen people with CKD four and five completely reverse it just get back to more or less normal kidney function within a matter of months by going on strict meat and water especially red meat in water and even some people not as strict I had one friend of mine who was ckd5 he was he was nearing having to go on dialysis and and he was 35 and he's just like I'm not gonna see my daughter graduate high school you know and so he went on that but he still had some like um avocados and meat which I probably wouldn't have done the avocados because they're high in oxalates and when you pick them green which every avocado you buy from the store is going to be picked green and then ripened in the store or at your house um it's usually like a block of wood by the time you get them at the store still and uh and so they're even more they have four times the number of oxalates when they're picked green uh even if they ripen after that so you know even then he uh he he got up to he completely reversed it um and um and uh and so you know it's um uh very very uh common that people have improved improved their kidney function like just all the time if you drink enough water especially you know people with normal kidney function will just improve their kidney function especially when they're going on a carnivore diet you can definitely do that on on dialysis will it make them come off dysis unlikely you know this is not many things have ever done that in fact nothing is really ever done that I've seen three and there's ones is a work in progress I don't work with people on dialysis all the time but of the people I've spoken to I've seen a couple of them on that zero carb health and zeroing in on health Facebook group so look at that maybe that's been update maybe there's been more since then um there's one lady who the first one I saw was on there and I've SE I've seen people since then that I've spoken to and this lady in particular she said she did it for nine months and her doctor's like you're going to kill yourself you're going to kill yourself but she's just like my kidneys already don't work I'm already on dialysis like they're not going to get more dysfunctional than this I already need a transplant but she was just like no this is the right thing for me I'm going to do it and after nine months she came off dialysis that's that does not happen any other way that has never happened any other way that I know of um and there's and there's a uh young man I'm I'm uh friends with now and he's on dialysis unfortunately he was vegan for a long time it just destroyed his body destroyed his neurology you know he was one of these guys probably has B12 was so low that um that he got neurological dysfunction and that's the thing a lot of V oh my B12 fine like I bet you it's not because the reference range is is lowed down because so many people are deficient and anything under 400 or 540 in America can get cause nerve damage and so these people like oh yeah you know uh the r rang is 130 to to 540 in the UK or 600 here and 700 in some places um 7 750 and one one uh place I saw here but they go down to 130 right that's not normal and so you're in that you're like oh yeah I'm normal it's fine no it's not like you are getting nerve damage you're getting brain damage from this stuff so unfortunately this this young man was in that category and destroyed his kidneys vegan died destroyed his kidneys destroyed his uh neurological structure in fact he couldn't get out of bed he couldn't he stopped being able to use his phone he's so neurologically impaired and that's when he realized my D is killing me and unfortunately he's still on dialysis but he's making more urine so he's not completely you know he does still make urine it's just a little bit but now he's making more and more and more and he's actually getting um you know better they test you every time before you get dialysis and before you do all these sorts of things so he's actually is improving is it going to be enough is he going to be able to get off dialysis and and avoid a kidney transplant I don't know he's going to give it a year hopefully it does um is it going to get other people improvements it's going to improve but is it going to um is it going to um is it going to come back to the point that uh you're going to that you're going to to be able to get off um uh dialysis I don't know but it's it's definitely worth a shot uh to look at that so good luck with that there's a comment from from my sister rosin she said uh our great-grandfather ate his steak so rare his anesthesiologist accused him of being a cannibal uh when they were at dinner together and did not end well for the anesthesiologist that's true so you know the pranks you know probably a family trait um but you know going back to the the question people had with uh you know why doesn't raw meat taste good like it does taste good people people commonly eat raw rare meat and it's delicious and so uh but also we've been cooking meat for 800,000 years at least 1.5 million years more likely and possibly even more than that over two million years so we've been cooking meat for a very very long time we don't need to enjoy the taste of raw meat because we weren't eating raw meat in the wild for the last 1.5 million years or more since H sapiens have walked this Earth we've been cooking meat right since we've been breathing air and drinking water we've been cooking meat and so we don't have to enjoy the taste of raw meat and yet we do so you know the vegans uh are not winning any any points with that one um but yeah so my our great-grandfather he was a surgeon and he was actually very interesting guy he was the the youngest ever graduate from Columbia Medical School um ever to date he was um it was a sixe program at the time and he uh started at 16 so he started early and he finished early so he finished a six-year program in four years starting at 16 so he's only 20 years old and New York state law at the time was you wern't a able to start your residency until you're 21 and there goes the idea that everyone died in their 30s because you couldn't even start your residency in 21 and people had professions and degrees that took a lot longer than that you get your PhD at 30 and then you die two years later it's like kind of a waste of time at that point wasn't it um so you know just tell those people they're idiots but so he U he was on the on the on the the very beginnings of modern surgery because he was the second class at Columbia Medical School ever taught sterile practice you know that you should wash your hands right before you do surgery that was not a thing people didn't realize that and so in infections were rampant in surgeries and it wasn't it wasn't ethical to open the abdomen or open the thorax or open the abdomen open the thorax you you chopping off limbs doing this but there were other things that you did and U so this was on on the ground floor of being able to actually do anything because anesthesia was invented in the 1880s like mid 18 I think it's like 1885 or something like that mid to late 1880s and that's right after he went to medical school so he he graduated sort of when was that that would have been um in the in the early 1890s that he graduated I I have his diploma from uh Columbia and um his medical New York medical license he's also the 13th medical license the state of California ever gave out lucky number 13 and he um and I have his diploma of finishing his um residency in in uh surgery at bellev hospital in New York and um and that was early 19 1890s she was right at the beginning of that so you know he was like you know they were inventing seeing what you could do because it's the first time you could put someone to sleep and and and open the abdomen um safely and not get horrible infections so very very interesting so he's doing a lot of surgeries he like they have Striker or you know um metronics or anything like that in these places that would like make a whole bunch of utensils for us to use as surgeons and just uh and just repeat other people's surgeries he had to invent his own uh tools and I still have some of these things so he he would design his own things he had a forge at his house like his dad was a badass that's that's a whole other thing um that that's probably too long of a story to get into but that his dad was just an Stone Cold badass and taught him and his brothers out to be badasses too and so he could he would work a forge he could work metal and and um you know he's a he's an Ivy League surgeon and he's he's out in the Forge you know doing work like a man and he would make his own tools and I I still have some of these things that he made for different surgeries he would think of what he could do and then was like okay I'm going to make this tool for that and then he would make it and he bring it in and use it pretty badass so he was with his an anesthesiologist one day and uh they were at dinner and it was this very raw steak he oh that's just bleeding like a cannibal it's just just disgusting and he was just like all right and my great-grandfather was like he did not accept um uh slights and manner like he that was unacceptable to him and so he's just like all right and he like but you know the guy was the guy's guy was marked and so um and so he uh what he did was he he basically set him up and so he started back then every you know because they didn't have cautery you know they didn't have like you know um you know the electric Coty that we use now you make the skin incision with a with a scalpel but then the rest of it you're doing dissections with cautery so it just it cauterizes and burns the little vessels and um you bipolar and things like that burn these vessels and separate them things like that there's bleeding there it's much less and so for you have to slowly dissect down slowly dissect down tie off arteries and veins and things like that you just be tying these things off tying these things off tying these things off all the way down and it was just it was a lot of blood so people would lose a lot of blood and you always have to give transfusions always have to give transfusions and so they had they would have a a refrigerator full of blood and it was just like these little like glass canisters um that they would sort of hang up and stick in and they just give blood and give blood and give blood and that was very typical typical way of doing things because you just had to and you had you didn't call down to the blood bank and get things you know cross matched and this and that you just you had blood there you got it you brought it over because you needed a lot of it for most surgeries and so he started using like different sorts of things you getting tomato juice and like werer sauce and this and that and and he started like mixing this stuff and like red wine I think was like the base and making it you know bit thicker and this and the other and he and he would would play around with this until he got it the the the appearance and texture and consistency and viscosity of blood and but it was all you know household items right and so he finally did this and he and he he got one of these things and and put it in one of these blood bottles and he put it in there and he just said and he's pointed to said to the nurses don't touch this one just leave that one alone that one's that one's for um uh you know Dr power right that's just that's for me don't touch it and so uh you know after you know they they would operate in the morning they didn't have like big electric lights and things like that I mean this is the late 1800s early 1900s right so they would operate on the top floor of of a hospital and they'd have these big open Skylight so that just this natural light would come in so they had to start first thing in the morning that's why surgery starts first bloody thing in the morning is taken over from that um and so it's with Dawn you had to be there ready to go when that sun came up so you could actually see properly and then you were Dawn a dusk that's when you were operating and so you um so he was just at the end of it he was just like he was there talking to he man I I am par I'm just wasted I I really need to pick me up and he walked over to this cabinet with to the blood thing and he he pulled out his his uh his blood canister he just popped it open and he just like drank it he just drank the whole thing down and see y'all just saw that and act just blacked out just fainted and passed out on the floor like just like learn not to not to mess with uh my great-grandfather so that was um that was pretty funny so that's the story they're talking about and yeah people do just fine with raw meat the Messi drink raw blood they they do cook the meat too but they also can eat it raw it's it's not uncommon uh that people do that so okay so that's that I need to get to work and um and see patience but thank you all very much for coming on thank you everyone for the super chats and the super stickers very very kind of you and generous and a lot of good questions today and people be nice to my sister and my Eloise and especially my mods they're doing a really good job and keeping everything uh working working well and people keep being polite that's the whole thing if you're polite there's no problem if you're going to be rude to people then then you know you're going to be putting time out I mean that's all there is to it so this is this is everyone to be cordial and in polite Society with adults and so if you're not acting that way then you're going to be put in timeout and that's that's all there is to it and you keep doing it you're going to be asked to leave and in fact you're going to be made to leave and I don't want to do that because I I want everyone to be welcome and to uh you know get a lot out of this but you know you can't you can't be rude to people you just it's not acceptable and um you know we can't necessarily control that in other parts of our lives but actually do have control over for this and so that's what we're going to do and so just be kind to each other be polite and uh thank you all very much and I will see you next time"
