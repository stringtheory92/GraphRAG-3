        "body": "okay hello everyone thank you for joining me for another YouTube live just back from America I was speaking at uh two different conferences there was a medical conference CME medical conference I was uh lecturing at in San Diego the Symposium for metabolic health and uh and then a carnivore conference convention up in Wyoming after that and then uh a lot of stuff in between and after uh pretty interesting news um there are a number of documentaries coming out uh a few that are on um you animal- based nutrition how that important that is and how that's been falsely vilified and and many others on specifically carnivore so the one that I was working on well two that I was working on in in um this trip um one was from an Australian um filmmaker named carolene who's a very nice lady and she's doing something on um how the benefits of being in ketosis and fasting and ketogenic diets and things like that um and obviously you know animal-based nutrition wraps up very um very well in that so there' be a lot of different people in that realm there and then another one that's spe specifically carnivore is one called animal very aptly named and uh that is um being done independently by um by someone who has just been very positively uh benefited by the carnivore diet and wants to get this out there to more people and so he's self-funding this and has gotten uh some um you know whole film crew together like a whole professional film crew together which is which is really uh exciting so we were uh filming for both of those and um so so do keep an eye out for those the animal one in particular I think people should keep an eye out for um in the coming months because they're going to have a website set up where people can actually give videotape themselves giving a testimony about their experience on a carnivore diet and what it's done for them you know weight loss uh reversing health issues coming off medications all these sorts of things I mean some people have really gotten their lives back and uh and we're on death's door some people and people in nursing homes and um not able to care for themselves dementia now they're back home living independently exercising working out in their 80s when before they were you know terminal dementia patients and Alzheimer's patients and that happens you know so you know if you have a particular story that's uh you know or just just normal like hey this just really changed your life and you're feeling so much better and you've had chronic pain and fibromyalgia and weren't able to function all these sorts of things and this gave you your life back those are really powerful stories and messages that that would be great additions to projects like this and so they're going to put out a um uh links and on their website they're going to have a way that you can submit your video testimonials and they're going to put it so as they're rolling the end credits they're going to start rolling these through and people just popping up you know giving their giving their experience with this so I think that's a really important one to um to look at and uh and so people keep an eye out for that and um and maybe be a part of that I also want to uh thank my friend chrisopher brandland um from brandland law.com uh who is helping me uh patent and copyright protect my videos on YouTube and my podcast in general um people may know that there's a a fake book out there that's being sold on Amazon and elsewhere under my name and obviously you know we need to copyright protecting so people can't do that and and get those sorts of things taken down so if people find a a a book on Amazon or elsewhere that looks like it's by me it's not not yet anyway so I have um as of this recording anyway September 4th 2024 I have not published a book I am working on one and hopefully we'll be able to get that finished this year but uh it's not out yet so any any books that are out um they're uh unauthorized um unauthorized and uh frauds basically so I've also got some some thanks from Tom carnivore says welcome back Dr chaffy congrats on the 400,000 subscribers love seeing your channel grow thank you very much that's really nice of you it's really exciting 400,000 is nuts I I really appreciate everybody who has has joined my channel and has um contributed and um follow left comments likes share this with your friends and family things like that it's a it's fantastic um that well first of all it's it's very humbling that people even care what I have to say but it's h really great to see people um do so well and like you if you look in the comments and maybe people can leave comments here about their personal Journey with carnivore but I mean you just see such amazing results and people really changing their lives and that's uh that's definitely made it you know everything worth it even you know people going around saying that I'm a fake doctor and not an MD which is not true I am a doctor I am an MD I have an MD it's an internationally accredited and recognized uh medical post-graduate medical degree from the Royal College of Surgeons it's recognized as an MD by Canadian Medical Board by the American Medical Board by the Australian Medical Board and um and uh and I have a active medical license um unlike Dr IDs who does not have an active medical license he has not had a Med medical license since 2023 um only finished his internship in December 2021 um oh sorry no he graduated December 2021 didn't and finish his intern year December 2022 and basically had a license one more year and hasn't practiced since I don't even know if he practiced after his intern year and then he goes around telling people he's board certified in lifestyle medicine but lifestyle medicine doesn't offer a board certification it's a certificate so he has a certificate in lifestyle medicine which can take anywhere from 20 to 40 hours to complete online um that's not a board certification specialty he's not registered as a specialist or a GP in the UK he's not even licensed to practice medicine um so he's going around saying that I'm falsifying my credentials and saying that I'm an MD when I'm not and I'm a doctor when I'm not and he is definitely false if in his credentials and saying he's something that he is not so dealing with all that nonsense I have a lawsuit um that I'm putting forward against him I've slapped him with a defamation uh letter from my lawyer uh to cease and desist and to do a retraction all this sort of stuff and we're currently in the middle of that um that's been taken up by a lot of people Dr Alo Lane Norton stand eings people have made these claims as well so I'm going to be pursuing legal actions against them also so uh if I get uh actual you know screenshots of them I have it for some of them and um if anybody sees that you know please do take screenshots of them saying that I'm not a real doctor I'm not a medical doctor or a licensed or anything like that because it's completely false people can look that up go to appa.com ahp uh or. org. something like that look that up just Google that Google my name you'll see medical practitioner licensed in good standing no hits against me no complaints or anything like that on my record so uh easy to look up and um if you see any of these people with a big platform or whatever saying that stuff about me please do take a screenshot get their name in it so it's identifiable as them and um send it to me send it to the email that you we put in these descriptions the Anthony chaffy at gmail.com uh sort of thing and um or get it to get it to me some other way or get it to someone who can get it to me uh because you know you have to fight these little bastards you can't let them win um but all that stress headache and nonsense is more than made up for the fact that you know we're just seeing people by the hundreds of thousands completely get their lives back uh in order and and um it's just amazing to see so I absolutely love seeing that please do keep commenting please do keep letting me know how you guys are doing and thank you all very much for the for the um 400,000 subscribers on YouTube it's absolutely amazing u m and this is um from Melissa who did not have to do a"

        "body": "m and this is um from Melissa who did not have to do a m and this is um from Melissa who did not have to do a super chat but thank you very much Melissa says a huge congratulations to you and L and little boy to for also reaching 400,000 K uh and from your loyal Mod Squad which's very very nice of you thank you very much and um and uh also that's you know another bit of news ell and I got engaged last week in Wyoming so that's a big bit of news as well so thank you very much for that I really appreciate it um I'll pop in here in some of the questions one is from Mariana sharp uh that says Dr cha do you have any diet advice for ALS um I do definitely think that it's worth trying a very strict line diet very high fat meat-based ketogenic carnivore diet um this has been shown in multiple areas of neurological or for neurological conditions to make massive recoveries um people with Ms are recovering and people with traumatic brain injuries concussions postconcussive syndromes U pain disorders all these other sorts of things are all improving I would hope that something like ALS will respond we don't know for sure we don't have studies on this but but um I have worked with a couple people with ALS and they at least have seemed to start improving it's still very early days but um people are going to improve anyway there are a lot of different things that people improve when they go on to a carnivore diet and so you can't really tell I can't really tell yet if those people are improving just because of the improvements that you get from anybody going on a carnivore diet or is it specifically helping the ALS time will tell there are ALS groups that are now talking about how uh more and more people with alss or more neuron disease are attempting to use a carnivore diet as as something that they can try so hopefully more and more people will be able to well there'll be as there are more and more people trying this we'll be able to get some some information on that to try to help people out I think you need to look at all your vitamins and minerals and make sure everything's el else is in in proper working order add in a bit of liver these sorts of things you need to make sure your B12 is optimal you need to make sure your vitamin D is optimal you need to make sure your Omega omega3 fatty acids like DHA EPA your Omega 6 is like arachadonic acid not all the plant versions not the animal versions of Omega 3s and Omega sixes um that those are all in order as well because those are all extremely important for your neurological function and um and development and healing and uh you know things like B12 if you have B12 that's even in the middle of the range of what we call normal you can actually get demyelination of your axons and so you really need to get to to get that up in a more optimal level um which is basically on the upper end of normal for the normal uh for reference ranges or even a bit above depending on the reference range so in America I I typically um like to see people's B12 at 1100 to 1600 pams per Mill leader in Australia UK Europe and and much of the rest of the world I like to see it between 800 and 1200 pea moles per liter so depending on what units you guys use I would get it up into that level I would get your vitamin D up you know well up at the upper ends of the reference range if not above because that's very important to and all these reference ranges are just averages for the people that have come in it's not an optimal range it's an average range and the average person is and malnourished so that's not who you want to compare yourself to you want to compare yourself against healthy people in optimal ranges um so good luck with that um and and everything else you need you need to be in the sun you need to get proper sleep you need to reduce stress you need to just be outside living a more normal life don't sit in a box all day uh sun is really important you know it can help you know promote vitamin D but it also promotes nitric oxide and other sorts of um you know proper flow in your in your arteries and things like that I mean there's a lot of big benefits from being in the sun and uh you know just getting light in your eyes those UV light actually trigger uh signal in your retina goes to your brain and triggers brain derived neurotropic factor bdnf which actually helps your your uh brain and nervous system improve particularly your hippocampus and involved in memory and recall and depression all these other sorts of things really important so um you had to do everything with something like ALS or other major issues like you know cancer Etc you had to throw the kitchen sink at it so do everything that you can uh in the best way that you can and I do think that that includes a high fat clean lion diet with ruminant meat and uh bit of liver every day to make sure that you're optimizing your vitamins and minerals so hopefully you or so whoever else is um that you're asking on behalf of is is uh doing well and um I would definitely give it a try please do let me know how that goes and how th ey do uh question from nav thank you very much for the"

        "body": "ey do uh question from nav thank you very much for the ey do uh question from nav thank you very much for the Super Chat nav I appreciate it also I'll be on for about another about an hour and a half total so I have to I have another appointment at 12 so I will um be around till then uh 12 Perth time so that's about an hour and 15 from now question from nav um 100 plus strict carnivore now great no improvements in health or loss in any weight not great um have a multitude of issues like ibf IBS fatigue insomnia and more what the longest amount of time it takes to start seeing improvements in your experience at the longest I've seen it it depends on on what what you're talking about so I have seen people you know take three months even six months before their energy level start to improve uh whe if you can really low and really poor energy and then just something just clicks and then all of a sudden it just they have all this you know great energy and they feel really good I've seen that take as long as six months I've only seen a couple people have to go that long uh but I've seen a few other people do it like about three months you know that is a bit more common most people be faster than that um and then as far as weight loss is concerned I've seen it take longer than that I've seen it take uh anywhere from eight months to a year a half before people start losing weight and uh people just start at different different points in their life and have different metabolisms of different metabolic States and different hormonal uh patterns as well if you're finding that you know you're not you're not sort of getting the the benefits you think you you should at this point you can try getting a blood panel try looking at your hormones vitamins and minerals and seeing if something's off I mean you could have an underlying Medical condition that could be holding you back as well uh you check your leptin as well your serum leptin Le p n um and if that's elevated that is uh it's difficult to lose weight when that's elevated and that's a sign of a slowed metabolism in um leptin resistance um you know we check other things as well um you know you can check your thyroid you can check uh you know your your sex hormones and you can check your vitamin B12 you check your folate you can check your vitamin D you can check your um arthrite red blood cell levels of magnesium and zinc um and and folate too you want to check your M arthrite levels of those it's not really accurate otherwise um and just see you know see if there's something limiting you see if there's something pulling you back I mean you you will be getting all the nutrients you need from eating meat especially if you add in a bit of liver you know a couple ounces of liver a day or three days a week or something like that um but some people have Mal malabsorption issues I mean I just had a patient yesterday who had pernicious anemia his B12 which is was not U maintaining up at what I would consider that optimal range it was still within the normal range of uh of the rep of the lab but um that's not a normal reference range and so I I checked him for his pricious anemia antibodies and he was positive so he had pricious anemia so he's not going to be able to to absorb B12 very well so you know you need to you need to um take sublingual B12 or or get regular injections sublinguals easier and and less invasive and uh but you know whatever you want to do uh to get the B12 that you need and maintain that um so you could be something like that too so if it's been going on for a while and you've been having you know you haven't seen the improvements that you that you want then I would check that out um as far as IBS um most people improve their IBS symptoms pretty quick you know because it's um you know that's that's typically from things we're we're eating that's having a reaction in our body so maybe think about is there anything in your diet right now that that could still be triggering that um you're saying you're strict carnivore I totally believe you but sometimes people don't don't consider certain things um as non- carnivore or non-strict carnivore things like coffee which can absolutely cause symptoms of IBS tea can do the same thing artificial sweeteners even magnesium supplements can cause loose stools especially when you're when you've taken out when you've taken out fiber from your diet but also medications there are a lot of medications for diabetes and and um you know other conditions that um that can uh uh cause IBS like symptoms and malabsorption uh metformin is is a very very common diabetes Abes medication and it will block out the absorption of B12 if you have chronically low B12 you're going to be tired and if you are uh taking that you know you're going to get you can get Loose stols as well especially if you're taking in combination with some of those other things that I mentioned and um and then maybe using Pepper or spices or something else that um you may may trigger this or or dairy you know some people just can't do dairy some people can't do eggs you know so see what you can do you know try try filtering out certain things and um and then uh you know just try you know beef Lamm and water you know very fatty um but not so much fat that you're getting copious diarrhea um so yeah so that's what I would do hopefully that helps and um you hopefully you you you get to where you need to be I'm sure you will it just takes time and you know 100 days is great um but it can take longer than that especially for weight loss and and other sorts of of Health improvements uh fatigue yeah I've seen that take as much as six months unfortunately and there could be something underlying that's holding you back so do check your blood work and see if there's anything else that that could be the problem you also seeing have problems with insomnia that can also add and lend itself to the fatigue so you know getting into the sun in the morning starting setting up your circadian rhythm starting your body clock going your brain tells what time it is by frequency of light coming in through your eyes and so if you're just sitting in you know lit rooms with blue lights you're not getting natural lights your brain doesn't know what the hell's going on and when the light goes and when the Sun goes down put on some blue blocking glasses you turn the lights down low in your house use red lights or yellow lights candle lights or or old school in canis and bulbs not these white you know LED lights that are just have these really flat fast flickers which you actually screw with your brain and um and can stimulate you and make you wake up and so you don't go to sleep properly and um you know things like that you know that you know melatonin you know is a very easy way of of sort of restarting your circadian rhythm at night and getting you um able to start you know resetting your your body clock on when you go to sleep as well um so all these little little things you can use to try to try to get you to where you need to go so your body's in a nice Rhythm and you start just being happy healthy and and um and everything else in a you know naturally so think about that hopefully that helps and and good luck with things and you know let us know how you go um there's a couple things here [Music] um there's a there's a a nice little comment from U Mrs hooligan fish says Hi everyone thanks to carnivore I was finally able to drive a car today for the first time in many years I wanted to share the good news I'm on day 58 of my journey that's amazing um I'm really happy to hear that I'm really glad to hear that you're doing so well that you get your Independence back that's amazing question on hemocromatosis is carnivore okay if someone has this condition absolutely I do have a couple of patients with hemocromatosis and uh they do great you know you're going to be doing uh really well for all the normal reasons why people do well on on Carnivore diet then the question is like well what about iron overload and it's like well you know the heem iron that you know that's in meat is more bioavailable so you absorb it better and people say oh that's bad you don't want all that oh you don't want all those nutrients that you can absorb you want these plant nutrients that you can't absorb like great argument guys um the fact of the matter is is that hemocromatosis has has has to do with a inability to properly process iron it's not because you just have too much iron in your diet now that can happen but genetic hemocromatosis is is different than that um usually iron overload uh from from too much stuff in your in your diet usually come from supplements like heavily supplementing things or eating fortified foods that have you know a lot or way too much iron in it um not just from eating normal foods and uh even even steak and even if you're on a carnivore diet and when you're when you have hemocromatosis you don't process iron very well that can sometimes change on Carnivore people go on Carnivore you have these genetic issues but they don't express themselves and manifest in the same way when you are eating a different way because you have a genetic predisposition and an environmental trigger and so if you take away that environmental trigger the expression of the of the genetic disorder doesn't actually show up and so uh I've at least seen that in a couple people uh Dr Baker talks about this as well he has has patients that have hemocromatosis and they have found that um their their iron levels are much better to control they don't have to do um as many uh blood donations I have um yeah a couple people one that has has really maintained his iron hasn't really you know gotten worse hasn't really got too much better and the other one uh got dramatically better and um and he F he had to get um blood draws every two months to keep his iron levels down um and then he went carnivore and and didn't get give blood for five months um I didn't tell him to do that I told him to keep doing to come get a test and then we'd see and um he just sort of left it and didn't get a test for five months and his uh fertin level was actually back in in in optimal levels and was below the level that he normally is after he gives blood so and that was after five months so uh it is safe worst case scenario you just have to still give blood but hopefully you're in that latter category where your body just sorts itself out and you can actually metabolize and um and utilize iron properly but if you do have to keep giving blood then you keep giving blood um but it's still going to be the healthiest way for you to eat and um and so it's going to give you a lot of benefits that are that are well w ell worth uh the effort Edison Twain thank you for the"

        "body": "absolutely absolutely yukino morama thank you for the absolutely absolutely yukino morama thank you for the Super Chat does carnivore diet work regardless of ethnicity absolutely you because we're all the same species at the end of the day and you know just like you know different lions from different areas in different parts of the world they're still lions and dolphins are still Dolphins or the same species of dolphin is a is is that same species of dolphin um you know some people like to uh say like well orcas you know they different orcas eat different things it's like well you know a you know just because your your circumstances are such that you may have different access to food like bears in different areas some have more access to fish you know like up in you know Canada or Alaska you know they're just eating salmon Kodiak Island they're just salmon salmon salmon salmon salmon um other areas they don't have access to Salmon uh in that to that same extent they have to eat other things uh that doesn't change what's optimal for them and same thing with humans different areas we have access to different things that doesn't change what's optimal for us now there's some people that have had exposure to different populations ethnic populations have had exposure to different plants for longer and they may have built up built up a a small amount of defense against those plant toxins but that doesn't mean that that's optimal it takes a lot longer than 10,000 years which is how long we've had um agriculture um and you know had some gathering before that but largely um after the Agricultural Revolution that we were eating large amounts of plants that we started seeing these these sort of shifts and genetic changes it's only recently that we're able to to process um uh starches you know that's that's a recent genetic adaptation and that's to you know the fact that megap was getting less abundant and died out and people had to find other ways of surviving so they had to start eating starchy vegetables root vegetables and things like that and so they started developing these genetic capabilities of breaking down the starches better and and using them and um that's a new adaptation that's that's not uh that's not an old one that was there forever that's that's recent um so some some people some ethnic populations that have had exposure to certain post agricultural foods will have a bit more defenses against inappropriate Foods sub optimal foods but we all still have the same benefit from optimal Foods so you will never find two two members of the same species that have different optimal diets like I said situationally maybe they eat different things that doesn't mean that it's optimal you know you have a bear that you know is eating meat and moose and fish and there's another one that's having to go through trash and dumpsters you that doesn't that doesn't mean that that dumpster you know dumpster bear that crash is optimal for a dumpster bear instead of going out and getting a moose or something like that the Moose is still optimal still better than the garbage it's just you know that's what they that's what they um have available to them and so they they use that to survive or because they're addicted to it they're getting this processed garbage food that we're eating and then they they eat that too I saw cows in Bangladesh you know going through trash to to lick the the flavoring out of uh packets of Ruffles you know does that mean that that Ruffles powder and potato chips are optimal for a cow not likely it's just this hyper palatable and it's designed to be addictive and it addicts other animals besides humans um so it is definitely uh good for everybody regardless of ethnicity it's optimal for all of us we're all the same species doesn't matter how different we look we are all human beings we're all Homo sapiens sapiens we are a subspecies of Homo sapiens and um some people like to trot out um Bears we covered that one and orcas they said well orcas eat different things uh well no they don't they're still carnivores they don't go around eating you know kelp and and plants and that's the whole point is that plants have toxins that you can that you have to be specially adapted for so you know to put that in a in a better way you'll never find two members of the same species that are able to optimally eat different plants or meat and plants right uh but either way the same thing holds uh here as well because orcas are carnivores they eat meat there are some species of orca that eat more fish and they're smaller they have different languages and social uh interactions and you have other species of orcas that are larger um have different communication different social habits and social structures they do not interact with each other they don't interbreed and they don't talk and co-mingle and they um and they eat largely seals um still carnivores they're still eating meat they're not eating random plants right and they're also considered different species so again no one's no one's um no one's knock that one down yet although they try but either way it's uh the main thing there is about the plants anybody can eat meat any animal can eat meat um herbivores opportunistically eat uh smaller animals all the time and um but you can't eat random plants you're never going to find two members of the same species that are optimally eating different plants and that goes for humans as well so FAL feral Grandma thank you very much for the"

        "body": "good luck with that Hunter thank you very much for the good luck with that Hunter thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Anthony been doing well on your advice glad to hear it uh my mom however regrettably had her gallbladder removed 30 years ago any carnivore keto advice for her yeah she can still do it there's no issues there she still she's still a person she's still human she still has the same nutritional requirements um and and the Ste bu ities to toxins that that we all do so the the issue with the gallbladder is just that you know she's not necessarily going to be able to absorb as much fat um at one time and that's because she's still going to make bile out of her liver but it's not going to be stored in the gallbladder so it's not going to be released in a you know in a big Bess fashion it's just going to sort of drip out regularly out of her Li and so um if that's the case then she'll have to split up her fatty meals throughout the day so s eat the same amount over the course of the day she need she need to spread it out and eat multiple meals throughout the day so that she can absorb as much fat as she b as her body needs um most people or at least many people with uh their gallbladders removed actually form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is an outpouching of the common bile duct and and acts exactly the same as a gallbladder so uh most people actually are fine so thing to do have her sit down have a big nice meal with a big fatty steak and you know if she doesn't have to run to the toilet and have um you know diarrhea in 20 minutes after her meal you know she's she's absorbing it and she's fine and so that just means she can just just you know eat to her tolerance and eat fatty meat till it stops tasting good if she starts getting you know running into into the runs then she just needs to split up her fatty meals throughout the day and uh then that's it so she can definitely she can definitely still uh do that that's that's not a problem so we have some super stickers here um from carnivore clarity thank you very much for for a very generous super uh super stick it's very nice of you um and very very generous super sticker from uh uh fusa dust uh it's pretty cool name and uh thank you very much for that I really appreciate that and uh Vin Diesel uh good to see you here buddy didn't know Vin Diesel went carnivore but uh thank you very much for that um and uh yeah so those are those are those we sort of stopped the the super chats B on because I didn't want to uh run out of time and not be able to uh get to all the questions um that people paid for because that uh makes me feel bad other you know sometimes other people just say hey look I got an hour I'm going to do as many questions as I can and um and they and they do that but I I don't like leaving questions unanswered so um uh we have to sort of do that sometimes do have a couple nice comments here one from Katrina Davis I says uh once I stopped eating um once I stopped uh eating wheat I no longer had Hashimoto's disease carnivore has been an awesome diet for me that's great to hear um I have dozens of patients with Hashim Motors probably over a 100 haven't really counted but a ton of them it's way more common than people realize and they all do extremely well on a carnivore diet especially a lion diet just red meat and water and you just see their antibodies just come right down um so it's h it's great to see and I'm glad you have that same experience um see there's another comment here from old biker says I want nothing to do with carbs and starches um all it does is raise my blood sugar which was a cause of my um congestive heart failure for years injection fraction rate is now 56% from 14% just wow oh my God that's fantastic I mean think about that this is something that has fulminant heart failure to the point that they're going to need to be on very serious and heavy medications and drugs for the rest of the life possibly um some sort of internal defibrillator or some sort of indwelling device to keep the heart pumping and uh and then a heart trans transplant I mean how horrible is that and then you just change your diet and then your heart starts working again that's amazing like injection fraction 56 um is is great you know above 55% is is normal and uh 14% you know from 14 that doesn't happen um that's actually very you know brings up something uh very relevant actually because I'm looking to publish some case series of um of these sorts of recoveries in my patient population I have a couple um uh heart failure ones and um so that's that's good to sort of remember that but but I think it'd be good to see uh if people have had a situation like this where they've had you know e cardiograms they they've shown that they have you know uh you know Progressive uh heart failure that's getting worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and then they go carnivore and Bam it reverses like that um and they can show that in their medical history and their and their echocardiograms and Doctor notes and things like that um I think it'd be great to publish a series of people with heart with heart failure specifically um as that's that's just amazing I mean no one's I mean no one knows about that and um you know and and addressing this and getting heart failure patients I mean this is the only thing you know you know and this this may be uh something that can stop them from having a heart transplant U which is a big deal and they don't don't have too many hearts out there that can donate to people and um you know and if we don't need to donate them at all then even better and you don't have to be on these these horrible immunosuppressant the rest of your life and get horrible infections and Cancers and and uh you know significantly shorten your life as a result um but you know extend your life in the sense that you know you were your heart was not going to work in a in a in a bit anyway but if your heart is working now and you don't need that in the first place obviously that's the best result so if you sir Mr old biker would uh be willing to be part of that and if anybody else has um has has been in that situation where youve reversed heart failure or know someone who's reversed heart failure and would like to be a part of that uh case series or case um uh series publication that I'm I'm uh thinking about publishing that's what I want to publish please do email me um at Anthony chaffy gmail.com it's usually in the descriptions um but uh you know please do talk about that you know obviously we need all the medical records and your Echo saying that this this is what you're and it's not like an acute thing where it's just like your perfect heart um heart function and then it just dropped down and now it's come up because it could be just because of that that acute situation is resolved but it sort of coming down over the years and all of a sudden bang just goes up well that's uh that's different isn't it so if people are able to do that it'd be great to get you know you know 10 or so more people uh if possible to uh to be a part of that that would be actually pretty amazing and I think that would really open up a lot of uh open a lot of people's eyes up and um and so if uh you would be willing to do that I'd love to publish your case if other people uh would be interested in that it would be amazing to get a case series together and publish that too so if you guys are willing and able to do that or know people who are please do email me or have them email me at Anthony chaffy gmail.com so chaffy spelled uh you know c h FF so two fs and two e Anthony spell normally Anthony chaffy gmail.com uh but that's fantastic I'm really glad to glad to see that um friend stink assat said hello again with the super sticker very thank very grateful for you buddy uh thank you very much for for saying hi and for the super sticker um and uh also we are getting into the September challenge for howto cornivore so if people do need a bit of extra help um they can go there to how howto cornivore .c um I make all this stuff available for free if I can I put you know a playlist together so people can find it getting started on a cornivore diet should help people uh through uh you know getting know watching videos on how to do it as well as why to do it um playlists on cancer playlists on Sports playlists on uh other sorts of things as well to try to help you know narrow down know what uh what are some of the more important ones to watch in these different subjects but uh but if you need a bit more help and you want that sort of group um format where you have you know the different sort of modules and and and learning tools and those videos are sort of laid out in a specific order that that we think are very helpful um and then like the group support and asking questions of of everybody and uh and and there's so many very knowledgeable and experienced people there that they can help um they can help uh answer questions and then we do weekly Q&A sessions where people submit questions and we and we sort of go through them live and uh and and and sort of help people with their specific issues so if you need a bit more um uh you know bit more uh help getting going on it then that's something you can try otherwise you know the information is available for free there's not a special product or supplement or anything like that you have to buy there no piece of equipment or Machinery you know just go on YouTube go on those playlists that I mentioned it's all free and if if you're able if you're a self-learner and you're able to do that on your own great if you need a bit more uh help and Community Support you know that's a that's an option too and if you want just a community sort of establishment my patreon group is more more set up for just a a community of carnivores that are just all nice people and get to hang out and interact and um have weekly calls as well um and the my patreon is just Anthony chaffy MD on patreon um so yeah and uh this is this is a good one real carnivore says why am I never sore after hard workouts to exhaustion so strange yeah that's something I noticed early on and I I tried to really kill myself with just doing sets of um squats and I end up doing 32 sets to failure and people don't always believe that but it happened and uh it took like four hours but it happened and I couldn't wear myself out and the next day I I wasn't sore and I was like that's crazy went hiking like up a mountain up Mount Sai if people know where that is stupid hike it's just switchbacks a whole way up four and a half miles just straight up the side of this bloody Mountain it was fine it's totally easy and I felt so good that I was like right time to go start playing rugby again and I went to rugby practice that night was at a dead Sprint the whole time still not sore the next day wasn't sore the day after that until I met a friend for coffee and um uh 20 minutes after having one cup of black coffee I started getting stiff and sore my legs and hamstrings and back and shoulder I'm like okay what's happening what's happening I could feel it happening in real time and then I was sore for the next two days not nearly as sore as I should have been but I was sore and so I was like right never coffee again and that's when I figured out that stiffness soaring s that stiffness soreness and swelling that isn't from lactic acid lactic acid that's that's just a nonsensical statement it begin with because your your lactic acid is is only is only that that initial burn as you're sort of maxing out um on a set or something like that uh and then it goes away because your muscle stop being sore that's that lactic acid going away it doesn't then come back and just sit there for two days uh that's not what that's not what that is um that's the inflammatory factors from Plants those are those plant toxins that I keep harping on about that are causing that pain stiffness and swelling because the plant warning you like hey don't eat me I'm going to hurt you and so you know don't eat it you know like I'm I'm fine with that um and so when you get rid of plants and I find that a lot of the beans and seeds and legumes and and Grains and carb containing foods carry a lot of these toxins that make you very sore and stiff um that uh when you get rid of those things you just don't get sore anymore and so you work as hard as you want and you just won't get sore unless you have some of those plants in your in your diet as say oh well I still I still get a little sore like it's better but I still get sore like do you drink coffee yeah I drink coffee well there there you go coffee will do that to you uh it causes inflammation has these lectin and nasty actors that are going to cause pain and swelling stiffness and soreness and so if you have them it's going to be a problem uh but when you get rid of them you don't get sore but that's that's one thing that people just get so pissed about you when I say like I don't get sore they're that's bull you get sore for some reason that's the one that that upsets people the most it's like don't eat plants for two weeks and see for yourself man like it's not that hard and uh and it makes a big difference so glad you found that too it is weird it's from plant toxins plants have toxins they're poisonous that's why you don't want to eat them because they don't want you to eat them a cow doesn't want you to eat it either and that's why it's hard to kill them because they're big and strong they have horns and Hooves and will stomp you out if they're you know like wild animals you know they know that um that other animals are trying to eat them and so they will fight them they will kill them if you know a moose gets if you get too close to a moose it's going to kill you it can kill you it has killed people uh same with bison uh the you know the big five um killers in Africa you know like the the top five animals that you know kill humans in Africa four of those are herb s elephants Kate Buffalo hippos uh rhinos and then number and then on that list in there and that top five is Lions so you I don't know where Lions rank in there but the other four of the top five are herbivores right they're not killing you to eat you they're killing you because they don't want you to eat them right and so you know they're not they're not pushovers animals don't want you to eat them plants don't want you to eat them wants you to eat them so they all have defenses rhinos can just smash you up and stab you with their horn um and uh plants are just sitting there like like idiots they're not even trying to hide and so you know they have other defenses so they don't have to hide because they're poisonous they're toxic so th those toxins are what you're experiencing when you get sore or when you get sick or there's a lot of different illnesses that are directly caused by the food foods that we eat by the plants that we eat and the toxins that are in them you get rid of those those diseases and problems go away it's pretty simple it's a whole field in in veterinary medicine looking at livestock and and there's all these different diseases so quote unquote diseases uh that come from eating the wrong plants they have names for them big head big tongue limp neck Crazy Cow syndrome those are not diseases those are toxicities they recognize those diseases as coming from eating the wrong plants you get toxic from those plants and we just haven't figured that out yet you know they have muscular distrophy cows get the same muscular distrophy as humans do but they've they've figured out that that's from a selenium deficiency has anyone ever checked muscular distopy patients for selenium anyone out there who has muscular distrophy or know someone with muscular distrophy check your selenium see what happens let me know it may not be but why hasn't anyone asked that question that makes no sense to me um probably because you know no one has has realized that and sort of put two and two together but you know give it a try I'm really curious I don't treat anybody with muscular distrophy I don't that's not my you know I'm not not in neurology so uh I don't see those patients but anybody knows a neurologist anybody who has um uh you know friend or family member with it um uh with mushe get it checked out it's really easy uh you need RBC selenium so arra levels your red blood cell levels of selenium that's that's the more accurate one and um you know get them on a proper diet get them on a proper human diet eat fatty meat with a bit of liver every now and then and uh get those nutrients up and see what happens I would hope that it would help because muscular distopy is a nasty nasty thing to have so in any case sort of went on a bit of a tear there and a bit of a rant um but uh we'll probably wrap it there because I have uh I have an appointment I have to hop on to with an interview uh for a guest on the podcast so thank you all very much it's been absolute pleasure as always it's great to see everybody great questions as usual really nice that everyone's U joined on and glad we were able to get back on for another live session I'm going to try to get back on in two days as well um and I will try to bring the cat next time uh but he's uh I don't know he's sleeping somewhere he was with me before this and um and I'll try to get that uh yeah so about the same around the same time um on Friday which is in two days and oh actually let me double check I might be working this Friday um in the [Music] morning no that's fine yeah I can do that so two days I'll be able to do that and uh great and we'll see you all uh in a couple days and um and uh yeah hope you're all doing well great to see you all great turnout today got over 600 on YouTube uh which is great I sort of stop putting them on X and uh you know Facebook things like that just because it's just sort of spread out can't really always a answer the questions on X or Facebook or or Instagram so I have to focus on the super chats from YouTube so sort of do them on their own and maybe I'll do lives independently on X and other platforms as well but for now anyway I think just going to put it back to doing it on YouTube so um for people wondering where the chaffy um where the chaffy uh uh Q&A on X and Instagram and all that sort of stuff are you just direct people here probably just going to keep them on YouTube and then just do uh sporadic ones on those other channels when I can okay thank you all very much it's been great uh great time as usual thank you all and see you next time"
