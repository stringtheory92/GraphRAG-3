    "transcript": "okay finally going Live on YouTube that took way longer than it should have sorry about that talk about sorry talk about proteins and fats for weight loss percentage grams uh wise please so it you know it it does change it um it doesn't uh it's not the same sort of gramage for everybody okay so uh you just need to get enough protein you need to get enough fat your body will tell you that if you're not eating carbohydrates you're not eating a lot of other you know lectins and things like that that are going to disrupt your hunger signals that are going to disrupt your digestion and your energy absorption or your or nutrient absorption you can generally just listen to your to your body so you eat enough you keep going uh while meat tastes good and it's satisfying uh to you and then it'll stop being as satisfying and you'll just stop and so you can just listen to your body you can eat intuitively if you're eating a natural diet so I would just do that but you need to make sure you get enough you know people are trying to limit all the things that they're eating in order especially in order to lose weight but that's not what your body's asking for you're out your body's asking for nutrients if you're giving it the right nutrients it won't let you overeat you know generally there are people that have different sort of conditions and are on different medications that may change that and alter that but that is it that is a general rule so I would just eat enough protein and enough fat uh that's going to be different for everybody okay I'm just going to start with uh some questions here um that uh we had submitted from my patreon group and if you want to be a member of these lives and part of these lies we do these every week or twice weekly and you can submit questions and we can go through them and talk more in depth as well so we'll start with those and so that's on my patreon account that's just Anthony chafee MD if you guys are interested in checking that out so to start things off I'll ask one of the questions here from Carmine who says a few weeks in and I know that I have increased my consumption of fat and it is filling but I have I have to force myself to eat sometimes my fear is that I'm not eating enough protein especially since I have returned to the gym is this a common occurrence and how do you cope with it uh yeah so if you're if you find yourself forcing yourself to eat that means your body is telling you to stop that means your body's telling you hey we've had enough we don't need this anymore you know please stop um it meat should taste good you should be getting that positive feedback that reward for eating meat and fat and so if you're getting to the point where you're like Ugh you know it's not really tasting good anymore and you're forcing yourself then that you're actually forcing yourself to overeat okay so you don't need to do that and uh you probably don't want to do that either especially when you have excess body fat your body's not going to want as much as you think that it might you know so you might think well I'm really working out a lot I'm doing all this I need all this stuff um uh I'm doing all all this work and all that sort of stuff I need more energy I need more food well you clearly don't if your body's telling you to stop eating okay so you shouldn't force yourself to eat ever okay um so that would be what I would do is just listen to your body and if your body's telling you to eat less eat less so a question from Mike after the body uses available dietary protein to build repair of the body on a plant-free carnivore diet What Becomes of the remaining protein does it become glycogen glucose fat excreted if a combination uh what are the approximate percentages I don't know percentages um I do know your body can store and sequester protein and um so it's not just like this perfect level that you here's all this protein and then and then it all gets shoveled away so your body is able to to conserve protein and store it away and so and use it at later times this is why you know we eat meat in one go and and then we use it throughout the day or throughout the next day or the night and we rebuild our body and rebuild these structures so your body is able to store protein just like it is able to store fat and carbohydrates as well um some of it will turn into uh you know glucose and glycogen but that's generally um need driven as opposed to substrate driven so namely that you're just because you have a lot of extra protein that doesn't necessarily mean that's just going to automatically turn into glucose and things like that uh some of it will it seems but it's um it's more demand driven than anything um so I guess there's a sort of an add-on to sort of those hunger Hunger questions if you've had issues with food before how do you know if you're just misinterpreting hunger cues that's a good that's a good question you know it's it's difficult sometimes when people come from different ways of eating or they're eating too much or too little for whatever reason um and having disordered eating patterns generally people get less disordered eating on a carnivore diet on a natural diet because you're more satiated you're more satisfied you're not feeling bloated you're not getting overweight you feel good and you're getting healthy and it's also good for your mental health as well uh significantly uh better for your mental health and so you you will have to relearn your hunger signals you will have to to relearn what it feels like to be hungry um and what that means and so I think going by taste is uh really important so if meat tastes good I think that that means you are hungry if you are only eating meat if you're not eating carbohydrates if you're not taking different medications that can increase your appetite um and uh so if you're doing that then if meat tastes good I think that means you're hungry and once it stops tasting good it means you're not and then you start paying attention to that and then relearning your hunger signals um just a quick question here just type 2 diabetes um you know can you eat on a carnivore diet yes you absolutely can it's very very helpful there are there are actual you know big studies showing that just going on a ketogenic diet is very very beneficial for type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes really normalizes blood sugar hpa1c and makes it very very controllable blood sugars which is this is the important thing for diabetes and you can come off a lot of your medications and reduce your insulin if you're insulin dependent a lot of insulin dependent type 2 diabetics can come off of insulin not everyone but but a lot of people can so yes it's very very beneficial and it's very beneficial to everyone in every condition at every stage of life because this really is our primary evolved biologically appropriate species-specific diet that is the the most optimal for the human beings for the human animal I truly believe that I truly believe that that's what the evidence shows um so another question from our patreon members Jeff he says I know someone who after some misdiagnoses now is diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia and is going to discuss surgery is this something that can be addressed first with diet maybe I you know I haven't really come across this before but I think that in in the context of a carnivore diet and um you know I have a strong suspicion that it will I haven't seen it specifically but your body's going to optimize it's going to start working better when you're on a biologically appropriate species specific you know uh proper human diet as Dr Berry says so your body's going to work better and so your your hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia that is going to optimize as well is that going to fix it I couldn't say but is are you going to work as well as you possibly can given your genetics and your situation yes and so can that help things like that it wouldn't be the first time something like that happened so I wouldn't uh I wouldn't put it past it I would certainly try it before I started getting surgery to rip my uh um you know parathyroid uh glands out of my neck and um you know so I would I would definitely give that a shot does carnivore diet help with Hashimoto's disease yes it seems that all autoimmune disorders seem to respond very very well to a true Elimination Diet like carnivore where you're eliminating out all of the unnecessary unwanted and unhealthy different foods that we eat that can precipitate different diseases like Hashimoto's so we have a number of Hashimoto's patients at the functional medicine clinic I work at and they have all been doing very very well uh it's it comes off a bit slower Hashimoto's responds lower than say like Crohn's and ulcerative colitis or even rheumatoid arthritis but it does respond and it does improve and people's thought um antibodies go down and their thyroid function goes up and you can have permanent damage you may have to take different medications ongoing especially early on or even permanently but it can significantly improve things and I've every single one of our patients is improving and that's that's what I'm reading from other clinicians around the world that are doing this as well so yes Hashimoto's and all autoimmune diseases that I've seen respond very very well to uh carnivore Elimination Diet um uh let's see uh D Ford asks are electrolytes necessary usually not usually you'll get everything that you need from just the meat that you're eating because this is actually what we're designed to eat and so you should get everything that you need you shouldn't have to supplement if you're eating a biologically appropriate diet right you know animals in the wild they don't supplement they just eat so electrolytes generally no you don't sometimes when you're transitioning from eating carbohydrates into any ketogenic diet because of the drops in your insulin sometimes your body has a bit more difficulty regulating your electrolytes and so you might have a bit of a disturbance early on generally that corrects on its own if it happens at all most people it doesn't happen some people it does and maybe you just have to take some electrolytes for the first couple weeks generally you don't have to after that um but you know if you're having a problem and you have a deficiency and you actually take a blood test and you actually have you know a you know a low electrolytes on uh your blood tests you know take some electrolytes it's not that big of a deal most people will equate cramping with low electrolytes that's not always the case quite often that's dehydration not getting enough water and you can see this by the fact that a lot of people will just take copious amounts of electrolytes and they'll still be getting all the cramps they'll still be getting all the nighttime crayons they'll still be getting the exact same uh experience with it and so well obviously it's not the electrolytes then because they're taking electrolytes and nothing's changing right so then you tell those people hey drink a lot more water and they go away so that that's quite often what happens uh what to do with a knee with no ligament and arthritis in the hands well you know there there is damage that you can do to your body I have damage that I've done to my body from you know years of sports and uh doing stupid things and um you know so those aren't necessarily those aren't going to heal themselves you know you're not gonna you're not gonna you know regrow ligaments necessarily you know the body can do some amazing things but you know it's um it's uh that's a you know not something that I would I would hold out much hope for uh arthritis you're not going to regrow your cartilage that that we know of but you will significantly by going on a carnivore diet or even a ketogenic diet you're going to significantly reduce the inflammation in your body ketones just having higher ketones significantly reduce inflammation in your body and you're also eliminating out a lot of things that cause inflammation in your body so you will experience the pain and discomfort and disability of arthritis far less and so I think your life will improve a lot from that as well um let's see so hi doc question how how does it work to be on a carnivore animal based and also play sports do we need a bit of carbs I always feel a bit shaky with no carbs at all uh no you definitely don't need carbs I um I think that it actually detracts from your performance because when you eat carbohydrates you raise your insulin insulin blocks proteolysis it blocks lipolysis it stops your body from being able to produce energy from fat and so the only energy you have available is in your muscle and liver glycogen and that will run out that runs out in a couple hours so if you're doing really high intensity work you're going to you're going to hit the wall and you're going to crash um if you're fat adapted and you're on keto or carnivore you make all the blood sugar liver glycogen muscle glycogen and ketones that you need instead of only running on the glycogen and glucose that you have in your system and you're tapped into your fat Source you're constantly replenishing all your glycogen and glucose and ketones so you will not run out right like you have even the very slender person has has weeks of fat reserves left over unless you're just completely emaciated and on the verge of starvation and death um you you have weeks of energy left in you and so no you know exercise or or sport or whatever is gonna is gonna crash you out because you're constantly uh tapping into your fats fat stores this is shown by Professor Tim Knox who is one of the top the world's experts in exercise physiology and sports medicine and he was one of the guys for like you know 30 years who was saying you need carbs to burn carbs you've got to do these high performance athletes that you have to have carbs you have to have carbs you have to have carbs and he has you know in the last you know decade or so come out and said like oh my god I've been lying to people for 30 years I'm so sorry uh no you don't need carbs in fact you don't want carbs for the the reasons I just mentioned he's done randomized controlled trials where you have people who are eating athletes who are eating carbs and ones that are keto adapted fat adapted and they have the exact same ability and output in their in their performance initially and then going longer term the keto adapted fat adapted guys do way better because they never crash they never hit the wall they just keep going and then they switched it so the people that were keto adaptive fat adapted they had them eating carbs and then they got the other guys fat adapted and then they ran the tests again they found the same results the ones that were on carbs and the ones that were off carbs they had the exact same uh exercise potential and output until they hit the wall and then the fat adapted guys took over so that's um that to me is is sort of a uh you know end of this story but really for me I I just me as an athlete I have never performed better and felt better and could go longer and go harder and get better results than when I was on a pure carnivore diet when you eat carbohydrates that shuts that down you can think of it like you know when people go on you know running marathons or doing you know Iron Man and things like that they're talking about hitting the wall you know you go and you go and you go and you have to carbo load and fill all that because you don't want to hit the wall you want to push the wall as far away as you can but eventually you hit the wall and you feel like garbage and most people stop and sit down and and that's where they they call it a day then other people that are you know more determined they're pushing they're pushing they want to push themselves until they push through the wall and they say that you can you can push yourself and you can break through the wall and um you can break through the wall and then you get your second wind and your Runners high and you just feel amazing and you can just go forever and go forever and the harder you go the better you feel right well what that is metabolically is you're eating a bunch of carbohydrates your insulin is high it stays high for about 24 hours and then what you know you will run out of your liver glycogen and muscle collection and you'll run out of energy your blood sugar will drop and you'll hit the wall and you'll feel like garbage because you cannot replenish your blood sugar and you cannot replenish your glycogen and you cannot tap into your fat stores normally this is going to take about 24 hours before that resolves but if you push and you push and you push you can actually force your metabolism back in to start mobilizing your fat store so you don't die so that's what's happening so I live in my second wind I am always in my runner's high when I start working out I'm always burning fat and I'm always feeling better so the harder I push myself the more energy I burn the better I feel and the harder I want to go and the more energy I burn the better I feel the harder I want to go so it's a positive feedback I just want to go and go and go and go and so you know I don't run into the wall I don't uh have to you know uh crash and force my way through I'm always feeling amazing so for high performance athletes or any athletes or any sport you have a monster Advantage when you're keto adapted fat adapted on Carnivore when you're eating what you're supposed to eat okay um you know I know I know several Sports Medicine doctors in Australia who work with some of the top rugby players in Australia and New Zealand and I can tell you that some of the top players in rugby league league and Union are on carnivore and they are not telling people because they don't want people to know about it because this is their this is their secret advantage and they are taking full advantage of it while they can and revitalizing their careers and just crushing it and you know some people have actually come out and spoken to the papers about it and um you know and there are a lot of others who are not talking about it because they don't want the secret to get out and so you know yes this is uh this is something that is really going to benefit you in sports and everything else um so a question here is like do you what do you think about the whole fat debate uh what fat percentage do you roughly recommend for men versus women so for me that that debate isn't isn't really a debate it's just you need to get enough fat and you need to get enough protein for your body and your body's going to have different demands depending on if you're a man or a woman depending on your goals depending on your exercise level and whether you're pregnant or not and and all these different sorts of things so I think that you can you really can eat intuitively I don't think you have to just you know count your Macros and and pick what you're doing I think that you know if you if you need a calculator to figure out what to eat that you're probably eating the wrong thing and that you you shouldn't have to do that you know gorillas and koalas and lions they don't count calories they don't count macros they don't you know pull off their calculator to figure out you know how much you know nutrients are getting in they just eat you know they eat what they're supposed to eat and they stop when they don't feel like eating anymore so they're not forcing themselves to eat and I think that's what that's what we need to do as well it does turn out that usually it's like one to one you need one gram of protein for every gram of fat that turns out to be around 70 calories from fat 30 calories from protein roughly that's going to change depending on the person depending on their situation so maybe aim for that and then adjust you know I do a a bunch of videos on how to figure that out um there's carnivore for beginners um you know tips tricks and pitfalls and another one called fiber constipation and diet and where I go and try to tell you to how to figure out how to get enough fat basically it comes down to your digestion if you're only eating meat and water then your body has a limited capacity for absorbing fat okay you make bile bile emulsifies fat that's how you absorb fat you really can't absorb fat otherwise you can absorb you know you have some natural abilities of of absorbing like some medium chain fatty acids but a very small percentage of them so when you're eating when you're eating um you know fat and you run out of bile your liver only makes a certain amount of bile use about 800 milliliters to a liter depending on the size of the person a day and so when that's gone you know you really can't absorb fat so what happens that excess fat goes out of your body you you literally cannot absorb it right and so you know I think there's a sort of this overflow valve uh that's how I think about it is overflow valve on fat where it's really you really can't overeat fat because oh you don't want to eat too much fat what what does that mean your body can only absorb a certain amount and your body's very efficient it's not going to make a bunch of bile if it doesn't want you to absorb fat with that you know I think that you know our bodies are very very efficient they know they don't just make a whole bunch of products just for the hell of it just to get a random amount of fat you know they they your body made that amount of bottle because it wanted that amount of fat and once you get that your body's like yeah we don't need any more and so it just goes out right that excess fat is what keeps your stool soft so if you have dry hard stools which is what constipation is it's not in frequency of stools it's the consistency of the stools you can easily go on a carnivore diet only once or twice a week and very small volume because there's just not much to go because you're absorbing 98 of the meat that you're eating that's a good thing you're supposed to absorb the things that you're eating you're not eating rocks here we're not eating dirt and wood you know you're eating things that you're supposed to absorb otherwise why are you eating it um so you want to absorb this stuff and you know you're going to absorb every ounce of fat that you eat if you're you're not getting enough fat your stools are dry that means you're absorbing every ounce of fat that you're eating and you probably need more you probably have you know more bile available for you so you want to keep eating fat until you have normal stools normal soft consistency stools if you're eating a lot more fat then your body can absorb then you can get loose stools okay this is like what that's saying is like fat through a goose where you you give you know Goose a chunk of fat just out of it's out through them in a you know a minute or two right you know they can't absorber just shoots right out of them that happens to you the other side of it is if you're really not getting enough fat you can get so constipated that it causes a blockage and only liquid stools can get around that and you get what's called spurious diarrhea or overflow diarrhea and so that alternates between these dry hard pebbly uh stools and like liquid stool so that means you're so constipated there's like liquid coming around um so yeah so it says hi can I go for a marathon with just a half marathon three weeks before or unless I run a 32k first so I'm not a distance Runner I've never trained for uh those things before I've just you know just played rugby and done a lot of you know just training for that and Fitness training for that so I don't know the best uh best uh advice to give you there but you know uh the best way to to train for anything is to do it you know so if you're running if you're you know running a marathon before you compete I mean like I'm I'm playing I you know I'm playing scrimmages I'd you know uh do Sprints and drills and all these sorts of things to get in preparation for the games and playing practice games and practice matches and things like that in order to play the game so if you want to get better at running marathons run more marathons that's that's my advice oh goodness um move what's happening here sorry okay all right oh let's see the next question is thoughts on autophagy and related research by David Sinclair so I don't know all of his stuff but I don't know exactly what you're referring to with David Sinclair but Sinclair is a professor at Harvard he's done a lot of research into anti-aging and actually reversing the aging process which is really interesting and uh you know and I'm really excited to see where he goes with that and what he ends up figuring out because I wanna I want I want in you know and um uh an autophagy so you know autophagy or autophagy which I think is probably more uh proper way of pronouncing it is um is when your body's clearing out these sort of you know older run down uh cells or even the parts they're in so the different organelles are just sort of run down and worn out like different you know macrophages or sorry um uh mitochondria and different sorts of organelles and things like that so you're sort of recycling these things and you're and you're rebuilding new ones that that work better and are tuned up and that's really good that's really important and we find that you don't really do that when you're eating carbs okay you're eating carbohydrates you're eating sugar your body just shuts down those processes and you and you can't really uh recycle these these dead and dying cells and organelles uh so when you go when you fast we know that you get a lot of this turnover the cell turnover and these organelle turnovers uh autophagy and um but you also get mitophages so mitochondria doing this and all the different organelles uh you know are going to be recycled and they're going to work better and they're going to be more efficient and they're going to be and you're going to be more healthy and more more vibrant so we also know that it's not just fasting it's just being in the metabolism that you're supposed to be in any way I don't think that that's a fasting metabolism even though that's what I was taught in Biochemistry I think that that is our that is our primary metabolic state that is the metabolic state of all basically all animals in the wild including humans because humans just eat meat in the wild right uh can you heal fatty liver on Carnivore yes you can um fatty liver is just caused by eating certain things and so you stop eating those things and fatty liver goes away but so back to David Sinclair you will on a carnivore diet on a ketogenic diet or just fasting you will go through autophagy you will stimulate stem cells you will do a lot better health-wise and so you know people are just literally aging backwards and you know we know uh as geneticists for 20 years now that human beings are designed to live 120 years right so why are we dying in our 60s and 70s right I mean that's literally middle age so why aren't we getting there you know that's because we're eating poison and slow poison is still poison you die 40 years early you've been poisoned all right um so you know I think I think a major thing that David Sinclair should look at is is things like that I mean he I don't think he's from from listening to some of the things that he said on diet he said that from what I know from one of the things I've heard maybe changes my sense then but from the things that he said uh it was just like well you know I haven't really looked into diet and all that sort of stuff but you know this the the all the studies say that like a Mediterranean diet is the best okay so that's where he's going on he hasn't really looked into this and uh looking at nutritional studies and epidemiological studies not great evidence you know so you need to look at better evidence and you look paleontological record you need to look at uh you know comparative Anatomy you need to look at our physiology and a lot of other things as well and you can look at the these carnivorous relatives of bars like the Inuit the Maasai hadza the Nanette many many more examples and they are very healthy they don't get the diseases of the West End Australian aboriginals obviously um all these all these people did not get all these Western diseases now called human diseases because now animals are getting them they're like oh we only see these in humans they're are human diseases and what are you doing why why are zoo animals getting human diseases because you're feeding them human food you're feeding them things that they don't eat in the wild you're feeding dogs and cats things they don't eat they shouldn't eat normally and then getting human diseases we're eating things that we don't in the wild we're eating things that we didn't evolve on we are getting these human diseases as well because as I've said before I don't think that these so-called chronic diseases are diseases per se I think that there are toxicities and malnutrition toxic buildup of species inappropriate diet and a lack of species-specific nutrition so namely too many plants that were not evolved or adapted to to eat and safely and break down and detoxify their their poisons and extract nutrients from and not enough meat which is what our Vital necessary nutrition source is so those are my thoughts I think if you combine the work of David Sinclair with a carnivore diet you're going to be doing a lot better than anyone else has in a very long time since like Methuselah um do you drink raw milk and thoughts I don't drink raw milk I generally don't drink milk at all if I were to have dairy I would aim to have raw dairy um but I just tend not to eat dairy I just eat meat and and drink water generally sometimes have you know some cheese with meat or whatever I very very rarely will have milk raw milk's not really available in Australia it's a crime apparently and so um that's a bit rich but it's um it's better than homogenized pasteurized milk but I don't think that it's really ideal you know and you will still have enough lactose in it that you'll get an insulin response and you'll disrupt your metabolism and metabolic State and so I tend to avoid it for those reasons um next question here do I have a salt routine is it something you track I don't so I don't track it I just salt to taste I've just noticed my tastes are just changing where I'm getting I'm using less and less salt as I go you know I stop using salt off the other for a couple weeks or maybe I think I made it about a week just to see how it was um things tasted you know uh sort of bland but still okay a lot of people will say that when they give up salt you know for a couple weeks it it tastes pretty bland but then things actually start normalizing uh in your taste I didn't have any downsides um at all I wasn't getting cramps I wasn't having low energy I didn't feel bad at all so um it looked fine or it felt fine um and then I just sort of lightly salted things because I sort of like to use the salt to sort of dry out the meat a bit when I put them on the racks in the in the fridge that just sort of helps it you know sort of preserve longer and age a bit better uh does carnivore help with underactive thyroid yes it does I generally see patients you know underactive thyroid is and Hashimoto's is very under diagnosed it's something that people don't always always look into and um and uh and think about uh as as being something that can affect them and affect their health but it is definitely something that um uh you know shows up a lot more than people realize and so we see a lot of this in in our functional medicine practice because people are coming to us because they're just basically you know they're just sort of fed up and they just feel sort of not their best and they've heard that you know we can make them feel better and optimize their health and they come in and we check a battery of things and one of those things is we we thoroughly check the thyroid and a lot of people have underactive thyroids and we put those people on even other just diet and lifestyle changes getting people to exercise more intermittent fasting you know eating Whole Foods not a bunch of processed garbage or carbs they will all improve their thyroid um carnivore absolutely does that as well it really helps thyroid as well so yeah I think that that's something that and there's different causes of of thyroid dysfunction any sort of problems but for the ones that are caused by disruption of the of eating the wrong things then 100 carnivore can help that um well carnivore diet help silence my tinnitus it can it depends on what's causing your uh tinnitus but it's um you know there are different sorts of inflammatory processes that can cause uh tinnitus and you will reduce significantly the amount of um the amount of um inflammation that you have and so I would uh yeah I would uh I would definitely say that that can be helpful um carnivore down under thank you very much for the super chat um we appreciate you thank you for all your hard work well thank you very much I really do appreciate that um and that's that's very nice of you to say that and to and be my number one fan I appreciate that and thank you Holly as well uh for the Super Chat it's very kind of you uh as well um and uh and Luke thank you very much uh for the super chat too uh he Luke asks any suggestions for reheating leftover steak you know I don't I don't tend to reheat it I generally just eat it cold I don't put it in the fridge you know if I have a steak that's sort of left over as long as there's no flies or whatever you can cover it um just make sure the bugs don't get in that um uh it just just tastes fine the next day you know I've left a brisket on the counter for days and just sort of just cut off a big slab of it uh every day and it's great it's fine and um but if you're going to reheat it um I guess you could use a microwave and you know I've done that but sometimes it's just nice to just sort of get some Tallow in a pan and just sort of toast it up and and crisp it up in the Tallow and that's really good uh Kade thank you very much for the Super Chat Kade um do you think beef water salt allows one to cut body fat while putting on muscle I have 80 pounds to cut and I'm getting stronger in the gym while losing body fat I'm 23 year old male very active your thoughts on this yes I absolutely think that this will you'll you literally shred fat and stack on muscle I have absolutely no doubt about that I see this all the time I saw this in myself and and other people and especially if you're working out a lot you are going to be putting on muscle and you are going to be shredding fat and so your weight you know may actually not change like I didn't I didn't my way you know I dropped 23 pounds in 10 days you know when I went when I just stopped eating vegetables I wasn't even eating carbs I was just eating vegetables and not that much meat and then I started eating a lot more meat and I stopped eating all of all the greens and I dropped 23 pounds in 10 days right and you know it's uh it seems insane but it's that's exactly what happened and you know when you do eat enough when you're starving yourself and you're really limiting calories too much your body just really just shuts down your metabolism and you will you will actually store fat and your body does not want to give up the fat stores that you have so when you give yourself as much as your body is asking for well then you're going to uh trigger this release and your body's going to actually ramp up your metabolism and you're going to start getting back into business and you're going to start burning more fat paradoxically you know we know this in bariatric medicine bariatric surgeons will tell their patients hey your stomach's not big anymore you can't eat too much but you need to get at least 1200 calories a day because if you don't eat at least 1200 calories a day you are not going to lose weight you're going to stall your weight loss and so this is this is a well-known phenomenon so I lost 23 pounds in the first day quintupling my my uh caloric intake and just not eating greens and and then after that my weight stabilized and I didn't my weight didn't change it didn't go up or down for months after that but my body was transforming in front of me so I was stacking on muscle and shredding fat so that's uh that's exactly what will happen so well done Cade for giving it a shot and you know no risk no reward you took the risk now you're getting the Rewards well done let's see where the next one here is um so Jay thank you very much for the Super Chat Jay appreciate it uh very much uh Jay asks or says I'm a little confused about interview with Dr Mason my cholesterol increased from 150s to 4 30 after three months on Carnivore LDL up to three twenties but triglycerides stayed at 70 and HDL went from 61 to 66 better triglyceride HDL ratio should I be worried uh no no you're fine so I look um you need to tell me a bit more about what you're eating like are you eating strictly meat are you doing high fat meat um are you fasting are you taking your Bloods at a consistent in a consistent way you know I always tell people you want to take your bloods in the morning always fasted between 9 and 11 A.M with the same hydration status right so at least two glasses of water no more than four glasses of water if you're checking your hormones and your and your cholesterol you should not do any strenuous activity the day before or any engage any sexual activity because this can throw that off if you're fasting for a long period of time your LDL will shoot up so so we know that you don't need anything and your LDL goes up right and so um it's very temperamental and I wouldn't worry about LDL as long as your triglycerides are good and your HDL is good your LDL is good and you you have very good levels your HDL is very good and your triglycerides are excellent you know you have and your HCL is going up you're eating saturated fat saturating fat increases your HDL it's good for you the generally American College of Cardiology published in large meta-analysis in 2020 showing going through all the data and looking at it and showing that there was no correlation not even an association between eating saturated fat and getting heart disease in fact they found an inverse correlation between eating saturated fat and getting a stroke so people who ate more saturated fat were less likely to have a stroke and vice versa right so you know this is completely uh opposite of what we've been told our whole life and and this is this is a mainstream view now this is a mainstream understanding uh so you're doing just fine I just keep doing what you're doing keep eating fatty meat and drink water and don't eat plants foreign scroll down here sorry guys um Douglas thank you very much uh for the Super Chat I really appreciate it uh very kind of you um Oscar thank you as well for the Super Chat and the question uh Oscar asks uh Hey Anthony started carnivore a few weeks ago but I have troubles with constant belching hiccups after food and water tips uh just adjustment period uh that's that's been interesting you know um if you're eating anything else or drinking anything else or having any sort of you know flavoring in your in your um in your water or anything like that I would get rid of it uh try not drinking water around meal times okay and um uh you know sort of generally thought you know for at least like an hour usually two before and after meals just don't drink any water and that keeps your digestive enzymes much more concentrated and you can digest things better um you know also if you're just sort of swallowing air and things like that you can sort of belch hiccups this is more of a neurological issue and there's a lot of reasons for hiccups but I think that I think this is probably just pass on its own there's nothing there's nothing in meat or water that's going to really cause all that and Trigger all that so I would just just see how you go and then try not drinking try not drink water around meal times and uh and see how you go foreign can a carnivore die reverse gallbladder sludge and the pain that comes with it I think that it it can I mean there's we don't have studies looking at this but I've actually been uh talking to some generals trying for four years with uh some of the general my general surgery colleagues uh to like get a get a study like really showing that you can uh you know reverse gallbladder disease and sludge and even bile stones or at least prevent them um by going on a high fat anything diet because if you're just eating enough fat then you're going to stimulate your your gallbladder to secrete bile right so this is where gallstones come from this is where bile sludge comes from because your your bile stitch in your gallbladder but it doesn't just sit there and then overflow it concentrates and concentrates and concentrates and even in textbook it's described as concentrating up to 20 times more than um 20 times more than um uh you know than normal right so I'm sure there's some people that that concentrate even more than that but what what is so what has happened is that to any hyper-concentrated solution at rest a former precipitates it forms crystals that's what biosludge is that's what gallstones are and so even if you have a predisposition to form gallstones and bile sludge if you eat enough fat and buy enough fat I mean as much fat as your body has made bile for then it's physically impossible to make bile sludge or gallstones because there will be no bile in your gallbladder right so even if if you were going to form stones in one day which is not compatible with Life you know um babies would just be dying in the womb um you can't you still can't if you're eating enough fat because there will be no bile in your gallbladder right so this is this is um this is something that people should understand this is the physiology of of your body and your biology so if you have bile sludge in your gallbladder and you're eating fat this is going to excrete it's going to come out and squish it away and so I do think that you can do that yes okay um goodness uh the Graham thank you very much uh for the the Super Chat thank you uh Stan thank you as well I really appreciate it uh Stan asks hi doctor I'm strict carnivore mainly fatty beef should I worry about eating pork and chicken as well regularly as their fat is different from uh different being green fit yeah it is going to be different it's not as ideal as like you know grass-fed and finished you know beef fat or or you know venison that Moosh fat mousse is Delicious By the way anyone who's not eating moose like you should you know give that a shot is best tasting meat I've ever had in my life was Norwegian mousse and um so I think you're doing great you know if you're going to eat pork and chicken to see it see how you feel if you have autoimmune issues uh inflammatory processes probably probably best to avoid it there's no real Point um a lot of people with autoimmune issues have a worse time with uh pork especially chicken fish and even eggs like egg whites especially and dairy dairy in general can be quite inflammatory the different proteins in casein that they can be a bit more inflammatory there's like A1 and A2 proteins A2 is less inflammatory but it's still somewhat flammatory inflammatory so those are just some things to think about if you're feeling good on beef just go for beef if you want to try some pork and chicken do but just pay attention to your body and how you feel I feel better on beef I feel the best on beef I always have and so that's what I I'd mainly eat but sometimes I'll have pork like some uh you know crispy uh pork belly those are delicious um and uh and you know some I had I went to a restaurant I got like a whole duck uh it was amazing and some crispy pork fantastic you know I feel fine I don't have any autoimmune issues uh or any sort of problems um like that but I do feel better on beef but just see how you go just just eat whatever meat that you enjoy and it tastes good to you and that you can afford so that that's the main thing foreign thank you very much for the Super Chat as well it's very kind of you um there's a loving your 30-day challenge group thank you for all you do oh well thank you very much I'm really glad uh that you're enjoying that that's um for those who don't know this that's a challenge that that uh my partner and I uh my business partner Simon Lewis uh have put together to sort of give people added support um sort of like my patreon where I just sort of have these sort of community set up where we can help people and give them added added uh you know support we can actually talk to them you know I do try to talk to people on social media and answer questions on the comments and and direct messages I try to but uh I do get quite a lot of these things and they can they can get quite lost and um and uh at the moment I'm sort of um a bit behind on all that I'm a bit overwhelmed with it but I do try but with our carnivore challenge we're in a dedicated uh telegram group and so they're able to ask questions directly and and so that's not a problem and um and then we have weekly Zoom uh q a and check-ins and make sure everyone's on the right track and and getting helped out with that um and so yeah well thank you very much and I'm glad that you're finding it helpful um and uh hopefully it keeps being helpful and you do great uh Oscar thank you very much for the Super Chat as well um Oscar says uh thank you uh also I've had itchy red dots since starting sometimes itchy without any dots histamine intolerance or keto rash does it go away it really depends on what's what's causing the dots so that's something you need to sort of be aware of in your environment there's a lot of things that can cause you know contact dermatitis or other sorts of exposures that can that can precipitate a DOT you should also keep a food diary and look at the different foods that you're eating when you're eating them when you're getting these red dots in these rashes um or in these these itchy episodes um I you know I find when I get some like seasonings or spices in in the food that I eat you know it's going to be in a restaurant uh that I get itchy my face gets itchy my nose gets stuffy I start feeling like a bit uh you know tighter in the chest like I'm I'm getting some asthma and um and that's just that's just sort of the the defense chemicals doing their doing their thing and defending defending the plant so I would look at that that's exactly what you're eating if you're just pure meat and water then see what different meats and and the different ways you're cooking them see if that'll felt uh affect things differently uh it may not they may not have any connection um but if it is and you're eating these certain things you're getting this reaction after those things well something in it whether it's histamines or whether it's 100 other things whatever it is it's doing something that you don't want so so uh just avoid that thing or you could see that they had has no relationship to what you're eating and when you're eating it and then that means there's something else in your environment that's doing this okay um stunt man on the loose uh thank you very much for the Super Chat I appreciate it um thoughts on Carnivore while dealing with ulcerative colitis all this is yeah you're in urine for a good time I've been on Carnivore for two months symptoms have drastically dropped but still minor bleeding finally no medication but want full remission I I think that that's fully attainable that's on the ulcerative colitis and Crohn's but but more so ulcerative colitis are very very responsive to a carnivore diet or any Elimination Diet because you're really just getting rid of these things there are studies um you know large randomized controlled trials with an elemental diet which is eliminating out it's like this you've probably come across as like this liquid powder stuff that just has the Pure Nutrients that you need and nothing else and you go on this liquid diet it just has you know fat and proteins and things like that um and you want to get the ones that don't have any carbohydrates in it generally those are ones made for uh you know pediatric epileptics because they really can't they really need to be in ketosis uh you find that these these have um better efficacy than in treating flare-ups of UC and Crohn's than steroids okay that's crazy you know and so it's um what does that mean that means that there's something that you're eating that is causing your flare-ups right so you just eliminate all that stuff out and the stuff goes away so as I alluded to earlier if you have an autoimmune issue like ulcer colitis you need to be as close to grass-fed and finished beef and lamb as possible because there's going to be things even in meat even in pork chicken fish Dairy especially and eggs especially egg whites that are going to uh be a trigger for your autoimmune issues so I would get down to as close to well you can you can certainly go down to you know uh grain finished beef and lamb and just water today and that will almost certainly get rid of all of your problems and if that's just not quite enough then you you're going to need to Source some some grass-fed and finished Lambs you can buy a whole lamb and just eat that for a few months and it'll go away you know I have no doubt in my mind I've seen people after three months on on a full carnivore diet really sticking to red meat um have negative biopsies um at three months I've literally never seen someone go longer than three months and not get a negative biopsy you know by doing things you know pure in that way with just red meat so uh just that that's what I would suggest just red meat and water um black tape green lime a good name uh thank you very much for the for the Super Chat I appreciate it um question is I'm going through a massive carb and sugar addiction yeah that's uh unfortunate a lot of people are stuck in that same situation what are your suggestions to get out of it every time I try to fail it's difficult you know it's it's it's difficult and every situation is unique but like any addiction you can you can break the addiction um and generally takes about two weeks um a lot of these additions sugar addiction uh you know gives dopamine response to your addiction centers of your brain Just Like Cocaine heroin and meth and so this is going to have some withdrawals and you're going to um you know have cravings and things like that and so that lasts about two weeks generally nicotine lasts about two weeks generally to get over that chemical addiction so so keep that in mind there is a lot at the end of the tunnel you you make it you make it two weeks you should be out of the actual addiction side of things and then it's just oh I remember that cookies tasted nice you know and then you might sort of buckle if you are tempted I think the best way of doing this has actually been shown in in studies um uh Dr Chris Palmer from Harvard he's a psychiatrist there he talks about a lot of studies using a ketogenic diet showing that people withdrawing from drugs and alcohol actually have a much easier time um getting off of those drugs and withdrawing and abstaining when they're in ketosis and in fact for alcohol you actually you can get seizures you can get very very hurt by withdrawing the people that were in ketosis actually needed less benzodiazepines to help them get through their withdrawal which is interesting you know I mean there's there's something different happening chemically in your body it's not just in your mind and so I would I would try a carnivore diet I would at least try a keto diet and just when you feel those cravings you eat fatty meat and in fact you try to head it off before that so as Dr Baker has said you know someone said how much meat do I eat on a carnivore diet and he said eat as much meat as you need to to not get cravings for carbs and sugar so that's what I would suggest eat a ton of fatty meat and you know when you're full and you're stuffed on good nutrition your your Cravings are going to be much much much more reduced and also if you can everyone's a logistical situation is different but just throw out everything non-carnivore in your house just just empty your fridge you know you can go on my Instagram and you can scroll down towards the bottom I have a picture of my fridge it's just just meat you know it's like a it's like a you know a butcher store um and so you know I would I would just do that get rid of everything that's uh you know Carbon sugar related and um and just fill up on fatty meat just that's it and uh and just remember there's a lot at the end of the tunnel after two weeks you're free just do the best you can man and if you mess up just get back on it just keep going you're not out of the club no one hates you you can just get up and go again and you'll get further the next time and just keep going until you get through you know and uh you know you fall down you just get right back up and keep going that's what you do so good luck with that I'm you know I'm sure that you'll get there uh Dr chafee what meat to Fat ratio would you suggest for a person with Ms just the same meat to Fat ratio that I would suggest for anybody else you know just as much meat and fat as you need you know aim for you know a gram for gram and then adjust from there and just make sure you're getting enough meat and fat the main thing with things like Ms is not eating all the other things that are going to precipitate the MS um some what is his requested join I've never actually accepted anybody's request to join and so I don't know um so I don't know I don't know maybe maybe I'll try one of those one day uh great um so uh Jay fed uh thank you very much for the Super Chat I really appreciate it uh thanks Dr chafee you recently saw a podcast where you brought up a patient with ehlers downloads it is rarely discussed so I appreciated it very much I also have ehlers-danlos and am autistic and the carnivore diet has been amazing well that's awesome I'm really glad to hear that um yeah that was something that was really really um you know I really like seeing as well uh was it people with ehlers download syndrome can actually resolve their issues I actually have a patient at the moment in my clinic who has Elders downloads and he said that after a few months his his situation was was extremely different so he would daily wake up with a joint out of place out of socket shoulder out of socket you know elbow wrist fingers all bent around just because we're moving at night and they just pop out um ehlers-danlos is a is a connective tissue disorder where you get hyper mobile joints and so you can get a lot of dislocations and damage and arthritis early on and um and so uh he said that after about three months on a carnivore diet he had no dislocations or maybe it wasn't even three months maybe it was only a month but he stopped getting dislocations altogether and now he he doesn't have joint pain he doesn't uh you know uh you know just dislocate his joints when he's doing strenuous activities and you know he has uh his uh family has like you know ranches and farms and things like that and um so yeah so that that's awesome and and we're seeing more and more that um autism is is extremely benefited by getting proper nutrition for your body and your brain and getting off the cars because the carbs cause harm and they disrupt the the Natural Energy signaling and functioning of your brain your brain is supposed to run on ketones there are parts of your brain that run on glucose most of it runs on ketones and it wants ketones preferentially so I think that that's great that you found that I'm really really glad that that it's been helpful for you hopefully you can you know be in groups with other people with similar conditions and encourage them to get on the same track and um and help their help themselves as well especially when people are younger with uh autism your brain is still developing when you're younger and you can actually reverse a lot of a lot of the the you know developmental issues that you had and so it's the earlier you catch it the earlier you address it the earlier you go on a hot on a high fat meat base at least ketogenic diet if not full carnivore diet the better your brain will develop better in your children's brains will develop better whether or not they have autism and it's obviously especially important if they have a condition like that so um you know I just encourage people to look into it there's a lot of literature out on the subject Dr Chris Palmer writes about it in his book Brain energy which is fantastic I encourage everyone to read that book we're currently reading that in the book club in my in my patreon group and it's fantastic so um I think everyone should should know about all that Mystic skills thank you very much for the the Super Chat I really appreciate it um seven weeks strict lion diet so that's just you know beef and water off six medications awesome and I'm on day six of detoxing from eight years of daily cannabis use and three years of opioids for severe IBS and Interstitial cystitis this way of eating saved me well that's that's fantastic I'm really glad to hear that and you know and that's just goes into what I was just saying there with with addiction um again in Dr Chris Palmer's well Professor Palmer's book He's a professor of Psychiatry and Harvard that you know that he writes about that in his book um that people are able to beat their addictions to very serious uh narcotics and and drugs when they're on even just a ketogenic diet it makes a big big difference so that's that's fantastic I'm really happy for that I'm happy to hear that really well done okay cool um I've been a Beer Drinker for 10 years zero carb beer clean now does the alcohol and beer act the same as fructose or is or is it the carb accompanying the alcohol that is a problem no yeah no alcohol uh is is what what carbs the problem alcohol is also a problem and so alcohol obviously does a lot of you know bad things in your system and is broken down in your liver it's detoxified in your liver but the breakdown products it goes into are not ideal those breakdown products actually cause harm as well they go into fatty droplets that's where fatty liver comes into and you sort of sequester this fat there and um and a lot of these Downstream products cause harm and cause liver damage and peripheral insulin resistance and can precipitate atherosclerosis heart disease and other you know degenerative processes uh so yeah so and and it has been shown by the University of California San Francisco biochemistry Department that fructose and alcohol get broken down into the same substances and so they they all cause the same harm once they're broken down into those into those substances um question new study out this week that says there are no benefits to intermittent fasting what are your thoughts well I haven't read the study so I don't know about that there are certainly a lot of studies that tout the benefits of intermittent fasting I suppose it's how they design the study how they put it together and if it if it actually showed what they they aim to show with it so um if you send that study along or DM me on Instagram with the study I'm happy to take a look at it and and talk about it uh the Graham thank you very much for for the Super Chat I really appreciate it um he says I believe the addictions are attempts to improve life or I believe that all addictions are attempts to improve life so anything healthy that improves life probably will help with bad addictions too that that's a very good uh way of looking at it you know you're just trying to be happier and enjoy things more and you're sad and you're upset and so you turn to these sorts of things and um and then you you your brain starts working better your body starts feeling better and you don't need those things anymore so I think that's very plausible uh explanation for that uh yeah um have you seen anyone get relief from inflammation caused by disc herniation I'm 17 days into Carnival losing weight feeling great but so far very little relief with inflammation yes I have it depends on what hey you know issues you're getting are you just getting back pain is that herniation hitting on to a nerve causing the impingement and radiculopathy down a specific dermatome um either way yes it can help I've seen it help a lot of people in that exact position that is a that is a condition that I'm very familiar with and I've seen people do very very well with that there are neurosurgeons that I've spoken to around Australia and the world that are actually doing this and actually treating people uh with a ketogenic carnivore diet to improve their symptoms from discogenic back pain and radiculopathy so yes that is something that can help so just be patient just just eat meat drink water it's not going to fix everything it's not going to cure everything but it can certainly reduce the inflammation and the and the pain and of symptoms experience it's not going to fix everyone every time but it can it it will help so just keep it up um tired looking for a name uh thank you for the Super Chat I appreciate it uh thanks for a constant stream of valuable information you know you're very welcome I I do hope this is helpful for people and as long as people are interested and and um uh you know and and want to know more I'm happy happy to to answer it I think this is something that is very beneficial to everyone um I've sort of looked into this and studied this uh very very in-depth the last five years and it's built on really 25 years of uh serious study into biology and you know human biology and nutrition and botany and cancer biology so all of these things add up and then so I'm happy to um you know share what I've uh what I've learned and what I've thought about and figured out um do you want an uh huddles Otis anyway sorry butchered your name but thank you very much for the super chat um 100 carnivore for a month colitis not flaring as bad that's great um gastroesophageal reflux disease has improved great I'm thinking it takes time um it takes time to fully attenuate these problems with the diet uh lactose free butter seems to help uh yes absolutely I mean like you know Rome wasn't built in a day and your damn your body wasn't damaged in a month you know so you're getting more than a month to heal um you know when when you reverse a lot of diseases and you you drop you know 80 pounds of weight in six months I mean you're doing really well um you know like people talk about how you you go out into the woods and you you walk 10 miles into the woods uh well you got to walk 10 miles back and that's sort of how you can think about it with your uh with your health you know you've spent 20 years mucking up your body and mucking up your health well it's going to take time to come back it's not going to take 20 years but um you know you've already made significant improvements in just a month so you know I would be very happy with that and and that's just that's just signs of you know good things to come so just keep it up uh Stefano thank you very much for the super chats very uh very generous of you appreciate it um I became aware of Keto 10 years ago adhered to it for six months at a time and since I'm in and out um healthy fasting Etc I completely I'm completely carb addicted develop diverticulosis uh flare up recently and keto carnivore completely cured this what that's fantastic and you know what that that's the funny thing is that we talk about how important and beneficial you know fiber is and don't eat meat and all these sorts of things and what do surgeons tell you to do when you have diverticulitis don't need fiber right eat things that have a low residue that you're going to absorb that have high bioavailability you're just going to absorb it's not going to create a lot of waste that is meat that is what meat is meat is the perfect example of that and so um there was a study with over 2 000 people doing colonoscopies and seeing people's risks for diverticulosis and they found that the only things even correlated with increased risk of developing diverticulosis which is just the out pouching and the diverticulitis is the infections of those out pouches that that the only things um associated with it were increased fiber intake and increased number of bowel motions a day right you're just wearing out the organ and it gets worn out so constipation wasn't a risk factor meat wasn't a risk factor fat wasn't a risk factor you know the only risk factors were fiber and number of bowel motions and fiber and bowel motions go hand in hand right because you cannot break it down you cannot digest it it has to go out you know people talk about oh well you can't digest meat it just sits in your in your in your gut for 10 years how okay I've eaten hundreds of pounds of beef this year like there's there's nothing in it right and um you know that's because I'm absorbing 98 of it you're right it doesn't come out because it went in it stayed in uh into my body into my bloodstream and fiber you actually can't break that down it doesn't matter if it is there for 10 years or 20 years or a thousand years you don't have the enzymes to break down fiber period you can never break it down so what happens if you you can't use it you can't break it down you can't absorb it it goes out the other end that's what waste is it doesn't just sit there there's not just like a like a bag sitting there oh there's meat just sitting here there's a one-way tube you know I mean I I saw through that when I was setting you know oh it's just sitting there how how how can it possibly sit there for 10 years did you not go to the bathroom for 10 years probably not you know so if we weren't digesting steak if we weren't able to absorb it it would go out just like fiber but in fact it's fiber that we can't absorb and break down but we've we've just been told this and then we're not thinking about it right they're all you need to eat a bunch of plants because it's so much more easy it's so much easier to digest you can't digest it you know meat you can Digest that's the easiest thing in the world to digest you can't digest plants and yet we've been told that it's the other way around and instead of thinking about it and thinking like actually that doesn't make any sense people just bought into it and they get so invested in it and they get so angry when you point this stuff out but it's a it's a fact it's true you can't break down fiber it just goes out you know you can absolutely break down meat with that stays in uh so Terry Terry thank you very much for the Super Chat I really appreciate it uh what is your opinion of stevia leaf extract and monk fruit once in a while same thing as my opinion of cigarettes and cocaine once in a while if you want to do it that's your choice but it's nothing that I want to put in my body because it's not good for you it's not something we evolved on it's not something that uh is is going to provide benefit to us it can cause harm it can cause addiction it can cause hit your limbic system make you remember that sweet taste and that sweet flavor make you go hmm I want something sweet again and then you sort of go down the whole uh you know spiral of uh you know ending up in uh you know in a motel two weeks later covered in in Krispy Kreme dusts you know so I don't know that's this is not a that's just not something that I personally think that that is is worth it to me I mean you get something that tastes a bit nummy and and causes harm well that's the same that's the same relationship that we have with drugs you know we know smoking is bad for you we know cocaine is bad for you we know drinking is bad for you and yet people do it because they enjoy the the experience of it at the time and so you know they and I enjoy this experience of it at the time and uh and they say okay well I'm willing to accept the REM the repercussions the ramifications of that so you can say that with stevian monk fruit and you sure that's not as bad as Alcohol Tobacco or cigarette or or cocaine that I know of uh but it's but it's still not good for you it's still not adding benefit to your health and and so where I'm coming from I like Optimal Health I like feeling my best all the time and you know what meat doesn't need stevia like steak tastes good without it and that's what I eat anyway so um that's my my two cents on that um but you know do whatever makes you happy and if you're going to have it every now and then I would just make sure it stays every now and then because it's very easy to get these things these addictive substances start every now and then and become all the time and and then other things get added in as well and it's a slippery slope because you start making concessions for one thing you're going to make it for a dozen other things and then you're back to eating the way you were before and and um you're not going to be doing as well uh bad monk thank you very much for the Super Chat I really appreciate it um they ask hello doctor is chicken and eggs diet optimal B for mostly red meat is not available here in India thank you very much uh you've helped me tremendously well I'm really glad to hear that and um you know and that's totally fine you know just eat the meat that that you have access to that makes you feel good and uh and that that you enjoy and um you can get lamb Lamb's great if you can get venison venison's great uh but if you can't chicken and eggs are perfectly fine you know if you have autoimmune issues you know that that might be a bit more of a touchy subject but you know if the chickens are eating natural you know things going around eating bugs and you know other chickens then uh then you're gonna be you're they're going to be a lot better than sort of store-bought chicken and eggs so that's totally fine if you feel good on those then just go for it uh Teddy honeybunch thank you so much for the uh the uh the Super Chat I really appreciate it um hi Dr chafee I've been carnivore for about five months uh when I have severe pain oh when I have severe pain I can't eat animal-based food uh it happened a couple times do you know what causes this of a cancer patient well well that's a good question I think that's something that that we would need to sort of explore a bit more if you want to DM me on uh Instagram I will try and I'll try and find it uh there but uh the main thing is you know where is your pain what's causing the pain you know sometimes people can have cancer and that you know like if you have bowel cancer say you know you can you know any sort of residue that goes in it can it can sort of push on that and be uncomfortable usually it's actually fiber that causes a problem because that's the bulky that has bulkiness to it that's pushing on this cancer in the bowel and that that can cause pain um so you know I can't think of anything that would be in meat that would would cause pain for cancer I guess it depends on where the cancer is and what else is going on and what else you're eating um but you know one thing that that can be very good for cancer is just fasting you know if you look at my interview with Professor Thomas Seyfried you know he's one of the world's experts in cancer biology and and how it relates to nutrition especially and so he's um you know he's shown that you know if you reduce your glucose increase your ketones the starves out cancer cells because cancer cells are very reliant on on glucose and this is something that we've known for 100 years um of the work of a Nobel Prize winner Otto Warburg cancer cells need 400 times the amount of glucose that normal cells do and cancer cells cannot run on ketones like normal cells can and so you go into ketosis and your fasting and your blood sugar is down and you're depriving these cancer cells nutrients your body's doing fine because it runs on ketones uh that can be fine so if you find yourself not being able to eat animal based I I still wouldn't eat things that are going to be harmful so maybe take that period of time to just fast for a little bit I don't think that you want to do that too much I don't you don't want to go losing weight and and hurting yourself but maybe strategically fast around those times at the very least I would not eat carbohydrates if you had to eat something else besides meat or animal based I would I would definitely not eat carbohydrates because that is fueling the fire of your cancer so some things to think about anyway okay um there we go blessed seven family thank you very much for the Super Chat I very much appreciate that um 51 year old woman uh hold on a second yeah so 51 51 year old woman stroke in 2017 now completely off uh blood pressure medications and cholesterol I've been all carnivore since July great so grateful uh thank you Dr chafee for your genuine concern and helpful advice well thank you very much I really appreciate that and I'm really glad that it's been helpful you know this is one of those things that I just sort of started doing because I was interested in it and I thought that it wouldn't it could help people and I had no idea if it would uh you know be interesting to anybody except me and um uh but I'm really glad that that people are picking it up and finding it interesting and using it to help their lives out that actually really makes me very very happy so I'm very glad to see that thank you for sharing that Kim Kraft thank you very much for the Super Chat it's very kind of you good to see you uh Kim craft again thank you again and uh and a charger Mopar good to see you buddy eating a steak in in front of your phone um see here and uh phrase I'm sorry I'm not gonna pronounce that right if I did it's by pure luck uh thank you very much for the Super Chat uh they ask why does the brain naturally prefer sugar if it's bad so that's the thing you know that's something that people say it naturally prefers but it it doesn't actually it depends on how you look at it or it depends on if you look at it if you look at it you'll see that even if when your blood sugar is high if your ketones come up to a certain level it'll dump out the glucose and just run on ketones so once you reach a threshold your brain will exclusively run on ketones certain parts can only run on glucose the majority of it this applies to with the ketones so it is claimed I think erroneously that the brain's primary resource and fuel is sugar because when we're in our primary um primary metabolic State you know when we're eating we're in a Fed State uh your brain is mostly running on glucose it is still running on ketones your brain always runs on ketones it has to run on ketones to a certain extent um that they're like okay well this must be what it primarily runs on because this is your primary metabolic State So that's its primary nutrient Source but again I disagree with that I don't think that's our primary metabolic Source I think that our so-called fasting metabolic state is our primary source I think we call the FED say our primary State Because by the time we're able to look at biochemistry at a molecular level everyone was eating carbs right and so I said oh when you eat it looks like this and when you donate it looks like that it's like yeah when you eat anything except carbohydrates it also looks like that and you know when I eat 5 000 calories in rib eye I am not fasting that is not a fasting metabolism right so that is misnamed right so when you're in your primary metabolic state or just have higher ketones your brain will quick click over and just run on ketones and those certain areas of the brain will run on on glucose um also it's not that blood sugar is bad or carbohydrates per se are bad it's that exogenous carbohydrates exogenous sugars eating foods containing sugars plant sugars because there are carbohydrates in meat of course and glycogen and things like that but plant sugars and plant carbohydrates the reason that the that is bad that is not what your body wants that disrupts your body's normal um biochemical processes and so your blood sugar goes up artificially your body freaks out goes oh my goodness this is going to kill you because high blood sugar damages your body these glucose molecules physically fuse to other molecules called glycations non-enzymatic binding of those uh carbohydrate molecules to other molecules and it damages them irreversibly in most cases so um that is harmful and so our bodies look at that and go sweet Jesus what is this idiot done and it slams up your insulin to try to get this stuff out of your system as quickly as possible but that insulin disrupts a lot of your uh hormonal and biochemical processes a lot of them you know it can precipitate you know blocking the conversion of testosterone into estrogen and the ovaries in women so they get you know too high AI testosterone to low estrogen they can develop PCOS and everyone it can actually precipitate high blood pressure as well it can cause a lot of problems a lot of problems and so it's um it's just something to understand that it's not something you want to take in we make all the blood sugar glycogen and and ketones that we need you know we don't need to bring in extra carbohydrates we make carbohydrates you do not need to bring them in Brenda shoot thank you very much for the Super Chat I really appreciate it um and it's rexis there's also uh very generous thank you very much for the Super Chat that was very kind of you hi Dr chafee carnivore seems touted as a fat loss diet however I'm somebody who needs to gain weight who still struggles from inflammation is carnivore feasible for someone wanting to put on weight yeah so I don't think of it as a fat loss diet you know this is not a quick you know crash diet to get you in your your high school you know prom dress again and uh and then you know go back to eating cake and pies this is the optimal diet for human beings and so this is going to be optimal for every person in every situation at every stage in life and so if you need to put on weight you need to gain Health lose weight this is this is for you if you just want to optimize yourself if you even feel amazing I thought I felt amazing my whole life I played very high level Sports and worked very hard to be in very good shape and feel good what I thought was good all the time then I got all this garbage out of my system and I realized that I felt a thousand times better than I've ever felt my entire life and I realized looking back that I felt like garbage my whole life and I was not okay with that I was not happy with that and I did not want that for other people as well so if you want to put on weight and by weight I'm assuming you mean healthy weight like lean muscle mass then carnivore is absolutely the way to go I've never been able to put on uh lean muscle mass faster and easier than on a carnivore diet you're you're taking in all the building blocks what are you doing you're trying to put in lean muscle mass right you're trying to build meat okay eat meat that's exactly what you need to put on meat is more meat so you need to lift weights exercise be physical and eat a lot of meat and don't force feed yourself your body knows what it's doing just give it just give it what it's asking for keep eating meat with the fat on it until it stops tasting good and that's pretty much it okay I'm Barber shoot again thank you very much that was very kind of you and black tape green lime thank you again for for the Super Chat uh they ask thoughts on Thor's on women I'm assuming that's thoughts on women on keto carnivore women's hormones do play a huge part on cravings and energy levels do you think we should approach the diet differently no I don't I don't think you have to approach it differently you know there's no examples of of females of any species that eat differently than the males right so you may eat less but you still need to eat the same thing and again you need to get enough meat enough fat enough protein and yes it absolutely uh will optimize your hormones for men and for women like I mentioned just getting rid of carbohydrates really helps with PCOS which is the leading cause of infertility in women and again insulin blocks the conversion because women first of all you start with with cholesterol so you're not getting enough cholesterol not get cholesterol in your diet you're not going to make enough hormones because your hormones are made from cholesterol we make about we only make about 70 of the cholesterol that we need you need the rest from your dietary intake Okay so you need this for your normal hormonal health so you're not getting enough cholesterol and you're not getting enough fat you're not going to be making the the the hormones that you need there are many many hormones between cholesterol and uh estrogen the last one being testosterone so women make testosterone first and that gets converted into estrogen in the kidney and then the ovaries insulin blocks that so insulin will block the conversion of testosterone into estrogen so the testosterone will be much too high estrogen will be much too low and you will get serious hormonal dysregulation so that and many other reasons you know there are different plants that are hormone disruptors there's a lot of phytoestrogens like in soy you know there's there's I don't know 10 or 20 times the amount of phytoestrogens in three ounces of soy than a fertile woman will make in a day there's 50 times more phytoestrogens in those three ounces of soy then in the birth control pill so these are these are not what you want in your body if you're wanting to optimize your hormonal health and there's other things that can block your estrogen and block your testosterone and derange things in other ways because the plant is trying to mess you up the plan is saying you eat me I'm it's going to cost you all right they do not want it to be advantageous for you to eat them because they die when you eat them so you know just like you know animals can run away or fight back they've got horns they can kick they can fight they can bite they have defenses they have ways of stopping you from eating them because they don't want to be eaten either no living thing wants to be eaten okay so you know you need to understand that and different living things have different defenses and the defenses of a stationary plant or fungus or algae is that they use these toxins and these biotoxins and defense chemicals to stop you from eating them and to get sick and to get poisoned if you do and to sequester nutrients and make it hard for you to function properly and to get any nutrients from this a lot of the nutrients are are bound up in ways that we don't have the enzymes to break down because we're not designed to eat those plants they have other things like phytic acid oxalates tannins that bind to different nutrients and make them completely unavailable we cannot get rid of these sorts of things someone's asking about estrogen and raw milk I don't know how much estrogen raw milk but it's it's nowhere near the amount that's in um that's in soy and one of the things too that people talk about you know like red meat I actually had a a patient that had breast cancer and her oncologist said you know don't eat red meat because it has all this estrogen in it so it was already supposed to eat about a bunch of plants basically right seed some tofu my Jesus there's 3.9 nanograms of estrogen in a hormone-treated cow in three ounces of lean hormone treated beef okay there's over a million nanograms of phytoestrogen in uh three ounces of soy okay little different the birth control pill depending on the pill has about 35 000 nanograms of estrogen a fertile woman makes over 150 000 nanograms of estrogen so you go so 3.9 nanograms in in meat like who cares that that means nothing it means nothing you know and yet we've been told that this is a big deal all these hormones that are put into it no no this this is a drop in the bucket it's not doing anything and it's a it's a con it is just a con and it's a a marketing trick to sell their garbage and their slop and just don't buy it meat is our natural diet meat is good for you meat is what we're evolved to eat meat is what we're supposed to eat we are not supposed to eat plants we are not designed and adapted to do that safely like a cow is but cows are not designed and adapted to eat all plants they eat very specific plants they eat grass and they don't even need all grasses they eat specific grasses so you know sheep and cows you have them in the same pasture because they eat different grasses right so they can coexist they're not competing for resources okay so this is very very important to understand this uh and Esther borosh oh very good to see you thank you very much for joining um says Dear Dr Chaffey have you checked out the the dutronomics course by Dr Wars I haven't yet but that is something I definitely plan on doing um deuteronomics is the study of deuterium um and biology in our body very interesting for people that are interested in that uh please check out the interview I did uh with with um Dr Laszlo borosh who's a professor emeritus of pediatrics at the school of medicine at UCLA as a research biochemistry researcher there at UCLA for for decades and now he's um uh teaching deuteronomics uh in in Hungary and um and so that's something he has a course that you can check out online and that's something I'm going to do but uh do check that out um check out that interview I have with him and um and uh Dr Gabor Somali who's also uh you know one of the world's experts in uh deuterium so very very interesting stuff in how this affects your health and when you're in ketosis when you're in ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet this actually improves that side of things as well so another another piece of the puzzle as well okay all right guys well if we if we don't have any uh more burning questions I think we might leave it there it's been sort of an hour and a half and um L's passed out on on the couch next to me so I should probably uh get going but uh thank you everyone uh for for coming by I hope that was that was helpful for people and if you you like that and you thought this was helpful you know please share it with people and let them know um uh where they can sort of find these things and I'll somehow try to put up some some tags on the questions and things like that and or if someone is able to do that um and put up the the sort of the um uh the the timestamps on all this so I can put it on YouTube so people can uh you can sort of see the the questions and Skip and Skip around to them uh that would be very very helpful uh thank you guys very very much I am going to try to do these more uh you know potentially every uh sort of week or two and I'll do obviously I do these every week with my patreon group and so you guys are more than welcome to come there but you don't have to you don't have to pay for anything that I do that's just something that um can provide a little more support and so if that's something you want then then please come by but uh otherwise we'll see you here next time okay all right guys thank you very much and um we'll see you later and please do you know hit the bell and like And subscribe that really does help uh you know grow the channel and and get this out to more people the more people that are engaged the more people that like and uh comment uh the more it helps the algorithms and you know so if you're just I mean just say whatever just comment whatever just say anything the smiley face fire symbol like whatever the hell it doesn't matter it just it does help and it picks things up in the algorithms and and it helps get things out to more people so thank you very very much everyone I really appreciate it and uh looking forward to seeing you guys again yes I do want to do the quiz all right thanks guys"
