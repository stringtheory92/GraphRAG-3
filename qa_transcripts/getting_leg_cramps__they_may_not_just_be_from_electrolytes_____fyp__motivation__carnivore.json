    "transcript": "so a lot of people complain they're getting crabs like when they're sleeping or during the day or whatever what's the best way to overcome this yeah I mean you know the common the common thing is that you know people say oh you're electrolytes your electrol Electro electrolytes you know there's no real reason why you should you should have your electrolytes really unbalanced when you're on a carnivore diet um as opposed to a normal diet certainly as opposed to a normal diet because you really are getting everything that you need and you should not have to supplement um you might be in a particular situation where maybe you do but that's that's quite uncommon and you know maybe when you're transitioning possibly you could you know your your bodies are sort of figuring things out maybe but these are theoreticals um quite often people will take a lot of electrolytes you know they'll take the magnesium and potassium and things like that uh you know when we see people in the hospital with potassium issues you know low potassium we really don't see them having a lot of cramps they have heart arrhythmias that's the issue with potassium you know like it messes with your heart uh magnesium sure actually you know when people actually do get you know cramps in the hospital that's that's something we do look for like okay what's the Magnesium what's the calcium um you know because those things when they're too low they can they can actually you know cause cramping so those shouldn't be out of balance though they shouldn't be out of whack on a carnivore diet um but you know you you can experiment with that but what a lot of people find is that they'll they'll take a lot of electrolytes they'll up their soul their do all this sort of things in the last time I'm taking all these electrolytes I'm taking magnesium I'm taking calcium I'm taking potassium doing all this salt I'm drinking putting salt in water drinking ocean water and all these sorts of things you know I'm still getting cramps you know it's just like most commonly cramped from uh dehydration you know just not getting enough water and so you know and and especially if you're already supplementing you're just giving yourself a ton of electrolytes and you're still getting cramps well it's obviously not the electrolytes yeah because you covered that you know that that base and like and now you know it's something else and so generally you know people say oh I put some salt in water and I drink a lot of water you know drink that and then and then it gets better I was like yeah but was it the salt or was it the water exactly you know in most cases it's going to be the water and so that's what I suggest to people is like you know really increase your water and I I feel good you know leg cramps I've always you know gotten leg cramps if I get dehydrated you know I'm playing a game I don't I don't get enough water and I'm just running around to a high physical exertion and then that night I'm just like just waking up and just screaming cramped and uh and I could drink a bunch of water and then go away now I'll get that I go to the hospital when I'm there for 16 hours I don't drink water at all and I you know get home and you know I don't get enough and then I'm I have a foot cramps leg cramps and things like that drinking enough water gets rid of that you know I don't I don't take any electrolytes or anything like that some people may need to like if you have a legitimate sort of depletion you know people that drink a lot of coffee what is that going to do that's going to sap you magnesium and it's going to dehydrate you two big points in cramping so these people may get may get a lot of cramps maybe they do need to take some magnesium in that case but they also need the water and really what they need to do is start drinking caffeine in the coffee so that's the big one is is really you know if you're getting those leg cramps you know electrolytes maybe but really you know remember water you know because that that's a major one yeah for sure a lot of people will say um my potassium my calcium or my my magnesium are low and then we will sort of come back and we'll say well do you have any symptoms no I feel fantastic and then it's and then I'm kind of thinking well are they really low or are they kind of low to some sort of standard measurement that doctors have and you've done a blood test and you think they're low like for example with potassium is it actually common to have low potassium or is that is that an issue was it in the hospital sometimes you know it it crops up you know but um you know a lot of medications can screw with your potassium or your sodium sodium has a lot to do with hydration as well you know you can over hydrate you know and if you're um you know sensitive these sorts of things you can um sort of deplete deplete some of your sodium but yeah you really have to work at it you know you really don't have to work at it yeah and clean water is safe right drinking water is safe yeah especially you know if you're if you're drinking you can you can force yourself to do anything and then and then that's not that's not a good thing um you know and eventually drinking water will kill you they've done studies in this back when it was ethically possible to do that you know you just like just put a hose down um you know rabbits throats and and just fill them up with water and they just see how much water it takes before their cells actually start to you know go into dysfunction and they're going to organ failure because they have so much water in their body uh and so you extrapolate that out to you know an animal on our size and it's about 50 gallons okay so I don't I don't know of anybody who's going to be doing that anytime soon um but it's possible you know and um you know but if you're drinking to thirst and you're just you're not forcing yourself or anything like that but it's just every you know the water you're drinking is like yeah this this is good this is refreshing you should be fine you shouldn't have any issues with that okay awesome everybody drink more water yeah exactly that's it that's the bottom line you're not gonna do anything let's just drink more water it'll help your cramps you don't need that salty yeah yeah exactly yeah and and you know if you're eating more salt you're actually going to increase your your your your your body's uh desire for for water as well you know so um yeah take home is just just drink more water everyone everyone will likely benefit from drinking more water people don't realize just just you know uh how good it is and they feel a lot better uh you know when they start getting more water"
