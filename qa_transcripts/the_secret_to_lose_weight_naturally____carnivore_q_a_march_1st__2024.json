    "transcript": "one animal in the wild doesn't eat when there's food available and they're hungry you have a biological imperative to eat when you're hungry if you're withholding you're not quite eating enough your body's thinking well it's because it doesn't it's not accessible we don't have access to it and so it'll just slow down your metabolism less coming in less is going out that's all there is to it you're going to store hold on to your fat more so you want to encourage your metabolism you want metabolism to go up so you want to eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and let your body tell you when that is all right hello everyone thanks everyone for joining today's for the live for March 1 for me and then February 29th for for most everybody else so thanks everyone one for joining I am just taking a look here we've already had some some super chats um and uh also wanted to mention I don't know if people saw this on um on uh Lane Norton's but he made some stupid little reel where we took two seconds from from a podcast I saw of a three-hour podcast we go into Nuance detail about all sorts of things and just you know stating the fact that you know uh plants have known carcinogens in them and so you know the Brain Trust then cuts that out and goes on a whole tiid about oh well dose makes the poison and never points out what the dose is by the way so he says that there's poison but he doesn't say well that dose but and dose makes some poison but it doesn't say what that dose is right because he has no idea and so like why would you say that uh yes well there's a poison but it doesn't matter because it's a too low a dose well how would you know you don't know what the dose is you don't even know how much is in there you don't even know what's in there you're just saying yeah I'm sure it's fine and I say oh well there's a human TR data and the guy is such a spaz you know the human dat just like it's like a six-year-old got a YouTube channel and um so he said talks about the human data it's like oh wait there is some and it's like when I put out the randomized control trials you know they always say this that and the other uh he didn't provide a single randomized control trial so he put three uh links for studies in his in the little description not a single one was a randomized control trial he flashed a study title um in the in the uh video that wasn't a randomized control trial that was a systematic review of epidemiological Trials oh sorry there there was one randomized control trial in that list of 50 studies that they included in this systematic review and that was a randomized control trial where they took Frozen cabbage and used that as ice packs on women's breasts who were breastfeeding and had had swollen painful uh breasts and versus ice packs so it was a randomized control trial of using Frozen cabbage as an ice pack versus normal ice packs and some of the women said that they preferred the Cabbage better than the ice packs even though they gave the exact same objective uh reductions in inflammation um wow Lane I mean my goodness what rigorous studies you put forward I mean I am so impressed I I Chang my I I have to change my entire philosophy now off the the rigor of your of your studies and logic so then he goes on saying that you know he puts out these randomized control trials and people then um you know shift to say oh well but but some studies are are flawed and um um I'm not saying flawed I'm saying that they're crap those are stupid studies they mean nothing um you're talking about about people freezing cabbage and putting them on their breasts to reduce inflammation and you're saying that that's a a reasonable demonstration of the fact that that the poisons in Plants don't cause harm that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my entire life but of course he I'm sure he hasn't even read his own study he just looked at the headlines because he's a hack and so and then he says oh then they just go to the anecdote look at all these people so if he knew logic he would understand that's a logical fallacy called strawman uh I've never said that I've never said oh but but some studies are flawed when he pulls out that I've pointed out that every single study that he puts out is garbage it's absolute garbage and it doesn't compare what we're talking about the ones that did show you know cohort studies and different sort of epidemiological studies I looked at these damn things I went through all of the damn ones in this in the systematic review there's only one randomized control trial the rest of them are epidemiological and all they did was look at the difference between a standard processed food diet and people who ate more uh fruits and vegetables so again completely useless for what we're talking about right so it doesn't say anything about the question at hand which is are there harmful substances in plants objectively yes there are we've Quantified them we've named them shown them in uh countless textbooks studies and so on um and he just says yeah well I'm sure that I'm sure that they're fine um yes you know there could be poisons but yeah just eat an unlimited amount why would you say that I mean there I mean there's countless countless countless studies so is showing um the direct harm and human harm that are caused from eating certain foods hey buddy eating C certain plants getting cyanide poisoning getting oxalate poisoning um you know different tannins and other sorts of things causing harm cyanide is known to damage the mitochondria it's known to cause thyroid dysfunction and goers neurological dysfunction and even small doses small Contin ual doses uh ongoing and this is these are and things like cassava which are major uh Staples in the Tropics of hundreds of millions of people you know this actually comes into play and just saying no it's perfectly fine eat as much as you want is not only irresponsible it's just ignorant um and um so it looks like he's not even reading his own studies which doesn't surprise me he's just is just terrible studies anyway um and um and then he said there oh I could just keep going about all the different studies um like not not a single one not a single one compared what the populations that we're talking about Whole Food meat based diet with a whole food plant-based diet not a single one and not a single one was a randomized control trial you have to dig in to the systematic review that he referenced and there's one randomized control trial and it's about ice C on your breasts right so literally the worst PhD I've ever heard in my life I I I think they just have hand these out now I mean it's just like the um you know the the reduction in in uh quality of of um the education system now and just hand out phds like Pez dispensers I get apparently you know it's just it's just insane so one of the studies I swear to God I I get this as an example um oh and also in that systematic review that he says all this this randomized control trials you know because he's just six-year-old spaz um the own the author of his own study that he put forward says and I quote in the and I quote uh at the at the bottom it said says the quality of the majority 68% of the evidence in this systematic review was low right so this is low quality evidence the majority of these studies included in his systematic review that he thinks is just the end all be all this proves it this proves everything by the own by the author's own admission were low nearly 70% of the studies used were lowquality evidence I mean this is just hilarious that he thinks that this this has any meaning in the real world so I don't know if he's just not smart enough to realize that these were lowquality studies that none of them were rcts even though he said they were rcts um or if he just thinks his followers are too stupid to to look him up um probably both you know just like he's one of those guys that just looks at the headlines and just says yep that that that says what I wanted to say and then that doesn't check anything it's absolutely hilarious um one of the other studies um that again and it's epidemiological but um this this this proves that these plant toxins um are actually good for you um and and at least doesn't don't cause harm say oh these have anti-cancer effects they have health benefits and blah blah blah blah blah so so one of the studies that he put forward uh and I'll just talk about it here it's um it showed it it was a study looking at a couple thousand people down in Costa Rica having heart attacks and he said okay are these um are these toxins in um in you know the bras leafy green vegetables um the iso thio cyanides are these are these um beneficial right and uh or vegetables in general beneficial now these are known toxins and why do we know that they're toxins because our body reacts to them as a toxin by trying to detoxify them and clear them from the body right and there are some people that have genetic differences and they don't clear it as fast or they don't clear it as well and so they tried to differentiate out between these people that had a heart attack which they survived um and looked at to to to see that if the people that metabolized them better and got them out of the system uh did better than the people who didn't clear them as well so they were around in the body more and so if they're eating more of these things and they differentiate out to like you know low and uh you know low through high levels of there's four categories lowest um second lowest uh second highest and highest amount of of vegetables and things like that that they were eating and um so they separated those out and of the people that were eating the most veg vegetables they said okay let's let's see the genetic differences between these people and the ones were eating the most and had these toxins that they weren't able to clear you know does that is that beneficial for heart heart attacks now they found that people who ate more cruciferous vegetables had lower rates of heart attack um than the other groups right but again this is epidemiology you know can you what can you say about it's just oh well that's the only difference no of course there are a lot of other differences and and they actually marks them out they don't discuss them but they put them in the results table um so this group that had the most at the most vegetables this This lends into healthy user bias because they did other things that were healthy as well so this group also had the lowest rates of diabetes also had the lowest rates of smoking had the highest socioeconomic status had lower total caloric intake per day and the lowest sugar consumption per day there's a lot of differences there and um I'm sure there were there were a lot more so and then they looked at the ones that had the genetic differences the one who were able to clear the iso thyoides out better did better right so the ones that um the ones that had these these plant toxins bouncing around their system longer did worse had more heart attacks and so they even concl included well this could be that this is actually damaging to the heart uh to have these things bouncing around your system I mean dear Lord Lane read your own studies like it's not hard your whole point was that the the dose Mak the poison you have no idea what the dose is you never say it right you don't talk about how over 150 milligrams of oxalates a day can be a harmful dose and that half a cup of cooked spinach has 660 milligrams of oxalate you don't talk about the fact that real people in the real world have gone to the hospital or died from oxalate poisoning of 3.5 to four grams in a single dose you don't talk about the fact that thousands of people have gone to the hospital eating beans with lectin in them that were undercooked or or or or mis um you know wer weren't processed properly you don't talk about any of that because you don't know about that any of that because you never looked it up so why are you talking about something that you don't know and don't understand you're speaking out of pure ignorance and you do it in such a whiny aggressive way that people think that you must know what you're talking about because you're you know you just talk about it in such an exasperated way it is absolutely mindblowing that anyone listens to you it's mindblowing that anybody listens to this guy he's a he says he's a nutritionist and he eats Captain Crunch and Lucky Charms for breakfast if you meet a nutritionist or someone who claims to be a nutrition expert and they eat Lucky Charms or any other sugar cereal at any point in their adult life after learning this sort of stuff for and certainly as on a regular basis turn and run this is no one that you should ever listen to their advice is awful like it's is just insane saying um you know I mean you look at study after study after study talking about these different toxins um I'll read some of them to you from the CDC potentially any fruit or vegetable containing Cy cyanogenic glycosides cyanide containing uh molecules uh linamarin and amygdalin may be contributing to Total cyanide content um in health in health foods such as smoothies so stud's looking at smoothies normal smoothies that people eat on a daily basis and you know they have these raw food raw plant black seeds soy almonds almond milk things like that and these all or not sorry not this soy but the almond milk and um you know and these things can cause damage they can cause harm um and so they said that um that cyanide from lenam Warren for instance has been linked to a variety of Health ISS issues such as diabetes neurological deficits sensory or memory impairments and weight gain goers uh thyroid dysfunction um through damage to the adrenal uh and weight gain through the damage to the adrenal GL function moreover thos cyanide um metabolic byproduct of cyanide has been tied to goer growth and hypothyroidism the presence of cyanide in these drinks the drinks that people drink and so oh dose makes some poison yeah in the things that we're drinking in that dose Lane pay attention in those drinks um may not pose an acute threat of poisoning however this study suggests that a diet consisting of regular raw flax seeds whole fresh whole apples and or unpasteurized almond milk smoothie intake may result in chronic sublethal exposure to Total uh Cyanide and lead to those Health detriments that were listed uh above so this is so simple to look up it's just people are just too lazy to do it and then they try to conflate that the human data this is the human data Lane people go to the hospital they get sick eating these sorts of things your data is not data I don't give a how how almost reduction in swelling in someone's breast they get from Frozen cabbage versus an ice pack that is the least of my concern the fact that someone paid for that study is mindblowing and the fact that you would site that as a randomized control trial that proves that plants are good for you when ingested is shocking you should have your PhD revoked I mean who who gives out phds to people who can't think this is just absolutely insane so I will obviously be responding to that like I just did but I'll be making a short to just point out the idiocy of this man and the things that he says uh because he just tiresome to hear this guy go off about things that he has no clue about and think that he is just you know the end all be all every time that I do a response every time that I shut him down in the comments or in messages or in um or in uh response videos he never responds I wonder why because he has no response he just pretends like it doesn't happen if someone has a response and he just wants to bulldoze over them he starts swearing at them cussing at them and uh and and belittling them he talks all sorts of trash he talks a real big game and then you come back and point out all the flaws and his arguments nothing so he's lying he's pretending that you know he's winning all these algs he wins none of these things he just doesn't engage in them because he knows he's going to lose them and he says oh well I come with this I come with this logic then they say this then they say that none of those none of those things have happened none of those things have happened with me Lane uh because every time I come back and show the idiocy of the things that you're saying you're nowhere to be seen I tag you in the it too and you I share my story this guy this is the same guy who tried to say that humans were not apex predators and his proof of that or what he wanted to demonstrate as proof was that he challenged me to fight a lion a bear or a cougar with a spear and said well if you're an apex predator you should be able to do that okay people do that every day Lane right now there's a whole YouTube channel a guy goes grizzly bear hunting with Spears right that's a thing right and the massai they fight lions with sticks and they win right this is happening right now the fact that you don't know that these simple examples may not know that guy's YouTube channel but the Messiah really never heard of them if you don't know about these things if you can't think about them for a single second you have no business open opening your mouth um and then of course we had Spears for how many tens of thousands of years hundreds of thousands of years we had stone tools before that and yet we were taking out bully mammoths dire Bears saber-tooth cats all these sorts of things apparently our ancestors hunted cave Lions to Extinction and this is reported on the Smithsonian website and they said it was because because they they liked throw rugs that they had all these skins and all these furs and they really preferred The Furs and the skins of of the cave Lion now that may or may not be it may be that they were trying to get rid of a a competing predator in an area that were competing for sources and a danger to them but uh and then just used their their pelts as throw rugs because they had them but um but either way they hunted them to Extinction and yes with Spears laying so this is a man that doesn't even know how to use a dictionary and so I just posted that thing about the Cav lines I posted it about uh I posted the definition of an apex predator from Cambridge University uh dictionary and it said an animal that you know eats other animals and isn't often eaten by other animals don't have regular um uh predators and and that they are prey to right and in one of the examp examples it said humans are apex predators however they sometimes get killed in the Wild by other apex predators I mean this is this is a simple definition of term this man can't even look that up and then he makes a public post about this thinking he so great I respond in kind and oh look at that no no response he just pretends to his followers that he always has the last word that's his Persona he tries to drum up the man is um is is living a fiction in his own mind and and just trying to propagate this to other people um you can tell by the way he acts that he's probably pretty low self-confidence and um and a lot of a lot of past trauma let's say that makes him act like a petulant child um you know so the fact of the matter is is that this guy doesn't even look up his own Stu studies he lies he makes up that he says oh randomiz control Tru not a single one not a single one did he provide if you look at the references in in the studies he provided none of which were rcts you you find one one the one RCT in the reference section is about ice lettuce I mean the academic rigor that this man goes through is just staggering no wonder you know he he thinks so much of himself but in any case it's um it's it's pretty sad to me that this guy is tricking so many people into thinking he has uh you know anywhere more than you know two brain cells between his ears because it is just shocking how ridiculous his claims are he can't even look up a a dictionary definition um and and doesn't even check his own studies to see if they're an RCT let alone Al does it compare the populations he's talking about let alone does it actually say anything about plant toxins in the body and how they work and one of them flat out said that those plant toxins in uh the leafy greens actually G actually were associated with more heart attacks right more heart attacks and of course you know epidemi epidemiology is is flawed in in a number of respects and um yet the man doesn't seem to know that so this is something that um just is just wild to me that this guy um continues to pretend that he's relevant and um uh unfortunately some people are buying it but more people are coming around to the realization that he has absolutely no clue about what he's talking about so any case that's uh that's that's my little update and news for the day um and we'll get to the super chats we already got a number of them thank you very much everyone for for um submitting those I think today I've got about two and a half hours so maybe depending on how many more we get in uh we'll cut off the super chats in sort of an hour hour and a half or so just to try to make sure we get all the super chats unfortunately I I I'm not always able to get to all I apologize for that I do try to let people know please stop putting in super chats so that we can so that we can get to uh get to everything but unfortunately sometimes I can't I can't even do that um also if you guys could hit the like and share this on your social media to get more people to the live that's always helpful and that suggests this to more people um YouTube then puts this out to more people and then we get more people on we get more questions and we get um more importantly more exposure and then more people can see my rant on Lane which is which would be nice okay so first question is from Sunshine kiss Thank you for the Super Chat carnivore BBB e for seven months blood pressure 170 over 110 tried three days without beef um try three days without beef BP uh down to 120 over 80 does trimethyl alanine trimethyl anine okay uh or Omega 6 to3 ratio cause high blood pressure um not that I know of um there are different things like high homocystine which can be countered with more B12 more folate um that can help and then just insulin resistance you know when you get your after a given period of time insulin resistance will come down so I'm I'm so I'm I'm wondering if they're saying that BP is up to 170 during this time and then just tried three days without beef and then the blood pressure dropped down to 120 um well if that's the case you know just see how it affects you if there's something in there that's that's affecting your blood pressure negatively like that you know can you can just keep keep it out and uh track it so if you consistently see that that just when you don't eat beef uh your blood pressure comes down fine you know your body's reacting to something I haven't seen that before it's usually the opposite but if um that's how your body is reacting then that's how your body's reacting maybe there's something in there like you say that uh that could be triggering this off and and grain fed and finished uh grain finished beef can have more omega-6 six than you want um and quite low omega-3 sometimes as well so potentially but um you know just see how it goes either way if it affects you like that then you know just avoid it so just run some more experiments see how you go it could just be a timing issue and just eventually your your blood pressure was coming down but just see just self- experiment see for yourself you know what seems to affect it and um if it's if it's um uh the beef that you think is is causing the problem then then just eat other meats that's fine one thing that I just remembered about uh the lane thing before I forget he said that um he went off about zealotry and calling us zealots um you know a zealot is someone who's so fixed in their belief and they're and they're immune to facts and evidence the reason I think what I think is because of the facts and evidence evidence um he has not provided any facts or evidence that go counter to any of that right and yet more and more people are coming out with more and more evidence more and more studies looking at the Messiah you know if you think these these plants are so good you look at the Messiah versus yakyu in the 1920s and 30s where the Messiah who only ate meat blood and milk Were Far and Away the healthiest cohort in that study and that daki cuyu who ate largely plant-based they were far less healthy far worse developed they were shorter they were they were much skinnier and had less lean body mass they were 50% weaker they had worse dentition they had worse Health they had worse Health outcomes they had nutritional deficiencies they had other deficiencies and just replacing the nutrients in a in a part of that trial where they had prisoners um that were just sort of you know in jail for a peri period of time with the British uh that didn't fix them and get them better it wasn't until they replaced their normal diet of plants with meat that they started getting better from a health perspective these were people alive at the same time in the same area and similar genetics because they interbred right this is a golden study to look at what happens in the real world when people eat these Whole Food plant-based diets versus whole food meat-based diets and the and the difference was Stark and clear and at every point in um in our history and prehistory when humans switched from hunter gatherer Hunter really uh lifestyle to an agrarian lifestyle as quoted in a in a in a in a blurb from a Cambridge textbook on pale anthropology anytime this happens anywhere at any any time regardless of the crop that they went to the same thing happened the height and health of the people declined they shrank by four or five inches on average average male brain size went down by 11% average female brain size went down by 17% evidence of poor wound healing evidence of infections like tuberculosis shorter femurs that's associated with obviously shorter stature but stemming from malnutrition um C teeth Fallen Dental arches smaller Jaws all these sorts of things the exact same disparity is seen between the Messiah and the YuYu in that late 1920s study then 40 years later people say oh but look there's there's heart disease showing up in the Massi like right they started in including grains and plant-based foods during that time and so then the heart disease came up you know where it didn't come up in that long-term study looking at all the health outcomes of the Messi the Aku they didn't find any it doesn't mention heart disease anywhere right and then in the 1970s you start seeing it show up and now there are people in of the Messiah that have that have obesity problems diabetes problems heart disease problems denen problems those are the ones eating a more agrarian based diet those are the ones eating more modern plant-based uh or plant influenced diet because all of our all of our diets all of our tradition of our standard diets uh are plant-based right now the standard American diet is not a meat filled diet it's Lucky Charms like Lane is eating right it's 75 80% plant-based right so the difference in these in the studies that lane looks at looks at the difference between an 80% plant-based diet using processed food predominantly versus an 80% plant-based diet that uses more Whole Food and less uh processed food and a lot of other um confounders that that complicate the issue and uh as as part of us a healthy user bias so again I mean this guy wouldn't know academic rigor if it slapped him in the head so that's what you can look at those are the type of studies you have to look at you have to look at populations that are eating meat whole meat versus popul are eating whole plants but like Dr Garner from from Stanford said who is an out andout vegan activist you know uh I I saw a quote from him who knows was falsely attributed but said that he'd been a vegan since the 1980s he said not for health reasons he just likes being a part of the vegan community so we talk about zealotry we talk about people like lay Norton like Dr Gardner who won't shake their beliefs who won't stop what they're thinking in the face of the evidence Lane eats Lucky Charms he thinks that's a good idea that's that's if not zealotry it's idiocy and not being able to shake his ideas and not be able to look at competing information is the definition of zealotry I've read your studies Lane they're crap I read them every time trying to see if there's some sort of bright spot some hope that your brain isn't completely dead and every time I'm disappointed and this is no exception so that's the zealotry that's him being so locked in his ways no I I learned this in school therefore it has to be true you're a big boy now Lane you need to understand that a lot of things you learned in school were wrong um and a lot of things you're doing now is wrong um but you know people like Gardner who said that no no it wouldn't be ethical to to do that study to take people doing carnivore and people doing a vegan diet and and see the difference there right he said that wouldn't be ethical because we couldn't possibly do that because because um meat does doesn't have essential nutrients like fiber hate to break it to you doc but um fiber is not a nutrient in the first place so it can't be an essential one you don't get nutrition from fiber we don't break it down we don't absorb it right I mean you get a little bit of short chain fatty acids from the fermentation in your colon that may feed your inas sites may but it's not much it's not all that that much um you get far more from Ketone bodies that you produce yourself you far more from butter which gets its name from its high levels of butyrate which are these uh short chain fatty acids that we're speaking of so they're saying no no no we're not even going to study it because we already know the conclusion no you don't you've never studied it and in fact that's why you're not studying it because you're a zealot and you don't want evidence to go against your zealotry and the same goes for laye the guy doesn't even want to know the answer he just wants to keep pushing his ideology he wants to keep pushing his coaching packet and um and keep being a a you know self-aggrandizing uh influencer which I think is the most depressing occupation that anyone can get you know I do this I don't this isn't my job I have a job I patience in clinic I do surgery I see patients on on a weekly basis um you know I work six days a week generally I fit in things like this because I think it's important um but Lane doesn't have a real job he just it's full-time influencing it's full-time selling people on his program so he has to be the authority all the time or else people won't buy his his terrible terrible advice um you know I guess it works for some people but you know what like i' I'd rather you know actually help people than um than be a snake oil salesman and try to pretend that I know know everything when I clearly don't you know that's the thing you know that's what Thomas S says it takes a lot of knowledge to understand just how ignorant we are and I don't think Lan's gotten there yet he doesn't actually realize how little he knows and that's the scary part um you know no one the most learned person in history will never and has never even understood as much as 1% of the totality of human knowledge it's not possible and the totality of human knowledge is very Stark I mean that's very scarce for the amount of things there are to know about human knowledge is just infantes small right and no one will ever know more than 1% of that right so you have to have some humility and understand that there are things that you don't know and that you won't know and you need to have open mind um I had an open mind which is why I changed my thoughts this is why I changed my opinions which is why I changed my views which is why I do what I do now because that's where the evidence LED he's not willing to look at the evidence or think about the evidence he wants to stay in his box because that's what he learned that's what it's going to be that's where the human data shows no it doesn't actually Lane the human data shows that people get sick eating plants people the human data shows that we have suffered as a people as a civilization as a a species since incorporating more plants and that we're suffering more and more and more by The increased uptake of a species inappropriate diet this is a guy who again doesn't even know what an apex predator was or is and that we were them this is this is not this is not working in there properly so this is something that um you know is a problem for him maybe he'll come around eventually but um you know I I doubt it so and also he he goes off about you know telling people like well this is if you cut out plants and this oh well you have IBD IBS and you have fat sensitivity blah blah blah blah why are you making diagnosis why why are you trying to make diagnoses for people that you've never met before you're not a doctor sorry to break that to you Lan but you're not a real doctor and you never will be and you're not licensed to give medical advice and opinions and diagnoses on people's issues and to give a diagnosis about something that you know nothing about you're just guessing you're saying well people have problems they got better it's because of IBS and fat sensitivities how the hell would you know for everyone every time you got in your mind you know what causes the IBS in the first place buddy right so what causes IBD what causes any of these diseases what causes diabetes you know since we're reversing these things in clinical trials in humans not not epidemiology but actual Interventional experimental data we're reversing things like type 2 diabetes with high fat ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet and then you go back to eating the way you were and the diabetes comes back that's showing a cause and effect relationship you remove the cause the effect goes away you return the cause the effect comes back pretty straightforward and so that's the human data that's what the human data shows is that we can reverse diseases by changing people's diets to a more ancestrally appropriate diet and then we look at the human data of people like the akiyu and the Messi showing that the Messi they were eating more ancestrally appropriate diet like just a meat diet blood milk animal-based diet they don't get these diseases in the first place it's not until they start incorporating plant food that they start getting these diseases right cause and effect right that's the relationship that's showing there right but Lane doesn't know any of this because he doesn't want to know any of this it's willful ignorance you know it's out there you know I mean he he took that one little two second clip from something I said just stating the fact that plants have toxins in them or um carcinogens things that have been shown to raise your risk of cancer significantly and didn't listen to the rest it so he has no idea he has no idea what the arguments are he has no idea what the evidence is you know he just likes to cherry-pick and talk trash and that's um you know and that's pretty sad honestly it's a sad existence you know and it's hopefully something that more and more people will see through eventually so if people find that that um you know that re on his uh his his story you know leave a comment let him know what you think um I sort of hesitate to say that just because it just sort of raises his um you know his reach with that um and makes it makes the engagement go up which just pushes it out there um you know so sometimes the best thing to do is just ignore these idiots but you know the fact of the matter is is that um you know he just shouts down he tries to shout down anybody who uh shows what idiocy he's diling and um you know so people just have to tell him that he's completely full of it sometimes and so that's what we did here anyway I digress Laura rer thank you very much for the Super Chat hi Dr C and thank you 66-year-old lioness um triglycerides are 79 uh HDL 75 LDL 148 total to39 doc sent script for Statin uh before um um there her appointment on the 6th of March help me argue T3 T4 and and up TSH down that's great is my thyroid healed uh first time A1C test was 5.8 doc won't uh test for insulin you know your insulin's going to come down your fasting insulin is going to come down uh your hba1c will come down and um well I can't say that your thyroid is all the way healed but it looks like it's healing which is really good and um well you know you can just point out that that stattin um if you've had a heart attack this is the Staten Staten company's own data on their own product is it's never the product is never going to look Rosier than in their studies they found that in their published data that if you have had a heart attack and you're on statins long term for the rest of your life but at least five years that it will extend life by five days Days d a Ys days not months not Years days certainly not decades days and if you have not had a heart attack it will not extend life doesn't really look like a cause an effect relationship there if if cholesterol is causing heart disease and we reduce cholesterol you should reduce heart attacks heart disease and death from those uh maladies and yet we don't see that not really to any significant degree anyway so um you know you can point that out you can also point out that cholesterol was never the problem it was a scapegoat that idea was never put forward by a serious uh scientist independently that was put forward originally by the sugar companies as a scapegoat for sugar and so they went and found different professors and researchers that had a bit of clout and no morals and and paid them off to push that that idea that um it was actually cholesterol when it was more likely to be sugar and Seed oils and the processed foods that were much more prevalent at uh coming to be more much more prevalent at the time you can point that out you should watch uh further videos uh like mine called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease you could also point out ask about familial hypercholesterolemia and why is it that people with familial hypercholesterolemia are more like to have clotting disorders and people with clotting disorders are more likely to have clots in their arteries or veins and have problems in that of that nature um and that when you separate out the people with familial hyper cholesterolemia with what they call elevated LDL what I call normal and versus um those who had had the elevated LDL and the clotting disorder that it's only those with the clotting disorder that have increased rates of cardiovascular disease and the ones that just have the high LDL don't have an increased rate of heart disease it's the same as the general population and then point out that hopefully you took genetics depending on the country many countries don't require you to take undergraduate uh classes but if he did in America hopefully he actually took genetics and learned about population genetics and understood that the percentage of the Leal in a population does not change as a percentage of that population with the growth or reduction of that population unless there's a mass extinction event or a mass migration event that could change that so the same percentage of people that had familial hypercholesterolemia now had it in the 1800s when there wasn't a single case of death from myocardial infarction reported in the literature certainly not in America for the entire Century of the 1800s there was one obscure reference uh at a of a case report in the late 1700s where they said oh look there's looks like there's this thrombus in the coronary vessel isn't that weird we've never seen that before they do thousands and thousands and thousands of dissections and autopsies over the course of their career most doctors were primarily anatomists and they just did dissection after dissection after dissection after dissection which was a very common thing no one saw this stuff no one saw these these St strus and these these um clots and things like that on autopsy or or whatever oneof and then 130 years later the next one shows up in the in the literature in America the first recorded death from myocardial infarction proven on autopsy was in 1912 and they said yeah we don't really believe that they didn't believe that this was actually happening for another 10 years or so when more of these started showing up and then 10 years after that it's the number one killer in America so in that period of the 1800s there's the same percentage of people who had familial hypercholesterolemia and we didn't even have seed oils back then these so-called heart healthy polyunsaturated fats and the only reason do you know why we think they're heart healthy you know why we were told they were heart healthy because Proctor and Gamble who bought Crisco from the Germans in the early 1900s paid the American Heart associate a the equivalent of in today's dollars 20 million us to lie and say that Crisco the seed oil it's hydrogenated seed oil was better for your heart and better for your cardiovascular health than animal fats like butter and lard and tallum right this was fraud when we know this this is this is this is recorded in history this is recorded in the top medical journals in the world that you know the sugar companies made this stuff up that Proctor and Gamble paid off uh the AHA and all these other sorts of things these are facts and these are these are well-reported facts so you know the the fact that people like Lane don't know these things you know it's just that's that's their own fault you know the information's out there this is willful ignorance they could look this up they don't they choose not to um and so that's the thing so the entire 1800s you have the same amount of people as a percentage of the population with familial hyper cholesterolemia which invariably will give you heart disease and kill you unless you get on Statin which didn't exist back then and yet not a single reported case of death from heart attack during that entire time not a single one we had whole in textbooks of all the different maladies that we were seeing in the 1800s 1700s 1600s 1500s going back to galin in uh the Roman era and hypocrates before that no mention of heart disease heart attacks and all these sorts of things you go back further you get to the EBR papyrus in ancient Egypt about 4,000 years ago they knew what angina was they knew what diabetes was they knew what the signs were before someone had a heart attack but they were eating predominantly grains beer and pressed seed oils sound familiar right so if cholesterol were the cause we would have had way more heart attacks throughout Antiquity than throughout history because we've always we've always made LDL and they've always been a certain percentage of people that had familial hypercholesterolemia and yet we don't see any of these sort oh well people just didn't see it you can you can argue that to an extent but you know people like Galen were actually very very smart and they were describing certain things you know EBR Papyrus describes these things describes people having a heart attack they're like yep that's what that sounds like that's what an sounds like that's what heart attack sounds like you don't see that in literature with hypocrates you don't see that with Galen who wrote profusely you don't see that with the doctors that came after them you don't see that a single autopsy being done in the last few hundred years of of Dr Harvey William Harvey described the circulatory system the man did thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of dissections and autopsies and the man who described the circulatory system and showed that the heart is actually what pumping blood around the body and not the lungs he just he just he just wouldn't have noticed he just she's just too stupid to see that there's a big thrombus and clot in the coronary vessels really if this was so common if it was so prevalent why wouldn't he be seen one right this guy described the entire circulatory system he wouldn't have seen that you're kidding yourself so that's a long answer short answer is watch the video I did on uh called the truth about um cholesterol and heart disease and that goes through a lot of the of the facts and and data there's some new stuff there that I talked about that's not in that video but that video will really cover it uh especially with what I just said so good luck with that uh at the end of the day it's your body you know you don't have to take medications that you don't want to your doctor works for you right you don't work for him he's not your boss he doesn't get to tell you what to do uh it's good to listen to your doctor it's good to take their advice uh on board but if there's something that you feel strongly against and you don't want to do that is you are well within your rights to say look I appreciate it but I really don't feel comfortable taking that uh but thank you very much I'd like to focus on other things thank you um and you can even just point out and say look all my other markers are getting better um I I just don't I don't believe that the evidence evence is is strong enough for me to try to change my cholesterol levels when everything else is improving and my triglycerides are going down my HDL is going up and I feel better and my thyroid is getting better my A1C is getting better and all these other things are getting better you know I just don't I don't see how that follows that everything could be getting better and this is just all of a sudden trying to kill me that doesn't really make sense it'd be the one thing that would be getting worse if that is actually getting worse which I don't think it is so in any okay so good luck with that hopefully hopefully uh your doctor comes around and because this whole cholesterol theory of of heart disease really just has to go it's just nonsense Alvin kin thank you for the Super Chat is pork only okay I can only afford pork belly I ask this because pork is not ruminant meat I have eczemas wondering if it would work well it'll be better than what you're eating before but it also depends on what the the pig is eating if it's like Factory farm factory rais pigs they're giv a bunch of feed and corn and soy you know some of that's going to get through it's going to have a much higher level of linolic acid the Omega 6 is that you don't want uh that can cause inflammation oxidative stress in your body and could absolutely trigger your eczema so you can you can certainly try it most people do best with red meat if they have things like eczema or autoimmune issues but you'll still you should still do a lot better um than than you would be eating all the other things that you're eating so definitely give it a try um but if it's not if it's not as good as you want it to be just remember that red meat will will probably sort it out uh and good luck with that hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor cornivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys Bruce Lynch thank you for the Super Chat on Carnivore my cholesterol is 231 LDL is 156 HDL 69 because heart disease runs in my family also my creatine probably creatinine was also High my wife is a nurse and tells me to go back to eating vegetables I feel good though any advice um yeah well it sort of piggybacks on to the the previous one um from uh from Laurel there uh which is you know cholesterol was never the problem in the first place um so watch that video the truth about cholesterol and heart disease and um and and you'll see in show it to your wife I mean that that's what the evidence shows the facts show that um that LDL is not the culprit here we've been we've always made LDL cholesterol why is it just killing us now you know and the the idea that oh we just didn't notice it is just lazy thinking you know we did we just didn't we noticed we didn't notice it in 1911 but we noticed it in 1912 and Beyond really um no no it wasn't there in 1911 or it wasn't there in large enough numbers that we were seeing it on autopsy and then 20 years later it's the number one killer in America and it is has gone up decade after decade after decade after that in prevalence and as we've reduced cholesterol we've reduced red meat we've reduced saturated fat we've reduced cholesterol we've taken medications for the same the rates of heart disease have gone up you know we get dishonest actors like Lane and Simon Hill uh saying that well the age adjusted mortality ity rate of uh heart disease peaked in the 60s and 70s and actually started coming down after that that's not what we said that's a red herring so you know this is again another logical fallacy that lane doesn't know anything about that you're you're Shifting the argument or sometimes called people call Shifting the gold Poe they start talking about something else like hold on a second no we were talking about this you're you're you're changing the argument the argument was the rate of heart disease is going up the prevalence of heart disease is going up the incidence of heart disease is going up the amount of people as a percentage of population that have cardiovascular disease is going up the the number of people getting new diagnosis of cardiovascular disease is going up so just because we're surviving heart attacks because we're smoking less have better interventions better access to health care doesn't actually mean that the rates are going down the rates should go down if we're if we're doing all those things and those are all positive things for heart disease why are the rates going up it's just that we're surviving oh well we're just screening better now no we're not we have the same exact screening someone has symptoms and you get them a stress test we don't we don't just do stress tests on people just for screening you know it's when people are symptomatic that's when we screen that's when we put them on the treadmill and and do an EKG um and that wouldn't explain firsttime heart attacks the number of people having their first heart attack but surviving is going up so you can't you can't fake a heart attack you can't and on a heart attack you don't pick up by screening like oh look at that we just screened them and uh looks like they're having a heart attack isn't that lucky no you come in having a heart attack and they say wow this person's having a heart attack right and but they survive it because we have better interventions we can get people through it have better access to care better access to hospitals so they get there quicker things like that so it is it is just a fraud and the sooner we we get rid of this um terrible idea the better human Humanity will be Bruce Lynch uh question two how to know if you're consuming too much fat if you're consuming too much fat you'll get diarrhea that's it because your body has a spillover mechanism you cannot absorb fat past a certain point so why would we think that we're eating too much fat when we're not even satisfying our body's uh ability to absorb F you have bile that's made by your liver it's an expensive resource um it costs energy it costs uh resources like cholesterol which is good for you it's in every single cell in your body and uh your hormones vitamin D all these things your brain is uh is is uh partly made from cholesterol as well large part so your body has a a specific capacity to absorb fat after that after it runs out of bile it really can't absorb fat your your gut can absorb a small amount of fat without bile that's very small it's like single digit percentages and the rest goes out so you have an overflow mechanism and this is what keeps your stool soft if you're if you're eating enough fat by enough fat I mean the amount of fat to s safy your body's demand for fat and absorb all it wants then it stops absorbing it because it doesn't want it anymore and then that goes over and that little bit of spill over is going to keep your stool soft so it's um it's it's surprising to me that people would think that physiologically our body would just make a random amount of bile to absorb a random amount of fat that doesn't make any sense your body doesn't do that for anything else and um if it's making a specific amount of something it's it's for a reason um you have five organs working in concert just to absorb fat your stomach starts breaking uh down your food your liver makes bile your gallbladder stores that bile and secretes it into the small intestine when you when you eat fat your pancreas makes enzymes to break down the food further and break down the fat in particular and then that uh broken down fat gets emulsified by the bile and your small intestine absorbs it so you have five organs working together just to absorb fat and it has a specific quantity that it that it can take in that doesn't sound like an accident to me and so there really is no way to overeat fat physiologically because if you eat more fat than your body has the capacity to absorb it'll just go out the other end right fine uh so you might get diarrhea it might be inconvenient but it's not bad for you right um if you're taking things like ox bile sure you'll absorb more fat than your body wants potentially if you're eating a lot of fat but don't do that right um you know that would be forcing your body to um to absorb more fat than it wants so let it absorb the fat that it wants and you'll be fine there's a nice little super chat from my little El Marie thank you very much she says favorite doctor well you're my favorite patient not that you've ever been my patient but you're my favorite little girl anyway couple of sunshine thank you for the question um hi doc I was diagnosed with Corda in the 1990s I was told it was benign um in the news yesterday I read Gary sessa's son died from one are all are cordas all malignant um no um the thing is is that you know you can you can still die from a benign you know benign tumors um so you know there there are a number of different tumors in the brain and the spine like things like meningiomas um that can um you know uh that that can that can cause problems like so so here's the thing you you have to you have to be clear about your diagnosis right because if you were told you had a Corda and you were told it was benign that's sort of mutually exclusive right so you cordas are malignant but if you were told it was benign then it wasn't a Corda so you need to find out what your what Your diagnosis was because um that's very important um so even if you have a benign tumor if that thing keeps growing and pushing on your brain or your spinal cord or something like that it can still it can still be dangerous it can still even be lifethreatening even if it's not cancerous uh if it is cancerous it's much more likely to continue to grow it may uh be more difficult to treat but um any growth in that confined space of your skull and spine spinal column spinal canal can cause serious problems so it's um it's important to find out what your diagnosis actually was so if you were diagnosed with a Corda then that's not benign right but if it was something that was benign like a um a meningioma then that's benign it's not considered malignant it's not considered cancer but it still can grow and cause problems so you need to you need to check with your doctor I mean if this thing you've had this thing since the 90s and it hasn't hasn't gone anywhere um probably not malignant probably isn't a is probably something else probably like a little menoma or something like that that's just calcified and and and not moving so definitely check your uh check with your doctor check with see if you can find the medical records see if you can find um uh I don't know if you had surgery I don't know if you had biopsy or resection of that um lesion whatever it was so you know if you didn't have that then you don't know what the hell it is because you don't you have to look at it under a microscope you can make a guess about what it is but you can't you can't actually say definitively unless you uh unless you look at it under a microscope so so that's the thing so it's um so it's very important to know what your diagnosis actually was and um and then see exactly where it is does it need treatment if you are you you if you have anything you should be getting monitored or surveilled or at least for a certain period of time get serial MRIs to track this make sure it's not growing even if you had surgery you know you check for recurrence but um yeah that's what I would do just just check with your doctor see if you can find the actual uh notes and and why this was diagnosed uh as a Corda why it was thought to be benign when cordas are not benign um and um and so yeah you just need to find that out I mean if this is if this has just been sitting there since the 1990s then you know there probably isn't much concern but uh I would definitely double check on that um but you know 30 years of no problems is a pretty good sign so um I wouldn't worry too much about that at the moment but definitely check uh check with that and with your doctor okay good luck with that uh jlp thank you for the Super Chat there's no question attached but um looks like someone here there we go so JP hey Dr chaffy uh being cornivore for 45 days eating mainly uh beef butter and eggs yet I still accumulate lots of gas in my gut what should I do I just give it time um you know the body can uh get a turnover in your microbiome and your those those those bacterial cells will take time to turn over it's usually pretty quick but um you know it's not it's not instant anyway um also you can try different sort of meats different sort of eggs as well and if you're reacting to some of those if your body's just not absorbing these things properly or it's getting down to the the uh small or large intestine and you know causing a bit of gas then you know then maybe cut those things out you know just just may just cut down to just beef and see how you go then you add after a couple weeks you you see how it goes if that's not changing anything anything you know then um then you add these things back in if that still doesn't change anything just could be unrelated something to do with your microbiome um and that normally just settles down on its own you could also add in a bit of live Culture Yogurt with no carbs put a little bit on a bite of meat chew it up together swallow it in the same bite and um you know do that for a couple bites for a week or two and that that can uh help readjust your microbiome so I would try that but most of the time these things just sort of settle down on their own um or if you're reacting to something so always test the different things that you're eating limit cut it down to just the red meat and water for a while and and see if that changes anything and if it does you just try adding things back in all of a sudden you add eggs back in and problems come back there you go don't e eggs good luck with that uh cuz your daddy 92 thank you very much for the Super Chat problems absorbing fat no coffee no sweeteners not constipated um tried high fat high protein think diarrhea is root of all my problems body not transitioning to ketones yet being carnivore for one year um tdka I don't know what that means T DCA don't know what that means but um okay so being Carnival for which is great um you're you're you're doing looks like you're doing everything really well so um you know the no coffee sweeteners and everything like that you're not constipated um so it it depends so there there's there's two sides of this thing so if you're only eating meat only drinking water the the problem with with loose stool's diarrhea could be more fat than your body can absorb and it will just just come out in more liquid fashion or that your um that you are eating so little fat that you're actually starting to get a bit of um a bit of constipation such or sort of a slight um blockage and uh if that blockage is um getting bad enough then then you get what's called overflow diarrhea where the liquid will sort of pass around um the outside of that and um and you'll get liquid stools so if that happens what you'll see is liquid diarrhea for much of the time and then every now and then you'll get this blocky Boulder that comes out and um and it's difficult to pass and so if that's happening you need a lot more fat um so okay so tudka is the bile acid derivative that occurs naturally in the body like many compounds in your body to because made through microbial process um yeah so I don't I don't know if that's um you know an issue here but um almost always in that situation if you're eating just meat just water it's one of those two things or your microbiome hasn't just turned over and you can try the the the whole the um live culture yoga but after a year I mean I would really I would really be doubtful of that so if you're just getting the loose stools you can try pulling back the fat um if you're getting loose stools with every now and then a blocky Boulder you need to really increase your fat so you aim for one to two grams of fat for every one gram of protein most people can just eyeball it and just see how their stools are going but if you're you're trying to figure this out and if you say like wow okay I'm under one gram of fat for one gr of protein probably undereating fat increase it if you're up at the two grams per fat um to one gram of protein side of things then okay well maybe it's just just more than your body needs and you just pull it back a bit so that's what I would do okay question from Lena struggle sleeping on Carnivore um rosacea and acne even after two months when in a deficit my skin seems a lot calmer why is that uh someone said fruits and honey no but it causes me anxiety uh to clear the sugar should I fast you can um you know most people do just fine without fasting but if you feel that um when you eat less or you do periods of fasting that that improves your symptoms then that's fine um if you're eating anything else besides meat and water just cut that out obviously um and just eat what's right for you so if you're eating a bit less and that makes you feel better great um you know and see how you go you just don't want to lose too much weight generally people's bodies will tell them how much to eat and just you eat until fatty meat stops tasting good and your and your fine so try that but and do try increasing the fat that can that can help a lot with um these sometimes um but if you find that fasting once or twice a week is is beneficial go for it if you find that eating slightly less than what your body's asking for is beneficial you know go for it while your body's healing you know just listen to your body eventually you should be able to just eat until it stops tasting good people on medications um will you know that might be different but um depending on the medication so just just see what works for your body and do that that's really all there is to it so Patty lipw uh asks how can I increase my low iron levels I'm 10 months into carnivore diet and eat uh one to 11 halves of fatty red meat a day so one one to one and a half um pounds of fatty meat per day um I eat one pound of chicken livers every couple of weeks well you know those are those are um you know the right things to do um you know if you're eating a a pound of chicken livers over the course of a couple weeks then that's fine if you're just every couple weeks you just cook up a whole bunch of chicken livers and just eat like a whole pound of it you're probably not absorbing as much as as you'd like so you want a smaller amount spread out over that period of time um you also need to investigate if that still doesn't help with your iron levels you need to investigate why you might be losing too much blood because that's the other side of things obviously you know women who are menstrating they can lose more blood and um and if that's the case then you know there are things that can help with that um the other side of it is checking if any if there's any sort of small chronic leak or bleed in your GI trap in your guts and so that can come up with a fecal oul blood um test so if you're eating tons and tons and tons of iron it can actually show positive as well or taking iron supplements that can show up as positive as well but you know I would I would start with that you know you're you're eating the right things you eat fatty red meat until it stops tasting good and add in a bit of liver spread that pound of chicken livers over the course of of a uh you know of the of the weeks that you're eating them don't just eat them in one big go because you're not going to absorb uh all of that if that happens your body has limited capacity to absorb absorb certain things and so you overwhelm that then you're you're getting a part of that you're not getting all of that you can absorb a lot but you know just to make sure that your body's getting um getting the most out of what you're eating I would do that just a a little bit of liver every day um and uh and see how you go there's a lot of heem iron in meat and liver especially so uh that shouldn't be a problem um and see how you go and if that doesn't sort it out then you need to look for reasons you might be losing blood right and um and there are a couple ideas there um that that I mentioned that you can talk to your doctor about tip of the spear thank you for the Super Chat what causes arterial wall damage quite a lot of things homosysteine can and um if you have low B12 and low folate your homosysteine will go up and that can cause damage to the inside of your of your arteries so just eating a a a red meat diet is going to probably counter that some people with mfrg mutation may need to add in a bit of liver um in order to get enough folate and sometimes B12 but um you know that should be it and so homosysteine should come down homosysteine can also irritate the in inside of the arterial walls and cause them to contract increasing blood pressure um then there's a lot of other things nicotine is known to damage the the artery wall um things that are going to cause inflammation oxidative stress things like lenic acid uh the Omega sixes that you get in Plants those could cause inflammation they do cause inflammation they do cause oxidative stress they could potentially damage the arterial wall and other things of that nature so you just want to exclude things from your body that um that are not supposed to be in your body and then you should be able to work fairly normally um if you don't get the damage to the artery wall you're not going to get the these buildups in the first place you know this is this this starts with damage to the artery wall um and so uh that's that's a good idea try to avoid those things so just going on a carnivore diet just eating an ancestrally appropriate diet not smoking not drinking um having lower linolic acid intake and that goes for you know grain finished beef and and other sorts of um you know Factory farmed pigs and chicken and certainly farmed fish is just never eat that stuff um those fish are not healthy if you seen videos of those things they're not they're not healthy they're not happy they're just in trouble and um so you know it's not it's not a nice thing to do for them anyway if we're going to eat them it's just that's the wrong way to do it and it's not healthy for us either um so there are some things but there are many others there's a lot of things that can damage your your artery walls and um much of them you'll be able to eliminate by going on a a more high quality meat-based diet J the spear um thanks for the Super Chat what health issues can arise from too many Omega sixes well heart disease seems to be strongly correlated with um with heart disease um then mental health issues Alzheimer's things like that can be associated with it if you look at my recent interview with Dr Georgia Eid psychiatrist from Harvard she talks about how toxic lenic acids are specifically for the brain and the Brain takes them up it can't use them as a building block like it does for Omega-3s um so it get starts getting broken down for energy and that's your brain's not supposed to break down these big big molecules for energy it wants ketones it wants glucose and when Omega 6 is get in there it causes a lot of oxidative stress and inflammation in your brain from that breakdown process and so that's um that's something that uh could potentially be damaged as well as your your brain your mental health um it also directly damages your mitochondria uh in basically all of your cells that I know of and that's going to cause all sorts of metabolic disruption and harm to your body the that uh is is is going to be quite detrimental it can also cause insulin resistance can independently cause your blood sugars to start getting deranged and insulin levels to go up uh increasing your demand for insulin uh to do the same job even though you're not increasing the amount of carbohydrates you're eating so Omega 6es can do all of that what else um what else did I want to say uh yeah there's there's studies showing that depending on your omega-3 to Omega 6 ratios people's in um risk of developing heart disease cardiovascular disease uh can dramatically in increase Dr Paul Mason has a great lecture on on Omega-3s and Omega 6es where he talks about that and he goes through the literature uh showing that and so that's that's something so you know a lot of people like um well a lot of people in general but in particular people like Dr um Chris Kenobi uh think that that seed oils Omega sixes are one of the major drivers if not the major driver of the um degeneration in our health as a species um over the past Century so and I don't think he's wrong I know I think this is this is probably one of this is one of the main contributing factors I think all the other things add into it as well uh very significantly um but the omega3 Omega 6 is I think is a major part of that uh but he wrote a whole book called The ancestral diet Revolution and he talks about Len acid Omega sixes and and the problems that they they can cause and the evidence for this okay so a bit each day thank you for the Super Chat will vaping cause an insulin response I guess it depends on what's In The Vape um if it's like a bunch of sweetness and all that sort of stuff maybe I've never heard of that though that's an interesting question I haven't heard of that um if there bunch of sugary sweet garbage and you're getting that sweet taste in your mouth and your body sort of responding to that I I guess it's it's possible that your body could start preemptively making insulin but I actually have no idea so sorry about that tip of the spirit thanks for the Super Chat can neuroplasticity help with chronic illness well um neuroplasticity in the sense it can that your brain can recover from damage uh sure because if you are experiencing chronic disease like Alzheimer's or other forms of you know Dementia or cognitive decline or mental health issues or epilepsy or migraines these sorts of things um because of you know some damage and uh incorrect stimuli from various Foods you're eating or other exposures then your brain can heal and recover from that and potentially have less symptoms of whatever you had like psychiatric issues or uh cognitive issues or epilepsy Etc and we do see people improving their symptoms how much of that is just stopping the insult and how much of that is stopping the insult and then allowing your brain to heal through neuroplasticity and making new connections forming new um synapses um is is hard to say but people do clinically improve uh for many many issues I mean epilepsy we've been treating epilepsy with ketogenic diet for nearly hundred years and diabetes we've been doing the same so it's um it's certainly possible to heal a lot and you look at my interview with Dave Mack Mac very interesting he had a stroke 30 years ago he's you know 49 at the time of the of our interview and 30 years ago he had a he had a stroke a subarachnoid hemorrhage and he had weakness on his right arm and leg since then he did Ain he did keto at certain points and um and but his neurology was stable it wasn't until he went full carnivore that he actually started improving his symptoms and his weakness in his arm and leg um significantly improved to the point that he wasn't um limping when he walked he wasn't unbalanced going up and down stairs he could now run up and downstairs which is pretty amazing so um the brain is is pretty amazing and so even after 30 years there does seem to be neuroplasticity as long as you just take away the blocks and the anchors on your brains um your brain's ability to heal itself and function normally so in th in that sense yes it can help carnivore Joe thank you for the Super Chat hey Doc from Joe and Colleen um thank you for the help this week appreciate your time oh you're very welcome good luck with all that um hopefully you guys are able to come to a decision that uh is comfortable for the both of you um and uh and possibly get into to see a second opinion and and um and uh you know be be happy with your decision whatever it is you you should be happy with your decision um and and feel positive that you're making the right choice and um and then and then go go with it and try to um you know hope that it helps with all your issues I think it's always it's never a bad idea to get a a second opinion when it's not a life-threatening emergency life for limb threatening emergency so that's always fair to do and you know when you're talking about an extensive operation you know that's going to have uh ramifications uh long term because of it always a good idea to get a second opinion to see if you need something that extensive or um or something else that's uh uh still appropriate and will still do the job but doesn't need to be quite as dramatic so just you know that's that's a fair question to ask um either your doctor or another doctor has a second opinion so good luck with that hope everything goes well hexen thank you for the Super Chat what is the best way for someone who recently had their gallbladder removed to start carnivore and then keep going um you just just recognize that when when you first get your gallbladder out your your liver is going to still make bile it's going to just drip out constantly so in order to absorb fat um for the the meat that you're eating for the fat that you're eating um you're going to have to split up your meals throughout the day so you want to still eat the same amount of fat over the course of the day but it it will have to be spread out because your body's just making this as a go it's not making it and storing it it's making it it's dripping out into your into your intestines and so it'll sort of build up and pool up there and sort of be sitting there and so you need to just sort of eat smaller fatty meals throughout the day so you can just sort of catch what's there so every couple hours maybe just eat you know it may be that you can do that with three meals a day it may be that you have to do more than that it uh it just depends so just recognize that if you eat you know a certain amount of meat and fat and you get the runs you know within the hour after that you know that was that was probably more f fat than your body could absorb so just eat a bit less than that and sort of gauge on how much your body can absorb um and eventually you need to get enough food for the day though so you do need to eat you just want to be able to absorb it eventually you might form what's called a pseudo gallbladder many people do and this uh is an out pouching of the common bile duck and it just acts just like a a gallbladder so um So eventually may not be all that much of a problem but if it's if it's straight away then you probably wouldn't have had time for that to form and so that's what you need to do you just need to split up your fatty meals throughout the day and good luck with that future is now thank you very much for the Super Chat it's very kind of you found a YouTuber who stopped severe regular herpes outbreaks with carnivore have you seen this in patients and what could be the mechanism just improving the immune system uh yes it would likely be what that is um herbes viruses are U many but they are are uh retroviruses that live in the DNA of your own cells in your own neurons and the ganglin in the spine generally and so um but they can be elsewhere as well but they um every now and then they'll just sort of start your your own cells like replicate these things right this is a whole idea with you know the MRNA technology was it goes into your cells and your cells sort of make this stuff um so that's what these viruses do so that's where we you've taken that technology from We're mimicking that that Viral behavior and so your your body will do that and then once this gets up to a certain load this becomes a sort of a manifestes an infection it goes down that nerve uh axon down down your nerve and hits on the skin so you can get this in Shingles get there chickenpox right um and you can get um you know other forms of herpes as well it's um I haven't really heard that that's great I would I would think that it's just improving the immune system um when you see people as they age or they go on immune suppressants or their immune immune system is suppressed for other reasons medications and otherwise um they they generally have attacks of these of these herpes viruses these retroviruses um they get shingles things like that so elderly people in General I have weaker immune systems they think oh well it's just getting older now it is getting older but we're just eating crap and it's breaking down our body faster than it should so you know even elderly people should have a very robust immune system and so um when that is damaged then then these these shingles outbreaks can come back and they can be very very painful and they can that you know that pain can last a long time so um that is what I would expect your immune system is going to get better it's going to be stronger and um and so you won't get get the outbreaks like uh they did before so that's great to hear okay [Music] um so question from take shot action U says is there anything in the works for easily accessible database with rebuttal hm that's a good question um I have been trying to get a website up and going for the last two years and I am no good at it I've had people helping me with that but they um you know they were just doing it um uh out of the you know out of kindness and so you know they've gotten busy and um I need to sort of get on that and try to figure out how to sort of set that up but that would be a good that would be a good thing to do I I did want to have a database of um certainly people's success stories um and that's another thing if people I want to sort of build up that so if people want to send me um DMS on Instagram with their sort of success stories their first and before and after sort of things as well I I would really like to uh put that together for the website obviously only if you're comfortable with me using um these things I'm also putting together some presentations talking about this as well I wanted to use some examples so if people are comfortable with me using pictures and their stories please send me a DM letting me know about that sending me those before and after pictures and and the things that they were able to help um and [Music] um yeah I I saw Melissa and um and so one of the things we can do is is is do that as well so put in in uh rebuttal and um and uh you know the different arguments that people make I mean I've made a lot of blog posts U on Instagram but I mean they're just so lost so far lost down there at the beginning of my Instagram channel that no one no one's seeing this stuff so you know that's what the website's for you know I'll be putting these sorts of things in these different sorts of arguments and um um and resources and different links and studies and interesting um lectures um that that sort of help paint this picture of what we should be eating uh but yeah that's a good idea I don't I don't know of a database currently that has rebuttal but I will try to remember to if and when I ever get my stupid website going I'll put in um I'll try to make that as a as a as a section as well I'll just write that down okay all right okay let's just see here okay so there's um so there was a h Super Chat from last week from um n phonics Blinder um that I wanted to get to as well and they said if you could study any aspect of carnivore Behavior or physiology with unlimited resources and Technology what would be your deam dream project and what would you hope to uncover well I think that you what you'd want to do you'd want to do the most robust study available or or study possible comparing the only things that matter whole food meat-based diet and a whole food plant-based diet so you get people like dror Gardner Dr Willet Simon Hill or whoever whoever claims to be the expert on vegan diets and how to do it perfectly and then you have that and you test it against what I would consider the right way to do a carnivore diet in an ancestrally appropriate manner with high fat and nothing else and you compare those two and you look for long-term outcomes and you and you try to do this as as a randomized controlled experiment it's difficult to do these sorts of things it's hard to control for a lot of things but you can try um if would be also interesting to to do that with um the vegan groups that do supplement and you have to supplement right but do you right so they're going well know your body does all this stuff you don't need to supplement so you have the vegan vegetarian plant-based maybe even just vegetarian or whatever U but you you check those two things like the yiku you like the msai but you do it in a randomized controlled way and you look for different long-term Health outcomes and um and then you can do that with a with a third Group which is the plant-based group that does not supplement and the plant-based group that does supplement right because even the vegan proponents that say this is the best way to eat they say you still need to take supplements like B12 and many others um and and a lot of these vegan people are not getting that because you see people saying that no no no nagra doesn't say you need to supplement Simon Hill doesn't say you need to supplement it's like they do actually um you have to supplement at least be 12 if not other things as well and so it's um I think that's important to show as well that you know if you're supplementing all these things this these are your health outcomes if you're not supplementing these are your health outcomes if you're only eating meat and you're not taking supplements you're not doing anything else here are your health outcomes that's what you need and that that's just going to you know that's going to just complete this discussion um and uh or at least at least lead to it because you know we we just go back and forth all day all the human data the human data human data is crap you know this is this is this is generally bought and paid for by the by the Food Industries or it's completely useless checking you know Frozen cabbage versus ice packs I who gives a um and um and it's epidemiological in nature so they're looking at patterns they're saying well these people seem to eat more leafy greens these people less and they seem to have better outcomes but in that that same study ate less sugar ate less calories higher Soo economic status um less diabetes right so healthy user bias came into play less likely to smoke right all these things matter um and so so concluding that it was only the vegetables is is foolish right so you have to be able to do an experimental experimental trial um I would also like to do studies with specific Health outcomes like autoimmune diseases like heart disease like well diabetes we already have for for ketogenic diets um so that's that's translatable because ketogenic carore diets are ketogenic diets um and or they should be and um and then you know but but again look for these specific Health outcomes people with Ms you know get as many people you can with MS and put them on a carnivore diet you know uh we see this anecdotally but we're seeing in the tens of thousands now the people with with uh autoimmune issues probably hundreds of thousands at this point people with autoimmune issues putting this into remission getting off medications right so you know you just need to you need to put that into an experimental trial and just really Hammer that home we already have this with crohn's disease with elemental diets and removing carbohydrates removing fiber this keeps Crohn's into remission puts Crohn's into remission better than steroids for an elemental diet and keeps people in remission without medication up to 51 months just by removing carbohydrates and fiber so you know we already have experimental data on a lot of these things not that anybody ever look for that um and you know if you don't look you're not going to find it uh so I looked and I found it so those are the type of experiments that I I'd like to do I'd like to look at specific diseases and and their reversibility so find a 100 people with um Ms randomize them put them on different diets and just say you keep eating what you're eating and you guys were going to do a special intervention that's hard to do sometimes when you when you're in the other and when you're in the control group and you see people in the experimental group improving and they're like well I want some of that you know it's not a pill that you can give them and double blind it you know it's it's harder to do that um because people are going to they're going to eat what they want and if they think they're going to get benefit and and reverse their Ms you know then that's difficult so the other thing you can do you can just do an Interventional trial say hey we have all these people let's just put you on it and compare it to the um you know the the standard outcome which is which is also uh good to do but it's not as strong and as convincing as a as a randomized control trial but at least it's experimental data and it's not epidemiology um those are the type of things I'd like to do um I would like to get people with atherosclerosis with known atherosclerotic disease onto a cornivore diet and see if it reverses uh uh plaque deposition we've already seen this anecdotally in countless cases um Dave Felman has already shown this in his lean mass hyperresponders cohort that in 4.7 years of average time on a high fat ketogenic diet high fat meat-based ketogenic diet with higher LDL um up there with familo hyp cholesterolemia which suggests to me that that's the normal range for LDL cholesterol um that's just what your body does physiologically when you let it um that they had no progression in their atherosclerosis in fact the trend was to reduce atherosclerotic plaque so that those are the things I want to do I would love to do that um you know the ones with a vegan diet and a um a well-designed plant-based diet and a well-designed animal-based diet that would be very important to do that would be longer term the other ones I think you could do in a much shorter period of time because you're just looking for outcomes and of course course you know my uh major another major one I want to do is with with Cancers and gbms in particular there are a number of experimental trials and data in humans but they're smaller in nature and so we just need bigger ones there's one coming out of um uh Cedar Cai Medical Center in America and they're trying to recruit um over a 100 GBM patients to get them on ketogenic metabolic therapy um and um so that's something I'd like to do as well and even do like an RC there are there is an RCT with gbms and ketogenic metabolic therapy but it's you know it's smaller it's only 20 people and there's a lot of preclinical uh data with mice as well that's very promising so that's something I'd like to do as well that's a that's a big one that I'd like to do so very good question um those are my dreams I don't just have one I want to do all those okay dorotha thank you for the Super Chat hey what is your reply to the white paper by true health initiative to support anel keys I like to have solid arguments uh Happy carnivore here I haven't read that um they can support Lil key all they want it doesn't change the fact that he was paid shill and a con artist and uh morally bankrupt um you know people and and I've seen people uh defend him uh you know like Zoe har I love Zoe harkham I love her videos and she did a video basically saying look anel Keys isn't all bad he actually did a lot of really good work and that's fine but he and of course he had to because he had to have the clout and authority and recognition to uh to sell right if you I me he wasn't a good researcher and a good scientist at one point in his career he he'd have no authority to sell to the highest bidder but the fact is he did sell his his uh Integrity to the highest bidder and we don't know when that started we know that he did it to the sugar companies and and with the cholesterol theory of cancer or of heart disease but did he do that before that was he was he uh was his Integrity compromis before that did was that the only thing he did or did he stay pumping out uh garbage for the highest bitter we don't know and that's the problem you you can't trust anything that he says so I'm sure there's things that he did that were're good but there are things that he did that we know were fraudulent so the thing is is that you know everything is poison at that point you know it's like in in um in law you know it's it's fruit from the poison Vine like you just can't trust anything it says you have someone who comes in and they're a known liar and they have you know you cannot trust them and they've been shown to you have perjured themselves multiple times it's just like we're not going to listen to this person they're not a reliable Witness and so that's uh that's how I feel about anel Keys uh I'm sure he did some good work or else he wouldn't have been able to to sell his soul uh but he did and we don't know when that was we don't know what's compromised we don't know um what we can trust and what we can't so I don't know what they're saying in support of of Anil keys but we know that he was paid off to corrupt his data lie and um and and manipulate data to make it look uh like cholesterol was causing a problem which it never did and it never was um so you know people can defend him all he likes but I think he's pretty indefensible um you know we know that he lied we know that we have his contracts we know what he got paid right this published data and um you can't you can't just undo that and you can't say well he did that but that's the only thing he did well you know we didn't even know know about that until it came out and was was uncovered so what else is uncovered that we have what else is covered up that we don't know about yet right so I I just think you you know you have to just toss out all his life's work because he's he he has done that he has made it so we cannot trust his life's work and we just have to to toss him out as a uh as a clinician and a uh and a researcher um as a research he's not a clinician but um we have to toss him out as a researcher because you know he's he's corrupt and he was corrupt for the majority of his career so you just can't trust anything he says and um you know comes back around oh but I'm doing good work now it's like it's too late it's boy cried wolf like we just don't believe you now you're just you're just a liar and a fraud and that's what you'll always be so yeah that's the thing we can't we can't uncover uh what was fraud and what wasn't with with certainty so you just have to distrust all of it really Danny thank you for the Super Chat just started carnivore 3 weeks ago 54y old male bodybuilder 180 pounds I'm assuming um if it's kilos that's impressive moderate cardio uh recreational Labs uh cholesterol is 364 triglycerides 359 HDL 43 vldl 79 LDL 242 next KN in 6 months any recommendations um no just you're doing everything right you just um you just eat meat just drink water high fat uh no carbs no sugar nothing artificial no plants no nothing like that no fungus no mushrooms no drinks besides water uh cut down on Dairy don't drink milk there's enough carbs in there that you don't want them um it's early days right so this you've done it exactly right you've gotten your um preliminary Bloods that will will change your HDL will go up your LDL will go down U or sorry your LDL will do whatever the hell it wants glycerides will go down your H will go up um if your ldo goes up fine that's associated with Longevity if you don't eat for five days your LDL will also go up if you work out your LDL will also go up um so you're a bodybuilder something to remember if you work out if you have a heavy workout session the day before you check your Bloods your cholesterol will will be higher so just remember that so I always recommend people be very sedate and sedentary leading up to their blood tests for a few days and no exercise no stress and no sexual activity the morning of or the day before at least you can do it for two days before that's even better um and then just be calm and relaxed you know stress can can make these numbers go off um poor sleep can make these numbers go off so you want to prioritize sleep prioritize your stress levels you know relax do things that that chill you out and um and then take your Bloods first thing in the morning fasting from the night before 900 P p.m only water after that only water in the morning no coffee tea uh medications Etc um at least two glasses of water in the morning an hour before you get your blood test no more than four classes so same hydration status same time of day same fasting status um same EX exerise status same sexual activity status same stress levels that will keep you consistent uh if you check your your triglycerides and your your your um cholesterol 10 times a day you'll get 10 different numbers right because it just it just changes for a variety of different reasons and so uh that's what I would do so just take it easy relax focus on how you feel focus on your health um and uh your workouts are going to get better you're going to get leaner you're going to get stronger you're going to get more muscular um and it's going to be a lot easier than you've ever experienced before and then in six months you just check it again and see how you go I'm sure it will I'm sure it will improve um in the sense that your triglycerides will come down HDL will go up as long as you're doing all those things all of them matter so the sleep and the stress are also very important so good luck with that and cardio is sprinting is better than cardio just you know warmup or something like that sure but I wouldn't do um prolong cardio uh that can raise your cortisol as well um which isn't what you want so you uh just sprinting more high-intensity workouts like lifting weights and um sprints on the bike the assault bike or on a track or a treadmill things like that Jessica K thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy I have nasal polyps diagnosed with uh s Triad I am carnivore uh for a month now but symptoms have been worse any reason why no I don't I don't know why they would be worse um you know sometimes we can you know get strange sort of symptoms our bodies are clearing out different toxins and um and uh and that can manifest as you know weird symptoms and um but they generally go away you know if you're if you're um if you're releasing these toxins your fat tissue a lot of toxins can be stored in your fat tissue then uh eventually they're going to run out and they're your body going to work through them and get rid of them and um and you should be okay the nasal polyps you know like you're talking about with the the sress Triad um that goes along with asthma and inflammation in the nose but um quite often we see people's asthma clear up and when they go on just a meat and water diet so that's certainly my experience that's certainly been the experience with many people I've uh I've spoken to and patients of mine so I would expect that this would get better um could just be you know just a bit of a of a flare up before things calm down that would be my that would be my guess but do make sure that you're you've eliminated out absolutely everything else besides meat and water and um and if you you still have anything else in there any sweeteners any any anything you know just cut those out and just go with the meat and water and hopefully that will settle down um hopefully that just that that helps with the nasal pops as well but if they're really bad you know you may need to see an ENT about that um and get those removed but um you know rectal pops go away skin tags go away when people do keto carnivore diets so it's uh at least possible that that can help as well but if it doesn't you know there are Surgical interventions and I would be surprised if they you would get a lot worse with what you're doing or come even come back so it's likely that you know you'll have at least stopped that process and hopefully they go away hopefully they just s settle down I'd give it a bit more time you know one month is still pretty early days get rid of everything else besides meat and water and um and just give it a bit more time and uh you know if you if you're on medications stay on those medications until such time as as you can come off sometimes people come off medications a bit early and they get they get a rebound in their symptoms and they they feel a bit worse well you know you you can't just come off medications right away for for all things so just see how your body goes okay so Mrs meat suit that's a good name uh I have a kiari malformation I had decompression surgery a year ago I know caffeine stimulates uh CSF quitting helped with the head pressure that's good um how can carnivore affect CSF production love your content so you know we don't we don't really know for sure um because we don't have experiments on a carnivore diet but know things like ketogenic diets um Can potentially help uh with these sorts of things with um I'm trying to remember I I vaguely remember seeing a study with ketogenic diets and normal pressure hydris but I'm I'm just blanking at the moment but there are a lot of things in our body when we make an inappropriate amount of of CSF that um that can be helped by just cutting out different things that are inappropriate for our body or for people with too high iron that need to have um uh give blood periodically because their body can't metabolize iron properly I have patients that have done this and they normally have to give blood every two months but now uh they go on a cornivore diet five months on they have lower uh iron than they did after they would give blood and it's it's right in that optimal range so it could very well be that your body is is going to normalize your production of CSS but you know we don't have any experimental data or anything like that specifically on a carnivore diet I'm I am just really struggling to remember uh if there was one for normal pressure hydris it's just tickling the back of my brain but um so yeah so the thing is is that um you know you've had a decompression of kiari uh hopefully that takes care of your symptoms anyway and and you don't and you don't need to worry about it either way but um you just see how it goes for you you know this is going to improve your life in a lot of different ways anyway and so you this could very well be another one this could very well be something that that really helps you and so it's um it's uh you know important just to see how it goes for you um you know even if there is a study that says yes this should help and then you do it and it doesn't help and it doesn't it doesn't help and that's what matters not what the study says um and if we don't have studies on this which um you know for I I don't I don't know of any um for specifically looking at uh how much CSF is produced when we're on different diets um then um you know it's just important to just do that self- experiment and see how it goes with you so I really need to find that that thing on um NPH because it's it's just bugging me and I always I always talk it comes up and then I was like oh what is that study and then like when I'm I go and look and then when I'm actually have time to go look for it it slips my mind so I have to write a note for myself okay all right um I think that we have got a number of of super chats I don't think we probably need anymore I'm going to go for the next sort of hour so um and um but let's probably stop the the super chats now because there's already quite a lot and and I want to try to get through them [Music] all so Jeff Stone thank you for the Super Chat started testosterone replacement therapy in 2022 with t level of 300 to or 200 300 uh nanograms per deciliter symptoms like um erectile dysfunction low energy actually got worse started keto carnivore this December down from 200 lound to 165 pounds came off trt cold turkey that is awesome uh that is so great to hear Jeff um you know it's funny because you know I've seen people on trt who have you know decent levels of testosterone certainly came up from where they were before um then go on a carnivore dieet and feel so much better and then they come off trt and they're they're test testosterone normal testosterone production actually exceeds the level that they had um on trt which is fantastic and I see people um young men late teenage uh young men uh who have come in with very low testosterone like around a 100 nanograms per deciliter his 19-year old kid should have testosterone squirting out of his ears um and yet you know basically um hypon is basically primary testicular failure so if he went to a normal doctor and they test oh my gosh you you're not producing testosterone you need to go on trt the rest of your life um Stan eering is one of these people and he he went to college he just wasn't you know lifting he's lifting weight trying to get in shape and his his um testosterone level was just flatlined right and they went to the doctor and said oh you need to go on trt well I have had those patients and then well and then Stan decided to then you know uh serially abuse uh the these uh steroids and things like that for the rest of his life uh which is certainly going to uh cause Health ramifications with the level of abuse that he's done but the problem is with that I think he was done a real disservice as a kid because he may not have needed that at all in the first place right because I've had patients in that exact scenario that normally doctor like oh you got to be on testosterone the rest of your life they wouldn't even try tried anything else and I put this kid on a carnivore diet which he wasn't even able to really do full full on he was still having you know cheats and he mostly eating meat but he'd have some rice or snacks or something like that every now and then but mostly meat and his testosterone level went from just barely over 100 up to 400 in two months right so his his his testicles hadn't failed they could make testost strong it's just they were being held back by the things that he was eating and so it just made a massive massive difference and that's still going up you know he's still getting better and and he's he's not all that strict about it but he's eating predominantly meat and he's mostly eating meat most days and so that's really great it's great to see you um see you do so well and uh and do so much better and and uh just get healthier and come off the the medications that's exactly what uh what we want to do Dr No thank you for the Super Chat I have severe Cron's disease pure cornivore and can't seem to find meat that reliably works even different batches of grass-fed beef from the same company will have good or bad results that's really interesting um you obviously have a a more a more sensitive case you know it could be that medications can still help you sort of get this intermission and then you can come off those medications and keep it in remission with this um eventually you know we have um you know we have a think you know things the idea of leaky gut which we actually see on on electron microscopes we actually know this exists we see this on Imaging um and um so these molecules and bacteria can get in the body uh and they can cause damage and they can cause an immune response that can then have cross reactivity so it can take six months to a year for that those tight junctions to to heal and to close off those gaps and um and and to heal your leaky gut so it could be that you know you're you're going to be in that camp and that you need to you may need medication longer than other people but eventually that those um those Gap Junctions will heal up and come tight junctions and you won't have leaky gut anymore and Hope hopefully at that point nothing's going to come in it is interesting um you know different you know yeah different grass F you know the thing is is that things are called grass-fed when they sometimes aren't if if it has yellow fat pretty good evidence that that's that's grass-fed and finished uh beef right because it can be grass-fed and live most of its life on grass and then be in a feed lot for the last two months and that's allowed to be called grass-fed so it's grass-fed and finished and if it has yellow fat that's a that's a good sign that this is that this has really just been eating grass its whole life or at least in the later part of its life so I would definitely look for that um you definitely need to stick with just the grassfed and finished you may need to be on a bit of medication uh for six months or or more to let your your gut heal and um and um you can even go you can even go with like the original Salsbury steak is what he invented for this issue which is you you cut out the gristle the connect tough connective tissue and you just eat the soft muscle meat and the soft fat and then you add butter to that uh but it could be that you can't do butter you may be um reacting to that you seem be very sensitive so probably want to take out the grass-fed butter as well should probably never use anything but grass-fed butter but if you're you know if you're even using grass-fed butter and that's causing a reaction you're having reactions maybe take take that out try to use grass-fed Tallow instead or get like grass-fed fat trimmings see if you can get some of those and you just fry them up with your meat as well and um to get that that fat content but if you cut away the gristle you just have the soft fat and you just have the soft muscle meat you'll absorb nearly 100% of that and you'll find that you don't actually go to the bathroom or need go to the bathroom uh very often at all and so uh there was a lady that um that was doing this and she didn't didn't go for a month but it was soft and small you know she didn't have any obstructions or anything like that so but you you need to make sure you're getting enough fat as well because if you're not going all that time then you know you need to make sure everything's soft and not getting stuck um and that that's the reason you're not going as opposed you know because there's just not anything there to pass as opposed to um you know it's getting stuck and moving slow so that's what I would do I would um you know try to make sure you're getting you know yellow fat grass-fed beef cut out the gristle um just eat the soft fat the soft meat make sure you're getting enough fat probably don't use butter for now see how that goes hopefully within the next few months you'll be able to uh you be open things up a bit more um but you know there there's some people that have to do that I you know Salsbury talked about and people wrote books after that using the Salisbury method and you know it took over a year sometimes for people to really get to the point that they were they were back to normal health and so you know it can be it can be a longer process but um you know most people especially with crohn's do respond very positively early on sounds like you're already doing that that you're getting different results with different batches but sometimes you're getting good results which is good so try to try to maybe also have a food diary write down the things you're eating how you're eating and how you're cooking and how you're preparing them and what that's doing to you try the salsbery steak method of just taking out the gristle and um yeah and then just remember you may still need a bit of uh medication but at the same time you know doing what you're doing with like the elemental diet has been shown to be better treatment for an acute flare of crones than prazone right steroids so um hopefully this will this will at least massively reduce your symptoms and improve your health and eventually go away completely when your Gap Junctions tighten up and uh close off so good luck with that hopefully that gets better and let me know how that goes aen thank you for the super chat some other channels do Super Chat catch-up stream don't know what that is um suppose I could do like a um like stream something to like sort of catch up the the super chats the problem is I don't I don't um know how to get back to the super chats as well um and so yeah so I do try I've only I've only sort of missed out on super chats a few times but that's why I try to set tell to to stop but um yeah and sometimes I'll try to go back and answer the super chats in the in the in the comment section as well but um we can try to figure out what what the catch-up stream is um you know because the thing is I I I when I when I start these streams people start adding in more Super chats and so going back and doing the ones that I miss will then put me behind for that day too and then if I have limited time then that's difficult so uh we'll do the best we can anyway um today you know we have um oh well people are still putting in well people are still putting in super chats but um we'll see if you just get through everything today anyway but um just just understand that if you guys put in super chats at this point it it may be that I have to go but I'll try to get everything today anyway I re for and is thank you for the super chat um can your CAC be lowered with carnivore um yeah so this goes back to something we were talking about before which is that we're we're sort of seeing that Trend but we don't necessarily have definitive data showing that and we certainly see people that do lower their CAC score CAC score is not necessarily indicative of your total plaque score though so it's it's not going to count for soft plaque so you know if if you have a CAC score of you know 108 um that doesn't tell you anything about how much plaque is there it just tells you how many how much hard plaque is there so there could be very little or a lot of soft plaque your CSC score is going to be the same and so if you have a lot of soft plaque and your CSC s starts going up and up and up and up it's not necessarily because your soft plaque is going up for all you know your soft plaque is receding but what's there is getting calcified statins are known to calcify uh your your soft plaque and this is thought this is said to be of benefit they say uh this stabilizes the plaque and makes it less likely to rupture um whether that's true or not I don't know um they say a lot of things that I don't that I don't believe so I you know I I sort of take things with a grain of salt with that when it comes to that but um you know but that and that's the weird thing too right your CAC scores up oh my God you have to be on a stattin the implied result there is that you know the the implication there is that um that Statin will lower your C score when in fact it does the opposite it's known to raise your your CAC score and I you know I see people on um statens long term and they they're checking your CAC score and it just goes up and then they they oh you have to change your di you have to do this you have to do all these sorts of things they go on a carnivore diet and their CSC scor is still going up there oh it's because of that carnivore diet it was already going up anyway you know it had been going up for years and um you know this isn't any any different you're on a you're on a drug that is known to raise your CAC score so there are people that are reporting their C scores going down we don't have experimental data to show that so we can't really say for sure but again you know the Dave Felman studies uh showing a trend to reduce aosc orotic plaque has already been shown in that cohort with uh the the lean mass hyperresponders so it it seems to be my suspicion is that that's the direction that the that the data is going to go in um we we're already seeing preliminary data pointing in that direction um but remember that your CC score can transiently go up even though your soft plaque is going down and so you need to you need long-term followup on these things it's not just necessarily going to change right away um Daniela mininova um thank you for the Super Chat not seeing a question attached um okay maybe there's one down the line I'm not seeing one sort of here though so Mart Hart thank you for the Super Chat uh thank you uh for what you do I've been carnivore for nine weeks and my inflammation persists uh 56y old male no weight issues any suggestions uh well you know yeah nine weeks you know you you should get a lot of reduction in your inflammation um I do wonder what you mean by inflammation you're just talking about like pain or you talking about a a score like your ESR your high sensitivity CRP and that's maintaining inflammation you have inflammation for other things stress poor sleep um chronic cardio raises your cortisol um different sort of medications and autoimmune diseases all these sorts of things can raise your inflammation or other exposures in your household and in your daily life so make sure you're you're optimizing those sorts of things as well uh um if it's pain that you're experiencing um the the idea is is that you'll reduce inflammation and that that can reduce the amount of pain that you're getting but it's not necessarily going to eliminate all the pain that you have uh my back pain is a thousand times better than it was before I still have some you know it's still a bit stiff you know when I'm doing certain things you know that's life I've had pancake discs since I was uh 20 before before I started carnivore you know so I damaged my discs early on from high from a lot of High Impact Sports growing up and so you know that's uh that's something that i' I've got to live with now and um but it's a thousand times better than it was before but it's there is still some there you know I've damaged my the cartilage in my knees from years of kickboxing as a teenager long before I ever went carnivore um and so that persists today and so and that hurts and that's sore that causes inflammation but you know what like I have bone on bone arthritis on my kneecaps nowhere else everything else is perfect but bone on bone on my kneecaps because of the damage that I caused to it from kickboxing doing Muay Thai knee strikes and things like that and you know just being a stupid kid and doing knee strikes into poles and lockers and denting them in things like that just just because I could um and to impress my friends which is a really stupid reason to do anything uh like that but I did and so I damaged that cartilage and um you know and I I had an MRI and um you showing showing this and the radiologist looked at that and just like that knee right there I would not be getting out of bed with that knee and uh and I didn't even notice it I was playing rugby playing high level rugby I was doing squats twice a week like heavy squats twice a week you know yeah it's a bit sore but it's not that big a deal um and so that's the thing you if you still have damage if you still have have an injury like arthritis like something wrong with your back you're you're still going to have pain it's just that that pain is going to be massively reduced so hopefully it is hopefully that is what's going on and that you're you're you're feeling better but it's just not all the way better you know it may be that things can continue to improve but um you know then the other things are obviously um you removing out everything except meat and water um high lenic acid in in factory farms pork and chicken so you know that's something to remember that will cause inflammation there higher linolic acid levels in um in Grain finished beef as well so you you try cutting down to more of the red meats try to get grass-fed and finished when you can that can also help being at higher levels of ketosis can also help cutting out all artificial ingredients are all icial sweeteners monk fruit sugar Stevia all these sorts of things saying well these are the new ones this is good no new is bad we want things that were 50,000 years old we want things that were around 50,000 years ago during the last ice age right you don't want anything that wasn't that wasn't around back then so animals were around back then uh sweeteners were not part of our diet at that point and certainly not these these monk fruit sugars and stas they existed in Plants but we didn't eat those plants as a normal staple of our diet certainly not during an ice age right so just remember that cut out all that stuff try to get down to red meat if you can try to get your Omega-3s up and your and your Omega sixes down and um you may may try intermittent fasting you know eating once a day or maybe taking a day or two off to try to get your Ketone levels up ketones directly suppress inflammation as well and so if you're having a problem with inflammation you think it's still a persisting uh issue with inflammation try that get your ketones up get your glucose down and and see if that helps as well because um because it can ketones do suppress inflammation independently and then you're just not eating all these things that cause inflammation and you you'll be in a pretty good spot but you'll still have damage to your body potentially that will potentially hurt so just keep that in mind Victoria Street Ministry thank you very much for the super Super Chat I have a hard time digesting red meat thoughts also best tip for overcoming sugar Cravings um I'm thinking as I transition from a standard American diet I need success with this so yeah so so first of all with red meat um if you're eating meat or red meat with anything else it changes the way you digest it changes the way you absorb it changes the way your body processes it and so that's generally where people find they have a problem I I can't tell you how many people um I've I've said this to you and they say like okay well I'll try it and I always say like have you ever just eaten red meat just on its own nothing else um most of them haven't um and then they try it and they go like yeah you were right I had no problem eating meat as long as I was eating it on its own so that makes a big difference makes a big difference how your body process these things there's these anti-nutrients and plants that stop your body from breaking down and absorbing meat and and a normal things probably there's proteas Inhibitors stop you from breaking down protein properly there are fiber can can um stop you from absorbing up to 30% of the nut of the food that you're eating um oxalates tannins um Fates all these sorts of things will uh delay or even prevent the absorption of of certain things and so when you're eating those together with meat you're not dig gesting the meat properly so it's not you that that can't digest the meat it's it's the the plants that are making it so you can't so just keep that in mind also if you like other meats and they don't seem to cause a problem eat those meats that's fine but I would bet that if you're just eating red meat just on its own that that you'll be fine um and but see how you go if there's other meats that make you feel better then then eat those the key is just eating enough eat enough meat eat enough fatty meat you want fat add butter grass-fed butter to things as long as you tolerate it and um and that will actually help with your sugar cravings when you're satisfied when you're hungry when you're satiated your sugar signals will be lower sugar is a drug and so you know you're just going to have to sort of power through that a bit but it's actually not that long it's about a week or two and if you're eating enough then then you shouldn't get as many as many cravings sometimes if you get Cravings carb Cravings sugar Cravings it's because you're hungry your hunger signals are very different it's very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet so and especially when people want to lose weight and all these things well I'm going to limit it you're going to get carb Cravings then you're going to get sugar Cravings then because your brain is screaming at you to eat something and so what you want to do is you want to eat enough you want to encourage your metabolism you want to encourage your body say hey we're not in a famine you don't need to starve we got everything we need and then your body will settle down and so you eat fat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you do that every day at least once a day and you see how you go you eat the meat that tastes good to you that fills you up makes you feel the best and that you can afford and have access to okay if that's red meat then great if that's something else that's fine too so just see how you go and just and if you get sugar Cravings ask yourself am I hungry try eating eat some meat if it tastes good you're hungry keep eating until it stops tasting good and remember there's a lot at the end of the time two weeks you you really won't miss it um we also have to remember that we have to we have to deal with addictions like drug addictions you know when when we go to like Comfort eating and we have stress or something we we turn to food sometimes we turn to alcohol we turn to cigarettes we turn to drugs they're all drugs we turn to other drugs and um and so the thing is is you need to develop other other um Avenues of of de-stressing yourself so you get stressed out you get upset and you turn to food or you turn to smoking well you need to turn to something else you need to develop other Hobbies you need to say like okay well I'm going to go go for a walk when this happens that makes me feel better I like that I enjoy that okay I'm going to do that or spending time with certain people or you know just watching a TV show or you know playing some sort of board game or something that enter pains you something that interests you going to the gym you know that's a that's a great de-stressor you just go to the gym and you sweat it out and you just you just work hard it I mean you feel just like a different person at the end of that if you if you if you work hard and just feel wonderful so those are sorts of things so you need to you need to replace that addiction with something else that interests you and occupies you and distresses you and then just remember light at the end of the tunnel it's just two weeks away it's not that bad and if you're getting sugar Cravings you're hungry eat meat and um and enjoy you you will get through this um it um it will take two weeks from when you stop eating plants and sugar and carbs so you can wean down and that you will get improvements as you go but you know eventually you will have to stop and when you stop that's when that clock starts right so however early or late you want to start that clock is up to you whatever you think you can do you know if you wean down a bit yes you you'll likely have lower Cravings during that time but either way they go away and um you know eat enough eat enough fatty meat at the moment just start eating a lot of fatty meat make that the the priority of the meal make that the main part of the meal and you have sort of other things sort of added in there but you try to cut out all the sugar especially and and reduce everything else down reduce everything else down and focus on just eating a lot of meat and um and you'll be you it'll fill you up you won't be as hungry you won't want to eat all the other stuff and that's good too and eventually you have to stop that's when the clock starts two weeks later you shouldn't have any other carb Cravings as long as you're eating enough so remember to eat enough and good luck with that Mona shabir thank you for the Super Chat what is gliosis and inom Malaya in the gyus reti uh second question uh what issues can it cause in the future say 10 20 years down the road uh what have you seen with your experience this c u what have you seen with your experience that this causes so gliosis and ke Malaya so they're two different things um gliosis is and ke Malaya can come from um damage inflammation to the brain and you're seeing this area of damage basically and ke Malaya would be um sort of an atrophy or again damage you can get this from surgery you can get this from in inflammatory processes you can get this from uh other other sorts of mechanisms that can damage the brain um so anytime you damage the brain obviously if that's a part of the brain that is is um is important for a certain certain function then that can cause a bit of disruption in that unless it's overt you know then it's it probably will be pretty minimal and probably unnoticeable from from that standpoint um but may not and 10 20 years down the line any well just any damage to the brain in general is going to um predispose you for other sorts of issues uh such as epilepsy so any damage to the brain just damage to the brain is the leading cause of um of epilepsy so you know if if you've had damage then you know you could you could potentially um you could potentially get uh epilepsy but you know quite often when you have that damage and insult you know if you if you haven't had a seizure you know within the first six months it's unlikely that you'll get one but there is that potential and you know potentially later down the road if you're unwell for other reasons in your in your seizure threshold lowers for another reason then this area could sort of kick that off so you know important to to just be as healthy as you can um doing things like a carnivore diet doing things like um doing things like um uh you know ketogenic diets in general can help can help suppress that and and raise your threshold on seizures and um you know and um and that's uh that's pretty much it so you know um yeah you know it it's it's quite a general thing gliosis it's just sort of a nonspecific reactive uh process in the brain that's that's responds to damage so the thing is I I you know we don't know I don't know what caused that damage to your um to your brain um and so you know it's hard to say sort of more than that um you know the KE Malaya is just sort of you're just sort of atrophying and losing a bit of that tissue that's generally from uh damage right and since there can be specific damages to the brain that uh that cause this so you know I think it's probably more important what caused that damage um that that can tell you what's going to happen long term um but a lot of the problems that manifest from these sorts of things generally manifest early on so you have that damage and that's damaging part of your brain and so that's you know that's um you've damaged that part of your brain and so you know that that damage will heal or not heal depending on on what's going on um on what it's possible to do or how extensive that damage was and then you have so these these long-term After Effects like the gliosis and the KE and malatia um you know that that you sort of see on MRI but um but that's it so you know and again longterm generally long term is there's going to be things like epilepsy that's what you're going to have to contend with um that's pretty much it I think that's yeah I think that's um hopefully hopefully enough to answer your question anyway but um you know it's uh it's hopefully something that will just remain remain stable and uh and not cause you problems at all especially if you're on a on an appropriate diet and hopefully that's the [Music] case thos thank you for for the Super Chat Dr does carnivore help with lumbar disc bulge um it depends on how you look at it I mean if you you can still get injured and you can still get a disc bulge um if you already have disc bulge is if this an inflammatory process and you have a bit of damage you know it can help your body scar it down or reduce the inflammation and potentially sort of Scar that down it depends on on how extensive it is it depends on the cause um but you can still get injured you know dis bulges are are generally traumatic and so being on carnivore or not I mean if you're on Carnivore you're going to have tougher stronger tissue and so it's uh maybe protect you from getting disc bulges in the first place once you've had a disc bulge you know it's just I I think it would just if anything it would just speed up healing time but that doesn't necessarily mean that you won't get um you won't you won't need surgery or something like that so you know if you have a dis buul it's not causing too much problem it's fair enough to try a carnivore diet and see how that helps um it can certainly reduce your symptoms anyway and reduce the inflammation that's tracking up the nerve if you're having radiculopathy you know pain shooting down your legs people call that sciatica um it's um it's possible that that can reduce that inflammation and um and improve your symptoms but um you know it and it'll likely help sort of heal this stuff as long as it has the ability to heal at all if it's not just permanently scarred down um that's pretty much it but it's not going to stop these things from happening and it's not going to sort of fix it over night it's just going to allow your body to be healthy and to heal from things uh better than than it would otherwise so yeah good luck with that Spartan 17 thank you very much for the Super Chat hi I switch to carnivore in January I have an arhythmia and I take myop off for it I got heart palpitations often or I get hard palpitations often Since switching switching I have a lot less oh that's great have you ever noticed this with any of your followers uh why is this um no look it depends on it depends on the arhythmia I have seen people with atrial fibrillation uh reduce that and sometimes people would put them on to for atrial fibrillation so you know potentially uh that's something that you could see um but you know it's really early days knowing what we we what can improve on this sort of thing um and so that's great so it's just a matter of of collecting that that data and so it' be interesting to see what kind of um what kind of arhythmia that you had and um and why that that help um just just you guys know I'm still getting super chats guys um uh please please no more Super chats because I have uh I I I I want to get through all these and uh and I need to I need to go at some point um so I had seen people improve um you know just certainly for age refibrillation um and also I see contractility and uh Echo and things like that injection fractions improve as well um that's going to be for a lot of reasons your heart's getting healthier your body's getting healthier your heart's running on ketones now which is is actually your myoc cardio sites preferred energy source um and that's really important for your heart and and the normal functioning of your heart so it could be that there's a lot more to this and um and we see and we see um you know people improving we see people improving um uh with with other sorts of arhythmia but you know it sort of remains to be seen but that's really great that that that's improved for you uh hopefully just continues continues like that and settles down completely that'd be fantastic Cole Brew thank you for the Super Chat do you know anyone who does BJJ and is on Carnivore and how did it affect them yeah yeah one of the Gracies does it actually um so Holland Gracie r h Len or a an yeah a n um r h l an uh Gracie's like the the grandson of the of the founder of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu you know ho Gracie's nephew um his father was was a was a fighter too I can't remember his father's name I feel like a uh like a bastard for not remembering that but um but yeah the Gracie family so he does that and he does full carnivore and he said it absolute GameChanger and how he feels and his athleticism and his training he just feels amazing so he's head of um ccie jiujitsu jym he's a head trainer there at in San Francisco and so and so I did a a an interview with him and um and uh uh another gentleman that lives down there in San Francisco with him who's like a American Ninja Warrior he's on uh Instagram is SF ninja and um you know both great guys and um and uh they they've just done all sorts of crazy things with carnivore and the um you know even did the the Ninja Warrior American Ninja Warrior challenge like on Carnivore and um you know felt great doing it so yeah absolutely uh and there are more and more people doing this as well but uh yeah that's that's one who I've specifically interviewed so if you want to check out that interview um it's on my YouTube channel Channel and um and you can see for yourself yeah they they both feel great doing that so yeah good question menus pus thank you for the Super Chat as I understand my body will tell me how much salt I need based on the taste I got a strange headache after salty delicious ribi twice a week also keto Chow drops in my water is that too much sodium potentially if you're getting headaches from it then then you know tone it down um you know is there anything else than the keto Chow I don't know um I've never taken it I don't know if they have different kinds that have different sweeteners or artificial uh flavorings or things like that if they do just cut them out don't or this is natural flavorings even even worse just get rid of them and um uh you know see how you go but you know if you're if you're adding salt and you're getting a headache try not having the salt headaches uh are quite often precipitated by dehy hydration as well so just make sure you're getting enough water also um you know the more salt you add the more water you're going to need and so just just remember that also so just play around with it uh it may be unrelated you can get a food diary and just a food and symptom diary deping on exactly what you eat how much salt you use how much water you're drinking that day and then when you're getting these symptoms and see if there's a connection in a pattern uh quite often there is and um but if there's not then you at least have that piece of information as well that's like it doesn't seem to be related to the things that I'm eating so you know we'll go with that too so uh yeah just do some of that keep track and track your progress and see how you go Michelle Z thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr C is there anything I can print off and take to my doc showing that cholesterol is not the cause of heart disease please um yeah if you go to my um if you go to my video on the truth about cholesterol and heart disease I have a lot of studies and links in the description that you can that you can uh print out those studies um and uh and there's other ones in there I haven't put all the the links for all the studies I talk about sometimes I'm sort of refer to them by name and I just haven't G gone back and put them all in um but you can sort of look those up those other ones up if they don't have links in the description and you can sort of take in the ones that you feel are are strongest you can also um take in the um Dave Felman Nick norwitz um lean mass hyper responder study that just got published uh showing that people on a high fat ketogenic diet with marketly elevated uh LDL according to them according to normal standards um uh on average on this diet with elevated LDL for 4.7 years did not progress atherosclerosis and in fact trended downwards and one of the top lipidologists who is working on this who still believes and says in the paper look I still believe that LDL directly causes um the development of atherosclerotic plaque however in this population of the keto carnivore population it appears that it doesn't and and he said that this is definitely long enough to see if there was going to be something to see and they're going to keep tracking that as well but those are the things as well and um and just the fraud you know the sugar companies made up this this whole um this whole idea in the first place and then paid people to perpetuate it it's a fraud and we that's published in the journal American Medical Association 2016 in jamama so you know their own internal memos and documents this not this is not someone just accusing them of this this is them saying they did it and what they did how much they paid them to do it so that's the thing this is all a fraud and um and the evidence is there Michael Robert thank you for the Super Chat doc do you think weightlifting and running is natural and beneficial for prolonging lifespan or is it better to do light exercise and not stress the body um you know I think I think your body's meant to run meant to sprint in particular when we're running after prey or running away from a tiger or something like that you're not going to get too far from a TIG you're better better off staying and fighting but um although that's not going to go too well either um but um you know unless you have a a spear like uh Lane Norton but um you know but uh the thing is is that we do have studies looking at weightlifting sprinting things like that and they can actually at least in some studies lengthen tiir and so tiir are the the cap on the end of your chromosomes that basically tell you how long that cell line is going to live how long you're going to live and so if that starts shrinking down shrinking down shrinking down shrinking down you're coming coming towards the end um but then you start doing things that sort of build that up and there are some things like like this sort of exercise like growth hormone can uh lengthen your teum MIRS and lifting weights and sprinting can raise your growth hormone can and raise your teir either independently or via the growth hormone increase and um so I think it would be beneficial you know we're we're supposed to use our bodies we're supposed to be um strong vibrant individual that are going around doing things in the wild and that's what we've always done we chopping down trees and building houses and Forts and and um or you know just living out in the wild and you know um fighting off you know giant saber-tooth cats and um you know attacking and taking out woolly mammoths and mastadons and things like that and then chopping them up and lugging hundreds of pounds of meat however many miles back to camp and back to back to where you guys live so this isn't um this isn't something that we're not designed for we're not used to so you know hard labor is uh is is part of our makeup and so I don't I don't I certainly don't think it's going to I don't think it's going to like worsen you as long as you're not injuring yourself um you know the idea that we just need to be sit in the box and just atrophy is is wrong you know sarcopenia lower skeletal muscle mass is is directly correlated with uh in in being fragile infirmity uh cognitive decline and shorten lifespan uh for many reasons you know um maybe you're just so weak and so frail and so fragile that you're just going to break your hip and and um and hurt yourself that way 50% of people that of elderly people that break their hip die within the first year um quite often it's because they're so weak and frail that they break their hip in the first place but that's a high a high mortality rate very high so you know if you're lifting weights if you're doing you know sprinting and things like that and you're and you're keeping up a good lean body mass you're going to be healthier and you and you'll likely live longer yes Chad serson thank you for the Super Chat losing weight very slowly 275 pound male eating two pounds of meat red meat daily and black coffee very sedentary with 40% body fat expect Pati well you know you just just I wouldn't worry too much about your weight loss focus on your health just focus on eating properly eating two pounds of meat is that enough is that enough fat are you getting more than your body wants are you getting as much as your body wants if you're eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good that should be fine if you're stopping before that you like well I I feel like I could stop and I want to lose weight you can actually do the opposite of what you want because you can slow down your metabolism and uh you know one of things that that anel Keys did U before he sold out hopefully before he sold out and this is what people talk about like well he's done these other studies I don't know who the the what who he could have sold himself to on this one but um either way he did a study in the in World War II with consciouses objectors U who didn't want to go and fight in the war and they said okay well you're going to get drafted unless you volunteer for this experiment volunteer for this experiment where we just starve you and see what that's like and see what it does the body and see how safe it is to refeed people after a period of starvation and um and so they they did that and they found that yeah people lost weight but it it sort of plateaued off and stabilized even though they were eating the same small amount that they were eating before and so they also found that if it was just calories in calories out that these people some of them would have lost more weight than they started with in the first place so your metabolism slowing down your body saying you're not eating we're telling you to eat you're not doing it that must be because there's no food available one animal in the wild doesn't eat when there's food available and they're hungry right they'll eat you know you have you have a an imperative a biological imperative to eat when you're hungry and so if you're if you're withholding you're not quite eating enough your body's thinking well it's because it doesn't it's not accessible we don't have access to it and so uh it'll just slow down your metabolism coming in less is going out that's all there is to it and so you're going to you're going to you're going to store hold on to your fat more so you want to encourage your metabolism you want metabolism to go up and so you want to eat more um uh or you want to eat enough I should say so you want to eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and let your body tell you when that is at first it's going to taste amazing if you're hungry you're going to get to a bite which does taste Bland and uninteresting you're not really going to want to finish it so just stop right there you can overeat on a carnivore diet but it's very difficult because your body will be repulsed by this and saying like don't eat this you won't enjoy it and so that's what you do so um some people take longer with fat loss which is one of the things um some people have very high leptin levels which are satiety hormone when people have High when they have leptin resistance it it's going to take longer for you to lose weight if people have leptin over 100 um I've heard some bariatric surgeons say that you cannot lose weight unless you get surgery which is not true you just have to be really dialed in to your diet and just do a strict carnivore diet and at least cut out all carbohydrates because insulin blocks leptin and causes leptin resistance fructose independently blocks leptin and causes leptin resistance lectins these class of Defense defense chemicals in plants can bind to insulin receptors five times more tightly than insulin cause an insulin reaction and can Bine to leptin as well um and block it off and cause lepin resistance so sometimes people need to just get their their uh levels under control before they're going to start losing weight so just focus on your health focus on getting healthy Focus On Healing your body focus on just how you're doing don't worry about the scale um it'll happen but that's not the important thing the important thing is your health and that you're eating properly eat enough enjoy your life start doing things start going out for a walks start enjoying your life more and and um you know good things will happen but it can take time so just be patient empty Vines thank you so much for the super chat um hey how would you add fat if you can only get uh 8515 grass-fed beef um just add ghee question mark also I had both solid and watery stools today on pure carnivore is that type is that the type of stool if too much fat um well if you had a lot of like a lot more fat than you could eat just today you know it could be that that that came out quick and sort of flushed out the solid stools if that solid stool was really hard and dry and Rocky could be that that's that overflow diarrhea that I was talking about which is not enough and if you're only eating 8515 it's probably on that side of the equation um so yeah grass-fed ghee grass-fed ghee is fine grass-fed butter is usually fine for most people um grass-fed Tallow is great too but G's probably probably better you can also try to ask your butcher to try to get the fat trimmings and if he's a grass-fed butcher then try to do just just um the grass-fed uh yeah try to get the grass-fed fat trimmings and you sort of fry them up in a pan and and eat those along with your meat as well that's that's a great way to do it too okay so from question from darit I ordered 8 bounc bags of magnesium and potassium chloride and use Redmond's Real Salt uh in a mine from Amazon um measured out into a qut glass mason jar it was quite full I'm not sure what that's referring to um maybe that's referring to another question earlier that I didn't see but um okay sounds good um so yeah I I don't know if that saying that just adding that in make B basically making your own electrolytes which is uh which is great you know I mean people can buy sort of different electrolytes um and but if you just have your own sort of salt that you're using with pottassium chloride and magnesium and you just use the salt and that gets all your electrolytes you know that's sort of a good way and then you sort of salt your your food with all of those minerals and you sort of get them you know not a bad way to do it um You probably probably be fine without that stuff but early on some people can uh need a bit more so it just depends on the person and how you do and if that makes you feel better then great keep doing it probably won't need to do it forever though Tristan J Pinkerton thank you very much for the Super Chat I've just finished brain energy by Christopher Palmer fascinating book suggesting a link between mitochondrial dysfunction mental health and food um recommends the keto diet are you familiar with him yeah I actually had him on my podcast uh i' I've read his book too it's fantastic um he used to do carnivore diet he he's apparently um active in the um the the zero carb groups which is what carnivore used to be called um back in the day and so I think he does mostly keto now but um but he used to do carnivore and so you know he's not he's not um you know he certainly doesn't have a problem with that Carnival diet is a ketogenic diet I think his point is just that the ketogenic part of it is is is the main main part of it because being on a ketogenic diet for you know 3 four months increases the number and activity and and uh e efficacy of your of your mitochondria significantly so some Studies have shown that after three months on a ketogenic diet you'll have four times the number of mitochondria and they're four times as effective so it's a massive massive massive boost in your mitochondrial function uh but yes it's absolutely great um if you guys want to see my interview with Professor Palmer he's a psychiatrist who professor at Harvard and um and he's doing randomiz control trials as we speak on um on this exact thing and reversing uh schizophrenia major depression things like that with um with ketogenic diets which is great so uh yeah very interesting guy and really interesting conversation that we had we had to sort of cut it a bit short because he had another meeting directly at the hour um but uh yeah I I'd love to talk to him again about it it's very interesting so people can check that out on my YouTube channel with Chris Palmer Shane Templeton thank you very much for the super chat with the timeline you present regularly the 1920s uh being a major turning point in American Health is there a cities correlation acides correlation um found do ruminant animals not build up a load of pesticides or herbicides uh Etc over or is there a pesticides correlation uh found to ruminant animals not build up load of pesticides herbicides Etc over time actually it seems that they they probably detoxify and filter them out there was a a um an article I read um some months back that suggested that that cows for instance could actually filter out and eliminate glyphosate which would be great because you know pigs don't really um the thing is is that your body is going to going to you know there's this idea of forever chemicals just stay in your body and build up um these aren't them our bodies have a capacity to to filter out and and eliminate these different toxins um and um and other animals do too so you know they'll be filtering these things out and it'll be damaging them it won't be good for them they'll have some of that in there but it's not just going to just build up build up build up build up build up build up build up build up build up um no but also you know but they're so they're going to act as a filter so it will be less uh could it be getting in sure the ruminant animals are generally why people have an easier time eating it is because they are better at filtering these things out and not getting them in um oh that guy what was that guy um Dan Butner that compulsive liar I saw a little clip that he did uh where he said that oh if you want to reduce toxicity he actually had some some some decent points and then he of course landed with oh yeah and if you eat meat you know one pound of of grain-fed meat has equivalent of 11 pounds of uh plant toxins people worried about corn or soy and wheat and all the toxins in there well if you eat meat then you're going to have 11 pounds worth of toxins for every pound of meat total I mean he just pulled that straight out of his ass um and you know they these animals toxify these things and eliminate these things and also don't get the grain finish kind then huh maybe maybe think about that so he saying don't eat meat because if you feed the meat the wrong thing maybe it can have some bad stuff in it it's not going to be 11 11 times the amount uh but it's um you know eat grassfed then you know he's not talking about he's just a propagandist and you look at his body language in that clip he's he becomes very uncomfortable because he knows he's lying and um you you know so we know that cows and animals detoxify the plants that they eat especially if they are designed eat that plant and um ruminant animals are are really good at detoxifying things that they're not even supposed to eat and so um that's not true but what is true is that it can concentrate the phytonutrients they say oh you need these nutrients you need these phyto nutrients are so good for you okay well you know I don't you know these things haven't actually been proven to necessarily be essential but you know could they be of benefit sure guess what you have more of them in grass-fed meat than you do in the plants themselves so it filters out the bad things and keeps and maintains and stores and sequesters the beneficial things and the vitamins the minerals and the nutrients and that's what you want and so um you know there may be uh you know a bit of the stuff that you get but it's no it's not going to just build up build up build up build up build up as far as I know it's it's actually very good at at filtering these things out especially the ruminant animals which is why you know the argument goes you probably should avoid pigs chicken and fish that are being fed in in a species inappropriate diet because they're not going to be as good at filtering out the garbage um as as you'd like so yeah very good question Mason showers thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chy been carnivore for six months um 400 uh 400 to 500 levels triglycerides three months after and six months do I need to fast longer than 12 hours um no not necessarily you need to um make sure you're you're optimizing sleep prioritizing sleep um reducing stress that's something I've seen people have really stubborn triglycerides level levels is when they're is when they are really stressed out and they're having a really difficult time with school or work or things like that it's rare but it happens um I would also not worry too much about it as long as you're just eating fatty meat and just drinking water then you know your body's going to do what it's supposed to do um you're putting it best you're putting your best foot forward to allow your your your body to do what it needs to do and then you just uh reduce stress lift weights try doing sprints get sleep get proper sleep that's really important and uh and that'll come down those things will improve and what's most important is that your body will be improving the whole time so just take it easy also again it does matter how you take the test so you don't need to fast longer than than 12 hours if you want to you could but you know you want to do things consistently so first thing in the morning between 8 9:00 a. fasting from the night before 9:00 P p.m. so you want same time the same fasting level this gives you more consistent reliable results um only drinking water after 9:00 p.m. only drinking water in the morning no coffee tea anything certainly no food and um and then if you you don't exercise the morning of or the day before or even the day before that if you can help it um and no sex or stressful activities you just need to be calm you need to be relaxed stress levels can can really cause a A disruption of your blood blood results as well that's not necessarily in keeping of what is is normal for you um so I just keep all that stuff in mind and just keep getting data points and just focus on how you feel I wouldn't get too hung up on lab tests we treat patients we don't treat lab tests um you know just just remember that if you're well and you're feeling good that's what's important reduce stress improve sleep cut out everything except meat and water make sure you're getting enough fat and um yeah and then just keep getting data points but you know I mean just you know don't worry about it like just just check it again in you know in six months to a year and see how it's going you know and if you've done all those things and reduce stress and improve sleep you should be should be fine it should go in the right direction kame thank you very much for the Super Chat one month ribey and water without coffee uh or artificial sweeteners great job still serious dehy diarrhea uh my stool turn normal after eating fiber rich food advised yeah well the fiber is it slows things down and and causes bulk and th thickens things up you just like you you put fiber into you know they put sawdust into different foods to thicken it up um and so that's what it is you're adding a thickener to your to your stools so there are some of these cases that are a bit you know more more refractory um ribeye if it's very trimmed ribeye could still be not enough fat you could still need more fat um but let's say that you're you're eating enough fat you're not take things like magnesium or metformin which can also cause loose stools um and um and fiber again will thicken that up too um and you're you know let's assume that you're having more fat than your body needs or can absorb one thing to remember is that sometimes the rendered fat seems to cause uh bit of a difficulty for people to absorb and so it just sort of goes out a bit quicker and um so some people cut off the fat and actually eat it uncooked and then cook the meat separately to that and um that will be better for them to absorb so something to think about as well um and then again magnesium metform and all those sorts of things um it can also be microbiome issue that you're having this turnover in your microbiome and that can um that can cause a bit of loose stools that normally normalizes on its own or it could be that you know and if you're doing nothing else except ribe eyes and water then um you know it could be that you you just pull back a bit get a leaner cut see what's going on also one thing that people do sometimes they add a bunch of salt to their water that will give you diarrhea too so you know it's um it's not the case that you had to add a whole bunch of salt to your water um uh almost no one does some people some people do but most people don't and um and if you're getting if you're getting diarrhea and you're doing that then certainly don't do that so just remember that um and um you know if you really think that this is if this is uh a result of of much more fat than your body can absorb just reduce the fat that's all there is to it and that sorts it out that's what it was and if it sort of gets worse it could be that you have a bit of a blockage and you're having overflow diarrhea um so keep that in mind I mean you know adding a bit of fiber that would probably add to that obstruction and you'd have a bit of problems with that and You' have this Dr dry Rocky hard stool but um you know so uh if it's is just sort of not nice and soft there probably not that it probably is that your body's just for whatever reason not absorbing the fat uh you know either it's more fat than your body needs or it's um it's just not getting it because it's like rendered fat and you just need to cook it less cook the fat less and not eat as much of the rendered fat so try those things out and you should be fine even without the fiber okay carnivore for future thank you for the Super Chat uh 10 diseases ADHD ASD allergies etc etc I lived with all my life and is gone that's amazing after switching over to raw meat carnivore Jesus minus 375 pounds just 60 left to drop that's amazing um well that's fantastic I'm really glad to hear that I'm looking at the the picture of the thumbnail here there's a massive difference massive difference in way I'm so happy for you um well I don't know people check that out carnivore 4ore future um see you know if you've got a website or a YouTube channel and and some videos on that showing that I mean that that's going to be great uh for people to see and it'd be great to uh yeah have you on sometime and um uh you know talk about that because that's a massive massive massive Improvement and really really good job that's really impressive thank you very much for sharing that um DM me on uh Instagram or something like that and uh and uh we'll see about setting something up and get you maybe do an episode or something like that if that's something you want to do all right thanks for that what is thank you for the question mark or sorry thank you for the question mark thank you for the Super Chat I recently did a stool test and Cal protectant sits at 92 borderline uh range between um normal and elevated does this mean IBD and if so will carnivore help me thank you for all you do um well I'm I'm you know I'm not I'm not an expert in a stool test but um the the issue with IBD or IBS is the same you know you're eating things that your body's reacting to negatively and especially for IBD you're eating things your body is reacting to in an immune response and making antibodies that are attacking your body and attacking your intestines so the thing to do there is eliminate the cause eliminate the thing that you're eating that's triggering that response and yes a carnivore diet will help you in that and um generally red meat and water is the best high fat remember so high fat red meat and water uh that can definitely help you I have a I have a a um you really cut out everything else you people with autoimmune issues uh like IBD really need to be pure pure pure red meat and water high fat and cut out everything else all the sweeteners all the you know natural flavorings everything just just meat just water nothing else high fat and um and so if you um if you do that that can that can really help um I do a video um it's called like you know what they don't want you to know about autoimmune diseases and um and I go into I go into some of the literature specifically on IBD and um and hopefully I can help but yes IBD responds very well well all autoimmune I've never seen an autoimmune issue not respond extremely well to just a pure red meat and water diet so um if that's what's going on that should help so good luck with that Michael Robert thank you for the Super Chat do you think having your appendix remove negatively affects your digesting capabilities thanks um no probably not I mean there may be some sort of you people people speculate over you know the function that that remains to the appendix which you know probably is something but um it's certainly not a digestive capacity like it once was it used to be 4 foot long seeum that was blind and you know had a you know just a pouch a blind pouch and uh and that's where fiber would pack into and ferment into saturated fat and and the bacteria would die off and get absorbed as protein so you know we don't do that anymore we haven't done that in millions of years um and uh because we haven't needed two millions of years and so that that organ is shriveled up and is now this digal at least in that regard so no I don't think it I don't think it contributes to your digestion in any any significant way so if you had that removed I I don't think that's going to harm you from a digestive uh capacity you know maybe there's something else that it does but maybe not you know some people some people say they're like well it's probably there to like Reed your your bacteria after you take antibiotics like um you know we've had appendixes uh long before antibiotics existed right so and and and if antibiotics is going to damage the the microbes in your gut the appendix is part of your gut and so you're getting systemic antibiotic effect that's gonna that can that's going to get the um the appendix just like it's going to get other parts of your of your colon as well so um you know maybe some diarrheal diseases you know you're getting some some viral infections from norovirus and you're having diarrhea and that's flushing out a lot of bacteria you know maybe that maybe that's something that can help recede who knows um but either way it's it's it's it shouldn't negatively affect your digestion anyway stink ass cat thank you for the Super Chat uh you rock dock uh change is happening I run into other carnivores all the time uh at the meat counter my grocery store well that's awesome that's really good to hear that more people are getting this it works you know and all you have to do is test it yourself and um if you want to wait for the the larger studies to come out that's that's perfectly fine that's very reasonable but you know I'm more than convinced by the evidence biological evidence The evolutionary evidence fossil record the biochemical physiological anatomical um and human data uh when we make these interventions like ke enic diets like elimination diets for autoimmune diseases like Crohn's Etc and this is not a new idea you know Salsbury came came up with this in the 1800s um stefanson came up with this in the early 1900s um Dr vand uh wrote a book about this in the in the S 1970s right this is not a New Concept this is an old concept that that keeps trying to be buried by multi-trillion dollar special interests uh so but the truth will out and this is working and it works for people and that's what matters you try something and it says well for whatever reason it helped me so I'm going to keep going with this and that's really it doesn't does not matter after that if it helps you it helps you and that's what's important Dom the founder thank you for the Super Chat what can we do about insomnia on the carnivore diet never had a problem sleeping before also where do I get the fat from so you want to get the fat from largely from the meat itself you want to get the the actual fat tissue um and and barring that if you're not getting enough add grass-fed butter most people do fine with butter um sometimes insomnia can be for a lot of reasons so a lot of people improve their insomnia on Carnivore I certainly did um my God my sleep improved so much on that um then I did other things like adding a sleep mask you know just blackout mask um trying to optimize my sleep routine trying to go to bed at a normal time that rarely happens but um turning the lights off putting on Blue Block blue light blocking classes to help settle me down and stop all that stimulus in my eyes so like wake me up until my brain is high noon and um and then you know you could also try taking um you know small dose of Melatonin every now and then that helps you sleep that can help reset your circadian rhythm and your body clock and reset you at a certain time so you want to try to take this at the same time every night um you it doesn't have to be but um that that helps that's better to try to set your circadian rhythm so your body gets used to this is when we go to sleep take it at 9ine o'clock because you want to be asleep at 10 o'clock you turn off the lights dim them at least put on the blue blocking glasses things like that um that can help um and then the the sleep mask that's really helps too and then you just get into a pattern and a rhythm that you know that's good thing about the mask as well you sort of put on your body just SS yeah sleep time this is what we do when we sleep and so I when I put that sleep mask on I I'm asleep within minutes it's normally half an hour an hour before I can get to sleep very difficult it's uh it's really annoying uh or at least it was because I don't have that anymore so um I would try all those the I have heard people say that they can't sleep without carbs you know salor is one of these things you know you I so you could it I would try these things first because I I would I would bet that it will it will sort it out it sorts it out for most people um you know even adding in a bit of melatonin I I that can help a lot and that can help reset things and get you going then you don't need the Melatonin after that but if you find that you do all these things and exhaust all these different Avenues you know have a glass of whole milk raw preferably um before you go to bed if I have a glass of milk like even raw milk um you know I avoid it because of the sugars and the carbs but uh every now once a year or so when I when I get my hands on some raw milk or something like that I might have some and man I'm within an hour I am just like nodding off on the couch in the middle of the day right and so that's uh that could be that where you're you're sort of suppressed your Ketone levels your blood sugar goes up but then it comes down and now your ketones are down your insulin's up so you're not making any and you're not making any blood sugar either right now your blood sugar's a little low and you're just and your brain just gets a little tired I mean you know starving your brain for energy to make you go to sleep maybe not the best idea but you know if that's if that's the only thing that gets you down then fine I mean that used to be an old um treatment for sleep was a warm warm glass of milk would help people go to sleep maybe that's why not sure but I certainly noticed a similar sort of result um so give those other things a try first and then maybe add the raw milk as well whole milk you need the fat and you want it raw and non-homogenized if you can Alicia thank you for the Super Chat I think there's um yeah you posted your question down here how can I get enough fat um Bilo pan I'm GNA say pancreatic diversion with duodenal switch um 75 cm of common Channel estimated I only absorb 20% of the fats I consume Creon prescription enzymes question mark have severe IBS IBD already uh look if you if you have pancreatic insufficiency due to this um you know this issue it looks like diversion so surgical I'm I'm guessing um then yeah you might have uh issues the the bile is what's going to help you absorb it but if it's not breaking down enough because you're not having the digestive enzymes coming from your your pancreas then um yeah you may need to take that and so talk to your doctor about that see if you do um and then if you get enough just from taking Creon uh which is these digestive enzymes um that for people with pancreatic insufficiency if people don't know that um and that helps and that's great if you're still not absorbing enough and it might be a bile issue you you could take some ox pile but the idea that your body wouldn't be making enough is probably pretty low um because your liver just makes it stuff automatically and if it's not getting down into your um into your small intestine it's backing up into the liver and you're getting jaundice right so that's uh that's unlikely I I don't think you'll need to take Ox pile I think that um if pancreatic not pancre pancreas isn't working you have pancreatic insufficiency then taking cre Creon uh prescription enzymes is probably a good idea so talk to your doctor about that and see if that's something you need okay so Copperhead Jones thank you for the super chat um doctor wants to do an ankle Fusion due to osteoarthritis I don't want to do it do I have hope that I can walk painfree someday day going carnivore um probably not painfree but very very potentially uh reduced pain um fusions aren't fun on the ankle obviously you know you're going to be walking very stiffly for the rest of your life so I I definitely understand the the desire not to do that if you strengthen the joint if you strengthen the muscles around the ankle doing calf raises things like that toe raises even with a bit of of weight attached to your toes that'll strengthen up the ankle joint that'll stabilize it that'll make it hurt less as well cornivore diet will reduce your inflammation it's not going to regrow your cartilage though it's just going to reduce the pain that you experience is that going to eliminate all pain likely not but it can reduce it significantly to the point that other people have said hey I don't need a joint replacement anymore you know look at my interview with Dr Gary fety Fe K he's an orthopedic surgeon here in Australia and he would put people on keto carnivore diets who needed joint replacement surgeries and he would say hey okay I'll put you on for a joint replacement here's your date in three months but until that you need to be on this diet this keto carnivore diet and he said the ones that were able to stick with it after about two months he would often get a call from them and and they would say hey Doc I don't think I need surgery anymore my shoulder feels great my knee feels great and so he's oh okay no problem we we'll cancel the list that's that's not a problem let me know if you need anything and um Dr Baker found that too you know that's what he got in trouble for originally as an orthopedic surgeon because he was telling people about these dietary methods and they didn't need surgery anymore and it pissed off his hospital because he's not bringing in the millions anymore right because these are expensive ass surgeries you know um and so the hospital makes a lot of money on them that's not what we're here for we're not here as doctors to make profits for a company and an organization we're here to help people and if the if the best way to help them is changing their diet not doing surgery then that's what you do um you're immoral and unethical if you do anything else um if you do the more costly procedure that causes more harm to the patient you're a bad doctor you're a bad person and you should lose your license you should not be allowed to practice medicine on people so the right thing to do is to do the right treatment the correct treatment the best treatment the one that's going to do less harm or no harm and going to give them the be the best outcome possible and uh diet really is the first first step there you may need a fusion people do ankle Replacements now or um so arthroplasties where they they replace the joint in the ankle like they can in the shoulder like they can in the knees um so you don't necessarily need a fusion anyway it could be that you depending on what's going on it could be that you uh can get a uh um a joint replacement but you know not everybody does these it's a it's a you know it's a bunch uh well it's not it's not a very common surgery so um you know uh that's an option too but I would definitely try it I mean good Lord why wouldn't you you know try it for three months see how you go get a lot of fat a lot of meat stop eating when it stops tasting good cut out everything else even coffee and tea they will increase inflammation that will increase pain in your ankle it will trust me on that it will and so just high fat meat just water that's it you will reduce your pain you will is it going to be enough that you say okay I can live like this or I can function normally like this especially with the exercises great you know that's a question you need to that you need to answer and if it can then great and if it can't and it's just still too much even though it's improved you know you always have surgery it's you're not going to die if you if you don't get surgery right now right this isn't a life or limb threatening emergency it's just pain it's uncomfortable so you have time you know you have to do this and you can see that um you know what it does and how it how it affects you and uh strengthen the muscles strengthen the ankle joint and change your diet and uh you will get improvements hopefully enough that you don't need surgery and if you do need surgery look into ankle Replacements as opposed to fusions Patra Schuman thank you for the Super Chat two months in I still have daily diarrhea this is a diarrhea day today I I will not thought eat 7030 fat to protein by calories I'm assuming yeah I take electrolytes uh no coffee have microscopic colitis what can I try um well the microscopic colitis you know I mean you should you know be that you're having a bit of inflammation to something um and irritation so I would I would definitely try to um reduce out anything except for red meat and um and that's it so just red meat and water just salt to taste and uh and see how you go um and get rid of everything else uh you're taking electrolytes do those electrolytes have artificial sweeteners like Stevia or arrol mon fruit sugar if they do they cause diarrhea get rid of them are you taking other electrolytes like magnesium if you do stop it um magnesium can cause diarrhea if you're taking met forant which is a very typical drug for a lot of people with diabetes to take that can cause loose stools does that mean you stop that no you talk to your doctor about that but it's just to understand that that can cause loose stools as well so all these things adding on can can cause problems um you're not drinking coffee which is great but what about tea tea can cause diarrhea as well so you want to stop absolutely everything besides fatty meat and water um try to stick to beef as well lamb especially if you have signs of inflammation in your in your colon um and then if you're still getting that and there's nothing else explaining it you know you can try and reduce it a bit more I think you know that that 7030 facted protein by calories is is usually pretty good usually people don't get diarrhea on that unless they're having other things like Stevia in their electrolytes or orthol mon fruit sugar so cut out all those things first if that doesn't quite do the trick just reduce use the fat a bit see how you go you should get to a point where things solidify up and um you know if you get too to blocked up again you can get overflow diarrheas watery stools with dry hard craggly rocks that come out every now and then and obviously that means a lot more fat is what you need so good luck with that so Beverly thank you for the Super Chat hello Dr chaffy uh thank you for all you do for everyone I have hemocromatosis but do not eat or me uh do I need to be concerned on a carnivore diet no I don't think so I have I have patients that um have stopped needing to give blood um because of their hemocromatosis and then one gentleman doesn't even have genetically hemocromatosis he just had the phenotype for it he just his iron was going up up up up up up up up and so every two months he needed to give give blood and um at least they um and these are just isolated cases but um they have um not needed to give blood since then and their body just perfectly regulates their blood uh iron levels so this is the thing it's about it's about the metabol metabolizing your iron properly as opposed to you're getting too much in I mean there are people that that eat meat and and have low iron levels you know so what's going on there or they have normal so it's not it's not about how much you're bringing in it's about how your body's utilizing it and how your body is is processing meat or or processing the iron so that's the problem with hemrom is you're not metabolizing it properly or other people that have different sort of metabol metabolite issues with hemrom or that don't have hemocromatosis but have the same effects of H chromatosis which is uh high iron levels so see how it goes it's certainly not going to hurt you um I think that and it can potentially improve how your body metabolizes iron Dr Baker has a lot more patience that in his database with Rivero um this is just my practice but I'm seeing so I have I have a smaller patient uh database to to draw from but Dr Baker has well over 10,000 people in Rivero I think he been 12,000 for a long time they've opened it up to more people now so who knows where they're at now um and he said that they've had a number of patients with hemocromatosis actually improved their iron levels so you know if uh if you still need to get blood draws every couple months you know snow skin off your back you're still you're you're doing the same thing uh but it could very well could very will help and it's not going to hurt you anyway it's not there not something that's going to limit you if you have a bit of organ meat every now and then I I don't think that's a big deal either um just do that to taste you has very good nutrients in it B12 B6 folate um is a very important vitamin that um uh sometimes people are lacking if they're only eating muscle meat so something to think about there too so you know having a bit of organs every now and then is fine and um uh see how it goes see how I mean obviously keep testing your iron and see what happens there but um I think that well hopeful that well that it'll improve things but I don't think it'll make it worse anyway I don't think there's anything special you need to do um so yeah good luck with that let us know how that goes because um we we don't see or I don't see all that many people with human chromatosis and so I talked about I talk to them and I and I give this advice to them um and I see some of them come back and improve but you know a lot of them go away and don't come back and don't tell me so I want to know I want to know is this actually helping the majority of people or is it just a one-off here and there so that's the important thing so see how it goes for you see how it goes in the next few months and um and if it's good you know please do report back and let everyone know how you're doing okay everyone this looks like the last uh Super Chat um some of the ones that that came in late um uh are are here so this is the last one of those so I'll stop it after this guys um and then spend about three and a half hours so I think that's a pretty good session um okay question from P thank you for the super chat um I've been full carnivore no salt eight months no improvements in my psoriasis your thoughts on water fasting for 14 plus days um fasting helps psoriasis you can certainly try it fasting for over 14 days is quite long you have to worry about refeeding issues um so if you are going to start eating again you eat a small amount just just start with just a small bit see how your body reacts wait a couple hours if you want to eat again you eat again um I tried fasting once I just did four days didn't really feel like eating for most of those days anyway and on the you after I finished four days I sort of thought like do I even want to eat actually don't feel hungry but you know I did that in my early 20s where I wasn't eating four days in time and I it caught up with me and so that's not what you want to do so I did eat and I got back to eating normally and that's fine um but uh I didn't have much of an appetite I only ate a little bit that first day my body didn't watch to much so still listen to your body just have a little bit if you're going to refeed you don't even necessarily have to do 14 plus days fasting I don't know first of all I don't know of much benefit from fasting outside of you know cancer that um that you get that on top of just not eating the wrong things if you're eating fatty meat and not eating carbs or sugar and you're in that correct metabolic state that ketogenic metabolic State then um then that that does that does most of it you get the autophagy you get the mitophagy you're you're removing all these things your body's reacting negatively to and so on but if you want to if you want to fast and and you want to see if that helps you know go for it just be careful um if you're doing a longer fast like longer than five days you need to just you know slowly reintroduce food and um and make sure your body's handling that properly um another thing that I've seen with psoriasis first of all psoriasis you know this these sorts of things like psoriasis autoimmune issues in general they respond much better to just red meat and water so if you're having pork chicken fish Dairy eggs all those things cut those out just go red meat and water and um that is people generally do a lot better with that and um and then people that I've seen that even do that but just have really stubborn cases of sasis um one gentleman told me that um after about 6 months of just lion diet that he is is soris wasn't shifting and so he started using uh Tallow just plain Tallow no sense or or or anything like that um as a moisturizer and he said just gone uh that that that that did it so I mentioned that to a couple other people that had refractory cases and it seemed to help them into as well so try that try to get some just Flatout Tallow or emu oil or something like that with no sense and nothing else and um um and so um if you do that um that can potentially help as well and uh you just go red meat and water use Tallow as a as a moisturizer it's the best thing for your skin ever anyway it says i' I've never had better skin than when I've used that stuff and um and then if you want to fast on top of that you can try uh just remember about refeeding and uh just easing back into things don't starve yourself too much your body needs food um you can handle periods without eating all all predators can all animals can we always all have to survive famines at one point or another or else our species wouldn't exist anymore um so we're capable of doing that but um I don't think it's necessary and unless you have a Cancer and you're specifically trying to drop your blood sugar and get your key tones up as high as possible so see how you go hopefully that that clears up and um hopefully those just red meat and water and the Tallow sorts it out if not and you want to try fasting you know go for it hopefully it helps okay all right thank you all very much I really appreciate that I'm going to um do a uh you know the weekly new video as as always on Monday morning Australia time Sunday afternoon evening in America and um that'll be sort of same time as always or thereabouts and um so hopefully people can join that for the premiere and and chat live and we do

in the comments let me know is that is that something useful to you guys cutting these things up into shorter shorter uh bites and um uh shorter pieces of content is that helpful or is it just sort of um or is it just sort of too much just let me know down in the comments if you can and uh thank you all very much and we'll see you next week I'll try to do another I'm going to start doing two of these a week uh on the weeks that I can um yeah so I'll probably do this next Wednesday morning my time Tuesday afternoon evening in America so we'll see how that goes and um and if that's a good time for people we'll do that Monday Friday or in America Tuesday Thursday and we'll see how we go and then Premier is on Sunday Monday all right everyone thank you very much please do like and share or sub subscribe if you haven't and want to see more sort of content like this and get updates on my my videos as they come out please do leave a comment about what you thought maybe your experiences with things that we talked about today like hemocromatosis stubborn diarrhea and all the other things that we talked about other people are going to have these same problems too and that can really help them going through the comments and uh and reading about that so all right thank you all very much and I'll see you next time"
