        "body": "ks guys Grace home kitchen thank you very much for the ks guys Grace home kitchen thank you very much for the Super Chat hi I'm 41-year-old female living with phah and arthritis 6 weeks on Carnivore lost 6 kgs which is absolutely fantastic very very well done um and and pain almost gone I just want to know can carnivore diet reverse my phah um so well first of all I just want to say you know it's it's only been six weeks you've already um you've already lost six kilos your pain has has significantly improved from your arthritis that's an amazing um that's an amazing Improvement already it's only been six weeks um the issue with ph and again there you know I I I say this other times but there are a lot of acronyms out there so I am going to assume you mean one of the more common ones which is um you know pulmonary hypertension pulmonary arterial arterial hypertension and um that's at least only one I can think of right now with that acronym so um I I don't know is the short answer it's not something that I've seen too much of it's not it's not a disease that I treat it's not issue that I treat um I haven't come across too many people that have reported back so you know if I had it would be very anecdotal I haven't seen studies on ketogenic diets and um uh phah they could be there there are literally thousands of these things so I've I've seen dozens and dozens I haven't seen thousands I haven't looked at all the thousands that are out there but you can you can check this out and if people have a condition that you're that you're living with you want to say okay you know can a carnivore diet help me well there may not be one on a carnivore diet but a carnivore diet is a high fat animal-based ketogenic diet and the ketogenic diets in the literature are high-fat meat-based ketogenic diets they're just cutting out carbohydrates what do you replace that with fat protein but they replace that with fat and protein from meat they don't replace that with fat and protein from Plants because it's it's a very poor source of fat and protein and nutritionally deficient in many ways and significantly inferior in even more ways so they don't so these thousands of studies that do ketogenic diets are all animal-based diets they're all meat-based diets and that's probably why the powers that you are trying to trash it because they they want us to think that meat is harmful even though it doesn't harm any other animal on earth carnivores or herbivores herbivores routinely will eat uh smaller animals opportunistically I've seen elk and deer eat uh ducklings and little chickens and even rabbits like full-grown rabbits that was a weird one but um because they don't have the right teeth so they're just chewing this in a very strange way and um but they do you know this doesn't hurt them right it doesn't hurt us either why would we be the only creature on Earth that gets hurt from eating our natural evolved diet and and meat doesn't have any toxins in it it's not toxic to any form of life they can have a poison sack that's different the meat itself is not poisonous to anything anything I know of anyway I couldn't imagine anything toing because herbivores eat this stuff too opportunistically so either way um you can look up ketogenic like go on you know Pub met or Google Scholar something like that something you have access to and just look up P or ar ar arterial arterial hypertension and ketogenic diet and see if anything's come up see if someone has studied it they have I mean literally there's thousands of these things you can also look at fasting mimicking diets and whatever disease or disorder that You' come up with because that's a way of hiding the word ketogenic because that's a bit of a four- lever word in some academic circles and so you know they say it's like well we know fasting is is really good and helpful in these conditions but you know that's really hard to fast for this period of time and so what about a diet that mimics fasting right it gets you in the same metabolic State as when you're fasting uh AKA a ketogenic diet so a cornivore diet is a ketogenic diet so anything that applies to those like those benefits you get from ketogenic diet from animal- based meat-based ketogenic diets are going to apply to a carnivore diet um and then some because you're cutting out more than just the carbs you're cutting out more than just carbs and and going into that metabolic State you're also cutting out all the plant toxins that are coming with that and um and there's plenty of books on this look up you know Dr gundry's you know the plant Paradox look up uh most delicious poisons is written by a professor of biology at UC Berkeley an evolutionary biologist and professor of biology there um and any textbook on botany I mean they all cover this stuff plants are toxic that's how they survive they're not they're not duking it out with people they not running away fighting back um scratching people and clawing them and attacking and all these other sorts of things they're just sitting there they're sitting ducks they're just they're not even trying to run away they're not even trying to hide idiots you know so how the hell they defend themselves why are they not why are they still there you know why do they exist as a form of life because they have actually have really robust defenses and they are chemical in nature the vast majority are chemical in nature they are Toxic by Design and so you get rid of these things you're going to get rid of these toxins um so that's where I do I would look up for that unfortunately I don't know if there is literature on ph and uh ketogenic diets that could be extrapolated to people don't on a carnivore diet but I do know that you're going to be helped in a number of other ways just like you know the previous question that there are so many good reasons for going on a carnivore diet and hopefully it helps your issue but even if it doesn't it's going to improve your life in a thousand different ways and it's going to be more than more than it can certainly make your life a lot easier and a a lot better and uh better able to deal with your your phah as a result of that and just be healthier overall and just be as healthy as you possibly can be in the body that you have and hopefully it gets better but again there are things in this world that can harm us that that are outside of our diet and uh a lot of things are from our diet a lot I would say like 90% of the diseases that we're treating now the issues that we're treating now as doctors are come from the eating and in appropriate diet a biologically inappropriate diet easily 90% but that leaves 10% that's not from that but you can be as healthy as you possibly can be and you're going to be better able to weather and heal from those other 10% of things so that's what I would suggest is just doing it anyway and seeing how you go and you can check and see on Google Scholar a PBM and see if there's anything on ketogenic diets or fasting mimicking diets and anybody else who has an issue that they're concerned about do that same search more often than not you'll find something you'll find something very promising and uh and it can can uh most likely help you and there's just more and more data coming out every single day and so it's a very exciting time because we're actually we're actually healing people it's almost as if it's almost as if uh you know the the the system was working in a way and the people are actually trying to help each other and figure out the root causes of disease um these diseases just never existed before and now they're just the only things we treat so what happened something in our environment so you identify what happened in our environment wasn't meat we've always been eating meat so that wasn't it so it's something new right like processed food seed oils refined sugars refined carbs this crazy plant-based push that everyone's been trying to shove down our throats for the last 60 years actually really 150 years if you want to go back far enough so that's what's new meat's not new so just eat your biological design and you'll be as healthy as you're biologically designed to be and that's pretty damn healthy all life on Earth is extraordinarily healthy the natural state of all life from single cell animals you know to humans and everything in between trees plants fungus everything they're all healthy they the natural state is to be healthy so why are we sick why 90% of Americans why are 90% of Americans uh unwell why do they have at least one metabolic disease why are 70% of people in Western countries overweight or obese why is that you know that's not normal that's not natural that's not supposed to happen um so something's happening in our environment we're doing this to ourselves and it's not meat we've always been eating meat that's established we already know that's safe right they have to prove that eating this other crap is better than eating meat or or at least or even safe at all they have not done that they've started at that as a position of yeah fruits and vegetables are really good and then meat is bad saturated fat cholesterol o that causes a disease therefore anything without saturated fat cholesterol is de facto good for you that was the whole argument and so we're starting from the point of well hold on everyone knows plants you have to prove that meat's good you have to prove that we don't need have meat was established that was just usurped and they just sort of did a little coup and got meat kicked out of there but that was the established reigning champ no one ever proved that plants were good for you they just said that saturated fat and cholesterol were bad for you so things without saturated fat and cholesterol de facto became good for you because the only thing was bad was saturated fat and cholesterol and therefore anything without saturated fat and cholesterol automatically became good for you uh that's not how that game works but they snuck it through good job them you know got to you know give credit where credit's due they were the sneaky little bastards and they they shoveled something through that should never have gotten through and hey you know more power to to them but now we've recognized what happened we we see the game and we just plug up that hole and say no that's meat is established we've already always eaten meat that is what's healthy that's the Baseline you have to prove that something else is better not the other way around so just go back to Baseline eat what we've been eating for millions of years eat what biologically appropriate for our diet for our for our species and you will be as healthy as you can be and hopefully that helps your phah and if not it'll still make you a lot healthier and you'll feel a lot better having to deal with the ph and so at least that's something anyway all right thank you everyone I hope that was helpful I hope that was useful for people and um I will see you on the next live event and I will see those in uh London in uh the weekend of the 18th in May and then people in Austin for the hack your health conference at the end of May and then in Switzerland s maritz in uh early June that one's going to be awesome really looking forward to that and then um and then in August I'll be in San Diego for the uh Summit for metabolic Health I'll be speaking there again this year last year I gave a a talk on cancer and ketogenic metabolic therapy as a novel adjunct for um treating cancer and then um and then I'll be in Wyoming for the the the beef Roundup in um rivert Wyoming which is now being dubbed the most carnivore friendly city on earth and that would be great because that's just a gorgeous part of the country gorgeous part of the world and so if people are there and want to go and wrestle a bear I don't recommend that but they have them there and um best to be looked at through the window anyway but gorgeous country and it'll be a lot of a lot of fun with a lot of great people
