    "transcript": "pasteurized eggs I know they they know they cost more but you get a lot more for your money because you're getting a lot more nutrients I think it was Joe saladan that does regenerative forming in the states that said that normal USDA average egg had 41 Mig of folate or so his eggs that were just pasturas had over a thousand so there's actually a lot more micronutrients that you're getting for this and so what you're spending on pasturized eggs you're not spending on supplements and vitamins and things like that not that you'd really need it even on normal eggs but you know it's not going to be as nutrient dense all right hello everyone thank you for joining um this is live for March 22nd for me March 21st for America um all right so thank you everyone for joining thank you everyone for joining we got people on Facebook and YouTube and X so thanks everyone for that so Cody d says Dr chaffy can I do a carnivore diet with chronic gastritis something seems to be helping me or nothing seems to be helping me terrible Burning Sensations along with constipation um is it going to heal is it going to heal that somehow um well look you know there's there's a lot of different causes of of of gastritis um one of them being carbohydrates because you know insulin when you eat carbohydrates insulin goes up insulin affects a lot of things in your body including the production of um acid in your stomach and so when you're eating more carbs you're eating more uh you're you're getting more insulin and then you're going to sort of increase the acidity of your stomach and so that can be a bit of a problem there so people find that they actually get a lot of relief from their their gut issues and reflux and all that sort of stuff um uh when they do that uh is it is it going to heal yours I don't know depends on what's causing yours it depends on what the problem is I don't know if you've had like scope down your throat to see if anything else is going on if there's an ulcer or any other sort of problem but it has helped a lot of people constipation is going to be a bit different than the gastritis though that can definitely be helped with constipate with um a carnivore diet because if you eat enough fat that will move things through your bowels and so you won't have you won't have a a problem with constipation anyway um some people get worried because they they don't go all that often when they go on a carnivore diet and that's normally when they get blocked up or it's because they're blocked up that they're not going that often so they get very worried about that um but as long as you're eating enough fat it will it will come out it's just that you're absorbing most of the food that you're eating which is good that's why you eat food is to absorb it not to have it pass through so um that is that is something that can definitely help and hopefully the gastritis gets helped as well but you know you need to you need to work with your doctor as well because there could be other things going on um that uh could be causing that and but either way you're going to get a lot of other improvements and it can certainly help your constipation if you eat enough fat vertical pedal garage my wife is 43 years old has joined me on the carnivore diet she recently had blood work done our doctor is expressing or and our doctor is expressing concerned about her kidney function uh um okay be yeah so so the thing is is that with kidney function if it's if it's to do with well if it's actual kidney then your creatin is going to go up and that's going to show a slowing of your of your filtration rate that's generally just dehydration um if your bu creatinine uh both go up together or or your um or your just your nitrogen and Ura go up then that's uh just you're processing more protein and so when you when you process amino acids for energy you have to cleave that amino group and then that turns into Ura that turns into um or it turns into ammonia that turns into Ura and that gets cleared out of your system and so um if you're eating uh a lot of protein and your body starts using that for energy you're going to start seeing your Ura go up and so really what you can do there is you can just increase the amount of fat that you're eating but increased Ura separate from creatinine isn't isn't a sign of kidney issues it's just a sign that you're metabolizing more uh amino acids if your creatinine is going up then sure you know that's that's sign that your kidneys are slowing down but that's generally to do with not drinking enough water it's not to do with eating meat in fact most people improve their kidney functions going on a carnivore diet and the studies show that high protein diets actually improve kidney function they don't worsen them so uh drink more water and maybe drink eat more fat as opposed to protein a lot of people go way too lean on when they do carnivore they eat a lot more fat than they've ever eaten before but it's still not enough fat and so it's um it's something that you need to uh you know be be mindful of and make sure that you're getting enough fat okay all right so question from cat um Can doc address the morelan no doctors are talking about it is painful and debilitating for some of us uh many things I actually don't know what that is um more Mor gallons never heard of that let me look that up okay so it's a it's like a skin condition sort of thing don't know haven't haven't never heard of Mor gallons before um but it does help with a lot of a lot of other skin issues a lot of skin issues can be from different sorts of you know toxins in the body coming in from your food or from different products that you use and put on your skin or ingest and um and that can cause problems problems um if you're losing weight you can release different toxins and that cause different sorts of rashes um sometimes called like a keto rash and they just tend to go away on their own so I don't I don't know what that particular issue is that that you're talking about there unfortunately so I can't really say anything more specific about that and Peter Brown asks what is the nutritional difference between cooked meat and raw meat well you just you you denature some of the of the nutrients you denature some of the amino acids like torine there are many others and and a lot of the enzymes that are in the cells you'll denature those as well so some people think that it's um beneficial to get more raw meat because you get all these enzymes that can help digest the food with you and help you absorb more and you get more of these proteins that are um not denatured but as I understand it you'll lose you'll lose some nutrients by cooking but you also make more others more bioavailable so there's a bit of a tradeoff there and we've been cooking meat for at least 800,000 years so I'm pretty sure we're used well used to cooking meat um things like tan are not essential for humans they are essential for cats so cats have to have raw meat to get enough nutrients and um that doesn't seem to be the case for us if are if you want to sort of have less cooked meat and um you know and try to make sure you're getting enough nutrients that way um then you can but um I think I think you just go with whatever whatever you feel like whatever I I've normally naturally gravitated towards less cooked meat just tastes better to me um but I still sort of will sear the outside and keep the inside pretty rare question from uh Sandra thank you very much Sandra for the Super Chat hi all been carnivore uh 10 months rheumatoid flares uh still and developed a trigger finger besides um metacarpal septic AR arthritis uh surgery site uh Dr inject attended last week could it heal interesting um generally that that they both go um well at least the rumor uh flares go um it depends on what's going on with your finger but um question I was asked is are are you doing just the lion diet are you doing just strictly red meat and water because that makes a big difference even even just eating pork chicken or fish that has been fed things that it's not supposed to have or eggs or dairy uh those those can can give you flare ups and and cause you to have problems with rheumatoid so just go just purely red meat and water that's what that you know term the lion diet that um Michaela Peterson coined that term because that's what she had to do with her rheumatoid arthritis she wasn't able to have anything except beef and pork be beef and lamb and so give that a try and and see you go plenty of water but you also need to sleep you also need to prioritize sleep you need to get your stress levels down and try to um yeah just try to be as healthy as you can in other respects as well um that that all makes a difference and if grain finished beef and lamb isn't doing the trick then you know you might be just a bit more sensitive you need to go to to grass-fed beef and L that's always the Baseline of feeling the best is if you can do that if you can afford it and you can have access to it that's that's always going to be the best especially for for autoimmune diseases so give that a try really cut everything else out absolutely everything else out if you're having coffee or tea or any artificial sweeteners or anything like that just cut them out and um and hopefully that will clear it up Stags thank you for the Super Chat how do I lower my cholesterol on a carnivore diet to make my doctor happy and off my back well you can go back to eating carbs you could um go back to doing things that were unhealthy for you and um then your body would respond accordingly by lowering your cholesterol which is uh high cholesterol High total cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol is actually asso associated with longevity and lower rates of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and infectious disease and some cancers so uh you could potentially do that it wouldn't necessarily but you know there was there is the Oreo study that um Nick norwitz did but it was an N of one he just did a self- experiment he put himself he he's on a nearly carnivore diet and he just ate a whole sleeve of Oreo cookies uh every day so like 12 Oreo cookies a day for I think it was 2 weeks and ended up being 16 days and that just complet you just dropped his LDL completely so you could try that um I wouldn't necessarily recommend it I might do a self- experiment and try see if you could drink like a you know gallon of milk a day you know like raw milk and see if that um that has enough carbohydrates to to drop your your blood sugar and then you're still not bringing in all the rest of the garbage that comes with Oreo cookies and things like that or you could try other sorts of carbs like you know white rice or something like that I mean the thing is is that um if it's if it's just your doctor being happy like it's the the doctor's not there for uh you're not there to make your doctor happy he's there to make you healthy and that's obviously why he's maybe a bit unhappy is because he thinks you're being unhealthy but you know at the end of the day you know he he needs to um respect your wishes in your life choices um and um if you don't agree that that cholesterol is is necessarily bad for you which I don't think that it is the case then you know you just you know basically just don't worry about it um if it's something for like a life insurance policy or some sort of you know check at work or something like that you know may be more more of an issue but you know you do you really want to sort of do do this every time you know that that your doctor takes a blood test for you I mean just you know you can get a you get other tests that actually look for disease cholesterol is not a disease atherosclerosis is a disease and the thought is that cholesterol causes atherosclerosis but there's just boundless evidence to say that it does not um you can show them the lean mass hyperresponders Studies by by uh Dave Felman and Nick norwitz uh when they um showed that people with so-called elevated LDL for 4.7 years like very elevated according to standard Doctrine um we're on these diets for you know with elevated LDL for uh 4.7 years on average that they had absolutely no progression in their plaque in fact the trend was to decrease atherosclerotic plaque so you know you can show them that um and hopefully this just sort of shifts and moves to the point that you don't uh you don't need to to worry about it anymore in your actually doesn't either hey everyone if you need a little extra help getting started on a carnivore diet and my online resources that I have for free aren't enough for you you can go to www.how carnivore decom and sign up for a 30-day carnivore challenge where you'll have online Resources Group support weekly Zoom meetings as well as the ability to chat live with myself Simon Lewis and the others in the challenge who can help you and support you and give you extra advice and help along the way so if that sounds like something that would be beneficial to you then please go to howt carnivore docomo consultation he eats only salmon bison and veggies he gets uh pain headaches daily and screams in pain I'm really sorry to hear that um uh yeah I I I do consultations I do try to keep all my stuff for free so that people don't need to pay because I don't uh don't want them to pay they don't if they don't um don't need to uh so I do have a lot of videos on autism um talking about you know sort of as much as I know about it anyway um you know if you need sort of ideas on how to sort of help him encourage him to eat I I we could do that I mean I have links for um booking a consultation in most of my videos probably this one too if it's um if it's if it's up but um the main thing is is is being ketogenic so no carbs or sugar or anything like that it's very important get ketones up that helps the brain work that helps gives the brain proper energy that helps the mitochondria in the brain turn over uh it's called autophagy so you're turning over individual organel in the in the cell and when you do that for Contra called mitophagy and so you're turning over those cells but you're also encouraging uh replication and reproduction and increased number of mitochondria as well that can that can take time you know people tend to see good or positive results in the first few days or weeks but the real effects don't happen for months and that's when you start turning over more and more and more of these mitochondria and getting better and better and better um so that would be the main thing and then getting a lot of good healthy fats like salmon bison is great but it's generally very lean so make sure that he's getting enough fat because that's what the brain is made out of DHA and EPA and cholesterol so uh that's what you want and um you know if he if he likes eating veggies then you know uh that's okay just keep it to as minimum as you can and make sure there's no snow carbs make sure it's not like potatoes and things like that where you know there going to kick him out of a key genic diabetic ketogenic metabolism or not diabetic but um nutritional ketosis right so that's what I would do I think that's that's the best thing that uh that can be done if you want to book a consultation you can but I I think you know that's those are the main take-home points so hopefully that's enough to to get you going and and help your brother so question from Vanessa I'm a rectal cancer survivor 62 years old female my body does not take in things like potassium B12 iron and magnesium new be to carnivore do I need to stop the supplements thanks um no keep keep taking if you if you are taking if you're taking oral supplements then then you are absorbing something your rectal cancer um if it's uh first of all I'm very sorry to hear that I'm very glad that you're that you're doing well and and that you're you're you know still uh still able to um you know be be um healthy and active even after going through something like that so I'm really happy to hear that um the rectum if you just remove the rectum and not any of the small intestine you should be fine to absorb different nutrients if you had other sorts of issues that caused you to have absorption issues then um you know then that that can be an issue but if uh if you're taking oral supplements for the pottassium B12 and iron and magnesium Etc um then you know then you are getting some absorption because that that has to go through the gut if you take it orally um as opposed to like injections potassium infusions are horrifically painful so um it's good that you don't have to get those things and and I don't know anyone who has to just continually get get those um so you should be able to to absorb them so keep taking the supplements for now U make sure that you're at good levels when you have meat and you have uh you adding in things like liver liver is a great source of B12 and all these other nutrients so have a b of that in your in your food as well try for at least a few days a week um if not a little bit every day to get you going check your levels make sure you're good levels you can try coming off your supplements after that point and then you check your levels again if they start slipping down and going down you know either uh eat you actually eat the liver because a lot of people don't um or or add in back or add back in the supplements if you're already taking liver and uh and that's not enough so so you should be able to come off if your body still has the ability to absorb those sorts of things um if you're at the point where you have to have injections then you know you might still have to have injections of like B12 but you know the other it sounds like you're still taking those things orally and if you had just part of your rectum come out you don't you don't absorb those nutrients in your rectum you absorb them in your small intestine so it should still be fine nithan a high sir does line diet reverse verical um good question I have not come across don't think I've ever come across a mechanism by which things like a cornivore diet would would help with that you know the thing is is that this is this is actually know people say oh there's no long-term studies on on Carnivore you know the most rigorously studied diet on Earth is the ketogenic diet but what kind of ketogenic diet you could do that with just vegetables it would be nearly impossible have to use tons of seed oils and and plant fats and things like that and you'd have to supplement copiously uh to just get basic nutrition and you'd be miserable but you could do it um and be in ketosis but that's not what those studies looked at they did not look at vegetarian ketogenic diets they looked at animal based ketogenic diets so they get rid of the carbs and what do you replace that with fat and protein and that's fat and protein from meat that's what it is so it's a whole food animal-based diet with a side salad so it's carnivore light carnivore with a side salad that's what those studies show and there's thousands thousands and thousands and thousands of studies on ketogenic diets of animal-based ketogenic diets of carnivore light diets carnivore like diets um that are ketogenic and showing massive improvements and benefits to health and specific Health outcomes like diabetes autoimmunity and many many others and has gone head-to-head with uh things like the DASH diet and done you know much better than them so um you know if you if you find a study on a ketogenic diet helping things like a veric seal that's that's perfectly translatable to a cornivore diet because that's that's what that was right a carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet it's just you're getting rid of the side salad so all these things have been done on Carnivore diets with a side salad maybe not everybody necessarily ate the side salad uh but but you could um but you had to eat meat and you had to eat a lot of fat and a lot of U meat and fat from animals so I don't know of any any studies specifically on veric seals but you know there's a lot of things that that this helps and um and you're going to help a lot of other things anyway and so might as well try it and uh see how it goes for you and then report back and let people know you know a lot of things that we're that we're understanding about this is coming from more and more people discussing their results which is how you have to uh start with any sort of thing any sort of uh trials you you you try something out and You observe the results so give it a shot let us know Bishop steep learning thank you very much for the Super Chat feeling a bit constipated since giving up coffee two weeks now uh does go away after a while well you have to eat enough fat and so before you were presumably not eating as much fat as you needed to because you had the coffee that was acting as a laxative and so now that you've taken the coffee away and you don't have that laxative effect then uh you'll need to you'll need to add in more more fat so just add in more fat and that that should clear up the constipation um and oh and um okay all right let's see um Karen Caitlyn um thank you for the Super Chat looks like question is down here oh well thank you again for uh both super chats is very kind of you so Karen says uh 63-year-old female carnivore one year I have inflammation stiffness after exercise 22 years ago during pregnancy I had two root canals done is this why I have chronic pain since your thoughts um well the the inflammation and stiffness after exercise uh sometimes that happens if you're still having like some little things in there like any sort of sweeteners or coffee or things like that that just are bringing in a bit of inflammation if you're only eating meat and only drinking water and not having anything else and generally inflammation and stiffness after exercise goes away or at least largely goes away so hopefully that has improved and if there's anything else still in your system then hopefully that will go away um and the The Chronic pain I'm I'm assuming is that maybe in your in your mouth since then I'm not um I'm not entirely sure where the chronic pain is that you're discussing but you I'm not a dentist but you know root canals are a pretty big procedure from my understanding and and um I I don't know if they're associated with chronic pain you know in the in the jaw after that hopefully the diet helps reduce inflammation and improve your pain it can help with a lot of pain syndromes um so hopefully it does for you um just be as clean as possible just try to eat just as much fatty meat as you can and then just drink water water and and cut everything else out if you're having still tooth pain mouth pain you know maybe talk to your dentist and see if there's there's a reason for that maybe something happened during the root canal that was that was a problem the stiffness and inflammation after exercise is hopefully a lot better than it used to be um but if you have sort of anything else sort of in your in your system it can it can still cause a bit of inflammation and some people find that you know if they drink coffee they still have that soreness but it's just not as bad um as it was before because I've got rid of other sorts of things so just try to cut out absolutely everything besides fatty meat and hopefully that improves your pain and then talk to your your dentists as well and if it's chronic pain somewhere elsewhere in the in the body and and just going meat and water hasn't improved that all that much um there might be a reason for that there might be a reason that there's there's something going on some sort of impingement or some sort of physical issue that that um maybe your doctor can help out with so if that's the case maybe see see what their thoughts are too and they can do an exam and see if there's anything they can they can elicit that way so good luck with that Robert fanelli thank you for the Super Chat 29 uh year old male 5 foot1 was 135 pounds now 140 uh tips on gaining weight uh fat to protein ratio eggs or beef lift heavy objects or exercise exercises like push-ups always been underway um yeah lift lift heavy objects and Sprint those are those are two great exercises but don't go super heavy you know I'm not a big fan of this like super high weight low rep sort of thing like unless you're like doing this for competition um and you're competing then I don't think you should should really do that going for like one rep max or you three rep four rep sort of weight uh levels um the more reps you do in a set you know just the the easier it is on your joints you know you need your joints like um trust me like I I screwed up my my kneecaps when I was a teenager doing kickboxing and um it's a problem you know and uh I if I hadn't done that as a kid I'd be I'd have perfect knees right now and I'd still be playing rugby so at the moment they just flare up and they swell up unfortunately because um it was long before carnivore I did this when I was 14 you know just doing a lot of Just Knee strikes and things like that so uh don't do that to yourself um do lighter weight and moderate reps so I I've always found that like 10 to 15 rep range was always best for me I've spoken to U bodybuilding coaches here in Perth recently who said that that uh what they're finding the best results are for their athletes uh for hypertrophy and getting sculpting a bodybuilder body is the 15 rep range that you you hit 15 that's the the last one that's when you fail at so you try to you know gauge the weight that's going to make you fail at 15 and so you have you're last you're struggling you can't quite get it back and your spotter needs to help you get it off get it uh up um that's that's sort of where you want to aim for and um that can that can hopefully help with hypertrophy if you're just specifically looking for hypertrophy then concentrating more on on the Ecentric versus the concentric so um like if you and sometimes it's easier to do that anyway like if if you wear yourself out like if you're doing pull-ups you can only do certain amount of pull-ups um you s step on a step you hold it and then you let yourself down slowly where the the muscle muscle is lengthening under tension and that actually can cause uh that to sort of tear those little sarir and uh and cause that to hypertrophy and regrow bigger so you do that that sort of um that sort of exercise so what helps you lift up the bar and then it slowly let it down like that even though it's like overloaded and you wouldn't be able to lift it up but you can control it going down slowly those sorts of things uh can be a bit of a bit of a trick to get um get a bit more hypertrophy uh as far as uh what to eat just yeah meat and water a lot of fat um you know you just your body will tell you what you need you just need to make sure you're getting enough and so keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good and do that try that at least twice a day if you're working out steadily um as far as eggs and beef they're both great um the old school bodybuilders used to used to think that like a ton of eggs like 30 plus eggs a day would just for a bodybuilder um you know that's already big that that would be you know equivalent to like a low dose cycle of steroids so um you know they thought they seem to think it had had some some serious anabolic effects as well so you want to you want to throw in a bunch of eggs you know you give that a try you know just like the old school bodybuilders um and just eat enough fat so that you're not getting constipated and um and eat twice a day and make sure that you're getting uh getting enough to satisfy your body's demands for um your body's demands for all of these um nutrients and all the workouts that you're doing Tina Andre thank you for the Super Chat looks like your question is down here um I had a h a hiatal hernia surgery it slipped after only two years I'm convinced from what I was eating it went from 5.5 to 3.5 uh will I be able to get off my osol if I eat carnivore with my hernia well I I don't know if you will be be able to but uh many people have and so hopefully you can as well but it's just one of those things you have to sort of wait and see but um like I said earlier when you reduce your carbs you also reduce your insulin and Insulin causes you to to make your stomach acid much more um acidic and produce more of it and so that can cause more issues and so that that can help as well um and hopefully you don't need the osol but just just see how you go and um you know do it for a couple months and if you're feeling fine you know you can always try coming off and and see how that affects you and hopefully you you can and hopefully you don't need to use that anymore good luck with that a bony 814 thank you very much for the super chat um hba1c 5.9 but been getting red fatty meat with virtually zero carbs pepper garlic powder and salt um since January 1st same with the wife um 5.7 assuming will improve over time optimization uh thanks Dr chiy so yeah if you're just eating you know fatty red meat and with with no carbs you know a bit of spices um probably isn't going to hurt your hba1c yeah that should that should help you also need to make sure that you're optimizing your sleep you're optimizing your stress levels if your stress is up your cortisol is up and your blood sugar is up your HB andc is up same thing with with uh sleep if you have interrupted poor sleep or you're not getting enough hours of sleep you're just they not going to be able to regulate your glucose properly again because of the cortisol so um if you uh there's a friend of mine Dr Tony Hampton gave a talk uh and put up a reel about this a couple weeks ago or short on YouTube and said that uh if you get it was like an average of four to five hours of sleep at night for a 7day straight you'll actually give yourself pre-diabetes and that's how much that cortisol will affect your your blood sugar and Spike It Up um but if you then get eight to seven to eight hours of sleep for another seven days you can reverse that so that's how powerful sleep is it's very very important it's it's not just diet diet is a major major major uh part in this because it's something you do every single day sometimes many times a day and you're just pumping in you know high-grade garbage into your into your body all the time obviously that's not a good thing but there's other things that affect it it's not it's not solely because of that so you need to get your stress reduced you need to uh make sure that that's under control and you need to get your sleep in check as well and those should both help both of you good luck with that s808 thank you for the Super Chat normally gain weight initially on Carnivore uh sometimes so some people have gained weight um there just going to be a lot of hormonal reasons that um that can be affecting this if you're on any medication that may make you overeat then that can make you overeat if you're eating a lot of dairy that can make you overeat so you can overeat and um and also if you're working out and you're lifting weight you're going to gain muscle and so that is going to make you gain weight as well or at least offset the uh weight from the fat that you're losing so it it can be um but there are a lot of different reasons for that different medications or you're having anything else besides meat and water um then take that into account get rid of any anything else that you're ingesting besides meat and water and uh you know make sure that you're eating enough uh if you're chronically undereating you're going to suppress your metabolism and you're going to actually slow your results so you want to make sure you're getting enough for your body and that will stimulate your metabolism and make you actually lose uh fat faster so um that's another thing then any medications just you know understand that they they may have those side effects and so if you look those up and and you are on something that causes those side effects then just be aware of that and and you may have to actually limit the amount that you're eating if um if someone's like taking uh prazone you know hydrocortisone those sorts of things that will absolutely jack up your your hunger signals and so I've I've I've seen people in that position that um you know when they're just eating to hunger they were just they were absolutely you know putting on weight and so um you know in that case you you might have to uh you know track what you're eating and uh and sort of limit it but hopefully you're not on any of those medications not many people are but they they do exist um and um if you're able to come off these sorts of medications safely with your doctor then that can help as well otherwise you may need to be you a bit more mindful of what you eat so you know when I say that you can just eat until fatty meat stops tasting good I'm talking about in normal circumstances when you're not taking these these medications so this is this applies to most people but of course there are exceptions dark sky thank you for the super chat um how does carnivore prevent bacterial infections is it true that ketones have antimicrobial effects on pathogens that's a good question I haven't uh haven't come across that anyway um there's a lot of reasons um one is it's just going to boost your immune system your immune system is going to be much more viable and effective um because you're not tamping it down and you're not taking in all these different sorts of things that that get in the way of your immune system also when you're blood sugar is you know low at normal levels uh that's something that's that's um going to be better for you and not better for the bacteria if your blood sugar is high that's a very common well that's that's a just a well-known uh cause of worsening bacterial infections so diabetics with uncontrolled uh blood sugar uh will commonly get worse infections and because the bacteria feed on the glucose and so there's much more much more uh food for them uh that's around and abundant so it can get it can get a lot worse so you're you're reducing the amount of of um blood sugar that's available for those bacteria and um and then you're just improving your your immune system it doesn't mean that you can't get an infection it doesn't mean that you can't get sick you definitely can't and so if you have a bacterial infection and it's and it's you know not doing well for you you know you should still consider taking antibiotics and work with your doctor on that as well um people still need uh need help uh sometimes and that's what the medical establishment is for is when our bodies can't do it for us and and there's a problem um you know that's that's what medicine is for um not this new these chronic issues that that we've sort of turned medicine into just treating chronic disease symptoms not even actually treating the diseases eating properly treats the disease reducing stress and getting sleep reduces the disease um but the medicines we have for a lot of these chronic illnesses just reduce the symptoms and uh don't necessarily um improve life expectancy and things like that so uh yeah those are some ways but you know if you get if you get a bad infection and you need help go get help Rachel May from X uh asks Dr chaffy is it safe to keep taking my uh LDN I'm assuming that's low dose alrex Zone um and Statin while on strip carnivore depends on what you're taking these things for um so you know just you discuss with your doctors if that's something that you need to continue to be on for any medications um you should always work with your doctor on on whether or not you need you can come off of things or whether you need them or not um if you're on low dose alone there's different reasons why people go on that um one is Hashimoto and so sometimes people with Hashimoto they can they can um help their um antibodies by reduce their antibodies by taking low dose nxone and so F by going on a lion diet just red meat and water that will reduce your antibodies on its own and you may not need that medication um NY Statin I'm just assuming my Statin um but um that's something you know I I I think that statins are you know statins are designed to lower LDL um but you know is is LDL something you want to lower so that's the question and so that's something that you need to sort of think about yourself for me I don't uh I I have you know LDL that would qualify me for a Statin and I don't think that that's something that would be beneficial for me so I don't take that myself and there are reasons for that if you watch my um my video on um YouTube just called um what was it the truth about cholesterol and heart disease and see what you think you can look at Dave felman's work with the lean mass hyper responders people with uh on a keto cornivore diet with so-called elevated LD LDL they're not progressing their atherosclerosis in fact the trend is to reverse atherosclerosis so you know that you have to sort of decide you know if you think that that LDL is something that you want to lower and if it is then statins can do that um but uh if you don't then that's something you need to think about on on why you're on something if you don't want the effect that it has so something to think about look into more Danny thank you for the Super Chat new to carnivore um only eating beef salt water for a month Sally Norton making me nervous about dumping oxalates should I take it slower so uh yeah so um you don't necessarily have to do that if you're feeling fine um you don't always get dumping most people don't get uh um dumping and will be just fine uh you know when they when they go Carnivor so it's um it's probably um you know it's usually fine for most people so I would just uh I would just keep going with it if you if you have start having a problem that could be explained by oxalate dumping and you've tried all the other things that that it could be to uh you know alleviate that and and you don't find anything that's working you say okay well let's try oxalate uh it could be oxalates then you just do Sal protocol which is you have a little bit of very low oxalate substances um you know just a just a bit like you know 50 to 100 milligrams a day and you look up what's going to give you that and so you're not getting too much and and then you you just add those in and see if it helps and if it helps great you know that sounds like what it was if it doesn't help then it may be something else so the thing with oxalate um oxalates and oxalate dumping is they can make they can really sort of present as anything or any any tissue or organ in your body can be affected by this stuff and so it's it's sort of um you know it's sort of difficult to say definitively that's oxalates I mean if you have calcium oxalate stones in your kidney pretty clear that that came from oxalates right so uh but other than that you know you don't necessarily know unless you just sort of try you add in a bit of low oxalate foods and you see if that helps Tamp that down and hopefully you won't go through that though I didn't go through that a lot of people don't go through that even people that have been vegan for decades um or a decade in Years anyway they don't necessarily go through that so it just seems to be something that that hits some people and not others so just just keep going and um but be mindful and just you know keep an eye out for it and you start getting weird horrible symptoms then um you know keep that in mind as as a possible explanation dizzy Willow thank you for the Super Chat 6'2 10 months carnivore workout and active trying to eat enough not overweight prior weight dropped to 165 is really trying to get back into the 200s okay so you're you're going yeah well look you're going to you're going to lose some weight early on because you're going to lose lose some inflammation water weight glycogen that's just sort stacked up your muscle and even intramuscular fat called myosteatosis and so you know this is something I've talked about before that if you're eating carbohydrates and sugar and alcohol and things like that your body's going to actually St store in a lot of that energy in in the form of fat in your muscles and so you know you see the bodybuilders that are just doing that that bulking uh with just tons of carbs and sugar and all that garbage and oh they got all bulky well and then they they go on like keto diets or just just lean meats and nothing else and you know they lean down and um uh that's and then they they think like oh I lost all this muscle and this is where that that myth that you if you're putting on muscle you have to put on fat too and if you're going to lose fat you have to lose muscle too total uh what you're doing is you're stuffing in a bunch of glycogen and fat and water goes with the glycogen there's two molecules of water go with every molecule of glycogen into your muscle so you get these water logged muscles uh with glycogen and with fat myosteatosis you can see this on MRI and we do and so when you do that you're going to make the muscle look bulkier right and then you go on keto sort of Carnival I think a lot of bodybuilders do they just eat lean meat leading up to a competition they just shred down and um you're going to lose that glycogen you're going to lose that water you're going to lose that myosis and so it's going to look like your muscle shrink it was never muscle in the first place it was Fool's Gold you know fairy gold it just disappeared um when you when you looked at in the morning so that's not what that is so you probably lost some of that right so now you're at hopefully a a lean body weight and now you can just put on muscle and if you're on a carnivore diet then the muscle then the weight that you put on will be muscle it won't be glycogen water weight and fat it'll be muscle and so everything you put on is yours and so just lift weights and eat a lot you know you got to make sure you're eating enough generally it's a lot it's like to double the amount if your if your body wants to put on weight you're going to have to eat like twice as much as if you weren't uh working out so uh do do remember to just get enough and make sure you're getting in meals and uh stimulating your body to grow which is um Anor robic exercise weightlifting and sprinting sprinting is fantastic fantastic full body workout okay Trina mckinness um from Facebook asks Dr chaffy I stopped my thyroid meds three weeks ago and replaced them with two drops of jcro iodine any thoughts I haven't had any labs yet well I would I would be careful with those sorts of things um I I generally wouldn't advise people coming off medications until their lab tests show that uh that it's a good time to do that um go by how you're feeling as well if you're feeling okay uh then great but um you know I would check I would I would definitely check your your thyroid your TSH 3 T4 3 T3 uh especially because that's the active form of of thyroid that's one that's actually doing doing the work in your body and um I don't know if you have Hashimoto but if you do check your antibody levels and um you know make sure that you're just eating red meat and water if you have any sort of autoimmune issue or really just you want to be as healthy as you can be and uh but check you know you know if your thyroid levels are low that can that can be harmful you can get you know serious negative health effects so just do do check and and only reduce your your medications you know responsibly with the help of your doctor when it's appropriate and your body's making enough thyroid hormone hopefully it is and hopefully this isn't um this isn't something you have to go back on but um you know and a lot of people do a lot of people do come off their medications thyroid in particular and so it's it's you know could very well be that you'll you'll improve another thing is choose is um if you do have Hashimoto iodine is probably not a good idea iodine can actually cause flare hasim to flare up and get worse so just be mindful of that as well and um and check your Bloods and make sure that that you don't actually need uh the the medication um and if you do maybe get back on maybe start lowering the dose check it sort of every few weeks or a month and uh see if you can incrementally reduce that down or get off of it but you never know it could be that this uh was good enough and and you don't really need um to go back on the thyroid but uh do check stink ass cat thank you for the Super Chat keep fighting the good fight doc well thank you very much I really appreciate that and um you know you too everyone else that's the thing you know everybody here is is doing the same thing you know you're all in influencing people around you you're being an example to others and you're recommending these things to others and you know so that that's how this works you know I'm just I'm just speaking but other people have to have to listen they have to share this with other people and they have to say hey look why don't you watch this and see what you think about it and give it a try so that's that's really you guys are the ones doing the work you know so I really appreciate that and um you know hopefully we can all work together to get this get this message out there and so everyone can at least give it a try and see if it works for them and see if it's something that's good for them and um and hopefully improve their life Liv and you know even if they don't go full carnivore you know they're they're going to make positive um they're going to take their life in Positive Directions they're going to improve their life in positive ways do you mean just eating more meat and not being afraid of the fat and the cholesterol is going to make a huge difference for People's Health and their life and not eating all the other stuff and being more mindful of that is going to help as well so you know this is going to make it you know this is making a big difference in people's lives and and um you know and that that comes from you guys sharing this stuff with everybody so I appreciate that so let's keep it up let's keep going until uh people know that they can be healthy and they don't have to be sick uh Mama cracker asks a question my son is in his 30s he tried carnivore and said it made his gums bleed uh too much protein um no not necessarily um I don't know what would what was going to make his gums bleed uh what kind kind of carnivore diet was he doing though was he just eating more meat but still having some other stuff or was he exclusively eating meat if he's just eating a lot more meat he's not going to get um he's not going to get scurvy or anything like that because your your your body um should be able to make all the collagen it needs just from the building blocks that come in but if you're eating carbs that that will block out vitamin C uh from being absorbed you do get vitamin C in meat and you certainly get a lot in liver there's more vitamin C in liver than there than there is in apples right for the same same number of grams so it's um it's something that you can you can definitely uh uh get enough of you can definitely get enough vitamin C and and you make collagen without without vitamin C anyway if you have hydroline hydroly from your food vitamin C catalyzes the reaction that that hydrolyzes Proline and lysene and so if you're but if you're getting that in its readymade form then then you don't need the V C for that anyway and you won't get scurvy uh and you'll get vitamin C but if he's eating a bunch of carbohydrates along with the meat you know that's going to stop him from absorbing uh absorbing vitamin C so if he's not getting enough hydroline hydroly and he's not getting enough vitamin C potentially but you know your gums bleed for a lot of different reasons your gums can bleed because you floss too hard you know or because you're eating a lot of meat and it's getting stuck in your teeth and now you're flossing and now your gums are bleeding right uh that that can absolutely happen happen as well uh it's you know it is it is a thing you know if you're flossing your teeth and you're that's going to cause a bit of uh damage and irritation little cuts to your gums and they're going to bleed so um just keep that in mind and uh but no he's not going to not going to get scurvy from only eating meat anyway hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own questions please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at 6:00 pm. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest of the Q&A Lee rayon uh thank you for the Super Chat 64y old male carnivore 7 months have high blood pressure on three meds for S 11 years does carnivore help with hypertension thanks it can um there are many different causes of hypertension some of the idiopathic cause so-called idiopathic causes could very well be from high insulin levels which can absolutely be uh fixed with cornivore diet and high homocysteine levels which can irritate the the inside of the arteries and sort of make them contract and when as your B12 goes up homocysteine tends to come down and so having a cornivore diet should should help that as well and so uh very often people find that they are able to come off their blood pressure medications but not everyone can come off all their medication it does depend on what's causing the high blood pressure but it can certainly help with with some of those causes so just see how you're doing see what your blood pressure is if you're standing up out of of a chair and you're getting sort of lightheaded and dizzy or you're getting sort of those light-headed episodes at other times uh that could very well be that your blood pressure medication is too strong and that it's time to start redu you know talking to your doctor to reduce that and uh and come down off of that blood pressure medication but yeah a lot of people can but again it depends on the cause if this is going to if this addresses if this is addressing the underlying cause then then it can help and if not then then uh it it'll still be there and those medications are still a good idea for sure Estelle K thank you for the Super Chat mom of three and breastfeeding baby still wakes me up um during the night ancestrally how did moms get good sleep uh should I focus on what I can control such as diet uh yeah I mean I think that's just pretty classic that you have babies it's uh you're probably going to get less sleep but you know if you're eating the right thing and you're eating a carnivore diet and you're and you're keeping yourself healthy that's going to keep your breast milk as healthy as it can be and hopefully uh your your baby won't have um won't have uh problems during the night or during the day you won't have all these problems with you know cro and Airway issues and um and uh you know like reflux and all these sorts of things that can make them very unhappy and unstable and upset and cry a lot and things like that because they're they're in pain they're uncomfortable so hopefully that helps and your your your diet is their diet right so your nutrition is their nutrition when you're breastfeeding so what's good for you is going to be good for them and what's bad for you is also going to be bad for them as well so you want to make sure that you optimize your your diet certainly because that will optimize their diet and their development as well and so they'll be uh they'll be able to develop properly and get all the nutrients and fats and ketones and um and essential nutrients that they need to grow up big and strong and have uh big well-developed brains and nervous systems so yes that's that's what I would do you know babies may need to to nurse throughout the night especially if they're they're younger and um and so that that may wake you up but hopefully it's not because they're upset and um and in pain and things like that Tyler Hutchinson thank you very much for the Super Chat when trying to cut some body fat on Carnivore is there a certain amount of protein and fat I should uh I should consume uh switching from standard uh body diet where everything was measured to the exact gram yeah I don't I don't think you you need to do that if you if you were at like a stable body fat percentage and you're just eating intuitively and your body just likes you there um you you're working out and you're sprinting and you're lifting weights you should get pretty pretty damn lean um if you are like competing for a bodybuilding competition or something like that um you you may have to start limit things a bit but if you limit it too much it'll actually stall and you might actually start regaining fat because your body going to you're going to suppress your metabolism so you have to do it very very slowly and incrementally uh to reduce that and not you know um ruin you know lower your metabolis ISM um there's a friend of mine Richard Smith he goes by keto Pro and he was a professional bodybuilder won the UK and European Pro bodybuilding championships as a as a natural athlete the the UK one was a an a tested one so like everyone was natural but the European one was untested and so he was going up against um guys on steroids and um and that um and he won right and so you know and he he said he was getting down to like two 3% body fat just on Carnivore and just getting absolutely shredded I can't remember I don't think I asked him actually um if he if he ever caught or did anything differently from from the sounds of he just ate meat you know to his body's desire and then um but because of his workout routine and um and diet it just you just shred it out really really well so I would just keep doing that just keep feating um fat and protein as fits your body and your body's demand so if you're if you're um getting constipated then you're not eating enough fat you need enough fat you need enough protein and so just eat enough fat that you're not getting constipated and need enough protein to to meet your body's demands for for your workouts and I I think you'll be fine you know if you're just if you're working out and you're eating intuitively almost everybody will be able to just lean right down if that's not working for you and you want to cut down more you know you can you can play around with slowly reducing the amount that you're eating but it's not something that that I know much about because I don't I don't do that and I don't recommend that to people because you know when I when I talk about the carnivore that it's it's not for those cases it's not for you know um you know getting down to the lowest body fat percentage for a competition it's it's just about Optimal Health and if your body keeps you at a certain body fat percentage you know there's probably reason for that and um you know sometimes the reason is is that you know you've hurt your body over decades and decades and Decades of eating the wrong thing and that's just where your body stabilized at you know maybe but um either way um you know it's just difference in goals so my goal for for doing this uh for myself and for other people is just is just Optimal Health and just being healthy um and so that's that's what I can recommend might be possible to talk to to uh Richard Smith um again goes by keto Pro I know he does consultations and things like that but he might be able to just just give you some advice as well on Instagram or wherever he's got a YouTube channel as well that people can check out um and you can ask him because he he's actually done this as a as a pro bodybuilder on a carnivore diet so uh good question for him uh Raymond uh asks I have stones in my gallbladder pre-diabetic but my glucose is controlled with carnivore diet good I'm 62 years old should I continue with carnivore well I certainly think so the main thing is how do you feel what do you think you know if you if you feel good and you're getting better and you're getting good results and your blood sugar is control then that that's a very good sign um having stones in your gallbladder well you know a lot of people can have this that really comes from undereating fat because bile is what your body uses to absorb fat and if you don't have enough fat is just going to sit in your gallbladder and actually concentrate so if you if you look at physiology textbooks those'll show you that that the vile can actually get more and more concentrated because you're constantly making this stuff you're making you know depending on the person male or female on the size of the body anywhere from 800 Mills to a liter of bile a day and so that can get stored in your gallbladder and that has to obviously concentrate out concentrate concentrate concentrate so that um if you're not eating for a few days or or a week or so you have highly concentrated bile that you can push out there you can get a lot of fat in because you need to make up for lost time and so um if you just leave it there and you just chronically undereating fat it's just going to get more and more concentrated and then eventually you're going to start making crystals precipitate and um that's what Gall sled you know bile Stones gall stones are and B sledges so the gall the gall stones are there because you haven't been eating enough fat if you eat enough fat now that's going to start stimulating that to push that stuff out and hopefully the gallstones won't grow after that because there won't be anything in the gallbladder to grow if the gallstones are too big though they could get stuck and that's something that we need to realize but if they're they're going to get stuck uh they're going to get stuck it doesn't matter really what you're eating eventually it's just you're just it's just the horse is out of the barn and you know that's going to be a problem hopefully they're small enough that they can just pass through and not cause a problem but if they do get stuck then [Music] um then um then you know you'll need to get a procedure you need to get help from from a doctor for that and that's that's it's a big deal but if you if you don't eat enough F they're definitely going to grow and they're definitely going to get bigger and down the road they're definitely going to get stuck so just keep that in mind as well Cody D thank you for the super chat doesn't look like uh there's attached but here it is down here um did two endoscopies had hpylori and that left me with chronic gastritis uh I just want to know if my ill stomach will um be able to digest the meat without making it worse like an ulcer or something like that well hpylori can cause ulcers um so if you have that you know you need to get that treated properly and um you know the gastritis can can certainly be from excessive um well excessive acid but also reduction in the protections that your stomach has against your your stomach acid uh going on a carnivore diet again will lower insulin which can lower acid production and uh make it you know not quite as as harsh for your stomach uh and then you need to get rid of the things that are maybe getting rid of the the protective layer of the stomach which is are things like nsid so like ibuprofen aspirin and um you know neoen and all those sorts of things um that can that can cause cause you to lower the protection that your stomach has naturally um but U you know but you should be able to digest meat just fine there shouldn't be an issue with that um so yeah just um yeah so that should be fine and hopefully it helps but you know if you have these problems it may be that you need to take medication uh to help help with that especially with like an hpylori infection if you have like ulcers as a result of that but eating meat won't cause an ulcer or anything and it won't um it won't make things worse it will hopefully make things better but you still may need uh some help with that so do work with your doctor um for that Phyllis uh thank you for the Super Chat Dr chaffy uh ni Statin is not a Statin uh drug used to treat cholesterol it is an antifungal ah okay uh used to treat things like uh candidasis right okay it's a nice stat not my stat um great yeah well I don't I don't well there certainly not gonna be any any sort of conflict with a carnivore diet and um if you you know find that you don't uh you don't have that sort of um candidasis or other sorts of fungal issues then it very very well may be that you you can stop taking that but you you shouldn't stop taking it unless you know the problem that you're taking it for goes away right so that's that's the main thing um so uh yeah so just just see how you go and um you know hopefully you know that that clears up and then you don't then you can come off of it and you don't have to go on it again but you know if you need it you need it and you know I still think that you know taking medicine is a good idea if uh if you need it so keep that in mind Sue Jeffrey from Facebook um says Hi I noticed when I take my cholesterol pills after a few days I get laded and dizzy um interesting I haven't really come across that before but I guess well there's different kinds of cholesterol medications um there's statins and there's other ones as well I'm you probably Statin most people are on statins these days for their cholesterol as opposed to something else but you know maybe something else um yeah I haven't really heard people getting lightheaded and dizzy I have certainly heard of people getting sort of like brain fog and affecting them cognitively um but you know maybe that's that's participating but you know the thing is is if you're taking medication is negatively affecting you you can talk to your doctor and say look this isn't this isn't making me feel good I don't I don't like taking these and you know is is cholesterol something that you want to lower in the first place for me I don't um I don't think that it's the cause of heart disease I think that that's quite evident but um you know that's that's my decision that I make for my body um but you know you need to make the right decision for your body but if you if you think you need medication to lower your cholesterol talk to your doctor about uh maybe switching up to a different medication that that maybe doesn't have those side effects and um and if you decide that well maybe you don't really want to lower your cholesterol anyway then that's something to talk to your doctor about as well and uh either way you know you should you know if you're if you're getting negative um effects with with any medication you should always talk to your doctor about uh what you can do to change that or maybe come off of that if the the side effects are are too severe Cody D um says I did did two endoscopies oh that was the same same one I think H did I do that already yeah I did that anyway so uh guia helper thank you very much for the Super Chat is it true uh the more muscle I build through exercise the more meat and eggs I need to eat I'm on a tight budget but want to start working out uh but don't want to deprive my body of additional protein needs well well you know muscle cost energy and you know you need to support that with with uh you know amino acids and fat if you're building muscle if you're working out in building muscle then you're going to need more protein and fat and those nutrients that go along with it in order to build that muscle so that's if that's what you're you're going for then you know your body's just going to going to ask for a bit more if you're working out and you're not able to uh eat more then you're not necessarily going to bulk up you not going to have the physical building blocks to to uh do that um but you'll get stronger and you'll get healthier and you'll improve in other ways so I would just you know just still exercise and U eat meat and eggs and um you know try to go for for less expensive meat you know ground beef and ground beef and lamb and things like that that can be less expensive um add you know butter and things like that to it to get good fats grass-fed if you can maybe a little more expensive but still probably worth it for the nutrition profile and uh pastu eggs I know they they know they cost more but it's um it's it's uh you get a lot more for your money because you're getting a lot more nutrients um in that um so like I think there was a I think it was Joe saladan Joel saladan that um you know does regenerative farming in the states I think it was him any anyway generative fer in the states that said that that normal uh USDA egg average egg had 41 milligrams of folate or so and that his eggs that were just pasture Ray had over a thousand so there's actually a lot more micronutrients that you're getting for this and so you know what you're what you're spending on pasturized eggs you're not spending on supplements and vitamins and things like that not that you'd really needed even on normal eggs but you know it's not going to be as nutrient-dense uh as you may like and um I think you know the most important thing is your health you know you can't really put a price on on good health and so um yeah so yeah you may need a bit more you know to you know if you're if you're not eating enough then yeah you may not be able to maintain uh a large muscular frame in physique but it's you know it's not it's it's not going to um be a massive difference like my weight my weight goes up and down depending on how much I work out but it's pretty slow process and I tend to eat fairly similarly if I'm 110 kilos so like you know 240 pounds or 220 pounds like 100 kilos and um is that right it's about right and um and so that's what at rest but when I'm when I'm working out and trying to build muscle like I need I need more and if I want to maintain you know 240 lbs I need to keep working out and I need to keep eating if I stop working out and I don't eat as much it's G to come down a bit my body's not going to just maintain that big musculature because it's like why you know your body's very efficient at these things and if you're not going if you don't need to um to keep and maintain that large musculature because your body is demanding it and you're you're doing all these physical things all day your body's just going to allocate those resources somewhere else because that's uh that's what you need to do to survive so uh yeah there's a there's a there's a bit of um of a dynamic there that you can play with Pippin FTS thank you for the Super Chat you plan to live to 120 but we didn't spend our development uh development all years one through five on Carnivore are you worried that's a critical part to reach that longevity uh that's a very question I I don't know if that's something that's going to affect us for longevity it's certainly going to affect us for development I'm not as tall or as developed as I would be you know I'm not the same as same person that I was that that I would have been none of us are and so uh that sucks but um I think from a health perspective you just your your body is going to be very healthy and yeah if we started this from the beginning we' just been very healthy we would be I you know met ically be younger than I am now if I was just carnivore the whole time you know I probably wouldn't have aged much past 22 you know and that would have been that would have been great but uh you know that's not what happened so you know we can do is the best we can do I I yeah I think it's um obviously the longer you're doing this the more benefits it's going to have but it's going to make a massive Improvement in anybody at any stage in their life and so um I think you'll get get a lot more out of it I think that um realistically could absolutely still go to 120 or Beyond even starting here where I did and I'm also going to be doing other things I'm going to I'm going to stay fit I'm going to stay active I'm going to stay exercising and um I do a lot of other things that that uh you know predispose people to be healthier for longer um not going to be drinking not going to be smoking not going to be taking any substances you know substances um you know like drugs or whatever uh because I don't care to and uh so that's not going to hurt my health as well so I think yeah I think realistically I'm I'm sort of working on 130e timeline that's sort of what's in my head and I think that's very realistic um from where I am and it may be that we have some breakthroughs in in uh anti-aging medicine and and if so then you know hop on that bandwagon I'm not really convinced of all the things you know the the rap ay and the metformin and things like that um I don't I don't know if they will cause you to live longer on top of a carnivore diet or if they're just undoing some of the negative effects of the bad things we're doing to ourselves you know if you you there the longevity trials in Sweden looked at biomarkers to predict living over 100 and the two best biomarkers they found last year were low fasting insulin and high total cholesterol right so you're going to get on a carnivore diet right and so you may or may not get high total cholesterol but you know a lot of people do and but it's not high it's just higher than other people but my B12 is higher than other people too so let's not forget that and um so with metformin you know you're going to lower your blood sugar blood sugar higher blood sugar Dr damages your body causes you to age prematurely and kills you this is what kills diabetics and gets their legs amputated kidneys failing multiorgan failure things like that and they die unfortunately so that comes from high blood sugar high insulin is going to go along with that and it's going to disrupt all these other mechanisms in your body so you know metformin lowering blood sugar and lowering uh fasting insulin and or and total insulin and fasting insulin and insulin resistance that makes sense to me that that would help someone live longer U because it's undoing some harm but if you don't have that harm in the first place is it going to make you live longer I don't know I don't think we have that data uh in fact I know we don't have that data but um you know maybe we'll find something maybe we'll find something that on top of a carnivore diet says oh this can make you live longer great uh I'm on 13e timeline I got time you know so I'll I'll wait another 30 years or so and um and if something comes out like oh that that actually you know looks very convincing I might jump on that then but at the moment um we don't really have that data on anything else so I'm just going to live as healthy as I can in a natural way and um and uh do it that way and I do think it's realistic that I'll get to 120 130 in good health hopefully living at home um on a beach somewhere that'd be the best Doo thanks for the Super Chat uh hi doctor is it okay to donate blood while on Carnivore does donating blood help with muscle building at all uh well it's certainly fine to donate blood and and it's a very laudable thing to do we're always in shortages in the hospital for for blood it's a very you know it's a very precious resource in the hospitals and it's very helpful and absolutely critical and life- saving in a lot of cases so uh donating blood is a very good thing to do and yes it's absolutely safe to do that on a carnivore diet and hopefully your body just rebuilds uh and recovers uh quicker as a result um does donating blood help with muscle building at all not that I know of um but uh that's a good question I haven't I haven't asked that question so I haven't looked for that answer I'm not too sure um you might be able to to look up on just Pub metet or even Google Scholar and just look up you know blood Don a muscle building things like that see if you can find some studies on that be interesting to know about and you know maybe can can share with other people uh but I haven't come across that uh myself but you can definitely it's definitely safe to to donate blood on uh cornivore diet and it's very helpful to a lot of people and you could absolutely save someone's life Sam's block thank you for the Super Chat hey Anthony fellow Perth fellow here um I was wondering if you have a a good hookup for Quality cheap beef and lamb in the area grass finished optional um well um here in Perth I generally just go to Costco or even go to spudshed spudshed will will sometimes have like a like a loaf of grass-fed beef like a like a Porter House in the US we call it New York uh strip and uh and you look at it and it's like yellow fat it's like dark yellow fat and so that that means that thing's been eating grass it's it's whole life really um it's cheap it was like 10 bucks a kilo so it's way cheaper than you normally find uh in other places so if you uh if you look for that things like spudshed um or Costco I just buy in bulk because it's it's much more convenient um and there are there are a number of different butchers around um and they can and some will go directly to a farm or some have like a farm that they're associated with or just like that's the Farm's you know storefront you know in Perth and uh and you can get direct from there you know exactly what's where it's coming from you know exactly how they feed it they know exactly how you feed it because they're the ones feeding it and uh and so you can you can get uh you know very good quality meat that way and um uh the beef shed is also really good they have a lot of you can buy a lot of bulk I I generally buy a lot of bul things in bulk because that's um just more convenience it's a hell of a lot cheaper as you buy the whole riy loin or porterhouse loin New York loin uh it's literally half the price or less just just for cutting it yourself it's just half the price so it's um it's definitely uh the way to go is to buy in bulk and those are some those are some options I know I I will be uh I'm in the in the talks in the works uh with talking to uh a meat producer that will deliver out directly to people and they do that all across Australia so it's just in Australia but um you know they do all like grass-fed finish regeneratively race sort of stuff and you know they've sent me some eats fantastic so we're we're in the works about talking that they might be a um like a sponsor of of my podcast and you know I don't generally take on sponsors um really it's just the the carnivore bar has been the only sponsor that I've accepted because I don't it's not I'm not doing this for for money I'm doing this to get the message out and I don't want to you know drown out the message but if it's something like the carnivore bar was I think that's a good product or something like this where they give you know very high quality uh meat you know then that's then that's something that uh you know if it helps people uh then that's a good that's a good thing uh so keep an eye on that space and uh in the meantime check out Costco beef shed spudshed and then just any butcher around you that may be able to Source directly to like a regenerative Farm that's the main thing too you want to you want to vote with your pocketbook you want to tell these regenerative Farmers that that's what we want that's the product that we want then you'll become more available become more abundant it become cheaper and um and that's better for us that's better for the animals it's better for the environment because it actually helps the environment and helps rebuild it and regrow it and and uh get more grasses and Greenery and and things like that that regenerative uh model is really beneficial to the land and the ecosystem as well as uh everyone else in the in the mix Sam's block thank you for the super chat um also a harder question while I'm here I was wondering uh what you believe the reason is that humans find uh sugar tasy and appealing uh is there a case for our ancestors eating carbage food opportunistically yeah so it's a good question so most carbohydrates aren't very sweet so you have you have some glucose it's just it's mildly sweet fructose is very sweet very very sweet and the thought behind that is that it's uh safe that we don't know of of plants that contain fructose um that are acutely poisonous to humans that will kill us that day that contain fructose so these are these are more safe and so the thought is is that we recognize this as safe and something that we could we could eat out in the wild oh okay that's safe I can eat this safely you know if you're not if you're not um able to get your normal food you can have this as as a substitute as an alternate and you can get energy and it does give you energy and um they can replenish glycogen and fat and all these sorts of things and if you're out in the wild and you're and you're in trouble like that's a good thing that's very helpful it's just that you know we would never be exposed to this extent of sugar um in the wild he's just not going to I mean you have to fight be bees can kill you swarm you and kill you before you ever get in there you we had to figure out how to smoke them out and all these sorts of things um so normally we would not be getting this stuff in the abundance that we have access to it now and so it's it's called an evolutionary trap where there's something in our brain that we sort of taste something oh yeah that's good get that but because it's just an unlimited supply of it you know you don't stop it's not self-limiting you just keep going keep going keep going keep going right and so that's the problem is that we're sort of in this evolutionary trap with with sugar so that fructose tells us hey this is safe you'll get some energy this is good but you're never going to get it in that quantity in in um in the wild so carbohydrates give you energy they give you a bit of energy it gives you quick kit of energy and so you know your body's saying hey that's a good thing but you know you're not really getting that um you know in in a large abundance generally in the wild and you think about things that are starchy and carb and things like that I mean you just chew on some oats I mean there's nothing sweet about those oats even though that's just a bunch of glucose right um or potatoes like yeah there's glucose in there there's starches in there but there's also other things in there that are toxic and they taste disgusting if you have ever you know bitten a slice of raw potato it's abhorent and you cook it sort denat things so you don't recognize it it's just very Bland a lot of glucose in there is very Bland so it doesn't taste sweet so it's um it's the fructose that really tastes sweet or the or the free glucose you don't really find free glucose you have milk that has lactose and that's uh sweet and that's you know encouraging the U you know the baby to to drink this and maybe give them um a bit of a stimulus to grow you know with a bit of bit of insulin and things like that but they know even breastfeeding infants are in ketosis you know they're in a ketogenic metabolism because they need to be because that that's what grows your brain those ketones cross the bloodb brain barrier and reconstituting into fatty acids and uh they they get used as the physical structures and building blocks of the brain and the nervous system and the ketones help run the brain and give it optimal energy to grow and build and and function so all good things and then when you start giving kids a whole bunch of sugary crap that they never would have come across in the wild um then they get out of ketosis and that curtails their brain development unfortunately and um so that's that's a negative thing so yeah so fructose is is sweet because of we think because we recognize it as something safe now there are going to be things in there you know remember that there are oxalates in avocados and there's are fonic cumerin in um avocados aren't sweet but I was just thinking fruit and there are fan aumans and citrus and there are tannins and things like that in grapes and you know a grape will make a cat very sick because there's toxins in there right U well it's some fruit but the plant wants you to eat it well not necessarily it doesn't doesn't want anything to eat it want certain things to eat it and it's going to have toxins to other things and so um yeah so that that's that's what's remember but yeah so if things are if things are sweet it's just it's just because we sort of recognize that is safe but now we've refined it we put it in a packet or massively increased the amount of it that's in that fruit which we would not have found in the wild the fruits were generally not that sweet and in an ice age you're not going to come across fruit anyway and so we know we don't need it um we may want it it may give an advantage out in the wild to give us a quick hit of energy and um you know maybe put on a bit of extra fat and fatten up for the winter maybe that's a good thing uh but we wouldn't have had it in every place and every time um so you know we certainly don't need it we know we don't need it but that's that's what people think as to why um fructose is very sweet so I think this the the last question uh guys is sort of the last um super chat we'll probably end after this Victor t uh thank you for the Super Chat thoughts on smoking marijuana on Carnivore um it's a plant right so it's not going to be something you want obviously there are things in that plant that give you these sort of effects that people find appealing but they are the toxins in the plant that are trying to actually defend that plant and you know just like caffeine that's a toxin in Plants a neurotoxin and a a an insecticide that's what it's for but we get an effect that we say o I like that um and people get that with marijuana as well so you know it's up to you it's it's a lot better to um smoke marijuana on Carnivore than to smoke marijuana on uh you know a standard processed food garbage diet that's for sure and at least you're not bringing in all the other crap that that comes along with the other diets so if that's something you want to do then you know that's that's uh that's your business but you know I avoid all those sorts of things because I just like feeling feeling my best all the time and I yeah and I don't I don't think that marijuana would uh be conducive to that to feeling my best and and to doing my best but you know if that's what you want to do I mean it's still better you know like people say you know what about drinking well you know it's going to give you carb Cravings it's going to make you addicted to Sugar again but it's better to just eat meat and then drink alcohol on occasion than to drink alcohol on occasion or even more often and eat a whole bunch of garbage as well I mean at least you're getting rid of all that stuff so you know you're still moving in the right direction but I don't think that the marijuana is going to be good for you um you know but that's what you want to do that's what you want to do okay all right well thank you very much everyone um that's a one of the rare times we've actually gone through the the super chats without um uh having to sort of cut them off and then uh get through them but I think it was a pretty good session um and hopefully people enjoyed that got a lot out of it and um yeah and hopefully we can and see you again next time uh we'll have another premiere on Monday for me Sunday for America um so uh that will be as usual and then other lives next week on Wednesday for me Tuesday for America and then another episode premiere on Thursday for me Wednesday for America and another live next week same time um and then remember that the generate conference is going to be in Melbourne next month on April 21st and um I'll be speaking at that as well a number of other people will be very very interesting um so hopefully see you all there and then um the phc UK conference the the public health collaboration UK conference is in London 18th through the 20th um of U May so uh that that will be a great conference as well be a ton of really interesting people people that Eddie Abu guy will be there he's just blown up on Instagram he's like well over three million uh people on Instagram now which is awesome because he's doing a lot of really really good things and and just uh and you know and just telling people you know that uh that are just trying to tell you to you know just eat crap and it doesn't matter as long as you count your calories which is so stupid you you put poison in your mouth arsenic doesn't have calories eat as much arsenic as you want apparently because it's just calories that count obviously that's stupid um there are things that are that are harmful to you and there are things that are beneficial to you so you want to take in the beneficial things and leave out the harmful things it's pretty damn simple um and so Eddie's been great about that about getting that message out there and um you know just telling these people that you know these loud mouths to you know just shut up because they need to okay all right thank you everyone really appreciate it great to see you all and I will see you next time"
