    "transcript": "all right hello uh thanks everyone for [Music] joining all right looks like I was looks like I was muted sorry everyone thanks everyone for joining um I'll be doing this uh keeping this as a as a regular live time uh same time and day Mo every week that I can anyway that that I'm able to with with other things going on so thanks everyone for joining on so that'll be 6 PM PST Pacific time in the US in on Thursday 9: p.m. East Coast Thursday and then Friday morning for Australia and then middle of the night for Europe so sorry about that maybe I can try and get um some other times that would shoot you guys better as well um squashington State here hi Heidi nice to see you nice to see everyone thank you so much for coming on um I just wanted to say as well the campaign for Maggie is going is going really really well we just crested um uh $ 31,000 Canadian dollars which is fantastic thank you so much to everyone who's been able to donate even a dollar because it's made such a huge difference and um we're trying to get up to $50,000 so hopefully we can we can get there in the coming weeks um and if so then then she she's able to keep her her but even if even if nothing else happens from here she'll already be able to keep most of her her at at home or good portion of it anyway so big big thank you to everyone who was able to to help out with that that's amazing and I really really appreciate it and she really appreciates it as well she is literally crying uh when when uh she saw the outpouring of of people's uh help and and concern uh for her in her cow so thank you everyone very much for that if people want to um donate or help out they can go to um give Sendo uh.com pleasehelp Maggie and I'll put a a link for that in the description here there may already be one but I'll I'll make sure that there is anyway so thank you very much everyone I really appreciate it um if people want to uh ask questions just put it in the chat and and write question in front of it so it sort of pops out and I can see it and and I will uh answer them as best as I can and we've already got a few questions here and yeah and please in the chat tell me where you guys are from where you guys are calling in from and because it's always good to see everyone from from all over the world so we got our first question here from DMV chess thank you so much for the Super Chat is it okay to eat only carnivore snacks and carnivore crisps dehydrated beef and boiled eggs every day is there anything lacking in dehydrated beef that you would need to eat uh normal meat for well I think they just probably have a bit low fat content um and they're expensive so you know for as as far as um eating it every day you know if you're eating just that as your meal every day that's going to add up uh quite quite quickly so um you need to make sure you get the right fat content and you need to make sure that it's not destroying your bank account as well so um boiled eggs are great carnivore Chris and carnivore snacks are great um depending on the cut of the crisps and the snacks they can be very lean though and you're not going to get a huge portion of you can make your own you can cut up riy or chuck steak thin and dehydrate them yourself I don't think you're losing anything um if you cook it you'll lose a bit because you're cooking it just like you'd cook anything else but if you think about the Native Americans that made pkin they dried out uh bison another game crowned it down into dust mixed it with Tallow and and made pkin out of that and they they lived most of the year on that so I don't I don't think you're losing anything I don't know 100% for sure but just sort of thinking logically about it I don't I don't think you are because we've been drying meat for a very very very long time and people have subsisted on it um as as a main stay of their diet in many places so I don't think you're losing anything but you need to get enough fat and you need to get enough volume of food as well and um you know if you're just doing the dehydrated stuff uh you know you know you may not be getting enough so just make sure you're getting enough food but the the food that you're eating is perfectly fine it's just make sure you're getting enough and make sure you're getting enough fat okay let's go down to the next one here this is a super sticker from Sharon R thank you very much for that Sharon that's really really kind of you and good to see you here and let's go down oh a lot of good talk here and um get to the questions though there we go so meeting male 41y old female um 270 type two diabetes no meds before Whole Food BP wfbp maybe Whole Food plant-based PB but uh stops um BG control carnivore three weeks ago so I'm assuming Whole Food plant- based on switch to cornivore 3 weeks ago past three days blood glucose rise Rises to 10 or 11 at 2 a.m. and stays High until PM drops to seven or eight until o before consistently um 6.5 to 8 any ideas no Dairy intermittent fasting 20 hours and feel good uh no weight loss I'm assuming well you well your early days and um and your hormonal balance is is likely um out of out of uh out of whack all right so your fasting insulin's probably up it takes a while to come down but it should continue to come come down and uh your letin is probably rais um other hormones are probably out of balance like thyroid and so on so until those start balancing out and they they will they'll start improving um it's going to be slow for the weight loss side of things some people do have slow weight loss but they improve all the time they improve their health all the time and they feel better and that's great you're saying you feel better um stress can also affect your cortisol which can affect your blood sugars um and so you need to optimize other things in your life as well you need to reduce stress you need to optimize sleep um you know if you're not getting enough melatonin melatonin opposes cortisol all these hormones just are interlocked and so if you're not getting enough melatonin because too many lights are on you're going to bet it random times then uh that can uh fail to suppress some of the cortisol overnight and so you know you can try optimizing your sleep schedule maybe even taking a bit of melatonin melatonin only works if the lights are off though you know if you if you have the lights on and you take melatonin it just goes right out of your system and melatonin is very important it's one of your brain's most powerful antioxidants so it's actually really really important that you have enough melatonin a lot of people don't because of our light environment at home um so optimize that an hour before you want to be asleep Turn the Lights very low get off screens and and everything um you can take some melatonin it's over the counter in America um I don't know if it is in Canada which is looks like where you're from so but you can you can take a look anywhere from uh 3 five or 10 milligrams of melatonin is is fine to take and people say well maybe you feel drowsy the next day why is that because it can if you take in higher doses it can actually suppress your morning cortisol release and if you're pumping out a lot of cortisol at night and that's affecting your blood sugar not necessarily a bad thing so you could try those measures and reducing stress optimizing your your sleep schedule um you say you're not on any medications which is great um but I don't know if you needed to be before you went on this I don't know how your your blood sugar uh control was prior to that um and what your your ups and downs were then it could be that you you might benefit from some uh diabetic sort of medications early on and then you know potentially get off them later um once you're once you control is more your body is more able to control it so um that's something and that and sometimes those things can help with with weight loss things like metformin and things like that which actually have geroprotective properties as well meaning that they are suggested to promote longevity and uh and and and aging and things like that or or or um you know more more subtle aging so those are the things that that I would try and also just just be patient you know it's three weeks you're doing great you feel good keep going you know uh that's that will keep getting better your numbers will keep getting better you'll keep getting better and eventually your weight will come down so just focus on the positives focus on how you feel and focus on your your medical issues uh getting better uh because they will and um and the weight will happen you know it's usually people that have very high elevated leptins or disruption in other hormones like their thyroid hormone that they they take longer to to lose weight and it could be that if you had a thyroid issue and a lot of people have thyroid issues a lot of people have thyroid issues that don't even realize it um and they can be subtle but they can they can be there that um that's going to be very slow for weight loss because that that directly affects your metabolism and as does insulin and if you are uh you know low enough you it might be a good idea to get on a medication in the in the in the meantime you will likely be able to come off of it if you don't have a major problem a lot of people do but people need it early on to get them feeling better and help with weight loss uh early on and then you know just up to physiological levels just up to normal levels if you're deficient and then you know in a few months if you're up in good levels and you can try coming off and check it again in two months and if you're still on good levels great you don't need to be on medication so that's that's quite often what I see so um yeah and just other than that just be you know just be patient and um you know it'll it'll come these things things will happen and U you know just sometimes takes a little you know different times length of time for everybody but 3 weeks is really early days but you're just getting into a sweet spot where your body's going to start feeling much much much better because you got most of this garbage out of your system your body's making a lot more mitochondria the recycling your mitochondria you're going to have more energy you're going to have more life you're going to feel better in a lot of ways so look forward to that because it's a really exciting time Rachel from Queensland Australia thank you so much so including body myositis IBM oh inclusion body myositis um trouble giving off floor seats uh walking up and down steps can carnivore uh help stop the progression and possibly reverse the atrophy um other family members also have it that's a that's a very good question I I don't know I don't know of any um studies you know some some of these studies that are you know helpful with with carnivore there are some carnivore studies some that are just on keto so people have you know try ketogenic diet and and help in certain ways and as you can clean information from that I don't know of any um for inclusion body my side this um and um H but you know there are other things I was actually talking to um Maggie the you know Rancher up in Canada and she was actually saying that um muscular distrophy in cows is a disease that that is just muscular distopy but in cow so it has a different name but that's what it is uh they actually figured out that it's a nutritional deficiency I think she was saying selenium and so if you just supplement with selenium like they they're not getting enough in their in their normal pasture then um then it actually reverses and actually can prevent it so it's um interesting interesting that some of these you know you know genetic issues uh can be brought about or at least precipitated or activated by nutritional deficiencies or or things you know affecting them negatively in the food that they're eating um so the monotis it's not something I really ever treat but you know as I understand it's it's an inflammatory disease um and you know a carnivore diet will help inflammation it just directly reduces inflam infation by two main metrics one it eliminates out a lot of sources and causes of inflammation in the in the inappropriate food that we're eating and lowering insulin and all these sorts of things two uh higher ketones which you'll have on a carnivore diet um on a high fat ketogenic diet in general directly suppresses uh inflammation and um so that will help with inflammation it's hard to say um other than that because I haven't really come across that before so I don't I don't even have really anecdotal sort of experience with that you know I mean there's some some things like Hashimoto and and Crohn's and all these sorts of things actually are um you know there is literature sort of showing that that nutritional changes uh really do help in a lot of ways and then I I've seen it directly hundreds of times so um unfortunately I don't have the same experience with um uh IBM so but it's worth a shot because you're going to you're going to feel a lot better anyway and it's going to optimize your health and so if you have a medical issue it's going to optimize your health with that medical issue and so your life is just going to be better in a lot of ways having to deal with that medical issue so you know it's um it's it can have a lot of benefits and positives either way so I would I would still give it a try and and who knows if it helps uh with that that then that's fantastic you can share that with your family and and then share it with the rest of us and let us know so that we can we can pass that around to other people who may be um having that as an issue so good luck with that and then Copper's carnivore kitchen thank you so much uh for the $50 Super Chat that's really really generous of you um love and greatly appreciate you and L uh but this is for little boy who stole the show the other day belly rubs for him from Alaska well thank you very much little yeah is my cat um he actually is around there he's just sort of sitting in the Sun by the window at the moment but yeah he's a cute little guy so thank you very much for that he's also just sweet I mean it's weird that like a hairless cat I mean it is weird hairless cats are weird uh but you get used to it and he's just very sweet um very sweet little guy so um yeah he's he's the hairlessness is sort of grown on me and also you don't have hair everywhere just fantastic and their their skin is all warm their body's warm it's like it's little hot water bottle you just sort of you know um there with you all the time and you're not getting a bunch of allergies and hair all over your clothes and things like that it's actually it's actually pretty good but he's freezing all the time which is why he like crawls under blankets and different piles of clothing you know so he can he can actually stay warm but yeah so there's a question from I love pineapples okay uh question how much water do I uh do I really need to push uh do I really need to push it I have had for years okay so I didn't write quite understand that sentence but basically asking how much water you need I think I have heard best not to eat one hour before and not after but have not heard a doctor say from Anapolis Maryland yeah so um the idea there is is that if you drink water in and around Meal Time um in in around meal time that that uh this can dilute your stomach acid and dilute your digestive uh enzymes and also just fill up your stomach that um you know would be better served being filled with meat and so especially people with with um gastric emptying issues or having had surgery to reduce the size of their of their stomach that's really important to not drink water an hour or two before and after meals and certainly not during Meal Time a sit to help help things wash down if you need to and that's the idea not everybody needs to do that not everybody feels that that benefits them but that's the idea and so if you're have certainly having any digestion issues or probably getting enough at one time then you should you should definitely try that because that that is helpful in those circumstances and you know for me personally I just I've just sort of done it um you know just just when I think about it I just will sort of just avoid you know water during a meal and just sort of wait for a bit afterwards um have I noticed too much of a difference I can't I don't know but some people really do and some people especially with with gastric emptying or if they're having trouble getting enough food they uh they need to just eat meat on its own without water and really fill up and then wait for a while let it digest and then drink some water um especially people that that need a lot more meat if they're if they're underweight and they're trying to put on weight then you you need to get as as much meat in your stomach as as you can because you can just you can just fill up and so um and so that's that's one of the ways of of doing that is making sure that you're not putting in water as well and wasting that space so that's the idea there uh question what would be enough fat that's from Maryann Elman so enough fat is just is individual so I try to I have a video it's called you don't need fiber and and then parentheses fiber constipation and diet and so that's where I answer that question or in my video on Carnivore for beginners I answer that a bit more briefly uh basically our body has a limited capacity to absorb fat and so if you satisfy that then your body and that's how much bile you have your B your body absorbs fat with bile bile ulies fat and then you absorb it after that into your lymphatic system and turns into kyom Micron and goes around your body right because it's actually goes direct through it skips it skips the the portal Venus system going to your liver and just goes straight in your body because your body's just like this is really important get it in right now we don't want to waste time right it's the only thing that does that and so once you've sat once you've satisfied your body's desire to absorb fat with the amount of bile that's made because I don't think that's random I think your body makes a specific amount of B because it wants a specific amount of fat I don't think that your body just randomly does things that's not how biology works and um so if you satisfy that then there's a spill over right because you can't you can't absorb it after a certain point you can absorb some without bile but it's it's a very small percentage okay the rest of it goes out and in your stools and so that's how you know if you have hard dry stools it means you're absorbing every ounce of fat that your body is eating and or that you you've taken in and none of it's getting out whereas if it's soft you have this excess fat so you you satisfied your body's capacity for it and then a little more that's spilled over into your stools and it's now soft right if you eat a lot more fat than your body can absorb it will come out as as loose stools and so that's how you can tell now if you're drinking coffee or tea or using sweeteners like arrol or Stevia or any of the other artificial nasty horrible things then uh those are all laxatives and that will confuse things because you may be not getting enough fat and very constipated and Norm would be constipated if you weren't taking these laxatives but these laxatives are keeping you uh a regular soft consistency now it doesn't matter how often you go as long as the consistency is soft there's a Bristol stool chart on constipation b r i s t o l and if you if you look at that it only talks about the consistency and character of the stools it says nothing about frequency right so it's just that usually if you're not eating enough fat you're always going to get these dry hard stools unless it moves out quickly and so if it's sitting there for three days four days five days a week um you know it could be because you're you're building up an obstruction right but if you have enough fat that that's not case it can sit there for you a week or two or whatever or a month uh as long as there's fat in there it'll be soft and you're absorbing 98% of the meat that you're eating um or so and and so only 2% is coming out whereas plants you know something like 95% of that plant is vegetable and fruit and things like that are fiber so you're not absorbing 95% of that so 95% of what you eat has to come out again we're used to just these massive massive massive amounts of waste coming out of us and that's not normal um it's normal because a lot of people do it but it's not actually what we're supposed to do so uh that's how you know how you get enough fat aim for one gram of fat and one gram of protein or up to two grams of fat and one to one gram of protein that's a rough range that most people do well in based on where you're at and what protein demands that your body needs an energy demands your body needs and nutrient demands your body needs it might go up or down from there aim for that and then adjust um by taste if it tastes good that's a good sign that it's that your body wants it as far as meat and Fat's concerned sugar is an outlier Sugar's a drug sugar is something that we say oh this tastes good this is safe I can eat this now and I can survive it's only available for two weeks anyway and then I can go and get get my kill but that's not that's not something that's good for us longterm um but the meat and the fat are and you'll get negative feedback it will taste less and less good every time you eat it until you eventually get you know you don't get any positive you experience when you're eating it just doesn't taste good and so you just you know at that point you don't need to eat it anymore right and so you know you just keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good you aim for one to one gram or two to one grams of fat to protein and then just see how you go and and adjust yourself from there uh thank you for the Super Chat Allison should I be concerned about lead in Himalayan or Redmond sea salts that's a good question I have no idea um I don't know about the lead content in either of those I hadn't heard about that um that's a good question though I don't um I'm not sure I well anyway I haven't heard anything about that if if people have heard something about that you know please do comment in the chat um or in the or in the video and and and let us know because if you have any sort of you know resources or links or anything like that that would be great too because U yeah I haven't really um yeah I haven't I haven't haven't heard that before so yeah I would um yeah I I would be curious about that so if anybody else has information on that please do share that with the class and um because I I don't know one way or the other but I have not heard that either of those have lead in them so yeah good question question from cherish 989 uh question on Carnivore for about six weeks watery diarrhea after every meal how long will this last so that goes back to the last question where it's just a matter of of of um identifying how much fat that you're eating and is that too much for your body and maybe you need to pull back the uh the amount of fat that you're eating or most people still drink coffee even though they go on a cornerboard diet or tea or still use sweeteners if this is your if this is your case you need to stop them immediately because those are laxes and a lot of people say well I'm drinking the same amount of coffee I always drank and that didn't give me diarrhea right 95% of the things you were eating had to come out so you have this large bulk of stuff going through your intestines at all times and so the mild laxative effect that it had just sort of kept things moving a bit and not getting completely blocked whereas now you only have 2% of what you're eating going out and so it's much more uh much smaller volume and and liquid and just and it'll just fly through you so if you're having any of that stuff you need to stop um and then if you're not having any of that and you're eating only fatty meat and water um then it could be that your body is not absorbing as much fat as you're eating or you know close to as much fat as you're eating and and sometimes that that gets better your body says okay we're getting fat now so we're we're getting fat in our intake now so maybe we'll start increasing the amount of bile that we make so a lot of people find that that um that uh their their fat capacity their ability to absorb fat goes up as you go um that usually happens by six weeks though um and so it could be one of these other things now the other side of it is that if you're eating so little fat that you actually are getting constipated and um you're getting quite constipated that you can actually get what's called overflow diarrhea or spous diarrhea where you are constipating you are building up this sort of blockage of dry hard craggly Rocky pebbly stools right and it's not really moving and you're getting the liquid stools coming out of your small intestine actually just pushes its way around and that's called overflow it's overflowing past this sort of pseudo obstruction or pre- obstruction and then you're getting just liquid liquid diarrhea all the time right and then every now and then you have a big hard dry lumpy hardto pass painful stool okay and then it's just liquid liquid liquid liquid liquid if that's the case you are not eating anywhere close to enough fat and you need to ramp ramp up your fat right away because that's that's really bad OB that's really bad um constipation that could lead to obstruction and that's not what you want so if that's the case if you're getting watery diarrhea and every now and then you get a hard chunky constipated horrible thing you are not eating close to enough fat you need to increase the amount of fat that you're eating and so uh that's what I would do so just sort of run through that list any coffee tea sweeteners get rid of them see how that affects you if you're only eating fatty meat and water if you're eating a good amount of fat like RI eyes like you know sort of gram for gram for gram then maybe that's a bit too much and you just s of reduce it or reduce um the amount of added like um rendered fat like Tallow and butter and things like that so just eat the fat that's in the meat itself that's that's uh takes a bit longer for your body to break that down and absorb that so it doesn't just fly through your body as quick some people find that that's that's the issue is that they just have they don't absorb that as well so they need to just eat the the solid fat on meat and then very rare cases um people need to cut off the fat and just eat that uh uncooked and then cook up the the meat separately and uh for whatever reason just having it just as as a sort of the uncooked fat their body is able to just break that down more normally and like a sort of a slow release tablet slow relase pill it it it um comes out better that way they absorb it better that way so those are some um uh you know so that that's uh you know that that's what I would do I just sort of run down that that sort of list here's a question on um with diabetes regarding carnivore do we uh mom diabetic have to test for keto acidosis on a regular basis no you don't so uh as long as you have insulin then you don't you don't need to do that the thing with keto acidosis is that you're ketones you basically have no insulin and so you just have massively elevated ketone and blood sugar and that causes an acidic state but you're not going to get anywhere close to that in nutritional ketosis so that's that's a different thing so um you know we don't warn diabetics that um that uh you know a period of fasting during Lent or something like that is going to put them in a acidosis unless they mess up their uh their you know their insulin doses right and they stop taking their insulin um so if you stop if you're a type one diabetic and you sto taking your insulin um then yes you can get into keto acidosis but that's a that's a very very different thing so um being in ketosis or a nutritional ketosis is not the same thing as keto acidosis it has it shares the same uh you know root in the name but it is it is not the same thing whatsoever so don't worry about that if you're on medication continue taking your medication you may need to take less medication in time work with your doctor your diabetes nurse in order to safely do that but um as long as you're taking things as prescribed and you're being careful and checking your blood sugar and how much insulin all these sorts of things you need to take you're not you're not at risk of that um type two diabetics really don't get keto acidosis anyway that's that's really something that's particular to type one diabetics who are not taking insulin it's usually how we diagnose new type ones because they they come into the hospital in keto acidosis because they haven't been making insulin for a few weeks and or making less and less and less and then you get to the point where your body's just like nope can't do this anymore so uh yeah very good question no that's not something you have to worry about uh on this quick scope thank you very much for the Super Chat hey Dr chaffy is smoked meat or water below room temperature bad at all I'm assuming not smoked water below room temperature but just room temperature temp below water water below room temperature uh bad at all so well you know when when you know a lot of people think that um you know just historically that drinking cooler water can sort of cause a cramping and constriction of your stomach which maybe cause some some stomach upset and maybe not sort of open up and allow more food and water to get in um and um so that could be part of that you know if you're if you're drinking warm water probably going to be easier to absorb it's going to in because when you increase temperature it increases reaction rates and absorption is part of the reaction digestion is part of is a chemical reaction right because we're we're chemical factories we are not combustion engines so that's why you know just as as a tangent you know that's why calories are meaningless um in that in that aspect because it it does because calorie is a measure of heat energy and if we were steam locomotives then that would be really important to know how much energy is coming out of of the fuel we put in ourselves but we are chemical factories and so that they don't work like that you know if you have a glass of water and you increase its heat its weight doesn't go up right so calories weigh nothing that's not that's not a good unit of oh more calories than more more weight that's not how that works more food more weight because that that's actually has mass and substance you're eating more matter and you're putting that in your body that's becoming part of your body so you're having more atoms that are now in your body and you weigh more so a better way of thinking about this is energy per gram right but so nine calories per gram right so oh my God nine calories that's bad well actually or actually you should look at the other way around which is grams per calorie was there's there are there's there's one gram of fat per nine calories where there's 2.1 gam of protein and carbohydrates per 9 calories so so that's a better way of thinking about it you're eating twice the amount of matter and atoms that have to go in your body and become part of your body to get the same amount of of energy of chemical energy that's um that you can that you're going to get from these calories so a better way of looking at if if you're ever going to consider things in in respect to calories think about them in grams per calorie as opposed to calories per gram it's just a different way of thinking about it and I think probably more accurate that's something that um Dr Michael eids uh presented on when at the Symposium for metabolic Health in San Diego that I went at it was very interesting and I thought you made a very good point because if you look at over time if you're getting your calories more from fat then from uh carbs or or protein you're just bringing in less mass and over time you're like every week or every two weeks you're you're you're just for the same amount of calories you're just bringing in two pound pounds less of of matter per week and is and I think it was per week and he's saying that that that that lines up pretty pretty straight with how much weight people generally lose on a ketogenic diet they lose about two pounds a week while they're eating two pounds less of matter every week as well so interesting to think about um if people haven't come across Dr Michael eids he's fantastic he has some amazing uh talks on um on YouTube and he has a great website I think it's called protein power anyway people can look him up e uh Dr Michael eids eades he's he's fantastic a lot of really really interesting stuff um getting back to your question um smoke Meats fine we've been cooking meat with open fire with a lot of smoke for 800,000 years there are some things that say well look at these different chemicals in there those can be carcinogenic well but the the studies that they've done with that were an animal model so you don't know how translatable you are but you know that that should concern people um you should take that seriously but they were in in massive massive massive quantities so they were in thousands of times the amount that you would get in like smoked meat and so they found that in in animals at massive doses that could be carcinogenic so is that really translatable to uh humans that eat a one 10,000th of a dose who knows so I'm I'm a bit I'm a bit agnostic to that I still have smoked meat sometimes I don't make it as as something I'd eat every day uh but I enjoy it sometimes I'll smoke a brisket or some ribs tastes good uh or go to a barbecue place or something like that um and try not to get all the sauces and and and rubs and things like that on it or at least asort without it um but it's fine especially every now and then I think that that's perfectly fine I mean it's um it might be I feel better when I just eat straight up meat because there is something in there sort of makes me feel a bit you know just like you know if you get a bit of seasonings or whatever in your meat it's just like it's just not it's not perfect but you know I don't I don't I don't I'm not convinced that it's just this horrible thing that we should just never do so I think every now and then is is perfectly fine I think your body perfectly be able to handle that just like every now and then you probably handle cup of coffee or some spice you know um but you know probably better to just um stick to just normal normal meat no spices no smoke but every now and and you know just see how you feel question from Natalie hi from Kentucky Hashimoto and stomach aches bloating all the time keto for three weeks with success and decrease in symptoms going carnivore next week tips for best results well that's great um well I well I would watch the video I did on on Carnivore for beginners as well as the you know you don't need fiber um you know the fiber constipation and diet and then I have an FAQ frequently ask questions one that I did as well um those are all can be found on my playlist so if you people go to my YouTube channel uh and go to playlists you can see in there it says getting started on a carnivore diet I think that is a sort of a curated list and that has those those sort of beginning things on how to do carnivore and how to succeed at it I would definitely watch those I tried to you have that sort of that that would be able to answer 95% of of questions that most people have when they're when they're first starting out um but basically eat fatty meat eat enough fatty meat get enough fat get enough of the whole whole show eat until fatty meat stops tasting good that's very important your hunger signals are going to be very different and I'm sure they're probably already very different on keto so you need to get enough it's very easy to undereat on a carnivore diet trust me I did it myself when I was just doing this uh on the Fly 23 years ago um I had no idea no one told me that um that you had to that you had to uh you know you that your hunger signals change and all these sorts of things so I had to figure that out the hard way and um I was training six eight 10 hours a day every day uh for a very long time and I finally just just couldn't do it um I wasn't eating enough and my body just just ran out of stores and I just started feeling worse and worse and worse every time I worked out where normally I was getting better and better and better every time I worked up so I was just thinking like okay I just I'm I'm clearly not eating enough I'm definitely not getting enough uh food but I'm just not hungry I'm just never hungry but meat always tasted good it always tasted amazing every time I decide okay I'll eat it's like oh God that was so great I'm so glad I did that so that's what that you have to relearn your hunger signals and if it if meat tastes good if a steak tastes good you're hungry you need to keep eating but if it doesn't you don't right so even if you haven't eaten that day and you started eating a steak you just go I'm I'm really not enjoying this don't eat it you know you don't need it it you know try it again later try it the next day it'll taste good eventually uh when you are hungry so watch those videos and also watch not only the how videos but the why videos why is this important why is this a good idea why does this help hashimotos why does this help other sorts of issues and bloating and all that sort of stuff quite often just fiber is is the main culprit there but um there are a lot of different reasons and so just understanding about you know plants being you know by their nature uh toxic because that's how they defend themselves you know and understanding that and understanding that it's best to eat what we've been designed to eat what we've adapted to eating and that is meat that um that that's that that's what's most optimal for us anybody who tells you that that um two million years of of adaptation is is meaningless and we probably just adapt probably making us sick and dying of heart disease at 30 the whole time but you you know but whatever you know like you know nature does not work like that you know even if if uh meat was causing heart disease and cancer early on in our adaptation like it it would change you know like we would get more adapted to it just like we've gotten adapted to some plants in the 10,000 years that we that some populations have been eating them and that's how you can see European populations Native American Native Australian population have very different outcomes when eating a western diet very different outcomes right and that's because Europeans have had longer access and exposure and adaptation to plant specific plants and specific toxins in those plants whereas Native Americans native Australians have not they've had the last hundred years or so of really being incorporated into Western uh you know Western culture um and and eating the food that the Europeans ate and you know and some people you know before that for a couple hundred years but it's only been a few hundred years and of exposure and that and not on a population-wide basis that's that's more recent than that and so they have not had that adaptation and they get much more unwell when eating a western diet when I first came to Australia I was told when you're when you're treating an AB virginal patient whatever their age says on their on their sticker add 20 years to that because they just age faster and they just get diseases quicker okay but why would that be they didn't get these things um you know read any historical uh manuscripts on on aboriginals or the Native Americans um you know they didn't get these diseases of the West uh and if they did it was in vanishingly small amounts and it was generally the people that were eating the food of the West and this is why they called it the diseases of the West because non-western people weren't getting them and uh but when they started eating the food of the West they got the diseases of the West that means the food of the West causes the diseases of the West which are not called diseases of the West anymore it's just called getting older it's just called life you know they're just called these chronic diseases chronic issues metabolic syndrome metabolic issues it's from the food it's from Western food and uh certain people have had exposure to to um you know exposure to uh Agriculture and so they have developed and and adapted a bit to that but we're not even eating the same plants that we we were eating 10,000 years ago these are new we we've sort of created these things we certainly weren't eating them 100,00 years ago a million years ago we were eating meat a million years ago 100,000 years ago 300,000 years ago 2 million years ago 2.6 million years ago three million years ago we split off from other primates because we started eating meat and we largely been eating meat for the last 2.6 million years plus if not exclusively in certain areas at certain times like during the ice ages in the Arctic Circle when good luck finding a plant right so so that's what I would I would say just understand the why as well as the how because that makes things much more easy that makes it much more easy to stick to because if you say like look no this is this is just the optimal way of eating for my health and my life and my longevity and for my family and so I don't I want to do that I don't want to uh eat suboptimally and so if you understand that you understand the why it will help you succeed and have this be a lifelong Venture as opposed to just a crash diet that you use for a bit to help your Hashimoto and you're bloating and then you go back to eating the garbage and all your problems come back again which is pretty telling if you eat if you go on a carnivore diet and this helps all your issues and then you stop eating carnivore diet and your issues come back well that means the food is causing the issues doesn't it so that's what I would do and good luck to that Natalie jetting Chen thank you very much for the Super Chat your thoughts on having seasoning during uh early days into carnivore ra all garlic black and white pepper green onion meat tasting boring without yeah look that's fair enough and if if you need to to have a bit of spice because you know it it makes you enjoy it more and it makes you more likely to stick to it you know that's that's fine uh uh cooking things does make make it better cooked garlic um is going to denature some of these sort of issues black pepper as opposed to white pepper black pepper is worse than white pepper has more oxalates and other sorts of things in it that you don't want white pepper is a bit more safe you know Green Onion the all of these things are parts of the of the plant that the plant doesn't want you to eat right so the pepper and the garlic this these These are seeds and Bulbs that's the next generation of plants that's trying to grow or the roots and all these sorts of things so uh they don't really want you to eat those those parts they also don't want you to eat the shoes because that's the part that's you know they're getting they getting sun and chlorophyll um is you know collecting sunlight and sun energy so that's not really something they want you to eat either but you know that being said you know if you're if you're using this in small amounts to just sort of FL the food and that's getting you through the Finish Line where you're just enjoying eating meat all the time you know that's fine um you know it's not like just like no it has to be 100% or you're not in the club no you can you can do it like that I feel better without it I feel a lot better without it and so I just avoid it and the longer you eat meat on its own with like maybe a bit of salt the better it tastes and the more you appreciate just the actual meat flavor itself and and you don't need the spices so now you know if I if I go out or something like that and so or someone puts on uh you know spices it doesn't it doesn't taste that good to me it's actually covering up the taste that I like which is the meat and it sort of makes me feel a bit crummy my you know my nose gets itchy my eyes are get sort of feel funny and I might get a stuffy nose or or my asthma might sort of start bugging me and so you I notice the difference but you know early on if that helps you helps you succeed then you know that's great you know because you're predominantly eating meat which is exactly what you want and you've eliminated out a gaggle of other sorts of you know plants that are just horrible for you so you're you're you know very very very uh going to be very benefited by that you've gotten rid of a lot of stuff that's not good for you you've added in a lot of stuff that's really good for you so that's going to be a massive net positive for you eventually once you're happy with the way you're eating I would try cutting those down and maybe trying 30 days without any of the spices and see how you feel I think that you'll find that you know after a while after a few days a few weeks you'll find that the meat starts tasting better and better to you and that you feel better and better and you actually feel a lot better without the spices so I would um I would encourage you to at least try that at some point down the road uh once you're once you're feeling pretty good about it from driven Mia thank you for the Super Chat uh epidi and testing pain intestinal hernia um I'm assuming you're asking if this if this can be helped by a carnivore diet uh well inflammation can be you know reduced well is reduced with a carnivore diet um and so that's uh that's a positive but um it you know there are different causes of testicular pain of course um and so it depends dep on what's what's causing that pain uh it can it may not remove the underlying cause of the pain but it can certainly reduce the pain by reducing inflammation and so on if you have an infection or you have some other problem you need medical attention obviously and so you should you should see your doctor about that um and intestinal hernia um well it's not going to close the gap on your hernia um it can make the experience of the pain slightly less but you know hernia is is a defect in the in the tissue where it's just sort of pulled apart you have intestines or or something else pushing through that and um you know that's that's not really going to close on its own you generally will need like surgical intervention for that if it gets bad enough and it's causing enough problems and and especially if it if the hernia goes out and gets stuck and you can't push it back through then that's an emergency and you need to get to a hospital right away because that that will cut off the blood supply and it'll start to die and your your bowel can die and uh you can die subsequently so um uh it can it can help your experience with all these things it certainly help you recover from surgery but it's um it's not going to close up the defect in a hernia uh that I would I would I would not expect that anyway um maybe a little smaller one maybe that sort of helps but you know generally this is just you know there's a defect there and it needs to be surgically repaired if it needs to be repaired at if it's not that big a deal it's not causing you a problem then you know it's not a problem okay question from Katie lady question hi Anthony my fiance and I just started the carnivore diet this past Monday I have PCOS and Hashimoto and was told to take natural supplement berberine instead of Metformin is that okay I don't know who told you to take berberine um metformin works pretty well berberine is um is a uh you know a plant and so it maybe it has some some similar sort of effects to metformin but it has other things as well and um and that's the part that I get concerned about is is all the other stuff that comes with the part that you want I mean you want to take an aspirin you want to chew on willow bark okay both are going to give you aspirin but the willow Bark's going to taste like crap and it's going to um is going to come with you know thousands of other chemicals that maybe you don't want you want the aspirin you don't want all the other things and also what dose how much bark do you chew on how much tea do you make in order to get the dose of aspirin that you want um same with berberine I mean is is it exactly as much as it's telling you I would feel more comfortable with metformin metformin is very safe drug very safe um people use it for longevity it has geroprotective effects as I mentioned uh very much helps with PCOS because that's that has to do with insulin resistance um and it disrupts your your hormones as a result of that um but going on a cornor diet will do exactly the same thing and it actually treats the underlying cause of your insulin resistance and hormonal disruption uh as opposed to just sort of masking it and helping with the symptoms there up uh but yeah you could you could you could use either one metformin or berberine I would feel more like I wouldn't prescribe someone berberine like I would just prescribe the metformin if I thought they needed to be on Metformin like for PCOS which is commonly prescribed um met they commonly prescrib metformin for for PCOS uh but just going on a carboard diet will do exactly that and so you probably don't need either the Buran or metformin for very long anyway so uh yeah hope that hope that um helps you make your decision on what You' like to do Michael Gavin thank you for the Super Chat question you might find uh the full carnivore easy for you being young and healthy but for older unhealthy people can you suggest a transition plan well I'm not all that young uh I'm I'm 43 and um you know and I and uh you know that might be younger than you are I don't I don't feel I'm not a spring chicken by any Str imagination I certainly um you know I'm not as young as I as I I think I am in my head quite often but um for people that are trying to transition you know some people that that are older they they just go bang right into it and they do very well with that um and and younger people may have struggled with transitioning so it's it's really more about mindset if you're not in a place that you can just go cold turkey that's fine um so if you're going to transition I would start with you know going keto right and uh and then reducing things from there I think that that getting rid of the carbohydrates and the sugar and the alcohol make major major major changes in your body and your biochemistry and your metabolism and benefit you greatly and so I would I would start with that right so start eating a lot more meat a lot more fatty meat the fat is the most important part and when you do that you will um you know you will just sort of replace out sort of push out the other things so meat's the main part of the meal eat a lot of meat have some other side stuff fine start with the meat first and cut out the carbs sugar and alcohol and then get a calendar Mark your day this day drop carbs sugar and alcohol and then the next week or next two weeks this is when I drop out all seeds nuts beans legumes lentils all that sort of stuff and then this next week this is when I cut out all night shades potatoes Tomatoes eggplants Peppers capsicums all that sort of stuff this one I knock out this next stuff and then you you go down and then you on this day cutting out all plants except for seasonings and spices and on this date I'm cutting out spices right so have a clear plan of progression if you just say oh yeah I'll sort of do it as I go and I'll just reduce things as I go some people can do that most people don't most people just sort of Linger on where they're at and maybe don't really change much you need to have a clear plan you need to say hey I'm going to make these changes here and here and here and here and on this day I'm going to be on so if you're going to make a transition plan make it a plan put it on paper make a commitment to yourself to stick to it and have clear dates that you're going to stop certain things and at a and a firm date on when you will be off everything right except maybe some seasonings and spices and then make a decision uh for yourself if you want to at some point try a month off without any spices I would I suggest people do that because it it affects you more than you realize even even that little bit of spices so um it's worth it's worth checking and it's worth trying to go without uh at some point but that's how I would do it that's how I I I generally recommend people transition uh thank you for Super Chat EG microscope our omega-3 fish oil supplements necessary on a cornerboard diet thanks for all your help uh no not necessarily and a lot of the fish oil supplements are not very good anyway they're sort of poor quality uh they become rancid or or denatured or damaged in some sort of process you know commercial process where they're sort of packaging and and putting these things together and shipping them out so they're they're um I don't know the exact numbers but you hear different things like know 60% are rancid and not really good and they don't have actually good omega-3 uh compliment anyway uh if you're just eating a lot of meat especially grass-fed and finished beef and lamb uh you get you're going to get a lot of Omega 3es if you're getting farm factory you know grain intensively grain finished animals or grain soy fed animals uh they're going to have less if any uh chicken and and pork are going to have a lot of more Omega sixes and linolic acid if they're fed a whole bunch of cor corn and soy if you're getting pasture raised very different story um so not everyone has access to that though but if you're if you know but but really just eat eat fish you know have fish you know once or twice a week you'll get a lot of Omega-3s have some sardines you know just 10 sardines a day you know you'll be fine with that um but beef has Omega-3s but you know it it does make a difference you know how how the the beef is is raised as well so if you're getting um grass-fed and finished uh beef much better compliment of Omega-3s uh thank you for the Super Chat Wolverine I might have Alpha gal I'm sorry to hear that getting tested I've been uh cariv for 6 months now can I still do carnivore with other than red meats if posit 100% you absolutely can also you how are you feeling with that as well are do you feel very sick with a red meat it may be that you know you you're not reacting all that strongly to it and if so you know just go with how you feel um I you know this isn't something I know um I I know in a very in-depth manner but you know having spoken to different people you know like Dr Ken Barry and others you know they've said that this is something that right so this affects like red meat you can eat other meats you can eat you know the white meats or fish and things like that and and and do just fine it doesn't have Alpha gal that people react to it's just a it's just a carbohydrate um that that shows up in in certain red meats so you just avoid those but you can eat other meats that's fine and so you can do very very well on things besides red meat still better than any anything else you'll e right and um and from what they've told me it it's not permanent so from what they were saying it only lasts a few months and then you can get back to eating red meat which is very positive and so hopefully that's the case hopefully you don't have it at all you don't have to worry about it but if you do fine totally fine to switch to fatty other meats you need to get enough fat just make sure you're doing that you're getting enough fat um and um and you should be able to add in you know animal fats as well and that should be okay which just you know just try certainly like duck fat and things like that you can add in um ghee should probably be fine as well probably butter and Tallow but um you can you can try them and see how they make you feel anyway um but in any case hopefully it's not there hopefully you don't have it if you do go to the other meats and then see if you can you can tolerate red meat a few months down the road and and see how you go so good luck with that Barry Simon thank you very much uh for the $100 super chats very kind of you very generous uh question I'm having abdominal cramping issues uh this has progressed over the last eight plus years I used to do I used to do a lot of smoothies with blackberries and more I was eating dark chocolate too uh possibly oxalate issues I'm strict carnivore now for two months beef salt water uh beef beef water salt Su butter and LM those are the the electrolytes um so it would be good it would be good to know a bit more Barry um are the abdominal cramping issues still going on um or have they been helped with a cornor diet quite often they they abdominal cramping is helped just getting rid of all the you plant toxins and um and uh uh fiber you know that that can cause cramping and and and bloating and and those sorts of things and painful constipation so hopefully that has gone better yeah you know dark chocolate blackberries all these other sorts and just most of the other plants that we eat have a lot of oxalates spinach that's a major one and um and so people will will eat aot of uh this sort of stuff without realizing it and have have problems with that quite often you know eliminating out all these sorts of things will improve your health and your your abdominal issues and your gut health issues dramatically and so um I would um I would expect that to be the case for you after two months I would expect you to have improved um and if you are having oxalate dumping that is generally transient you know speaking to Sally Norton who's who's the the the resident expert in oxalates you know she she said that some people have very serious time with with oxalates and oxalate dumping and get very sick and they need to they need to take measures and probably have some you know low dose oxalates you know 50 to 100 milligrams or something like that a day to sort of ease that that dumping but but a lot of people most people uh even if they if they are not everyone will dump but if if people are dumping they will often have pretty rough couple days or a couple weeks and then it goes away so if that's the case that you're having oxalate dumping issues it can it can manifest in a lot of different ways it can be abdominal cramping or joint pain or or you know weird sort of crystally sort of stuff coming out of your eyes or or weird calci calcified sort of order and plaque and stuff like that building up on your teeth or discoloration and all that sort of stuff so it can come up in a lot of different ways kidney stones but um it generally will pass eventually if it's still causing a lot of problem and you and you look at your symptoms and you and you look at Sally Norton's work and then you can look at our our interview together and and and check her other resources out to see if you think that that's something that's affecting you um you can try a very low dose amount of oxalates like a like a weak tea that has a bit of oxalates in it like 50 to 100 milligrams in it and she has has resources on on things that have a small amount and um and uh you know and at that point um you know you can just try that and see and if it helps you then then great um but you know just getting rid of all the fiber and plants and just eating more meat that can help gut in a lot of ways and and it can take a few months to heal leaky gut but uh it will get there and um so I would just uh keep positive about that keep going with that still early days two months is a good good amount of time but it's you know it is early on in the process and so hopefully you're feeling better already and that will just continue continue to get better if you think you are having ongoing issues that may be related to oxalates take a look at Sally Norton's uh work and see if her protocols can help okay oh goodness so super chat from MB gstv thank you very much for that um they ask thank you for the amazing education and support here to support regenerative farming we're in Canada um how can we donate to Maggie and Mac directly oh well thank you very much well the um the the the give send go campaign is it goes directly to them so that's i' I've put them down as the or as her down as the as the benefactor from that so I it doesn't go through me and then I transfer it to them it's there's no scheming there's no percentage the give send go there they don't take a percentage um and I don't take a percentage it it doesn't come to me at all I'm I'm just a facilitator I'm I'm not an intermediary nothing goes through me um and so I don't even have I don't have the opportunity to take a percentage even if I wanted to which I don't um and so that that is that is how to to uh give directly to them that doesn't that doesn't get skimmed at all so if you go to www.g send go.com pleasehelp Maggie um and I think that that is in the description here and if not I will put it in the and um let me see yeah and so yeah so that's in that's in the uh description if you go to the description of this um YouTube live uh you'll see that there and there's a there's a link there that you can donate and that goes directly to them uh it doesn't come through anyone else uh the website doesn't take a cut of that I don't take a cut of that that goes directly to them so if uh so thank you very much for uh supporting regenerative farming and and for uh supporting your your fellow Canadian uh Maggie macro are wonderful people and they they really do deserve help they have helped so many people uh without ever asking for or expecting anything else in return and um you know as as no good deed goes unpunished and so they the seems that the more good things that they do for people the more people try to take advantage of them and it's not like they're pushovers like I mean they they know how to fight um but they're nice people and and they try to help people and sometimes people take advantage of that and uh that's very very unfortunate so I think it's um uh they you know there are people in this world that deserve uh deserve help I think it's I think it's them and that's why I set that up so thank you very much for your interest in that and I really I really appreciate it and that's where people can go thank you um Sandra borit thank you very much for the Super Chat 45 uh years old from Brisbane carnivore for 3 weeks for back pain hav pain um G2 anti grade 2 antalis severe stenosis bone on bone recommended decompression and fusion thoughts well the good news is is that your pain is significantly improved um you have you have structural issues there that uh you know may need to be addressed um you know I I don't know what your scans look like you know if if your facet joints are in good shape and more working order and depending on where this is and how bad it is and and a lot of other things uh there are other options especially for someone your age uh besides a fusion it can also be uh you can also get a dis replacement you can get an artificial disc that's still so as well uh Leonardo thank you very much for the super chat um so Redmond Elemental test on website lead is 0.002% okay so that that's going back to the the Himalayan pink salt or Redman salt worry about the lead uh so that looks pretty low you know I don't know the exact um levels that are that are going to be a bit of an issue but that that seems pretty damn low uh so hopefully that's that's low enough for people that know um what the hell that means but you know I think you go buy parts per million and things like that so what is that um one two three four five six so that's like I don't know what is that if I'm looking at the zeros properly is that two parts per million or 20 parts per million or something like that um and then people can sort of look up if that's an acceptable amount of of lead in the salt uh I don't know off hand uh thank you very much Sherry Jacob for the Super Chat there no uh question attached but maybe there's one uh down the road here not seeing it though okay we'll just keep an for that um so super mhill thank you very much for the Super Chat how do you reut a vegan uh vegan's argument that it's unethical to kill an animal for our consumption as they have the same rights to live uh like humans well look it's it's not nice to kill anything that's not nice but you know the ways that we have uh you know developed are as close to instant as possible you know when in the west anyway uh that's what kosher is and halal is is that you're you're you're praying for the animal you're thanking it you're thanking a spirit you're making sure it treated well like they won't they won't process an animal if it if it has signs of abuse and or if it's dead already when it comes in I believe um it has to be like this is a healthy animal has been treated well you know you don't get to mistreat these things we're not going to process it if you do um and then they you know they they pray for it they thank it and then they uh you know slit the throat which historically was fastest way you were going to get you know in something's life um now we have electrocution and pneumatic hammer and they just drop or you know a bullet or something like that and you shoot out the brain s it's gone they're just instantly gone right so that's that's uh as as near instant as it's really possible to get um and so there's no no nice way to kill something but that's the nicest way possible look at nature and look at animals eating other animals is it ethical or unethical for them to to eat animals I mean what I mean let's define ethics here what what ethics is it's an artian concept uh and it and it means or it Aristotle or is it Plato anyway that era I think it's Aristotle um and they said that that being ethical was living into one's nature so what's eal for a wolf is different than what ethical for us a wolf should live within its nature and and hunt and kill and eat and and man's nature that he thought was to reason we should think about things okay well let's think about this what's our nature as well we are carnivores and we and that's what we need to eat so it actually is definitionally ethical for us to eat what we're designed to eat first and foremost now is it nice to do no of course it's not nice to do but look at all these other animals that are eating other animals are eating them alive ripping them apart and and it's it's torture it's horrible we at least think about that and saying we don't want these animals to Suffer Well we should anyway not everyone does necessarily but you know that's that's important to think about you we don't want these animals to suffer and we are thinking about that no other animal on earth thinks about that um except maybe it's fun to watch them suffer like Oracle whales flipping seals you 50 ft in the air down to another one grabbing it flicking it over and just playing with their food um you know pretty pretty nasty stuff they're just having fun with it they don't care and so you know that's that's one thing but also if we're talking about it's not right to kill animals for our food okay there is no such thing as a bloodless meal there's a study that came out of University of New South Wales in 2011 that showed that you have to kill 25 five times the number of sentient animals to grow one kilo of plant-based protein than one kilo of animal-based protein in larger animals like a cow right so you're killing more animals you're killing the birds the and this is not including insects this is sentient animals so like mammals and and reptiles snakes and birds and and gophers and and deer and and pigs and kangaroo because they have snipers sitting on these Farms that go in these animals trying to eat them like they're shooting these bastards right no one eats those things so that's waste that's a waste right so those animals are dying and nothing's even benefiting from it right and so you know that's not that's not what you want either so you actually have to kill more animals to grow their food also it destroys the environment that's not ethical right because you to grow you know big monocrop you necessarily have to destroy an entire ecosystem and you have to kill all the plants kill all the animals just to grow that one crop and you actually destroy the sign because really you're mining the nutrients out of the out of the ground it's like this just that's what you're doing it's a mining operation you're not putting nutrients back in it's in a wild uh environment there are animals eating the grasses eating the plants defecating and urinating and replacing all of these very vital nutrients to the soil you don't get that in a monocrop you have to dump in all this nasty nasty chemicals and fertilizers petrochemicals and fertilizers which is you know this which is why you get these big corporations and big companies that are pushing and supporting the whole environmental vegan movement because they're profiting from this they're profiting they're making billions selling the petrochemicals that are used in growing these crops right uh that you have to have and to grow these crops because you're mining all the the nutrients out of the soil and you're destroying the soil you're destroying the Earth really because you're losing we lose 27.5 billion tons of top soil every year because of our farming practices and those are better farming practices than they were before 100 years ago during the Dust Bowl when we were losing far more than that in the middle of America which is one of the most one of the most fcked and verdant areas in the world that was that that turned into a dust bowl we lost all this um you know top soil top soil was like you know you know multiple feet deep um during that time now it's just just you know that blew all away and now it's just like this they didn't have any top soil they couldn't grow anything right so that was that was because of farming techniques and then they fixed that and and did scallop patterns like a big row six miles long that the wind can come up and blow that all the way the rain washes down and washes it all away uh but it still does that now the scallop patterns so that's better but it's not perfect and and so we are still losing 27.5 billion tons of top soil per year because of farming that's an area the size of Kentucky every single year that's a limited resource because it takes 500 years to grow a centimeter of top soil okay that's going to go that will be gone you know there there's I heard some people talking about how there's like you know people that study this there's something like only like 50 more growth CES left on earth right the hell is that now you want to you want to increase that you want you want to have you want to force people to uh to reduce that even more we get more growth sus we have to feed seven eight billion people on only plants and we only have 50 growth Cycles left the hell is wrong with you like I mean you you are sprinting towards disaster and you I mean 55% of borneo's rainforest were were bulldozed uh and all the animals killed all the plants destroyed the entire ecosystem demolished to grow palm seed oil right and then and then I've heard vegan say well but you know but you're replacing it with trees yes you bulldo all these trees but then you replace it with more trees so you know same say not same saying not same same at all you destroyed an ecosystem with massive biodiversity in plants and animals you killed all the plant all the animals right those iranit Tans are dead they're not coming back those snakes are dead they're not coming back all of those animals are dead they're not coming back you know and then you have this monocrop which is not a diverse uh ecosystem right and so you're not going to be able to have the abundance of animals living there in this environment and in fact you have animals that come in there start messing with the crop they get shot okay so no not same same uh very very much not same same so you know when you actually look at the ethics of it and the morality and the environmental aspects of it it is far in way uh a better choice to just eat meat you know animals animals return nutrients and and and growth to the to the environment they benefit the environment they're part of the environment corn is not part of the environment corn does not help the environment and the ecosystem and um and you have to kill 25 times the number of animals to get one you know this equivalent amount of protein and that's not even talking about bioavailable protein right because bioavailability is a whole other thing you know if you're talking about bioavailab bioavailable protein probably much more than 25 animals um so this is just not a comparison and unfortunately these very well-meaning people have been thoroughly misled and uh and used uh by Massive corporate powers that are trying to profit off of our um you know profit off of our slavery basically you know keep us sick and po you know controlled and poor and and just turn us back into a vassel state turn us back into you know surom um I mean mil friederick Hayak called this what a hundred years ago close to you know well maybe 80 years ago 70 80 years ago he wrote a book called The Road to surfo they called this out he's like look there are certain countries that that turn into totalitarian you know uh evil regimes uh and 20 years before they turn into that there are very specific steps that they take that lead into this Socialist Communist hellhole right and you read that book and you'll see like holy crap this is like a Playbook they're running off of right and in fact there is a Playbook um what was that dude's name what was his name Saul Alinsky he wrote a book called 12 rules for communist radicals um this is this is what Hillary Clinton wrote her um College dissertation on um and it's not a political statement it's just a statement of fact and and for some reason this is the only one that's not all that's like that's not allowed to be viewed you know anyone's dissertation that published right uh this one's not allowed to be seen and she said that this guy was a brilliant you know all that sort of stuff this guy literally wrote the book on how to tear down a free society and impose a Communist dictatorship with you in charge right there's a there's an actual Playbook and this is this is one of them Healthcare is another part of it too I might add as well so something to think about and people have their their different views on things but that doesn't change the fact that this is part of the Playbook and people can read that they can read the the rules for for Radicals by Saul Alinsky uh and they can read um uh road to surom but this is this is all in the Playbook and um while Alinsky was um telling you how to get it done uh friedrick Hayak was warning you that this was happening and what to watch out for they line up pretty damn well so uh yeah that's what I have to say about about the vegans Jay Hawaii thank you very much for the uh for the Super Chat 18 months carnivore recently added broccoli white rice separately uh experiened major pain in foot and achilles any idea what it is or labs to test uh well you know if if you're getting pain in your foot in your Achilles and when you added in broccoli and rice I would get rid of the broccoli and rice you know when you when you when you add carbohydrates and especially things like seeds and Grains like rice is has a lot of Defense chemicals that can create a lot of inflammation which can increase pain and the carbohydrates increase insulin which suppress ketones and ketones directly suppress um directly suppress the uh the inflammation that that we have so um when you eat rice you're adding inflammation and you're taking away measures to reduce inflammation so that's going to make pain worse so if I have anything like that even if it just sort of slips in and I don't really notice it like my inflammation increases my back hurts like hell for a few days so I would get rid of all that stuff um and um and see how you go um I don't think you necessarily need to test any labs because um you know you really just need to get rid of the broccoli and rice if you get rid of the broccoli and rice and and a couple weeks and that pain doesn't doesn't settle down um you know you might need to go get it checked out I mean if you have an injury that's that's a separate thing I mean you didn't mention an injury here but um people do get injured and so you know get a get a doctor to check that out make sure there's not some sort of you know ligamental injury or or or some sort of damage that you've done to your to your foot and ankle uh Without Really realizing it also medications can affect these things certain antibiotics um increase your risk of having um illes tendon rupture and different sort of tendon ruptures so that's something to think about as well if you're on any sort of medications or or antibiotics recently as well but if it's just the the broccoli and rice you added in and that and then your ankle started to hurt get rid of the broccoli and rice oh goodness there we go Leo Wells thank you very much for the Super Chat recommendations for quitting coffee easily 20y year addiction I drink black coffee worried about withdrawal SYM symptoms yeah so U what I what I think is probably best is to switch to caffeine pills and if you switch to the pills then you can sort of regulate the dosage you're getting you don't get the 150,000 other chemicals that are coming with the coffee that you don't necessarily need or want and probably never did um and you're just getting the caffeine and then you could sort of reduce down the amount because you just take the pill cut it in half take half a pill or you know you sort of wait headaches are usually the main thing with with caffeine withdrawals usually last a few days and that's it they can be pretty bad though uh for some people some people don't have them at all even people that have been been on for a long time and then other people that only had like one cup a day they don't have that one cup and they get a headache it's very it's very strange how it affects people differently like that but see how you go you can just stop and then have the caffeine pill on deck or like a quarter pill or half a pill like 25 milligrams 50 milligrams and uh and if you start getting a bad headache you take that 25 to 50 milligrams and you know and that and that should suppress your headache and get you through that the next day you might get a headache you just do it again but you're taking in a lot less caffeine uh you're basically only taking it when you when you get a headache you just take a small amount and that should significant reduce the amount of caffeine that you're taking in every day and as you go you should need less and less and less and less and less as you become less and less addicted to it so that that's what I would do and you can sort of wean yourself off of that but but you do need to to wean it you know you can't it's not it's not great to start taking the same amount as you as you always were uh Joseph thank you so much for the Super Chat I really appreciate it besides the normal carnivore food what is a way uh to up the intake take of fat are ribe eyes bacon eggs Etc good enough thank you for what you do well first of all thank thank you and you're very welcome um yeah generally ribe eyes bacon and eggs are are great so rib eyes tend to be around 70% calories from fats or about you know a gram of fat for a gram of protein that makes about 70 calories per gram or sorry 70% calories from fat and um bacon can have more of that depending on on the cut of bacon eggs are around 60% for the full thing egg yolks are 80% so if you wanted to increase your fat you could just separate out the yolks and just have the yolks and not the whites that will get you up to two to one grams of fat per protein uh gram of protein um you can also add in butter if you like and um and then yeah it's really just fatty Cuts you know briskets super fatty it's very cheap as well I know people um that have you know like guy who goes by life like Jake I had him on my podcast he he just he just gets brisket and he cuts that up into staks he says they're great something I'll have to try and um and definitely great fat content there so really best to do it with just fat content bacon as long as you're not getting it like sugar cured and all that sort of stuff we fine um you can also do pork bellies and I just when I get pork bellies I just look for the fattiest ones possible and get those and so those are going to have a very high fat content as well and so those are the things you can do and then um uh and then you know adding butter I I add butter to my steaks if I if if they're too lean and that tastes amazing it tastes really good to add that in and and if you tolerate butter then that's then that's a great option as well and cooking eggs in butter you know Maggie cook like dude she has like half a pound to a pound of butter to like 12 or 14 eggs and just you know just slowly sort of stirs them in and mixes them together like in a in a um uh and like scrambled eggs and but the way she does it she's able to it all connects he's not having like a whole bunch of grease in the pan it it all just gets into the eggs it's amazing I don't know how it's it's I've done it once and then the other times it separated too quickly so you have to have it on Lower heat I think um probably try to you know whisk the eggs up first and then add that together with the melted butter and s s it in but have it at lower heat because if it goes in and just starts cooking it'll cook separate to the fat and so you want you want to sort of fold it in together and get the the the eggs mixed in with the liquid butter and uh and sort of stirred in with it so that you can um then it sort of cooks in together and and the butter Cooks in with eggs and it's great if you can do it right uh I've done it once and the other two times did not did not work out as well but I'm still working on it so that's H but yeah those are those are some tips anyway hopefully that helps uh coffee Ma bass thank you for the Super Chat uh no question just thanks uh great calorie chat oh well thank you very much I appreciate that yeah I think it's I think it's important to sort of think about these things a bit differently you know calories that's that's just a unit of measure you know that's that's different you know I mean it's just it's just you're using the wrong units right you know so it's just like you know I mean how how how you know how tall is that building oh 65 miles hour like that doesn't mean anything to me like that's what the for you talking about um different unit wrong unit I don't that doesn't make sense to me um and uh so you know that's how I think about you know calories as well it's just a different unit um and it's not really applicable to to weight you know per se Weezy Dame thank you so much for the Super Chat Leukemia Lymphoma imuno phenotyping just wanting your opinion if you think the carnivore diet would be hey with this condition I I do think it would be I think that if you if you look at the information um and evidence for uh ketogenic metabolic therapy these metabolic approaches to cancer treatment that uh they are very very promising and and in some cases uh you know shown to be extremely good so there I've done an interview with uh Professor Thomas CED of Boston College he's one of who's a major cancer researcher published over 100 50 uh articles and peer-reviewed journals and um very interesting guy wrote a book called cancer as a metabolic disease and and you know when and he describes it you know it makes sense you're like yep that that that fits um he'll be speaking at a virtual conference that everyone can see I put it up on my my Instagram but it's the the cancer Evolution Summit um and that's on September 21st to 26 so that that's actually starting today so um it's uh streaming on demand you can you sure watch it if you go to my if you go to my Instagram Anthony chaffy MD that's it's one of the more recent um posts and I'll also do a story about it with the link but the the link is just cancer revolution. events and if you go to that you can see how to sign up for that you can also do it if you don't want to pay for the whole conference and see all the speakers which I mean this answers this question and then some by watching these guys um you can you can just do for any donation even a dollar I believe uh you can get their docu series which talks a lot about uh this metabolic theapy of cancer and how metabolic therapy such as diet make a big difference um if you do want to do the the the summit and see the summit if you put in code cha20 so c h FF as in Frank e e as in Edwards dou fou 20 to0 uh you get 20% off um and and so that can help as well or you can just watch the the documentary that they made the docu series or you can watch uh these same people give discussions on YouTube for free as well on my channel and others as well so um that's what I I would take a look at but yeah it it I mean I mean just getting down to the warberg effect the warberg effect is that basically cancer cells are much more inefficient at making ATP and energy because they're mitochondria damage and so they require 400 times the amount of glucose as normal cells because of this and so you limit the amount of glucose available you limit amount of energy available to the cell very simple and U and there's other other benefits as well so there were study in 2019 2020 this showed that uh in conjunction with chemo and radiation a ketogenic like a carnivore diet without carbohydrates obviously that this improved uh chemone and radiation efficacy on the cancer cells so it sensitized the cancer cells to the chemo radiation made it work better and it also protected normal cells from the chemo so people did a lot better uh with that um and um and so you know so that that's that's just something to think about as well and and uh but yeah there's a lot of information on that um that goes into much more detail and it's very interesting but yes I do think that that would be helpful um and and I think it would be helpful to watch uh my interview with Professor sea freed seyf R IE D and even check out the cancer Summit uh that's going on now Susan Lydia thank you very much for the Super Chat will you ever interview Jordan and Tammy Pearson oh my God I would love to and I don't think I've made it to their radar yet and I don't I don't know if um I would ever be able to get a hold of them because um you know it's just hard it's hard to get through to people like that when you have so many people trying to get your attention so I don't even know how I would go about that I would love to interview them and and Michaela I mean you know she she has an amazing story and uh and that would be uh you know fantastic to talk to her she's done great great work here and also just you know you know her own podcast which is separate from a corn die she just interviews interesting people about interesting things and so I abely love to have all of them on a podcast at some point and hopefully I can one in the future Kendrick Hawk thank you very much for the Super Chat personal question is your hospital residency okay you seem to have a lot of time for travel and long form podcast lately well you know I've always sort of stuck in uh you know these podcasts whenever I could just basically not slept but no i' I've um spoken about this before but I was taking uh some months off for as like a research term um and so uh so I was and so I could do some of these projects and do some research and write a book that has not finished yet and um and then and then uh you know and and just have a bit more time for all this other stuff I was getting a bit um overrun with all my responsibilities and and having you know different conferences that I wanted to speak at in different parts of the world that just like would not have been able to do so I wanted to take a bit of time off and so I did that but I'm still working six seven days a week it's just in sort of a different capacity so um yeah but uh there's yeah it's a bit of a weird issue because my uh the hospital put me on like a six-month contract so I would have six month off and I could sort of you know still work four or five days a week but I would be um you know wouldn't be the whole seven days a week two four two to four nights a week as well um sort of experience and um Unfortunately they were saying the hospital said that uh you know it's just some of the problems with the public health care system is you're always in a budget crisis and so they said they was like well you know due to budgetary issues we can't can't bring you back and it's just like well I mean have contract they like what are you talking about and they're like well that's you know because it's you know a certain kind of contract we don't we don't actually have to honor it and you know I talked to Laur about that and they're like that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] that's the you know that's not true but you know it was just sort of um yeah I didn't I didn't it was just sort of too much of a pain in the ass to fight it and so uh so basically I have have this year off as sort of like a as a research year but you know I'm still operating doing sort of you know working with a private neurosurgeon Dr Steve Lewis who I mentioned U mostly and um H you know as well as as um you know another another surgeon as well and um sometimes although it's mostly with with Dr Lewis and uh and so we do so just doing their sort of private surgery lists and um helping out with that and then I have my my private Clinic that I'm at all the other day so I'm still basically working six days a week um either doing surgeries or or in the clinic and then I have um and then I have this sort of in the in the free time that I don't have either so like today I don't have clinic today and I don't have uh surgery today other days I will and I'll have to probably do this a bit earlier and leave um a bit earlier as well and not be able to do like the whole threeh hour things that like we we do other times but yeah I appreciate the question appreciate the concern uh it's a bit of a weird situation here in Australia it's not the same as in the states and so uh they can stuff you around a bit a bit more than they can there so uh and then also you know just not having permanent residency you know the work that I've done here in neurosurgery in the last four years hasn't really counted towards anything and that's uh that's annoying you know um and if I had known that coming here I wouldn't have come here I would have stayed in the states and uh and been done you know but uh it's okay you know we live and learn and I I've gotten a lot of great experience met a lot of great people worked with a lot of you know brilliant doctors and surgeons and I can't complain about that and I've gotten a lot of experience and knowledge and um and exposure because of that and uh and so I'm very happy with that and if it turns out that I you know I can't get anything going because the permanent res is just too much of a pain in the ass and um and they're just not giving to me which they have not yet still in that process I might just have to uh figure something else out and you know if I can't finish here I got to finish somewhere so it's uh you I'll I'll you know cross that bridge when I come to it anyway but uh yeah at the moment I'm still working a lot of hours but not as full on crazy ass n hours as I was before which is actually kind of nice uh Super Chat from charlina thank you very much for that no question attached but maybe there's one down the chain here let me take a look really seeing it um Les Kaiser thank you very much for the Super Chat hi from Ohio what state are you from and also I just added lots of seafood to my carnivore diet is that a good thing or not so much uh thanks man you're awesome well thank you appreciate it um no seafood's great um just make sure you're getting enough fat um but yeah no Seafood is great good Omega-3s lot of nice nutrients um it can be quite lean so just make sure you're getting either fatty fish or melting some butter on it tastes better anyway um I grew up in Southern California and then we moved up to Washington State uh just outside of Seattle in Kirkland and then my my family my uh siblings and um my parents are still up there as well and then my extended family is still mostly in California and then I have a cousin over in Chicago as well but you know he we grew up together down in Southern California and he's he's moved to Chicago more recently with his with his wife who is also a doctor and um and so she's uh after I think she did her residency out there so they moved out there and then they they stayed out there and they have a you know uh yeah a good setup there they're doing really uh really well have uh you know really nice kids and and having a nice time over there it's really nice so their house is is really cool it's in the the Edgewater area sort of thing it's really nice area it's close to the you know the lake there in Chicago and um you know the houses look like you know like The Cosby Show sort of looks like the hugable hugable house you know where sort of the outside it's just like it sort of has that feel to it and sort of sort of cool but yeah so I'm from Southern California and Washington that's where I grew up who's your carnivore thank you very much for the Super Chat what version of carnivore do you think is best for weight loss carnivore 6 months 53 recovering type 2 to 245 lbs and still have 70 to lose oh I think it being as strict as possible is the best way to go for health and and weight loss and so just eating meat only drinking water uh so just fatty meat and water and that's it nothing else you know bit of salt to taste that's it um I don't even use salt anymore it's just by taste preference I don't use any and um and uh you know so that that's what I would do just as strict as possible with hormonal issues and uh and and just having you know eaten you know not a great diet for a long time and starving and all these sorts of things and uh people can you know weight loss can be stubborn but you know six months is you know you're doing great hopefully you've had some good results hopefully you've been doing uh getting some good weight loss but you know it takes time you I wasn't um you know dramatically overweight I could still see my six-pack although I was I was fat and I was definitely out of shape um it took me a solid eight months working out working my ass off lifting weights playing rugby and only eating meat and water nothing else uh not even spices or seasonings not even pepper it took me a good eight months before I got down to a stable body fat percentage in weight and so you know it takes time and you know I wasn't I wasn't you know um I didn't have all that far to go I mean I lost a significant amount of weight a significant amount of fat and put on a significant amount of muscle but it takes time you know and so if you know it can take years you know but you should see steady Improvement you should see improvements in your health and your feeling and you should just feel good all the time and so keep doing that don't worry too much about your weight especially for guys because you know if you're working out a lot of guys would say okay I'm going to go and lift weights and all these sorts of things and they say well my weight loss is stallen okay well if you're on a carnivore diet and you're lifting weights you are putting on muscle and so if you're not losing weight then that means that you're losing fat because you're replacing with muscle because you are gaining muscle and so if your weight stays the same that means you've lost somewhere else right so you've lost fat and so just just think about body composition and your health more than just the weight on the scale low carb blow drama thank you very much for the Super Chat excuse me 1/4 of a tablespoon of old black pepper has as much oxalates as 1.5 cups of sliced onions or 22 times um as the same amount of white pepper uh black pepper is a no no for my joints yeah well that's that's very good thank you for for um illustrating that just shows that yeah there's there's quite a lot of of garbage just in black pepper there's seeds seeds of plant seed is the plant's baby that's where they generally have the highest concentration of toxins are in the seeds which is beans nuts legumes um grains all these sorts of things they're all seeds right so that's those are good ones to avoid Daniel Ron or Daniel thank you very much for the super uh Super Chat does carnivore diet help prevent kidney stones well it can prevent you uh in the sense that you're not bringing in things that are going to cause kidney stones like a bunch of oxalates and things like that now people can have oxalate dumping down the road especially they're taking calcium and things like that and they can they can get some Stones later on because of that that oxalate those oxalate dumping and things like that but um yeah you you prevent it because you you stop some of the causes of kidney stones or other causes of kidney stones like bacterial infection and so uh certain bacterial infections can cause massive stagghorn calculi in your in your kidneys um but tons and tons and tons of oxalates can cause big kidney stones as well so uh yes you're you're eliminating out a lot of things that can cause kidney stones also you're improving your immune system so you're less likely to have an infection like that super rare to get that infection anyway but um you just your your immune system is better when you're healthier so uh yes it can it can definitely help that but there are some people that can still get kidney stones down the road from oxalate dumping your body's just storing up all these oxalates in your cells because it's toxic and your body's trying to keep it and sequester it away and then you start unloading these things okay let's get rid of this crap and uh and that can build up and you can get some Stu that way so um drink enough water as well that can dilute that stuff out you're you're dumping all that stuff out too carnivore Cal thank you very much for the Super Chat question I'm lean how to add more muscle P Mass so you need to work out and you need to eat more so you need to lift weights you need to do Anor robic activity uh work hard um 10 to 15 rep range is a good range to preserve your joints and still get a good hypertrophy and um strength and uh you know so just just work out 3 four days a week and uh at least um you do four days a week Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday you have a rest day Wednesday rest over the weekend and then just um and then you need to eat enough and so you keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good try to eat twice a day if you're working out steadily because you you will need more you will need more meat when you're when you're putting on meat right so uh stimulate your muscles to grow give your muscles enough U nutrients and building blocks so that they can grow and that's how you put on weight plant sparing carnivore thank you very much for the Super Chat Ben bigman talks about metet foran undoing the exercise benefit so um it's good or bad um well that's a good question I'm I haven't seen uh Professor bman talk about that I have to look at that study to's see if I can cop Cy that it's not letting me copy it um I'll try I'll try and look that up though um that's interesting though that's uh I hadn't heard that um I I am a firm believer that it's it's best to be off medications right there are some geroprotective features to metformin it definitely helps with insulin resistance you have PCOS or you have diabetes very helpful and there are other benefits I like getting healthy and just being healthy and not having to use any of these things anyway um so for me I don't take Metformin um even though I know other doctors who are very healthy and don't have diabetes you do take Metformin David Sinclair from Harvard takes metformin he thinks that that helps with longevity uh I think that uh living a good clean life and eating what you're supposed to eat and exercising will increase your longevity probably more um but we don't know for certain and uh but that's interesting about the exercise benefits because there are a lot of benefits from exercise and so if you're losing out uh when you when you take metform that's not great either so I'd have to look more into that though but that is very interesting people can uh check that uh link and see and see what they think as well charlina thank you so much for the Super Chat day 23 carnivore got diverticulitis scared to go back to meet you did not get diverticulitis in in um well you didn't get diverticulosis just by being on in 23 days anyway that's something you would have for years and years and years and so um you can get infections you know you can get bit of damage you I I would wonder if you you were eating enough fat because if you're eating enough fat it should be very soft and just slip right through the area that you have diverticula um and not cause a problem if you're not eating enough fat um and you're getting big hard Rocky stools that can be more difficult to pass it can pull and stretch and cause little tears and microabrasions in the D particular which are already weakened and that can introduce bacteria and get a bit of um a bit of infection in there and cause diverticulitis but remember what what do what do surgeons do and recommend you eat when you have diverticulitis you want to rest about low um low residue food so no fiber No Seeds no anything like that that are going to sort of cause more problems right so that's a carnivore diet is perfectly fit that right so you can you can sort of fast for a bit I would get enough enough fat though that's really important and that will keep things soft and smooth and moving so that it doesn't cause ex excess strain to your to your bowel and your colon uh that have di articulate you've had di articulate for years and years and years and years and years uh they don't just show up overnight they take decades to form and so um you know it's uh it's something that youve had for a very long time and and um uh I I think the best way of managing that is is still with a low residue diet no fiber seeds and all these sorts of things that can get stuck in there and cause abrasions and problems and just eating meat and eating fat and I think I think it'll be much better off that way and I I know a lot of people that uh with diverticulosis that have improved uh and and uh on a carnivore diet so I would I would still think that that would be best for so good luck with that Matthew Wang thanks so much for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy hopeall as well do you have to take a zinc uh to Copper balance ratio when tallying 2,000 calories of beef steaks it seems zinc is very high relative to Copper I've never done that um if you want to if you're concerned about that then by all means do um there is copper in beef liver quite a lot of copper eat too much you get too much but um if you're worried about about that you can certainly check your ratios I mean I think that a lot of these nutrients that we're getting you know according to the RDA oh this is out of balance and that's out of balance you're not getting enough of this you're not getting enough of that but we know that that's not true because we get everything we need and and we're perfectly fine oh there's not enough calcium and all these sort of things and yet everyone's calcium is fine and I've seen people improve their bone density in late or middle age um you know which which is not supposed to happen you know we're told that you can't deposit more bone density after 25 well that's not true and and you're doing it on a on a low calcium diet just eating muscle meat and and yet people are putting on bone density most of bone is is collagen anyway and it gets mineralized right and so uh that's part of that but you know these ratios and how much you're supposed to get in proportion to other things you know those are those are figured out and written for people eating a you know a mix diet with a bunch of with a bunch of you know plant chemicals and things like that that disrupt and bind different nutrients that allow that that make it so you can't absorb these things as as well right and so you know that can that can be different as well so you can definitely get your your ratio check and get your numbers checked I mean you people say there's not enough zinc or magnesium or all these sorts of things you know meat and yet my number are all in optimal ranges and that's what I see in my patients as well so I think it's a bit different for us but you can certainly check it and if you think you need a bit more Co copper you can add in a bit of beef liver a lot of other good things in beef liver as well just don't get too much um that can cause a problem as well you can get a buildup of a copper you build up of fat soluble vitamins like vitamin A so having it you know a couple times small amount couple times a week perfectly fine uh Stephen uh cusi sorry about that but you your name but thank you very much for the $50 sh chat it's very generous of you began meat and fruit 3.5 weeks ago uh when I stopped drinking good job well very well done that's a big big big big step um I was a daily Drinker I am not on medications I don't drink caffeine I exercise five days a week consuming 70% fat less than 5% carbs I can't break two to four hours of sleep any advice uh diet issues or lifestyle change well you know having having been addicted to to alcohol for a long time and being a daily Drinker that can absolutely affect our sleep and you become dependent on them just like you're depend people can become dependent on benzo diazines for sleep and it can be very difficult to get to sleep afterwards without them so it's very commendable it's very impressive that you were able to drop all that uh after you know after using that daily for for a long time that's really really great um it can take time you know for your body to sort of readjust and and get sleep you can try melatonin you try all the different sorts of things you know turning off the lights you know using a sleep mask optimizing your your sleep routine um yeah you know 5 to 10 milligrams of of melatonin uh if it's over the counter where you guys are or speak to your doctor um if it's not to get a prescription or and you or talk to your doctor if there's any sort of contraindications generally not melatonin is usually pretty safe and it can help help you sleeping help regulate your sleep cycle again um and yeah and then just just allowing your your your body and your brain to sort of recover and get used to sleeping without uh you know without the you know depressants like like alcohol and uh you know which is barbituate and and um um or you know different benzos people have real hard time sleeping when they they're coming up then or that as a beans and it can be similar with alcohol as well but it gets better so just keep going with it optimize all the things you can optimize you know just eat just I mean if you're consuming less than 5% carbs if you can just get off of those completely see if that helps just going just just fatty meat try eating later in the day if you eat a big fatty meal big fatty steak that often puts people into rest and digest mode you know moves blood over to the to the intestines so it's less available for your brain um and you become tired you become lethargic so I think it's it's pretty natural big meal uh to eat a big fatty meal right before I go to bed uh because it just naturally puts me into a a calm sleepy lethargic State and I just pass out you can try those blue blocking glasses those help like I I had those on last night had had a meal and was in bed sort of replying to some messages in in the carnivore group I'm in and I I passed out just you know answering a couple messages it was just like it it works like it really helps so you can try that and um and and hopefully you know with the little sort of adjustments and given some time that you'll come out of that and I I expect that you will I expect that you know in the coming sort of weeks or months which you know doesn't sound great to that be you know weeks or months but uh in time I think that your your body will will adjust back to a normal sleep cycle without this chemical dependency and I would I would not use any sort of chemicals apart from like melatonin and optimizing your sleep and just eating meat to to help with this because it's not a great great thing to be addicted to these substances to help you sleep because you have to have them when you sleep it's not it's not it's not great and so that's what I would do and good luck with that um that's a bit of bit of a pain if you need to take a nap during the day take a nap whatever just just you know get your body used to being asleep again you know some people will say you know you don't want to take a nap during the day because you don't want to you know then you it's harder to get to sleep at night um at some point sure but uh you know you still need sleep and your your your brain and your body needs sleep and if you're dealing with this and you can't sleep more than a couple hours at a time sleeping more often during the day than that if that's what you need to do that's what you need to do and but it doesn't necessarily have to be a long-term thing uh John uh teras thank you very much for the super chat um there's no question available with that um but here's here's a comment later down so from John say I started carnivore after seeing you on 60 Minutes uh well that's good at least that at least that was good for something dropped 8 kilos and feel great awesome awesome good to hear it uh glad to hear it I have I have coffee with sweetener and sugar-free drinks what are the downsides of sweeteners if I'm not feeling any well the thing is is that you know you didn't necessarily feel any downsides to what the way you were eating before and then you tried something different and you said wow I feel better now so that's where the contrast is and so just a simple experiment you can try dropping those for a few weeks 30 days is a good is a good length of time uh to run a proper test and you just you just drop the the sweeteners and even the coffee or at least the sweeteners and sugar-free drinks if you want to keep the coffee and and then just see just drop them for 30 days and and you'll see you'll see a difference it can affect your insulin it can affect your blood sugar it um and it affects you in other way so like just Stevia my brother sent uh sent me a study uh last year about Stevia in mice and they you know so preclinical animal trial you know not humans who knows how this affects us but interesting nonetheless that they gave these mice an equivalent of just one can of you know sugar-free soda uh with stevia in it a day just one soda a day right one diet soda a day and the fertility rate dropped from 100% in the control group down to 45% in the stevia group so it dropped 55% right massive difference so what the hell is that doing to you what the hell is that doing to your hormones what the hell is that doing to your body so this is just you know these things have these things are chemicals you know they're not food you know and and just because they don't have carbohydrates that doesn't mean that they don't have chemical interactions in your body or hormonal reactions in your body so that that that's something I would be very mindful of um and so just try it you know just like you tried carnivore and you and you found good results you can try just dropping these and see what your results are and if you you go 30 days you go don't really feel a difference try and back in don't really care fine you know that that's totally your prerogative but uh I bet that you'll feel different a lot of people do a lot of people find that they're actually quite addictive these artificial sweeteners and that they're actually more difficult to drop than than sugar at least a couple people have told me that and so you know that that that's a bit concerning you know that they're they're giving you that sort of response I mean that's not that's not that's not that's not what you want you don't want something in your body that's going to give you a reaction like that if something is really fighting you to not stop taking it definitely want to stop taking it in my opinion so uh that's what I would do just give it a try and see how you go I I bet you'll feel better uh Slater bets thank you very much for the the $50 super chats very very generous of you uh there wasn't a a question attached maybe there's one down the chain here I will look for it um there we go and another there we go so so SL well thank you again for uh both super chats hi Dr chaffy grateful for what you do been carnivore six months now got blood work done and everything looks great except fate was 3.8 doctor was very concerned should I be should I supplement well it look there are some people that that don't process Folly properly uh they have the or they can even have the MTHFR gene mutation which means that they don't really process F and even B12 properly and um that might be you and if it's not you you just you may be just a a hypo metabolizer as well um so what you do here is is if you feel good great you know generally don't need to do much if you're if you're feeling good um but I think it's it is probably good to sort of keep that in a in a in a decent reference range until we know more about it because reference ranges for for us are probably different than other people U because these were figured out for people that were on a a mixed diet so may not be a problem however folate being what it is it can cause serious issues if you have being too low especially in pregnancy so especially anyone who's thinking about getting pregnant or could get pregnant um or trying to get pregnant or is pregnant don't mess around with your folate because you can get neurot tube defects and spinabifida and things like that that lifelong right so uh keep your folate up liver has plenty of folate and so if you're not getting the getting everything done with the the skeletal muscle meat and fat that you're eating then uh just add in some add in some liver either chicken liver beef liver yeah sheep liver pig liver whatever odd liver um all of that is fine just add that in a couple times a week so maybe two three times a week see how you go get it checked again in six to eight weeks and that that should be much better um and um yeah so so if you need do that just just yeah just add in a bit and that should be fine if you think about it you know we we are designed to eat wild animals that have been eating what they are designed to eat and or healthy as they can be we didn't pick off the stragglers we went for the alphas we went for the biggest strongest fattest bastards right because those are the ones that had the most fat the most nutrients so that's when we want we were apex predators but it wasn't like like a lion that's an apex predator that's going for the stragglers and the older ones and the younger ones on that they can get you know may not be able to chase down you know a prime you know cow or buck that's that's just in the prime of its life may not be able to get that we can you know we have distance weapons and tools that allowed us to take down the best ones that we want we went for the Trophy Bucks that were like the best examples of their species and so we're getting very healthy meat right and so that has a a different complement of nutrients so you can look at this with regeneratively raised grass-fed and finished cows they have four to five times the number the amount of of these different nutrients sometimes a lot more um what's the man's name I always forget this guy's name anyway he's a major um uh regenerative farmer in in America he's been on a number of podcasts very interesting guy and he's talked about like his chicken like normal chickens normal USDA says that you know chickens have about or chicken eggs have like 41 milligrams of folate specifically right but his regeneratively raised chickens the eggs that they produce have over a thousand milligrams of folate so where you get your meat and eggs makes a difference and so if we're just getting you know Safeway um you know uh beef and and chicken and eggs and everything like that they're not going to be as nutrient dense as they could possibly be and so you might need to add in a bit of liver I think the basically the only supplement any carnivore needs is just to eat liver and you don't need to get liver supplements just eat some damn liver uh figure out a way to cook it make some Pate or just sear it that's what I do just sear the outside or actually that's what what Maggie did and she just seared it so just this is like seared AI you just sear the outside you leave the inside raw tastes so much better and um so I had some liver the other day I think that's probably I've been counting it's like the seventh time I've had liver in the last decade but you know uh that's because I I checked my folate my fate was fine my B12 is fine so I'm not one of these guys that that needs a bit more but there is a lot more FID in liver so having liver every now and then is a good idea and I think it is a good idea to check your fola right because you don't know if you're if you're one of these people that can't process full a um as well as others unless you check I mean if you have a problem and you don't feel well you know then you can check too but you know just checking early on before there is a problem is a good idea too so I think folate as far as blood tests are concerned is one that that that we should check for carnivores like B12 and F just make sure you're in good good ranges and if you're not or or you're sort of on the lower end of that Spectrum add in liver a couple times a week good idea but also make sure you're not having too much because you don't want to get an abundance of copper and and uh vitamin A and things like that Sharon rents thank you so much for the Super Chat I've been carnivore for four weeks suffer from rheumatoid arthritis how can I stop feeling fatigue I eat once a day um one cup of bone broth water coffee with cream is there a doctor with your mindset in Adelaide uh there might be so if you go to the low carb Downunder website um just low carb down under.com DOI process possibly but you just Google it you you'll find it pretty easily um they have a list of of of clinicians practitioners dietitians doctors that uh that that have personally signed up for that so that they can be part of this sort of low carb um Network and uh and whether they're carnivore or keto you know it's uh you know that that's fine at least they they'll they'll understand the Core Concepts that meat's not bad Fat's not bad it's not a heart disease risk and and there are benefits from changing the way you eat and um and a lot of uh keto practitioners are uh understanding or at least coming around to the idea that um that that cornivore can be very very helpful as well and maybe even you know um better than than just normal keto for a lot of people um I think it pretty much for everybody because you're getting rid of different plant toxins and things like that but um but yeah so so more and more people are coming around uh to that so I would go toal carb down on website and and look I'm sure there are doctors in in Adelaide that on that list um uh as far as your rumar arthritis you know hopefully that gets better I mean that that generally does you want to be on red meat and water for best results stay away from uh Dairy and eggs and pork and chicken you you will do best on red meat and water with a bit of salt I would stay away from seasonings as well anyone with an autoimmune issue you need to be very very uh it's close to red meat and water and nothing else is possible and and for best results um as far as fatigue that can take some time I do I do have a video so I had that in that playlist getting started on a carnivore diet uh there's that frequently ass questions um video that I did you know the fa carnivore FAQs I I address fatigue in that so can be that you're eating during the day you're going to get lethargic after you eat so you want to eat later on towards the night um it could could be that you're not drinking enough water could be that you're you're not addressing your sleep schedule and that you're not optimizing your sleep um it could be that you're still optimizing your body's utilization of ketones uh which can take uh you know it's usually people are feeling better around where you're at but it can take uh you know months to really optimize and become really really Adept at utilizing keton so there are a lot of different things and there are a couple others uh but check out that that q that FAQ thing because there's just just sort of a list of things that you can address and um and and look at that could potentially be um part of the issue uh Joe or cury thank you so much for the $100 Super Chat that's was very generous of you hi Anthony I'm 5' 11 155 pounds 78 7 57 years old Jesus Christ I'm so dyslexic um I'm getting on it on average 50 grams of protein per meal three times a day per meal three times a day so 150 total now breakfast is three eggs 100 grams of lean ground beef with lots of butter whey protein Greek yogurt for lunch and a ribey or strip loin for supper uh suggestions well I mean that all sounds great you know but it's um it's not necessarily about you know the the numbers and exactly how much you're getting but is that enough for you is that is that what your body's asking you for so if you're if you're eating and you're getting to the point that that uh you finish the meal and it just tastes good if it always tastes good that could mean that you you're not eating enough and so you want at least for your last meal of the day like your ribeye strip loin meal if you finish that and it's good the last bite you need to make another steak right you want to Endeavor to have leftovers especially in your last meal if you're doing it during the day and you and you really stuff yourself to capacity it can it can you know make you lethargic and sort of tired during the day which you know isn't isn't all that great you know if have if you have things to do and you can't just take a nap in the Sun or something oh it sounds great s on a hammock or something like that so if you can do that do that if you can't do that then uh you know eat eat whatever you need to during the day to take take the edge off and at night eat until fatty meat stops tasting good and you want to Endeavor to have leftovers so you want to make more than you think you're going to want so that you completely satisfy your B's desire and request for nutrients and if you get to that you will find that you're less hungry the next day as well you may not want breakfast you may not need lunch and you just have these big massive amounts of steak at night and that and that's enough for you so um and so that's the thing too you don't mention if you need uh if you're trying to gain weight or lose weight or anything like that but um just in general you you just want to eat as much as your body actually wants so you don't need to think about how many grams per kilo or anything like that just eat as much fatty meat as tastes good to you and keep eating until it stops tasting good that for most people will be exactly right because you there's no equation complex enough to to calculate exactly all the different chemical reactions and and things are happening in our body um way too complex but the good news is that it it doesn't matter because our body does it for us and so you know if you if you are eating what you're supposed to eat you can you can listen to your body's signals and that's a major one so meat will taste good if your body wants it it will stop tasting good once your body is is done with it so I would just make sure that you're getting to that point and uh just just keep doing what you're doing just eat fatty meat and water and and just make sure you're getting enough and exercise if uh if you can because that's really good for you as well and that can stimulate more hunger and you need to eat more food with it and I think you'll do really well so good luck with that jar uh here and far thank you so much for the Super Chat what sauces can I use to change things up to add some spice I love good buffalo sauce um am I breaking the rules well look any you buffal buffalo sauce has you know you know capsicums Peppers you know hot peppers and they have that's a night shade and they have a lot of Defense chemicals so it's not great um as far as sauces go uh but if that's what you need to sort of get you of and running and used to just eating eating meat then great you know I mean you're you're at least you're cutting out all the other things and you're and you are uh you're eating a lot more meat which is good uh I think of it sort of as a as a bridging uh method you know that you can you can sort of get where you're used to eating meat and then you try with a bit less and a bit less and a bit less and then just go off of it and see how you feel you will feel better and um and uh but you know other sauces you can make carnivore sauces you can make you know cream sauce alfredo sauce you know with with just don't use all the spices and herbs and all that sort of stuff or use uh very little um you can make like oice you know like the like the you know juice from a roast and you make that you know dip that you know meat in there um that's great you can make gravies as long as you don't use a bunch of flour or anything like that so try and thicken it with other other uh things and um and uh yeah so uh there there yeah there are other sauces as well um and if you're going to use sauces just try to avoid ones with sugar in it you know there're a lot of like barbecue sauce and things like that just have a ton of sugar and so that that's really I I would definitely avoid things with sugar just because it you know it's added sugar is really bad and and it kicks you out of a of a of a good metabolic state that you want to be in and start screwing with your insulin and hormones in other ways as well so I would definitely do that but if you need a bit of s and you know other sauces use a lot of seed oil so like ranch dressing or mayonnaise all these sorts of things not what you want um and you can use sour cream or yogurt those are great especially with meat you put some yogurt or sour cream on meat you eat those together that that actually really tastes very good and um so maybe try try some of those options as well Stephen why thank you so much um is it all right to eat 20% mints beef and eggs every day yeah absolutely as long as it's enough fat for you sorry something weird happened with my mic um uh 20% be um beef mints and eggs uh is is probably a bit um probably a bit uh lean you know but if that's enough meat for you if you're not getting constipated you're not drinking coffee or anything like that that can mask constipation then um then that's fine but you know you might need a bit more fat than that you might need you know a bit a higher percentage of fat in your beef mints or adding butter or um egg yolks instead of the whole eggs but uh no ground beef and eggs every day is perfectly fine as long as you're getting enough fat mad Zumo thank you for the Super Chat what do vegetables have exact uh what do vegetables have exactly to say they have carcinogens WebMD says spinach has natural dietary nitrate I'm so confused was popey wrong uh Popeye was wrong Popeye was a was a marketing gimmick um and was not sorry don't know what's going on with my but it keeps saying it gets unplugged but anyway yeah no so poey was was a marketing gimmick um so yeah no spish does not make you strong um and uh there are there are a number of different chemicals I mean that's the problem is that is that plants make like a million different chemicals and most of those are to harm you are to stop animals from eating them and so they can be directly toxic they can be directly harmful and and uh and slow buildup you people say like oh gush well you know doesn't kill me right away and blah blah blah cigarettes don't kill you right away either Nei that is alcohol cocaine meth or heroin right that doesn't mean that they're that they're good for you and it doesn't mean that they are I'm sure heroin has some vitamins in it I mean like who gives a [\u00a0__\u00a0] you know it's like that's not the point you know there's uh there are harmful things in there and they can build up over time and cause problems over time and some of those problems can lead to disruption and damage to the mitochondria disruption I mean think about it this way cyanide damages um the electron trans transfer chain in your mitochondria when you're when you're making ATP this is what can kill you and stop your mitochondria from making ATP at all and your tissue doesn't get any energy and your all your cells and tissue and brain die right long before you die this is damaging your mitochondria and this has been shown by Professor C Reed and Nobel Prize winner uto warberg that when you damage the mitochondria and you damage that um the mechanism for making ATP you can develop metabolic issues and cancer and so things like cyanide built up over time at low doses you can just chronically damage your your mitochondria chronically damage your metabolism and build up and increase your chances of getting cancer right so excuse me so there are really thousands of these things that could potentially be cancerous or carcinogens um were they called cancer in everyone no of course not uh will they um you know you know how much is cancer is how much is a risk it's hard to say you know because we don't have we don't have good studies on these sorts of things we don't really know you know how carcinogenic cigarettes are you know and what kind of cigarettes are they cigarettes that uh were naturally cured or uh flu dried and and uh and chemically cured because you know there there was a study I saw in high school or my dad dad showed me in high school that that had uh mice that were predisposed to getting cancer and they're exposed to normal cigarette smoke they all got cancer and empyema and all that sort of stuff stuff and then then they had uh tobacco that was naturally cured like the way that we would have done it for centuries you know before the modern era um and they got all the empyema and and and atherosclerosis and things like that they did not get the cancer right so interesting you know so it's not necessarily smoking that's causing cancer it might be that there are these bloody chemicals that they're adding during the curing process that are that are causing cancer so it's um you don't have perfect answer for these sorts of things however this is recognized in botany and animal husbandry and veterinary medicine you know certain animals you know you're eating certain things that can cause cancer that can cause disease um The Who recognizes that foods that we eat can be harmful dangerous deadly mutagenic or carcinogenic that is on the w website they say this not me who says this and so you know it's um you know there there can be a lot of these different chemicals there are literally a nearly a million different chemicals that they use as defense and so you know and that's just the thing these plants are defending themselves you know and some of that defense can be directly toxic and just kill you it can make it so you don't absorb nutrients properly it can make it so that it disrupts your hormones in other ways you can't reproduce you can't make more little monsters that are going to come eat that plant because that's that what they consider you they consider you a monster that is trying to eat them alive and eat their children alive that's I mean they don't have brains to conceptualize these things like that but you know in in the grand scheme of things that's what they consider animals or monsters that are trying to eat them and kill them right so they're going to protect themselves and and if that means stopping those monsters from having more little monsters more is the better right and some of these things can cause damage and disruption to your biochemistry and biology and mitochondria and and down the road uh predispose you and precipitate cancer and so that's that's you know uh it's a bit funny to think about but uh you know they do have these things that damage your body in that way and uh could result in cancer um and and that was another thing too was that you know that was that was why I first came to this was when I was taking cancer biology 20 some years ago ago uh 22 23 years ago uh was because just flatouts showed us all the different numbers of carcinogens in plants and vegetables and fruits and things like that that we were eating uh they didn't name each one but they just gave the number you know 136 Justin brussel sprouts over 100 in mushrooms 60 80 100 in all the other uh fruit and produce items that you'd ever eat and so you know that was very shocking for us and that's why I stopped eating plants I was just like nope not doing this anymore not putting any of that crap in my body and so you know it's um it's uh it's out there but you know it's hard to track down because but look in botany books and horiculture books that's where you'll find this stuff animal husbandry books you know livestock medicine that sort of stuff that's where you'll find this stuff in the who back to ethics delusion uh first who knows what that means yeah second uh how is it ecal to abuse your body by not feeding its biologically appropriate nutrition absolutely true self-abuse is just not uh just as unethical uh thank you Dr Javy I fully agree with that and how ethical is it and how moral is it to uh to do that subject that to your kids and subject your kids to that and improper nutrition so they don't develop properly so they they grow up a foot the stunt uh stunt their growth and they're a foot shorter than they should be they're 50 lounds lighter they're sickly they're their whole life they get chronic diseases and illnesses they die young their brains don't develop they get autism and Alzheimer's when they're older and you know like and and they just and they just die sickly and young that's not ethical that's not moral it's bloody evil and forcing that on other people is is is damn criminal and absolutely evil I mean that I mean you're talking about Nazi level Evil at that point Nazis said that we need to do this for the for the greater good the good of the world Stalin said that as well lennin said that as well we got to you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet so we just have to kill you know few dozen million people uh in order to bring about a perfect Society for everyone else well you know your kids are going to die your Elder is going to suffer you're going to be sick but this is the best thing to do the hell it is you know if you're causing that much you know widespread you know rank destruction it's clearly not the right thing to do it's clearly evil and you are clearly on the wrong side of this and you are being diluted you're being conned into thinking something that is good for the planet and Humanity when in fact it is pure and utter evil and um you just need to fight against that tooth and nail don't let any of these people tell you that your child should suffer and and um and not be allowed to develop properly uh because of their preconceived notions that are dead ass wrong in the first place don't let anybody tell you that and don't let anybody say that you should suffer and you should be sick and your parents should get dementia and get heart disease and be frail and go to nursing homes and die decades before they should so that you don't have them in your life so that your kids don't have them in their lives and um that's evil you know losing out on Decades of time with your parents is evil I mean I you my grandparents should still be here I never met my father's parents because of horrible information like this and that's I'm never going to get that back you know I'm I've I'm never ever going to be able to have a relationship with them they were dead before I was born my grandparents on my mother's side was very close with both of them but I did not get nearly as much time as I should have and and I would have loved to have and they died in their 90s well that's that's a really good age they died 25 years young you know they should have made it to 120 they should be here right now and and they're not so how the hell is that ethical um it's not and so I think it's I think it's I think it's delusional and I think it's uh evil to push this on other people you want to do that yourself you go ahead that's fine but that's your choice you don't get to do that to other people you do not and if you try to do that you are in line with the Nazis and that's what they did right and we saw what happened in the nurg trials you know no one thinks that that's an okay thing to do and so you need to get your head straight if you if you are in that way of thinking Pacific Northwest Health Journey thank you so much for the Super Chat four weeks ago I ad Harry popped out with anal fures um okay I I had suppositories no more hairy h e r r y I don't actually know what you're meaning by that but still Burns uh to go number two would you recommend to fast for three days or should I get some ointment uh from the doctor well certainly get some ointment um so so I there just fissures and this can happen with uh you know bad constipation so you know if you're getting this you should um uh you you should you should definitely uh eat more fat you know it should be soft and smooth and easy to pass you should not have difficulty passing and you won't if you eat enough fat and people are well already eating so much fat yeah well look we we all are are shocked by the amount of fat that you actually have to eat because it's so much more than than we've ever eaten before because we've really avoided it like the plague but you need it and so if you are constipated then by definition you are not eating enough fat and so eat enough fat if you eat enough fat eventually your body will not be able to absorb it it will go out and it your stools will be soft or even loose so that's what I would do you could fast and give you you give your body a chance to heal but if you're eating enough fat it should be soft and be easier to pass you know you can fast for a couple days you'll still have things in the pipeline but yeah that'll sort of delay things and and things out and you can just sort of um you know fasting for a couple days is is fairly safe unless you're very emaciated so if you are then don't um but uh should be okay if you feel that that's that's what you need most people don't go more than a couple times a week anyway um and when they do it should be soft so if you decide to fast I I don't think there's anything wrong with that I do think you should go get some some cream or antibiotic cream or or whatever you don't necessarily need it from the doctor it could be um if it's if it's like like infected you think then you need to go to the doctor if it's just a normal fissure um and you can just use some cream from the from the pharmacist probably okay if you find it if you if you think you're having more problems than that then definitely get it checked out by a doctor um especially if you think it's infected or if you're getting fevers or anything crazy like that then definitely go to a doctor and um otherwise yeah you could just rest for a couple days fast for a couple days and um and then when you get back to eating meat eat a lot of fat so that everything's soft and just comes out and doesn't cause any any sort of Tears uh in in when you're when you're going number two and good luck with that Colin Holmes thank you very much for the Super Chat hi doc what is your take on Ted n's philosophy on diet his main premise seems to be as long as you eat enough protein it's hard to overeat um so I haven't I haven't gone too far into his philosophy I don't I don't know his that he argues for but just going off of what you've said here on eating enough protein it's hard to overeat uh that's true look your body your body um your body goes after nutrients it doesn't go after calories again calories are sort of a fiction that we need to get rid of but it's um so your body wants protein it want but it also wants fat too right so eating protein and fat together so a fatty meat uh you're going to get very satiated because your body's going to get the macronutrients it wants like the protein and the fat which it needs and it wants and it's very satiating um but there are nutrients that come with those as well and so the fat soluble and water soluble vitamins and minerals that come with the fat and lean U that's that's all you need so your body sees this it sees getting the nutrients sees you're getting um protein and fat you have you have receptors in your stomach and your and your brain already knows like what's coming up down the pipe line it's not just saying oh there's bulk here so that should be fine no it it tracks it sees you have getting a lot of fat you're getting a lot of protein you're getting these nutrients it says yep okay that's good we're done now so yes it is very satiating I would I would say you need to get enough fat as well protein is very satiating but that's because your body wants a certain amount of protein but that's not all of it that's not all it wants it wants fat as well and so combination of protein and fat together you will be completely satiated uh in that in that regard I don't think you can just do it completely lean protein I don't think you would want to anyway if you get a majority of calories from from protein it's uh that can actually be not good for you so you you still need to get fat f is an essential nutrient it is not uh it is not just a an energy source it is an essential nutrient so um just going off what you're telling me there protein is very satiating uh you need the fat too so the combination of fat and protein is per satiation mechanism uh Tyler v v sorry if I butchered your name I'm sure I did H thank you for the Super Chat check rothbard's man economy and State uh mice's Human Action Amos Bitcoin standard and Fiat standard uh breed love sound money and uh digital age and lay money so I'm not sure what those are um but I don't know if that was referenced to to something else or just an ad I don't know um but I'm not I'm not really familiar with any of those those sorts of things um but uh yeah thank you for the Super Chat anyway um and so it's from from Tyler again talk about ivy league in family related to chaffy college I'm not sure um most of my family's gone to Ivy League um and I was specifically told we were all told specifically my siblings and I that you were not allowed to go to Ivy League uh schools because they're all indoctrination camps like political indoctrination camps which I thought was pretty silly but um we were yeah we were just told we we we weren't to go there we weren't told where we should go or helped at all uh so that was very confusing but um you know ended up being sort of a moot point for me because I I ended up going early and so I just just went you know locally but um uh but yeah like my my grandparents uh met at Harvard and my grandfather was um you did his ivy league sort of all the way um I think went to he went to Cornell and then um did a he was a road scholar at Oxford and then had to leave because he was in Germany when World War II broke out and had to like flee across Europe to get the hell away from there and and then they sent all the road Scholars back from Oxford he went back to America did a masters at Harvard was teaching there met my grandmother who was in her undergrad there and then uh ended up fighting in the war and in EN counter Espionage it was actually pretty cool he was the first American spy to ever turn and work an enemy agent against the enemy enemy power literally wrote like press dossier and books on it it's called operation Drago man it's been since um released to the public and Declassified 50 years after after it was put in and um and so yeah so he have very interesting and amazing Stories he's he's one of the most heavily decorated uh American soldiers from the French government because he he posed as a Frenchman in France spoke fluent French and uh and then was working counter asage and figure out who were the German spies and and turning them and converting them against Hitler and uh yeah some pretty cool stuff and then then went back and did his PhD at at Oxford and then taught at Pomona College and then George Washington University at um in in uh DC lived there for the last a few Decades of his life and um yeah my my yeah dad went to Pomona and Berkeley my mom went to Berkeley um uncles went to Stanford and a lot of my Uncle cousins went Harvard and and my great-grandfather was the still to date as long as far as I know the youngest ever graduate from Columbia Medical School he was 20 years old and that was in the 1890s you know back when it was a six-year program so he started early started when he was 16 he finished a six-year program in four years so he's bit of a badass really and um and so yeah so we sort of have that that background U but then like we weren't allowed to go which I think is silly you you know um I I I think I'm I'm you know pigheaded enough and and strong willed enough to sort of push again back against those sorts of things and you know and and while you know Harvard and those sorts of places aren't necessarily the best education in the world you know they it does open some doors you know as Thomas Sol said one of the best things about having a a Harvard degree is that you never have to you know care about what another Harvard person says again you just never have to just be intimidated just like yeah I don't care um and that was it he wasn't really impressed with Harvard uh my family wasn't really impressed with Harvard uh you know the ones who went there and and the ones who didn't go there didn't go there because they weren't very impressed with it um and and I I've noticed this as well you know um my grandparents talked about this Thomas Soul talks about this and I've have uh I have a friend of mine in Ireland my my roommate in medical school and worked with some some guys who graduated from Harvard more recently and ended up marrying one of them uh but there's there's a big attitude there that just because you went to Harvard you're right about everything and there's that that Harvard says this is from Harvard this is it it comes from Harvard this is right and so she was deal dealing with these people and they were saying they're like like talking about just some you know usage of the English language and she was saying well no that's actually incorrect it goes like this and the guy just said uh yes it is right uh I went to Harvard so that was his argument it wasn't like well you know yes I'm correct and here's why here's the base here's the root here's the origins or whatever it was I went to to Harvard it's right um and and she schooled him because he actually knows the well actually it's a Latin base it goes by this and this is the addiction this is the usage this is this this is the origin and just actually just ran him down the plank and he was just like oh you know but there's that attitude that because you went to Harvard it has to be right and you have to be right and that was something my my grandparents described that was something that Thomas so described as well whereas when um so went to Chicago it was just like no you know because he went to hard for his undergrad Columbia for um his Masters and then he transfer he a really PhD program but he finished his Masters and transferred to Chicago because he wanted to study with George Stigler and um and the Milton Freeman and friedrick Hayak were there as well and and so that's who he studied with and uh so he got his PhD from from colum from uh Chicago University of Chicago which is absolutely top tier and um and actually that's where my grandmother went for undergrad then transferred to Harvard and she thought that Chicago was far far better and um and uh so will did as well and he said that you know in Chicago Harvard is just like well this is Harvard so it's right whereas in h Chicago they they taught you why and how to think not just you know uh so was very different sort of setup and um yeah so said that he never went back to uh Harvard for any you know uh um alumni things or whatever he even taught at Amherst which is not all that far away and he never once went back like just had no interest um so yeah it's a bit weird but um you know I I you know you can certainly get as good or better education elsewhere but you know it's uh it's still a fantastic school and um at least it was 20 years ago when I was going there when I would have been going there 25 years ago and um and it opens doors you you s of have that you know people assume that whatever University you went to was the best one that you could possibly get into because that's what most people do and so if you didn't go to Harvard because you couldn't get to go into Harvard and um it doesn't matter you you you talk to you know if you showed that you could have they say yeah well if you could have you would have you know and and that's uh you know it's a it's a safe assumption for most people because it applies to most people but not everybody um but yeah it's uh interesting anyway Elaine thank you very much for the Super Chat no question there but may there's one down here yeah there we go so Elaine s says I have pernicious anemia and missing the intrinsic factor eating carnivore will this cure me um well it can certainly help with autoimmune issues but if you if you predic this anemia you can get antibodies towards that part of your your stomach and it can kill areas that make it intrinsic factor intrinsic factor has to be released and then binds to B12 so you can absorb it and if you don't have intrinsic factor you it doesn't matter how much B12 is coming into your into your body uh through your food you're not going to absorb it so this can absolutely reduce your um Auto auto antibody load and your autoimmune issue and if those cells are not completely dead they can recover if they're too far gone if they're if they're damaged to the point of no return and no unfortunately and in the meantime you need to take um B12 shots maybe sublingual you know under the tong but the shots are generally better what we use are is called methyl cobalamin and that's more bioactive in in the body as opposed to cyanocobalamin you which is attached to cyanide molecule or um it hydroxy cobalamin there's a few but the ones we use and U um seem to be the best or or is methyl cabalin and so if you can get that then then I would would do it I would do it that way um let me see here find some of the next questions goodness where the hell there we go so D's thank you for the Super Chat is it okay to take apple cider vinegar on Carnivore for GI health I mean you could um I don't think you need it um you know but if you if you find it's benefiting you early on or whatever then you know you can go for it I would try uh a period without it you know try for 30 days and see if you if you even need it is it helping you or is it making you feel a bit worse um your stomach acid should be way more acidic than apple cider vinegar is ever going to be and so you'll get great digestion if you're having digestion issues or you think you are uh just don't drink water uh for a couple hours before uh and an hour after you eat a meal and then your stomach acid will get very concentrated and and very uh you know the pH will go very low and so you shouldn't shouldn't have any problems uh with with digestion after that uh but you can play around with it you know self- experimentation is great I don't find that that sort of thing helps me I don't feel that I need it and I feel much better without any of that sort of stuff but you can do a self- experiment see how you go and uh try it for 30 days uh on and off and and see the difference and go from there Lori pal Mary thank you very much for the Super Chat I've had trouble sleeping for years currently taking squil to help most things don't work after a couple days I need tips well carnivore diet generally helps most people some people seem to have a bit of a of a disruption um unless they eat some carbs right before they go to bed and you could easily do that with milk um you can get some carbs that way um if you if you really do need them most people do much better without and they they sleep much much better much more deeply much more restfully without any of that uh and just eating eating meat so carnivore diet um and then you need to optimize your your sleep routine you if you if you've been taking medications for years then you know your body is sort of addicted to this and is dependent on it so it can take a while to to wean yourself off of it you can have several weeks of bad sleep uh before your brain stops becoming dependent on this stuff um and that can be tough it can be very tough uh but I think it's worth it I think it's worth getting off of these medications and not being dependent on them so to do the best you can melatonin can help um people take varying amounts of melatonin for various reasons um you know uh so you can play around with dosages and uh you know start off at sort of a lower dose and increase up if you if you think that would benefit you and um and then you can uh just optimize your sleep you know uh environment so turning off the lights getting blue blocking glasses uh you know for two hours before you go to want to be asleep try to go to sleep the same time every night complete darkness in your in your room put on a sleep mask to make it even more black out and and [Music] um and yeah make sure there's no noises or sounds or annoying annoying things and um and and just do the best you can to optimize your sleep time melatonin can help and then but it can just take time it can just take time to get your body to stop being dependent on these these sleep Med medications I hate sleep medications they are so addictive they're so habit forming and and the thing is is that it's not just like oh I need it I needed it I want it it's a I cannot sleep without it and that's the dependency you just you cannot sleep without it so it's um yeah it's best to come off of that if you can and so uh I would try melatonin instead and and just optimizing your environment so good luck with that uh Michelle Ste Son thank you so much for the Super Chat howy Dr chaffy do you know if uh if there is any positive info for people who have motor neuron disease my sister has just been diagnosed that's a that's a good question I haven't seen anybody with motor neuron disease try this so I don't know I mean I I would I would hope that it helps I expect it to help I've talked to some people that said well if you do everything perfectly you know you watch Andrew huberman and you see about optimized with getting sunlight grounding optimizing sleep getting rid of all toxins and all scents and candles and and and and beauty stuff that have all these weird chemicals in it these forever chemicals that get in your body and cause merry hell and and just eating just strict grass-fed and finished regeneratively raised U beef with a bit of liver couple times a week that uh you know that you'd have to do it perfectly for sort of motor neuron disease and I've talked to people that said that they they think that it would help I think it will help no matter what because obviously you're going to have uh a better result even if you have a degenerative disease if you are eating what you're designed to eat if you're eating other things and your body's going to Decay faster you're going to damage your body in other ways as well which are going to compound the problems that you have with something like motor neuron disease so it will help can it help the motor neuron dis disease specifically I don't know uh I hope it does and I hope your sister is okay and and that's a you know it's a devastating illness um and I'm so sorry that she was diagnosed with that but Jesus Christ it's worth a try you know like like why not why not give it a shot and um and see how you go and see and see what happens um but uh yeah good luck with that hopefully she does well and it looks like we have a special guest coming in here as well with little sweet little El Marie who is saying thank you to Mike for some reason but it's nice to see you here anyway and um and hopefully see you soon because you're nice and Dak quadruple 7 thank you very much uh for the Super Chat I'm not seeing a question attached but maybe there's one down the list Lisa Lisa thank you so much it's like pizza pizza little Caesar's guy uh thank you very much for the Super Chat keto for seven years lost 50 pounds it's fantastic um 30 PB gain loss 50 30 pound gain menopause adrenal fatigue something attacking thyroid um estrogen testosterone uh ratio High I'm assuming cortisol low or maybe just both of them high cortisol low um te's normal inflammation hip hand pain brain fog bloating retention insights full carnivore uh since uh 17th of August appreciate you thank you um okay so hopefully I I understood most of that um well look you know just just anything attacking your thyroid and cortisol and hormones and all these sorts of things those those are going to be optimized by just eating corn or D so keep doing that it can take time so uh get rid of carbohydrates as well um and it sounds like you're already keto so you're probably still doing a keto version of carnivore and and not adding in carbohydrates of or sugars of of any description uh which I think is is a good thing to do so full carnivore get enough fat get enough meat eat until you are satisfied eat until meat stops tasting good and just you know getting all those other things out of your system because menopause oh are you saying you're 50 you lost 50 gained 30 pounds okay so it's hard to say what happened there with your weight but anyway you're going through menopause that can be first of all people can come out of menopause by going keto or carnivore you've been keto for a while so um I don't know how much is going to change with with carnivore in that regard but I I have seen people come out of menopause and all of a sudden they're in in their 50s they haven't had their cycle in 5 years and they say well I'm starting to bleed I'm starting to get spotting well how often are you doing sort of like cyclical almost like I have my period um it's just like okay well look at your Bloods you're not in you're not in menopause anymore your your estrogen and progesterone are normal or close to normal so you know that can happen um it takes time so you know just um you having inflammation all that sort of stuff from brain fog uh bloating and water attention um that should all improve you know with getting rid of all the the plants and fiber and all that sort of stuff um so just keep going with it stay full carnivore stay you know red meat and water for best results so like beef and lamb high fat eat enough and uh and just just give it time your inflammation should get better um your brain fog should get better as long as you're eating enough as long as you're eating enough and not eating during the day where you're eating a whole bunch and it's just uh you know shutting you down just because you're so tired and lethargic after eating eat later in the day and um yeah all those little things and just just try to adjust things little by little to optimize um optimize your health and your eating experience and then just give it time a lot of these things will will clear up over time if you've got inflammation or hip and and hand pain you could have an injury and you need to make sure that you address that um you know using different sorts of means like you know like ice or um uh or you know wraps and compression exercises things like that so if you do have some sort of injury you know you need to work with uh uh your your doctor or a trainer and things like that as well uh so you know but the brain fog you know that that should clear up same with the bloating and all that sort of stuff as well probably better to eat later in the day because you don't want to be eating during the day because that can give you brain fog that can make you sleepy and tired and so that can be part of the problem as well so just sort of eliminating out uh that as well and um yeah hopefully that just just all sort of settles down on its own and most often does and if if it doesn't there's probably a reason for that you just sort of trying to identify exactly what's going on maybe something in your environment that's sort of causing a problem that you can eliminate have like a food diary and a symptom diary say oh I had some brain fog here at this time on this day this is what I ate on this day at this time and this is how I felt and you can you can start seeing some some correlations and start seeing okay well maybe when I eat that that doesn't really agree with me or you know or when I eat that time of day that's not really that agrees with me and uh but those sorts of food Diaries are really really helpful food and symptom Diaries write down what you're feeling and when and uh and what you're eating and when and how you're feeling at the time and how it made you feel afterwards very good information can be had there dvac quadruple 7 um there we go so thank you for super chat I tried the die for 90 days beef only and got a bad keto rash on my back I also had a lot of um I also use a lot of toilet paper wall uh pooping why did this happen well you know the TP thing is just you know you're having you know fat it can be more loose and it can just be a bit more um you know more messy uh if you eat slightly less fat or you're not drinking or or if you're if you're drinking coffee caffeine tea um using sweeteners or whatever come off of those because those can give you more loose stools and you'll sort of get more solid stools and you won't have to wipe as much keto rash is interesting so that's that's something we don't know exactly what it is but you know when your when our bodies are are losing weight losing fat and and changing we we just sort of dumping out a whole bunch of crap you can have a lot of fat soluble evil that just sort of sits in our adapost tissue and then when you're losing weight it can can get released and it can affect our skin and and the rest of our body we can feel a bit weird bit off and and people uh don't feel great so I talked to a dermatologist about this who who does sort of Keto carnivore and treats his patients uh with keto carnivore and and he was he was saying that he was saying that that's what he thought it was he thought that this was uh people detoxing and this stuff is just going out and sort of causing bits of r es and things like that just like you can have oxalate dumping and you can get problems and issues from there you can actually get rashes from oxalate dumping that um that you can you can dump out other stuff as well and uh that can that can give you weird rashes and weird symptoms and and uh they go away is the is the uh the long and short of it is is eventually it goes away and so you just have to sort of get get through all that but that seems to be what's what's going on so um I would try to keep going with it you know if you're more messy stools then get rid of all the coffee and tea and sweeteners um and if that doesn't do the trick then just pull back a bit on the fat and uh and you should have more solid stools which don't don't cause that problem good luck with that Lenny thank you very much for the Super Chat hello Dr chaffy can my tube fed daughter do the carnivore diet 21-year-old bedbound diagnosed with uh uh me CFS HTS and gastroparesis is it possible to be on a cornivore diet directly into the jum uh yes you know I mean it's um it's the most bioavailable food source that we have and so it uh it should be perfectly fine to to do that I mean obviously it's it's you know nice to get the acid on it and uh and all the different sorts of digestive processes that we have um but she's not there right now then then you you're still going to be able to absorb a lot of this stuff um so into the jum well I mean you should be you know it's a bit funny because you know how much you know these things get stimulated when you get food into the stomach and that stimulating uh you know secretion with your pancreas it goes into your duum and that you know that further digests things and that moves down into the jum to get absorbed and and um you know is that going to be really stimulated well enough in the jum to release all these uh pancreatic enzymes and all that sort of stuff it should be it should be fine um and it and it still is the most bioavailable you know nutrition that that she's going to she's going to have and I think it can help her a lot and specifically just not eating all this other garbage that uh generally gets put through the two which are just just processed filth um that that can be beneficial also um there are also options that that sometimes people have in um kids with epilepsy or Crohn's disease is it's called Elemental diet and it's just powdered it's very processed it's just powdered nutrients and you want the ones that that are for the um epilepsy KS because those don't have carbs and sugar it's just nutrients fat and protein okay and um and that's just all the it's not all the nutrients there's a lot more nutrients in meat that we don't even know about yet and I talked to people with crohn's disease go on an elemental diet and this is a better treatment than than steroids right than prazone and pricone and that's in that's in the literature that's published and and I've I've seen patients that have that they go on they they're eating they're getting problems and they go on Elemental diet for three week gets them out of that but then they start feeling a bit weird because of the elemental diet maybe they're just not quite the right nutrient balance or enough nutrients um and then so they can only sort of stay on it for about three weeks they feel a lot better and then they go back and forth and back and forth and they eat normally and then they get symptomatic enough that they go on the elemental diet they can only do that for three weeks before they get symptomatic and they go back on a normal diet and so on and then they go carnivore and all their problems go away um but you that's something that you can supplement in as well and it's just it's just ready to go nutrients I don't think you need much digestion it's just like it's just the the elemental form of the nutrients and you know just aminos and fats and and vitamins and minerals they're just ready to go uh so that's an option as well um but I I don't think she'd have any problem with with a carnivore diet I think you I she like other people would improve as well U and you can supplement in with that if you think that's a bit of an issue um but definitely worth trying because a lot of those problems can be improved with a cornivore diet and eliminating out all this crap that are certainly not helping her and um so getting her proper nutrition getting her meat and fat and the vitamins and minerals that come with the meat and fat is is vital for her um and um and worst case scenario you can you can add in some of that that element diet stuff uh to to to Beef It Up but I I don't think I don't think you'll need to um you know and you can just yeah puree meat liver pate all this stuff squeeze that straight down a tube uh no problem and um Tallow straight down straight down the pipe uh should be fine as well um does it need to go in the stomach to trigger your liver to secrete bile probably not I mean you do need fat this probably someone that stuff has fat well it's worth a try anyway and um I would I would do I would do that if that was my daughter and or if it were me I would certainly be trying that and um I think I think it will be fine and you have elemental stuff without carbs that um that is there in case uh in case you need something as a top up as well so good luck with that so sorry to hear that she's having those problems I I hope that she's able to recover and you know who knows it could be that being able to go on a cornival die can help her recover and I hope that it does uh Tyler thank you for the Super Chat my first post was book titles all high disciples okay great like um yeah great I I was a bit confused on that uh so great um maybe I'll try bringing that up let me see if I can bring that back one up now that we know now that we know those are book titles I didn't know if those were like Bitcoin buying apps or something like that I didn't know um let's see see if I can find that hold on a second there we go okay so these are the book titles um rothbard's uh man economy and state Mees okay yeah okay I'm getting it now Mees um Human Action uh Amos Bitcoin standard and Fiat standard and breed loves sound money in a digital age and uh layered money great awesome aome I will definitely check those out um yeah sorry I didn't quite didn't quite get that at the time but that's great thank you for that uh Tim Mo thank you very much for the $30 Super Chat it's very generous of you hi Dr chaffy is there a type or brand of water you think best I've heard San pelen Gro is high in uranium Jesus Christ I didn't know that um also does cod liver have the same problems as fish oil supplements I take Carlson's any thoughts um so water I think is the best water you know is getting a filtered water um ones that get out fluoride or being in an area that doesn't have fluoride uh it's probably a good idea and uh not all filters will get them out I've seen mixed reports on whether or not the activated charcoal filters like a brida filter some of the home filters can get out fluoride I would I would get out fluoride if I were you I don't think there's any reason that we put it in there it's the wrong kind of fluide anyway um it doesn't seem to actually help with our damn teeth uh it seems that there was some sort of weird issue with with um you know industry and state that that they just were able to dump this waste product this toxic waste product um that they normally had to pay to get rid of now they were able to sell and put in the water um and uh you know is that helping us I mean there there are study showing that um in areas with floridated water the IQ goes down that's not good that's not what you want and it can um calcify the pineal gland you know the pineal gland is really important that that there's a lot of major hormones that come out of there melatonin being one of them and um DMT is another that's the that's the death drug and hormone that causes you to dream as well and causes you to have these you know very loose um sort of hallucinogenic moments when you're close to dying and um and it's it's pretty crazy you know some people call it like you know the that part of your brain is like the window to God it's like that's that's a major part of your brain small part but it's an important part and uh and floration can can calcify it and you see this on x-ray you see it go up and there's this chunk of calcium right in the middle of someone's brain like that's not great that's not what you want or I I would bet that's not what you want it's not what I want and um so you can get uh distillation filters it just sort of boils it up collects the steam brings that down leaves all the sediment and nonsense below and you just get this steamed water that's now condensed and cooled and that'll get out almost everything you get reverse osmosis water as well um does about the same job um and um and you can also get remineralization ones don't worry about pH water oh my God that is the biggest scam um besides veganism you know it's just it's just not necessary your body keeps your your oh your body's alkaline you have to keep it alkaline you don't need to do [\u00a0__\u00a0] your body does it all for you um your blood pH is slightly alkaline that is correct it's between 7.35 and 7.45 and if it goes outside of that range you die very quickly so you know no you don't need ph11 ph9 water no you don't and if anything that can that can harm you that can make your body work extra hard to have to try to keep you at the right pH balance and uh and it you know it neutralizes the the acid in your stomach and bring the pH of your stomach up well your pH in your stomach goes It's supposed to be around 1.5 to two it goes up past four you can actually get bacteria grow growing in your stomach in your small intestine not what you want right that can cause serious problems so none of that uh bottled water in general I avoid because it's in with these Plastics you get all these you know nasty plastic chemicals that are hormone disruptors and forever chemicals and all that sort of stuff uh they leech out more with heat but also just time will do it and God knows how long those things have been sitting in those bottles God knows the temperature that they've been sitting there in so just because they're cold out of the fridge for you doesn't mean they haven't been hot the back of a truck being shipped somewhere right so a lot of chemicals would have leeched out already sand pel and green oil or anything in a plastic bottle I would avoid period and um water at home I would uh I would I would at least use a house filter Rd a filter and um and if you can get a reverse osmosis or or a steam distilling water um water system then that's probably ideal be fit to be fit thank you very much for the Super Chat Spoonful live culture cottage cheese uh once per week good uh it's fine you know live culture good bacteria if you're going to do that have it with a piece of meat chew it together in the same bite swallow it together and that can help make sure that those bacteria get past your hopefully very low ph stomach and uh and and the digestive enzymes coming out of your pancreas as well and get into the part of of the gut that can actually uh host these things or supposed to host these things and uh yeah so that that's fine I mean I you know if you want to do that if if it's live culture and you eat it with meat with that bite of meat and chew it up together swallow it together uh that's fine uh for your microbiome I think that once you have an established microbiome your microbiome eats what you eat and so if you're just eating meat it's going to be happy to do that you don't need to keep receding your uh your microbiome with bacteria if you if you have an established good microbiome it's going to stay there you know so I think that that'll be fine um if you do that uh and eventually you you I don't think you need to keep doing that you can again run self- experiments you can do that for a while do a feal um microbiome test see if it's healthy see if it's good if it is you can stop seeding it doing the the the the fermented uh sort of um or the cultured sort of dairy or fermented plants if people take fermented plants for that reason um and then see how you go and try it again in couple months and if your microbiome is the same there you go and I you know if you're taking antibiotics or something you know sure you know do that sort of uh you know Spoonful a day like you know live Culture Yogurt or whatever with meat uh you know once a day while you're taking the antibiotics and then for a couple weeks after you finish the antibiotics probably a good idea to to repopulate your your microbiome um but if you're able to maintain a good microbiome without doing that you don't really need to do that um it's Dr Shan omara who I've had on the podcast really really nice guy very interesting guy um and so people should definitely check out that podcast that we did together um if they haven't seen it yet we did two together and you know he he likes fermented things um he only eats meat he only eats meat will have a bit of fermented um you know plants like I believe like some some sauerkraut or something like that with with live sort of cultur stuff or kimchi without as much spices or or whatever stuff he uses but some ferment fermented uh plants fermented vegetables um he uh just has a bit and it's chewed up and swallowed together in the same bite with meat and he did one of those microbiome tests and and like the like the president or CEO of the microbiome thing I personally called him and just said hey we need to talk to you uh because you have the best microbiome we've ever seen on the whole all the time we've been doing this and like what the hell do you do like what's going on he's like yeah happy to tell you so that was pretty pretty impressive so he's just carnivore for five years right and the you know we we know from studies that Inuit just eating meat lifelong they have some of the healthiest microbiomes ever studied right um and so my friend Dr Shan omara had like the healthiest gut that these guys had ever seen had ever tested for in their company and so they said hey you know what the hell are you doing so they you know he he uh talked to them about that but that's what he's doing so he's been carnivore strict carnivore never cheated once for five years and uh and has some small amount of fermented vegetables chewed up with the meat and swallowed uh but like a small amount I don't even know if he does it every day but just a small amount anyway and uh you know that's getting these good bacteria down there I think that he'd probably be fine just sticking with with the meat at this point because the bacteria is the microbiome is established and it's going to keep eating what he's eating um and so I'm I'm interested in checking my microbiome as well um just to see if if I've you know done that I know have some live Culture Yogurt every now and then I think I've taken antibiotics once or twice in the last six years um for minor sort of things and you know and so I I've I've had some some fermented or or cultured Dairy um after those just to just to make sure but I never felt different one way or the other and so you know but just to check it out and just to see see what's uh what the go is is and um and I would expect my microbiomes pretty damn healthy and then maybe you know try some you know uh live culture Dairy for a while see if it improves see if it gets better or see if it's just just fine already but uh but yeah if you want if you want that once a week long answer but yeah that's that's fine if you want that Michelle Steven uh Stevenson thank you very much for the Super Chat how do you Dr chafy is there any info about carnivore help with monor neuron disease oh sorry so we we are answer this question sorry there's a bit of a delay on these questions um but I I did come to that so um hopefully that helped answer your question if you missed that just just backtrack um what is it 10 or 15 minutes or so from here uh when I did answer that but I think it will help I can't say that it'll help motor neuron disease directly but it will help all of her other health aspects which can can at least not compound the problem that she's having with motor neuron disease and potentially help remote a neuron disease we don't have any information on that unfortunately uh but it is is well worth the effort I mean at this point you get a diagnosis like that you just try whatever the hell is available and just see what sticks just throw everything at the wall and see what sticks and um you know so I I would definitely give that a try and I hope that she does well dea thank you for the the super chat um hi IG nephropathy can carnivore eliminate that uh good question um I don't I don't know of any studies one way or the other showing like ketogenic diets or high protein diets or anything like that with specifically IG nephropathy but you can um but there are studies showing that higher protein diets improve kidney function for whatever reason when you go on a carnivore diet it's an Elimination Diet you're eliminating out a lot of things that your body's reacting to negatively and you are eliminating out things that are going to cause a disruption of your of your immune system and certainly uh autoimmune issues as well and so that those sorts of issues can be helped so I don't know for sure if this can help specifically with IG nephropathy I would expect that it would and especially if you're very strict with just red meat and water uh but either way you know just like with the last um the last question um about motor neuron disease it's it's going to help uh everything else as well and so at least it's not compounding on top of that um there are other there are other things that exist that that are bad for us and um and that harm us that uh you know that that aren't addressed by diet but a lot of things are related to diet so I would I would be hopeful that it helps uh but I can't say for sure I haven't haven't seen um studies that would that would we could glean any information off of and I haven't seen people specifically with that uh one way or the other but definitely worth a shot and I hope it works I hope it helps Sam S thank you very much for the Super Chat I have a vascular necrosis on my hip for 13 years um 65 years old and have no other health issues I can walk I can walk at Fourth stage said no to surgery on keto form mons can carnivore diet help me thanks so avascular necrosis um is is is a bit of an issue I mean that that that means that that that part of that bone has died and because it hasn't had um hasn't had the proper blood supply and so the bones died um and if it if it is dead then then no nothing's going to fix that probably I wouldn't expect it to anyway um it can help with the pain it can help with inflammation it can help with uh your experience of that problem I don't think it's going to regrow the bone I don't think it's I mean crazy crazy things happen but um and Bone does regrow but you know is that is that going to sort of if this area sort of died off can it help the vasculature potentially depends on what caused the damage if you had a physical injury that damaged the blood supply to to the head of the femur uh you know is that going to get fixed by going carnivore you know probably not but you never know um if it's some sort of vascular issue that that sort of had a bit of of weakened flow maybe but um I think the likelihood is is it is it probably won't fix the underlying problem but it could help with your pain and your ability to walk um but you know see how you go if it's been improving on keto that's great if it improves even more on Carnivore lovely and if it gets to a point where it's not really symptomatic enough that you find it has an issue then that it's not an issue so give that a try if after six months or a year on on carnivore you're finding everything's great maybe get an x-ray see what's going on who knows maybe it could uh repair some of that that damage from the avascular necrosis but necrosis means it's dead and is decaying is being reabsorbed by your body and breaking down right so that's not great you know um and so probably won't reverse that but if you're feeling good then then that's really you know uh uh the the more important part and obviously not causing any sort of major issues or infection or whatever um or your body's not reacting horribly to it but it's been 13 years so you know probably fine at this point but um you know after a year or so if it's not you know really all that much better take a look at it revisit it and see you know maybe you know getting that that part of the hip replaced at that point and then you know sort of not having a problem with it anymore hip replacements are pretty uh pretty standard now they're pretty they're pretty um you know bread and butter in far as far as Orthopedics they're quite good they're getting better the the the Orthotics are really good high quality material the surgeons are very skilled now and so you can get a very good result and have a very good time with it and um and if it's that saves you from having horrible pain and problems down the road it's a good option and um you know they last for decades and uh decades down the road you might even have a better option then and you know get another replacement for an even better sort of cyborg hip I don't know but uh but if you're having problems with it and uh and it's improving on Carnivore great but if it's not improving enough and you're still having serious problems and you know then surgery is a surgery is actually a good option and and it can actually really help you so don't don't completely dismiss that if um you don't want to you made it another 13 years without a hip replacement that's great you know the longer you go without them uh you know it's good because Technologies get better skills get better uh materials get better all these sorts of things they do have a shelf they do have a shelf life they're they're not going to last forever but they last a long time and they're pretty good now so um you know I think that um you don't want to just be in pain and debilitated and and not being able to walk properly and living a normal life um so don't completely discount surgery but you can always try cornivore and see how much that helps in the next six months to a year and you can always get surgery after that if you want to and um and if you do get surgery and you're on Carnivore you're going to you're going to heal so much better than than you would otherwise so you know it's all good it's not it's not it's not a problem to wait at this point but don't completely discounted um Bella brat for you thank you so much for the $100 Super Chat is very very generous of you and very kind thank you so much um seriously Dr chaffy I don't know how you do all you do but I think I speak uh for so many of us thank you for helping us all out uh please don't ever stop this is amazing I we always learn so much from you Hi also Hi l and glad you have uh such a doll to support you well thank you so much that that's really really sweet of you um and and I do appreciate that and I appreciate all of you guys and you know I started a channel just because I thought you know some of the stuff was important to say and and I didn't know how anyone would care if I said it um or if I was just saying the same things that that other people were saying and um if that was enough that they were saying it but um you know it's it's nice to hear that that people are being helped by this and that people are having good Su you know success stories I mean it's so refreshing and fulfilling to hear people say you know they've lost all this weight they've come off these medications they've come out of nursing homes and um it's that's just I honestly that's my favorite thing to hear is is how well people are doing and um and all the benefits it gets from this so thank you all thank you all for for taking a chance and and listening to what I have to say and saying okay maybe this makes sense maybe it doesn't make sense but you know the ones that sounded like it made sense to giving it a try trying something new trying something that goes against everything we've been told our whole lives my whole life I've been told do the opposite of what I'm doing and I've had the opposite results of what I was supposed to have you know and so that makes you think maybe this isn't the right way to do it and I did the opposite and I got the opposite results to what they said I would get so there's a lot there but you know thank you all for everyone who's who's just you know been brave enough to De it a try and see how it went and see how you did with it and you know you took the chance you took the risk you got the reward and you know it's uh you know that's something that Jordan Peterson talks about um you have to go out you have to face a dragon you have to fight a dragon and the dragon's scary the dragon can kill you but the dragon also has treasure and you can be rewarded and you can you can be fulfilled because of that and I think this is it as well you had to face that Dragon of fear of oh my God I'm going to die of this and of that and whatever and I've been told and and you live in fear because you've been told to live in fear right you know like slaves that say don't ever run away because it'll be worse you know or an abusive you know spouse that say if you ever leave me no one's ever going to love you your life is going to be horrible and I'll kill your family you know so like well my God I don't ever want to leave because I'm so scared of the consequences if I leave and um so you were brave enough to go against that and and you found that oh my God it's so much better now on the other side of this and so thank you to everyone who's given that a try and uh and then and then relayed your stories to other people and you know if people have had that experience they were sort of worried about this and they gave it a try uh and they found that their their health improved dramatically please leave a comment leave a comment under this and um and let other people know what your issue was um you know in in as much detail as you want to and um you know keeping your your privacy you know secure um and and just say like look these were my problems and this is this is how they helped you know and other people can see that and go like hey that's my problem you know and and and we have these questions is this going to help me is this going to help me with this problem with this problem with this problem some things I know the answer to I can I've seen it yes that will help you or there's literature saying yes that will help you uh other ones like motor neuron disease I don't know maybe someone else has had that maybe someone else has had experience with that maybe someone else has had um you know IGA uh nephropathy and they can they can leave that comment so anybody if you've had anything you know that has been helped by this and you took that chance and you rolled the dice leave a comment below um and and say hey this is what I have this is how it helped you know because someone else is going to see that and they're going to be inspired by that and they're going to give that it a try and then that's going to save their life and then they're going to pass it on they're going to save someone else's life and you have this massive network of people that you've helped as a result of that so all of you are helping people all of you are helping everyone in your circles everyone that you're talking to that's seeing you improve your life you're influencing them and you're going to get them better and they're going to be interested in doing this and they're going to try this because of you and because you and you are helping those people and then those people that they influence and they help you have helped those people too so you have a huge sphere of of good that you can do you know the whole idea of paying it forward all that sort of stuff you are just by being healthy and not being afraid and ashamed of how you got healthy will be paying it forward you'll be making so many other people healthy and happy and so you know thank you to everyone who is doing that and um yeah and please leave a comment below and let other people know you know how much you've improved on this and you know if people haven't improved you've had some problems leave a comment below you may have had a problem that other people have experienced as well and they know how to uh to to to fix it there's always a workaround I've never I've yet to to find anyone that didn't have a workaround some problem that they were having well you need to up this you need to down that you need to do this you need to do this and slightly adjust things with just eating meat and water you know but eating enough eating enough fat eating at different times a day doing different sorts of things that there's always a workaround you know or people are still drinking coffee with sweeteners and monk fruit sugar and all that sort of stuff common commonly people are still eating a lot of things that probably aren't great for them so if you're having a problem leave that in the comments and and ask for help there are so many people that have gone through exactly what you you've gone through and can help you and I can I can help you with a lot of these things and I try to answer um you know as many questions as I can in the comments so do leave questions in the comments I try to answer I can't answer all of them but I do trying to answer uh someone I can so uh yeah so to do that and thank you very much and thank you ver uh Bella brat for the very generous Super Chat is very kind of you uh s uh zirus I think that's the The North Wind isn't it one of the Winds um thank you for the Super Chat hello from ventur California right uh yeah I was I was born in Ventura so there you go uh love your content keep up the the strong work I one month carnivore here I have enjoyed all the benefits what would you say to those who uh think it's bad to eat just meat thank you um I tell them it's wrong you know and that um the humans have evolved eating meat that's what we've been eating for millions of years so obviously by definition that's what we're biologically designed and evolved and adapted to eat and an immutable law of biology is adaptation what you have been exposed to and AD your life will adapt to their environment and our environment has been meat for millions and millions and millions of years and so we are adapted to meat and so that is an immutable law of biology and any you knowbody who says differently doesn't know biology and so what we are adapted to is what we are designed to eat and if we are not adapted to something we are not designed to eat that that is not good for us if we're adapted to it if we're designed to eat it it's good for us it's optimal for us and the opposite is also true and so people saying well yes these plants didn't exist in the last 50 years these seed oils are we just made them through an industrial process these these random ass chemicals are just you know you know just came up last year but I have this study that says that it's better than eating meat don't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] I I just don't care if it goes against an immutable law of Nature and biology then it's it's wrong it's flat out wrong you can make a study that says anything you can make a study that looks at airplanes oh my good look at these big lead balloons floating around and flying clearly gravity doesn't exist and you can show that in a study and show that gravity is not real but it is and uh that's that's a physical law and if it goes against a physical law it's wrong sorry you know um and so this is this is a this is an immutable law of biology is adaptation and so what we are adapted to is what we're designed to eat is what we are uh optimal eating and things that we're not adapted to are going to cause harm we are not adapted to them we're not supposed to eat them we're not designed to eat them they don't have good bioavailability because we're not adapted to eating them they have poisons that we can't detoxify properly because we're not designed to eat them we're not adapted to eating them you know right after agriculture there's a hard line 10,000 years ago where people became five inches shorter brains are smaller teeth are crowded crooked damaged uh poor wound healing uh shorter femurs which is sign of malnutrition you know signs of infection tuberculosis in their in their um spine and things like that um you know these people were not healthy and that's because they started eating something they're not adapted to and they got worse they didn't develop properly they didn't get grow as tall their brains didn't grow as as large and their their teeth and mouth didn't didn't form properly and they got sick and they had poor wound healing and they got you know infections that didn't heal properly potentially killed them so that's not good so that's what you point out that biologically humans are carnivores we are apex predators top of the food chain top of the food chain apex predator predator the definition of that is a carnivore what apex predator is not a carnivore it's that's a definition you're an apex predator so predators of cabbage right apex predator means you eat every animal around you you know a sea lion is a is a is a major Predator they eat a lot of fish a lot of birds a lot of different things but they're not Apex because sharks and orcas eat and humans eat the hell out of them right so they are high up in the food chain they are not top of the food chain we are top of the food chain and we have been for millions and millions and millions of years if you're an apex predator top of the food chain you are a carnivore by biological design and adaptation so that is how I would answer that and um you can have there's a video that I did called um why we are carnivores and and it has a lot of that a lot of the information showing why we are carnivores and why we should only be eating meat and you can also couple that with uh you know the plants are trying to kill you want and understand that you know eating things that were're not adapted to eating like plants that have toxins in them is a bad idea as well so uh King and hiding thank you so much for the Super Chat more info this time uh 7 57 two years carnivore uh benign prostatic hypertrophy urologist says no cancer uh bladder bladder looks good but urethra is still constricted symptoms stubborn but calmed PSA um is down stay the carnivore course herbs or Mets um no no no keep going carnivore yeah so um no there have been people so so Professor Ben bman uh talks about um uh you Pro prostat ah prostate issues um and how they're heavily they're very strongly linked to carbohydrates and and insulin and things like that and so you know staying away from those things can improve things uh can take time but uh you know yeah your symptoms are stubborn but they they've calmed your Ps has gone down which is great so things are going in the right direction keep going um and uh hopefully that will keep getting better be very strict don't cheat don't have any carbs don't have any fruit don't have any honey don't have any alcohol don't have any any milk or dairy all these sorts of things stay away from it just red meat and water that's it and um and you should get better and better and better and better and your your prostate will hopefully calm down enough that you don't have any symptoms uh going back to Dr Shan omaro that was one of his issues he was he was peeing he was barely dribbling he was definitely having prostate issues and after a while on a carnivore diet and reversing visceral fat because that's his main thing and that his main thing is reversing visceral fat that's a fat around the organs in your abdomen that that is that is metabolically active and that damages you that makes you sick just having that fat other fat elsewhere isn't isn't as metabolically active now fat in general is an endocrine organ actually makes estrogen so no not everybody knows that they didn't teach me that in in medical school and um or high school or whenever but umh but it does it secretes estrogen and so your fat tissue is actually your largest endocrine organ especially if you have a lot of it right and so uh but your your visceral fat is very metabolically active and and detrimentally so okay um so Dr Amara does carnivore because he found a carnivore is the best diet to get rid of your visceral fat but he also exercises in a specific way he does Sprints I think three days a week or so you start with three days a week anyway maximal exertion and intensity for a short period of time and repeat right so sprinting either on ground or on like a bike like a like a assault bike just call ass on an assault bike for you know 10 20 seconds rest do it again rest do it again do that 10 times three days a week right and um or like Sprints out on on pavement I do Hill Sprints for some reason my knee blows up and swells up if I if I just run on on on the ground it's it's really annoying but if I do stairs and or Hills it's fine my knee doesn't blow up no idea why but uh it's annoying i' like it to not blow up at all ever and I'd like to be playing rugby again but maybe maybe one day and so but doing those Sprints doing weightlifting so that that sort of high-intensity Anor robic exercise seems to help rid yourself of visceral fat and that's what he finds is very important and so if you still have visceral fat then you can uh you know try to address that and try to get rid of that and that should consequently help your prostate issues Dr Amar had those prostate issues and then he got rid of his visceral fat and all of a sudden he said for the first time in decades it sounded like you know it was Niagara Falls when he was going to the bathroom like great you know when he when he was peeing and um you know Niagara Falls you know when you're not peeing is is probably another issue but that's the um you know that's the takeaway try to get rid of your visceral fat cornivore diet you're doing that exactly right keep doing that be strict um you can try a bit of cultured milk or you know like some yogurt things like that bit of that make sure you're getting proper micro in your microbiome chewed up and swallow it together with meat you know do that Spoonful a day for several weeks and hopefully that'll sort you out and uh sprinting three days a week lifting weights three days a week and that should get rid of the rest of your visceral fat if you have any and and help you metabolically and hopefully help your prostate issues as well so good luck with that Ryan Moses uh cornivore six months trid 101 HDL 55 LDL 216 vldl 20 alt 69 all other labs uh or normal in normal range any ideas on elevated ALT lift 5 days a week uh eight eggs and sardines 1 hour before Labs oh and someone someone asked before um if uh if cod liver oil was sort of the same as ficial I don't know that's a good question I've actually wondered that um you know if it's sort of heat treated and doing all these sorts of things you know maybe it could damage it so I'm not sure actually um but you know the liver itself should be fine um and so if you get cod liver in its oil you know hopefully that's okay um but uh but you know liver anyway is going to have it's going to have a decent amount and you'll C liver should have a good amount of of Omega-3s as well so hopefully hopefully that's case sorry I completely blanked was going to answer that earlier so isue with alt so alt well there's a number of reasons why your why your liver function test could be be out of range but you also have to wonder you know what they're doing because this is a snapshot in time and so you don't know the vector you don't know the direction right so if you were if you had a blood test before and your liver and your T was 106 and now it's 69 you're going in the right direction right and so if it was 29 and now it's 69 okay what's happening what what's going on that can affect your liver a lot of things can medications alcohol sugar fructose all these sorts of things um environmental exposures as well all of these things can affect your liver um so I wouldn't worry too much about that at the moment sometimes you can just have an aberant uh blood test test and it may not actually even be accurate you want to take things at the exact same time of day uh in the exact same manner every day and that gives you more consistent results so first thing in the morning between 800 and 9:00 a.m. fasting from the night before 900 p.m. only water after that same hydration status so at least two glasses of water an hour or two before you take a blood test no more than four glasses of water and you don't take any medications the morning of wait until after you medications or supplements wait until you take those after your blood test um and then be sedentary and sedate and very calm the day before and the day of that morning don't get pissed off in traffic or yell at anybody or get all charged up be very chill and very relaxed this changes things it does it changes a lot of different things um uh not necessarily just your your liver liver um uh test but everything especially hormones and cholesterol and all these sorts of things they they change um depending on your fasting status the time of day um your hydration status all these sorts of things and then again sedate and seditary for the day of and the day before and really two days before if you can so no exercise no sexual activity the day of or the day before and um and then get get it consistently and get more data points you know so if you're doing this in a consistent Manner and you're seeing your liver function test go down great you know you're you're going in the right direction and I would expect that's what you'll see um and if you uh see it start going up start thinking okay what am I exposing myself to what am I doing um okay maybe I have some artificial sweeteners like I didn't know that could be a problem and all these people and say that it doesn't cause a problem well it's causing a problem for you cut it out you know or a bit of sugar or honey or something like that you know just identify what you're doing besides red meat and water and address that and see if that's if that's the culprit or other things that in your environment other you know Plastics and and scents and and shampoos and thises and thats and all these other sorts of things that we expose ourselves to soak into our skin and get into our body and absolutely have an effect on us um so yeah I would um I would look into that but your your other markers are looking great your triglycerides are coming right down and uh your HDL is is coming up in a good range I don't vldl is low and LDL I you know higher are better anyway they make you live longer so um yeah so I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about that but uh yeah just good luck with it and I would you know keep doing what you're doing just eat eat meat and fat and uh get rid of seed oils and sugar and all that sort of nonsense and um oh and you ate eight eggs with sardines one hour before laps so that's going to derange your your cholesterol a lot so that's yeah you can't really do that so you can't um you can't you can't trust really much of you can't trust your cholesterol at all if you've eaten uh before that especially if you're eating you know fat just changes it so I would I would get your tests again and um and I would check I get things tested exactly as I said you know between 8 9 am fasting from 9:00 P p.m. the night before right same hydration status sedentary don't take medications before eat before certainly um and uh and then just get a couple more markers get them tested every couple months to see what you're doing um your alt will come down those things will come down if you've actually eliminated out all these things and if you haven't eliminated all all those things eliminate them and uh and go from there so okay so question from Heidi here and there thank you so much for the Super Chat osteoarthritis bone on bone in both knees what exercise would you recommend doing at home well it it depends you know you should you should go check out uh knees over toes guy he had I like his workout routine I've been doing that I have most of my knees perfect but I have bone on bone on the patella so on the on the kneecap and that's sort of and then transposed onto the onto the femur and um and it sucks but it's you know it's much better on on a carnivore diet and um and doing the knees over toast things has actually really helped it's helped my range of motion it's helped me um deal with uh having that issue and um and it also gets a lot of nutrients in because you're getting full range of motion to the knee and the knee capsule when that's how you get nutrients in and out of the knee capsule and so you want to do that so I would check out the knees over toes guy I really like him I really like his his routine and I've I've certainly found um you know a benefit from that and I'm I'm hoping that it gets me to the point that I don't have to that I that I don't my knees don't swell up when I run uh on the flats and I can go back and play some rugby and I and if I can I can get you know back in shape and you know start killing people I'm GNA take a video of me just just lacing someone on the Rugby field and like post that and be like youo thanks Ben you know this is this is because of you this guy's Hospital uh hospital visit today uh for you know spinal cord injuries is is because of you thanks buddy and something funny like that obviously I hope I don't just damage someone's spinal cord but I do plan on lighting someone up so um that's uh that's helped me um bone on Bor arthritis uh you're sort of at the point where you probably you might need to think about uh knee replacement um but knees over toes guy um helps helps me anyway and it helps a lot of other people so I I would give that a shot uh yeah someone else is here uh Nicholas uh yeah who's uh who's over at BYU's um teachers over there and coaches over there throwing and uh talking about Ben PR Ben Patrick is the knees over toes guy that would be my my recommendation as well so and Bella brat for you well thank you so much again for another $100 Super Chat that is really really kind and generous of you um they say this is an investment into everyone's questions and uh and to all your time and for all you do and all the things including L that's very sweet and also oh my God thank you for the food videos too thank you well well thank you I mean that's really nice of you to say and I I really do appreciate the support and and I I appreciate the fact that uh that people are getting something out of this and that that you know people weren't getting anything out of this you know it's hard to justify um you know doing it you know because does it does take time and it's it's a lot of my time and uh but I I really appreciate that so thank you very much and um you know thank you everyone for um yeah for for just being here and uh and hopefully it's it's helping answering your questions another question here from Aon lintvelt question my colleague has uh varet uh uh pereria she e a high carb diet because um because glucose inhibits alas she she eats a diet of 55 to 60% carbs in order to slow down the pathway will she be able to go on Carnival well I think everybody with any um with any genetic issue or medical issue is still human and I so I I firmly believe that we have an a biologically appropriate diet that is um that is that is universal to all of us and that we all would benefit greatly by being on that diet and so I think that yes she would benefit on that um it's um I don't know exactly how that's going to react or respond to this there are things that that are outside of of Pure Nutrition but I think that she is still human regardless of her genetic variations to to us um or to me anyway and and so I think that she would benefit I think she would be optimized by being on the optimal human diet so I I think that I think that it would help her um I don't know if it would help that specific issue I think it would help her in a thousand other ways though and um it would be great to see if it if it helps her with that condition but uh I know that it would help in other ways as well um and so yeah and so I I would give it a try anyway and she can always give it a try for three months and if she doesn't like it you she go away and at least she knows you know she say okay well that didn't that didn't agree with me for one way or the other maybe I got some benefits over here but I didn't like it over there that's fair enough and um but you know worth it's worth a try anyway bold carnivore thank you very much for the uh for the Super Chat appreciate 50 Grand that's awesome thank you so much for that um obviously obviously not with the exchange rate but uh bro don't forget to get back to your email thread I really want us to set set up our Meetup um I will do that I've so many emails um can get lost just because I get I get uh several dozen a day on four different email accounts so it's difficult to stay on top of of uh because they've got other stuff to do um but if you email me again um and to bring it up to the top so I can see it because otherwise it's going to be lost so I apologize but do just email me again and um and uh yeah here you go it's IDR it's not much in USD yeah so but uh yeah but uh thank you very much uh for for the Super Chat and um and yeah and do and just email me again uh and just send that up just sort of pop that up to the top and should be uh should be easier to get um for me to see it but uh yeah and then go to bed well it's actually early for me it's actually 1 in the afternoon but I've been on here for four hours and so I probably do have things to do um and that's and that's all the sort of the

Carnivore diet maybe it didn't go so well for them they had to stop or maybe they're thinking about stopping say why say what's going on say what you're eating be honest you're eating any artificial sweeteners or any crap like that or anything else put it in there and uh say exactly what you're eating and say the issues that you're having um say the benefits you're having there are going to be benefits so keep mind of a mind on the positives as well as the negatives talk about the things that are positive and also talk about the things that maybe aren't going so well and um someone will someone will have gone through that before there's nothing new Under the Sun and so the great thing about this is there are so many people that have done this that that if you've had an issue someone else would have had that issue too probably and would have been able to to um deal with it so all right well thank you very much everyone I really appreciate your time and people coming on here um and

and get more people healthy and not stuck taking a whole bunch of horrible medications and needing horrible surgeries and having their bodies break down to the point that they have to I wish my knees had never broken down ever um but that was probably more to do with kickboxing and and uh you know knee strikes and things like that which just damages the cartilage because none of my other cartilage is is damaged so in any case have a good day everyone love you all uh take care we'll see you next time"
