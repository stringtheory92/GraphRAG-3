    "body": "hi Dr C my wife has recently been diagnosed with Graves disease hyperthyroidism from an enlarged thyroid can the carnivore way of eating help cure or repair this autoimmune disease well first of all I'm very sorry to hear that um it's a you know it's obviously a very difficult situation to be in but yes absolutely there are so many people with Graves disease specifically that have improved on a carnivore diet I've never seen an autoimmune issue not respond very well to a carnivore diet they may exist but I haven't seen one yet uh from what I can tell autoimmune diseases are just your body reacting to these negative plant toxins and your and and you make antibodies towards them and then you get cross reaction with your own tissue and and that can manifest in many different ways just such as Graves disease or the opposite sort of uh issue is is Hashimoto which instead of exciting your thyroid IT depresses and damages and destroys your thyroid so either way same same treatment works you get rid of all those plants and all that garbage processed foods obviously but plants period and you stop making antibodies and we can actually track these antibodies especially with things like Graves and Hashimoto and you get a number you say hey here's your antibodies and then you go on a lion diet you really need to be strict red meat and water even pork chicken farmed fish uh especially uh eggs dairy for sure you should avoid or she should avoid and um because they're being fed things that that they're not supposed to eat so some of those plant toxins can get into the meat and that can get into her whereas the ruminant animals even with they're eating grain they ferment that first before they absorb it so there's there's much less of that that's you know my guess anyway and so that is what we observe we observe that people that are eating more red meat you know uh beef and water beef lamb and water goat venison Yak those sorts of things the ruminant animals that th that that people do best on those and so you know give those a try um and when you do that those antibodies go down down down down down uh it it can take a long time Graves and and room and Hashimoto especially they can take a while so just be very very strict very high fat meat and water improve sleep improve stress levels as well because those can all negatively affect autoimmune issues also so you have to optimize your whole life starting with the diet but yes many many people have improved Graves disease specifically so it's well worth a try and and it's going to help help her in a thousand other ways anyway so you know even if it didn't help with her Graves disease it would help with those other things but it it almost certainly will help with the graves disease I haven't really come across anyone who uh hasn' t helped with anyway"

    "body": "member says hi I get tight and Bloated feeling an hour or two after eating and it lasts for a long time I don't drink water within a couple hours of meals I eat only beef until it stops tasting good thank you very much H well you know it it could be that you just need to that your body wants these nutrients and so it's saying yes eat more but you're just not used to eating as much and so you could try eating splitting up your meal you know two a couple times a day try eating a smaller meal during the day and then later on later that night you might eat uh another meal and that might be enough for your body but not so much that you feel that there's a lot you know a lot in your in your stomach that you're you're having to contend with um that you know if that if that tight bloated feeling isn't all that much of a concern then probably don't worry about it if it's if it is causing a lot of problem then probably try splitting those those meals up um it sounds like your body wants these nutrients but it may just be that you're you're sort of at physical capacity so you eating more you know twice a day or or more often than you are if you're already eating twice a day might be a good way of doing that increase the fat as well because that's much more satiating and if you're eating very high fat uh you tend to eat less because you don't need as much because your body tracks nutrients it doesn't track calories but that also has good calories in it but it's it's the nutrients and the fat that your body wants you have receptors in your stomach that track up to your brain via your Vegas nerve that actually look at different nutrients and macro micronutrients and it says okay well we have have enough we can stop now and that's when your body tells you to stop eating however if you're getting a lot of lean meat but you're not getting as much fat your body is still going to say hey actually we there still some stuff we need so it's going to keep telling you to keep eating that to try to get more of that those fat nutrients and so on or or vice versa but uh it's typically typically more satiating uh when you eat more fattier meat most people aren't necessarily eating as much f um as they need because they just are so used to not eating as much fat when they they do start eating fat it's it's like they're eating twice as much three times as much fat as they normally are used to and they're like well surely this has to be enough fat because I'm eating so much fat compared to what I was doing but it may not be enough for you so keep that in mind try to aim from one to two grams of fat for every one gram of protein and see how you go and and split it up into more meals during the day if you have to so you don't get so quite so stuffed"

    "body": "member asks is 70% fat bare minimum or can it vary by person it does vary by person so that one to two grams of fat that I mentioned is about that range so one gram of fat to one gram of protein is 70% calories from fat if you're only eating fat and and protein and then two to one fat to protein is 80% Calum fat so that's the range you just aim for it maybe maybe that you need more maybe that you need that you need less but you just listen to your body and you see also you check with with your stools you know so if your if your stools are dry and hard and constipated then by definition you're not eating enough fat and and I you know I see people you know even even yesterday I got a a message from someone saying well I'm eating a lot of fat but I'm still having dry hard constipated stools and so um you're not eating enough though it's it's more than you've ever eaten before and it feels like a lot for you and and it is compared to what you were doing but it's it's not enough for your body your body has a limited capacity to absorb fat and after that it goes out and that excess that goes out is going to keep your stool soft and uh before that it's going to get all absorbed and your stools are going to be dry and hard so if there drying hard that means that maybe you're getting exactly the right amount of fat and and no spill over but it's unlikely so if you're if you're getting soft stools that means you're you know you're you're absorbing fat to your body's capacity and then there's a little spill over so you at least know that you've satisfied your body's desire to to absorb fat so that's what you try to do you eat enough fat that you don't get constipated and if you're only eating meat and water because the thing is is if you're if you are if you are drinking coffee still a lot of people do still drink coffee even when they go carnivore uh coffee tea artificial sweeteners usually in the coffee or the tea uh magnesium supplements and medications such as metformin these sorts of things can all cause loose stools and people say well I'm drinking the same amount of coffee that I was before right but you're not eating fiber anymore and fiber slows things down causes physical obstructions and just slow moving and so actually that coffee is probably great idea to try to keep that stuff moving and um but you don't need it now and so there's no fiber there now there's no fiber all this stuff is just liquefied and you're just just shooting through liquid instead of all this big bulky physical blockages that uh fiber causes so it causes much more loose stools and so you know something to think about anyway but if you're not having any of those things and you're only eating fatty meat then um you can you can adjust that with the fat you're eating but especially when you're drinking coffee or anything else if you're getting dry hard stools You Are by definition not eating enough fat and if you're getting dry hard stools and you're drinking coffee and that's a bit of a laxative you are really not eating enough fat so just keep that in mind"

    "body": "hi Dr C uh since starting carnivore I get restless legs most nights uh when I get into bed used to used to get restless legs very infrequently before please help oh that's very interesting you know there there are quite a lot of people you know my my girlfriend L included that have actually resolved their restless legs and they had it for years and just AB bugged the hell out of them um uh and then they went carnivore and and it just went away one things I I've noticed um is that the the the rare times I have gotten restless legs it's usually when I have just been out of the gym or not playing rugby or not being Physically Active for a very long time this there's no data behind this this is just my own personal experiences but I've noticed that just my legs are just they just want to do something they're like hell you know you're lazy ass let's go you know and so my my legs are just basically chomping at the bit to go and do something active you know when I start running and sprinting and working out goes away um that's just me you know I'm sure there are other I'm sure there are many causes of of restless leg syndrome if you're doing carnivore and you're just you know eating meat and drinking water and getting enough fat things like that I I don't know how long you've been doing it so sort of since starting so I don't know if you just started sometimes when people start early on it can be you can get a bit of an electrolyte imbalance you need to add more salt things like that uh most people don't have to do that long term you know some people do I know my friend Dave Felman has to use quite a lot of salt every day it's like seven grams like five to seven grams something like that he adds like every day so or else he just doesn't feel as good and uh and so yeah that's unfortunate I don't use any salt now you know so that's like you know the other side of it so it's um it it's just try to you know try to sort of optimize all these other sorts of things you know if you're especially if you're sort of you know standing up out of a chair and getting a bit lightheaded or dizzy that could mean that your blood pressure dropping a little low because you're not retaining as much water because you're peeing out electrolytes and water's going with it and so you maybe add a bit more electrolytes add more water try exercising doing body weight squats try to Sprint if you can that's a fantastic exercise probably the best full body exercise uh that you can do we were doing some yesterday actually we I probably should have filmed that that's missed opportunity we did um like a big leg workout circuit here at the B Time Chamber with uh group of the other guys that are here and um did like this big leg circuit and then it's like this big we're up with the mountains big up hill up to the leading up to um you know the place we're staying and so I said all right well let's just you know let's end this off and just try to kill ourselves by sprinting up the hill until we die and we're like racing so like one person would go like you know I would start and then someone would go two seconds behind me and then two seconds behind them and two seconds behind them you try to catch the person in front of you and then mix it around chase after people and so uh we really absolutely crushed it and killed ourselves so great workout uh you know you know really really good strong leg workout um and sprinting Hill sprinting things like that I I I I'm I'm yeah I don't I'm sorry I don't have better advice for you most people actually find that youus legs get better so you know maybe there's something you know just that you could you could tweak and fine tune to get things a little better for you on your your diet um and you can try exercising for me that that really helped every time I got I would get little weird restless legs it was when I hadn't been exercis exercising as much and I I always took it as my body just telling me uh to get more active that so see see how you with that see if that helps"

    "body": "member asks what do you say to people that claim red meat is carcinogenic and the science says plant-based diet low risk of CPT uh I say that there is absolutely no science that says that either of those things um you there are no studies extent in the literature to uh to quote my friend b k that show that red meat is carcinogenic and there's no literature extent in the L there's no there's no studies extent in the literature that show that plants uh are have a cause and effect relationship with lowering cardiovascular disease this is all associative epidemiological garbage and the red meat causes cancer thing is Extreme garbage like the worst of the worst with massive confounding Factor they call Pizza and fast food meat and that's obviously not the case um and uh so it's um it's uh well so it's it's a bit of a fraud and so you know you get these studies that are just you know weak epidemiological studies they they ask somebody you know take this survey tell me what you ate in the last two years that's that's an actual thing that they ask people remember meal you've had for two years and um and then look at other sorts of things oh look at this there's an 18% increase rate in the people that said they ate more pizza and fast food and and lasagna and things like that and uh so obviously meat it's meat then it's like screw off um the University of Washington in Seattle did publish a massive paper a systematic review looking at hundreds literally over 800 studies on the subject and they found the ones that had that weak bear association between uh not really meat and cancer were in their words junk studies and lazy science and that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of much higher quality studies and much better design studies without these confounding factors and nonsensical conclusions and associations with pizza and fast food and not not correcting for smoking and drinking and things like that that they found no association between even processed meat and cancer but certainly not unprocessed red meat and cancer and um the science does not say that plant-based diets lower uh cardiovascular disease risk they show that a healthy user bias of people that are following a more healthy diet in their mind can have a lower association with uh cardiovascular disease but that's not the same thing um so you know when they say that just say okay okay show me show me the show me the study that shows a cause and effect relationship between either of those things they don't exist and so you don't have to prove the negative you know they made the assertion they have to back it up so oh but red meat causes cancer does it where's the evidence for that oh everyone knows that that's not evidence oh well look at this study and is it that's not a cause and effect that's not a randomized control trial you can't you can't make a cause and effect you can't make a cause and effect statement from an epidemiological study you know so no try again and and just don't accept uh inferior data just don't you know they made they've made an assertion they've got to back it up and um oh but plants lower this how why where's the study that show that no that's an association there are a lot of other things in there you know there was um some of these these people have uh you know sent me these things oh but look at all these studies and meta analysis but you look in the meta analysis and because the meta analysis is only as good as the studies that are used in The Meta analysis and you look through and it's just these survey studies uh they're not part randomized control trials right oh but it's a metaanalysis oh wow it's a you know junk in junk out you have garbage studies in your meta analysis it's garbage meta analysis that's all there is to it so you know they you know do this like Lane Norton tried to do this a whole thing on him he tried to he tried to make this claim that um that uh you know that that that exact thing that these plant toxins actually you know lowered you know cancer risk and CBD risk and there was a study out of uh and one of the studies in that meta analysis um that he used they were all they were all epidemiological by the way none of them were randomized control trials except the one the one that was randomized control trial of using ice packs versus Frozen uh cabbage for um for mastis p and like cooling ice pack sort of thing I was like what in God's name does that have to do with cancer or cardiovascular disease I mean good Lord and um oh but it's randomized control trial of nothing you know so um but yeah so I went through these and I was just like I was like all right I went through the the U the studies used in the metaanalysis and one of them was from Costa Rica and they looked at you know a few thousand patients that have survived a heart attack and they looked at a a lot of different things but one of the more one of the things they looked at was how many you know fruits and vegetables and things like that they ate now if you're eating more fruits and vegetables and you're told that that's healthy it's called healthy user bias you're more likely to do other other things that that could be healthy like exercise like not smoke not drink not eat sugar not eat processed food you're eating whole plants you're not eating junk uh processed garbage processed plants really and uh you know so all these things um have an effect and so uh it was saying that and and and it concluded that oh look at this yeah eating more plants is is is better for uh protecting you from cardiovascular disease okay so you look at it and they found that yes there were different groups some had less uh plants in their diet some had more and uh whole plants and they people can find this you know my my thing on lane nort on my channel I go into more detail with it and show the studies and things and um but uh in those different groups the one that ate the most plants um had had lower you know they were they were out of all the people that had survived the heart attack they were sort of the lowest amounts okay so they had less heart attacks so first of all less they had less people survive the heart attacks because they don't tell you how many died because you can't give a survey to a dead person so they don't they don't know uh so that's a problem as well but of the people survived there were less people in that um plant group now there were people eating plants that were getting heart attacks though and the most important part of this though was that you look at the other factors the people that were in that group that were eating more plants they also had lower rates of diabetes ate far less sugar didn't smoke as much didn't drink as much ate on average 800 less calories a day than uh the than the lower U cortile that were that were're eating plants and um you know so all of these things add up and so just saying oh eating plants makes it better yeah you can't say that actually and in fact their own study showed that it wasn't that because there were certain plant toxins you know which we know are toxins because our bodies treat them as toxins by trying to detoxify them and people say oh no no but these toxins are really good like your body just doesn't know what it's had doesn't know what it's missing it's just it really should just have all this poison in its body all the time and you know you're just trying to get rid of it and it's obviously nature just you know screwed up and just has no clue this you know with a degree in in nutrition which is about as good as a degree in gender studies uh is uh is it knows more than you know God in nature and so um so they looked at that and they said that they looked at people that had a genetic difference in how to uh detoxify these things and so if they had an INE efficient enzyme to detoxify these specific plant toxins that um that they would have higher levels in their body and it would take longer to clear these out so they'd have a higher like if you're taking medication you just have a higher dose all the time and so they said oh okay so what did that do well it turns out that the people that had the inefficient enzym so they had higher levels of these plant toxins it was harder for the body to clear it they had more heart attacks right so so no uh plants don't protect you from heart disease um and uh or cancer or any of these other sorts of things and they've never proven any of that stuff one way or the other there are no cause and effect studies or relationships at all so when they make a statement like that uh tell them to back it up and then don't take garbage studies uh uh as an answer and don't just take a headline because that's what these headlines in the in the study said oh look plants lower CBD RIS no it doesn't your own data says it doesn't"

    "body": "hi Dr chaffy insulin uh is it a growth hormone or a fat hormone how does it affect different organs it is grow it is it is a um an anabolic hormone so it causes growth it forces energy into cells it forces energy into fat cells as well so things can be uh cause growth of many different organs and tissue um it's not just one or the other insulin is an extremely busy hormone it affects over 100 different processes in your body and one of of those is by you know driving energy into cells but that is probably the least of what insulin does is massively important um massively important hormone so it is the fat storage hormone it also stores uh protein energy in muscles as well but again over a hundred different things it does over a 100 different things and it does store fat so without insulin you cannot store fat your fat cells cannot grow cannot period right so type 1 diabetics they could eat 50,000 calories in a day 50 million calories a day for that matter they will not put on fat they will not be able to store uh weight and fat they just waste away and waste away until they die unless they get insulin or the original treatment was ketogenic carnivore diets 100 years ago50 years ago that was the only treatment that was the only way to keep these people alive type one and type two diabetics that was the that was the only treatment until um was it Banting that figured out um um figured out uh um you know insulin and things like that and uh and was able to was able to help uh people actually replaced insulin when they when they weren't able to make it and that that changed the whole dynamic and they started go oh well now you need carbs because now you have insulin so um then you have people with insulinomas so again if you don't have insulin you can't can't store fat so lower insulin lower fat storage period it's a scale just it's just a slope and um and then um and then uh then people have like an insulinoma which is a tumor that secretes insulin and that produces massive amounts of insulin they just they just can't stop storing that energy right so they get enormously obese it doesn't matter what they eat and and they feel horrible because their metabolism is low as hell they don't have energy to actually burn and use for their brain and their body so they just feel oh miserable all the time and they're just getting fatter and fatter and fatter it doesn't matter what they do and that's because insulin is so hot so you need insulin at a correct level you have no insulin you die you have too much insulin you die so you need to have that Goldilocks level right and long before you die in either direction you're you're causing harm and your body's not working properly again over 100 different processes in your body you need insulin at the right level if it gets spiked up because of your blood sugar it's going to it's going to all of a sudden be out of balance for all of these other sorts of things right and then you start getting in some resistance and it's going up and you're always at this heighten level and you're always out of balance for all these different mechanisms in your body and then you eat and it bang it goes up even more so uh very very important to uh get that at the right level it's a I do look up uh the the actions of insulin it's it's actually remarkable how many different things uh that insulin effects it's it's absolutely wild so once you look at that and you just go like keeping that in in check don't want that uh to to go crazy"

    "body": "member asks do fasting insulin and glucose tests reliably help diagnose types diabetes and insulin resistance mine are vastly different uh when measured at 7 a.m. and versus 5 p.m. yeah that happens my glucose is always 6ish at 7 a.m. and high fours around 500m despite being keto carnivore omad at uh 100 PM uh morning fasting insulin is high as well thank you um so first of all insulin resistance takes time to come down but it does come down you know if you're if you're ketogenic especially and and not having seed oils and all these sorts of things so you know Carnival being sort of the best way to do do that um but it takes time you know it's not it's not going to happen right away um it's it they are fairly good tests and um you know there are other there are other markers that uh that I look at when I'm just looking at overall health but specifically for insulin resistance yeah you would be looking at your fasting insulin but the thing is that like you said you have you have different measurements at different times of the day you know you have something called the dawn effect where you're going to have a higher um blood sugar in the morning just because you have higher cortisol in the morning you have your biggest dose of cortisol first thing in the morning cortisol will raise your blood sugar and so that's that's um very typical to see a higher blood sugar reading first thing in the morning then later on the afternoon especially if you're you know fasting throughout the day uh or eating a ketogenic uh meal throughout the day uh especially with high fat so it it's just a matter of just sort of being consistent and so if you test your blood sugar in the morning okay well you're not you're not getting like a false you know sense of security that um you know you're doing it later in the day when your cortisol is low and this is the lowest your your blood Chu is ever going to be it's like okay well that that's great but you know at other points is higher so you know you you will find that eventually your blood sugar in the morning will be uh you know between four and five you know that's a that's a you know really ideal range for fasting blood sugar first thing in the morning and then fasting insulin will also come down as well uh remember that poor sleep and high stress will raise cortisol will raise insulin resistance raise blood sugar and do all these sorts of things but you know your blood sugar is coming down to you know uh you know into the fours during the day so you know it it looks like your body is um is uh you know is responding to this and I think it will just keep getting getting better um you're saying their fasting insulin is high I don't I don't know how high that is but the point is is is to look at the trend so you look at what it is now and then check it again in three months and see where that fasting insulin is check it at the same time every day so first thing in the morning between 8 and 9 am fasting from the night before 900 p.m. no stress no exercise no sexual activity for 48 hours before the test and you don't eat or drink anything besides water first thing in that morning before you take your test but you do take at least two glasses of water you want the same hydration status as well because that can change these um these tests as well don't take any medications until after the test as well don't drink any coffee Etc all these things can can screw with your your test results it's very important to keep this consistent and then you can get more you you can trust your your uh your test better than more reliable so always look for the trend uh don't get too concerned about you know what your what each individual data point is you want a lot of data points so you can see the trend in the graph and all that sort of stuff and remember that if you average four to five hours of sleep at night after seven days you will give yourself pre-diabetes because of the cortisol uh cortisol Spike and if you're stressed out all the time and worried all the time you're going to spike your cortisol as well you're going to spike your blood pressure you're going to do all these other sorts of things you're going to spike your blood sugar and so you know you it's food is a major part of this but it's not the only part and so you have to you have to have take a holistic approach and look at all of these these uh factors together and try to optimize your health completely and then just get data points you know every couple months you te you test those again they will improve you look for the trend and the trend is that they're going down things are going well if they're not going down okay figure out why they're not going down well is there anything you can change in your diet or using dairy or this that and the other are you just lion diet yes you are just Lion Okay well it's not that how's your sleep going how's your stress levels going things like that there outside influences what about medications that could affect this as well so um you know that's how you troubleshoot that but um but until you sort of see the trend you may not even know you may not even have anything to troubleshoot could all just be going perfectly fine so you know do take a look at that and I'm sure you'll do fine I all my patients that I track and say hey get proper sleep reduce stress Eat This Way their blood sugar and Insulin just come right down and so you'll do you' ll do fine"

    "body": "member asks what is the scene uh behind not being depressed anymore Since switching to carnivore it's amazing well that's great I'm really glad to hear that um it's uh it's something we're finding out more and more in the mental health space you know there are professors from Harvard such as Chris Palmer Dr Chris Palmer and Dr George eat who have and and then many others Dr Rachel Brown over in the UK uh and many many more that're now sort of terming themselves metabolic psychiatrists and and they're treating these very serious mental health issues with diet and lifestyle and fixing the metabolism fixing the mitochondria and this is actually fixing the brain and how it works and so this is something that that so many people are finding that you know they go to a carnivore diet and their mental health issues uh improve dramatically even even on top of ketogenic diets because I've I've seen many patients that have um been keto high fat keto and that's improved a lot but they still had um uh serious anxiety and depression issues and it wasn't until they dropped the plants entirely that that they got better U as well so these plant toxins can cause you know neuroinflammation and and disruption of your of your uh you know normal Communications in your brain and and you can manifest that as mental health issues uh Dr Palmer talks about the importance of mitochondrial function and how being in a ketogenic State you get uh massively uh massive increase in both the number and quality of the m Andria specifically in the brain all over your body but also including the brain and this makes your brain run better and and you don't have these issues and so they are reversing things like schizophrenia o CD bipolar major depression major anxiety ADHD even autism you know there are studies showing that in entire treatment groups that are using uh ketogenic carnivore diets to treat autism and it's helping even in adults but it's better the younger you get them because then when the brain still developing and forming you can actually undo um a lot of it and and make the brain work much much better and um which is great it's fantastic my friend Jonathan Griffith he's a bodybuilder in the UK and um you know has a in Instagram YouTube channel we've been on each other's podcasts and things like that and great guy and in the middle of one of our conversations he just said uh know autism came up and he just said uh well you know actually that he had autism and I would not have guessed that I I would not have guessed that at all and he said that a year ago you know before he started a carnivore diet he would not have been able to have the conversation that we were having right then which is just amazing and so he's he's a he's know he's a full-grown adult and yet that improved the functionality of his brain to the extent that he was perfectly normal functioning uh which is amazing it's so good to see and if you get that in children it's going to be an even more profound effect uh which is fantastic so yeah so that it is it is wonderful to see that and again it's just these disease they just they just get better you know when you fix people's diet it's amazing and so we have clinical trials in humans showing that high fat meat-based ketogenic diets improve uh treatment resistant psychiatric disorders like all the ones I named even schizophrenia which is crazy that that helps but it's amazing um and uh and after a few weeks you know um the study with that George Eid was part of uh happened in France they had 31 patients with treatment resistance uh major serious issues been treated for a decade 15 years 20 years sometime no no help from standard of care medications and counseling didn't get go anywhere and they they agreed to go on a ketogenic diet 28 28 of them stuck with it for at least three weeks and every single one improved and um and I think it was two-thirds of them actually went into complete remission after Decades of suffering I mean it's just incredible so I'm really glad to see that that's helped you as well and uh do check out the interviews I've done with Dr Chris Palmer and Dr George Eid they both written books on the subject uh Dr Palmer's is uh called brain energy and Dr eids is called uh change your diet change your mind amazing books and amazing people and amazing interviews I really really really enjoy talking to both of them so do check that out and if anybody is suffering from you know mental health issues or knows someone who is those are really really important uh interviews to get to them or books to get to them sometimes it's harder to read a whole book unless you're motivated you but you might be able to to sit down and watch something for an hour anyway and both the the George Eid and um Chris Palmer ones are roughly an hour so not one of my massive three-hour ones uh so hope that helps but I'm really glad to hear that you're doing better and and I hope that continues and do check out those those interviews I think you'll find them very interesting"

    "body": "member asks how should we prepare for the upcoming famine uh plan Demi 2.0 uh bird flu already in the works apparently uh they'll put down uh billions of livestock and cause global famine and force plants and Grains on us well you know they they've definitely been uh threatening to kill a lot of livestock and say this is you know this has this has to go because of you know whatever reason and um so I think it's know not a bad idea to a have your own livestock if you can do that out in the country and just get the hell away from all that craziness um and then not be reliant on the food system you're just relying on yourself um hunting good option as well and um just getting a couple um you know big freezer chests and U you know buying a couple you know a cow or two and just stocking your whole freezers uh with a with a whole cow and or two cows depending on the size of your family and how much you guys eat and uh and see if you can just weather the storm and get through it I I was thinking that last year actually actually a year ago two years ago I was thinking maybe I should buy like a whole cow or two and I wish I did because but prices have doubled since then you know so um I'm I'm actually absolutely thinking of going down that route and um you know just I have one ice chest freezer I thinking about doing a couple more and uh and just you know getting a couple cows and uh just spilling it up and just having that and and maybe just have that as the as the emergency fund and um you know keep getting meat as it as it's available and then as soon as that stops like right well you know I've got I've got my backup you know so it's not quite doomsday prepping but it's just you know being a little more uh having a bit more uh you know foresight and the thing is too is that even if that never comes to fruition you've got just a ton of meat of high quality meat that's you know going to last and you can you can have for years and um that's not a bad thing I either so uh yeah it's it's a bit we're we're in we're in strange times and you know as soon as we figured out how to heal ourselves we're we're getting told that we're not allowed to heal ourselves which is you know it's a it's a bit telling really you know it sort of tells you everything you need to know and uh so for me uh I'm not going to stop eating me and so I'm going to I'm I'm planning ahead and going to probably stock things up not everybody can do that but you know buying a cow if you're able to get one in one time it's always the cheapest option it is so much cheaper than then buying it any any other way and just buying you know individual Stakes are the most expensive way to do it you buy a whole riy loin and you cut that up yourself easily half the price if not less and um and then you buy the whole cow and it's half that price Al on top of that so it uh it makes a big difference uh even just to you know just to supporting this way of eating in the first place that's a good idea to buy a whole cow and um and and then you just eat that for the next year or two you know depending I mean a family of four can live on one cow for an entire year right and so if you are an individual that'll probably last you two years you know so and and it's much cheaper to do it that way especially when you're going directly to a farmer um and it helps them because they make more money from it as well so those are my thoughts on that and um but hopefully hopefully it doesn't doesn't show up but you know it's better to be prepared and not need to have your intervention than to be caught with that one so yeah good good to good to think ahead hopefully it doesn't doesn't come up but don't just assume it won't because then you're going to be stuck and that's the other thing too don't let it happen everybody needs everybody has a voice and everybody can push back on this you know you just say hey you know you don't get to kill all these animals there's no reason to kill these animals we're not going to we're going to protest we're going to push back we're going to fight this you call your Senators call your Congressman call your MPS and say hey this is you know I'm not I'm not we're not we're not dealing with this anymore we're going to vote your ass out you know we're going to protest and we're not going to deal with it we're not going to listen to you you know straighten up and so if enough people do that you know we in the western societies we still you know we still can affect our own destiny to a certain degree it's not as much as it used to be because they've been ratcheting down the you know the the thumb screws of of authoritarianism for decades now just slowly but surely just turning it up year after year over the last century and um you know so we're in a we're in a much tighter spot than we were previously but you know we still do have some say and so if you you don't have to just sit back and take it if we get this spread out there me and enough people are like absolutely not you're not taking our meat Supply away that's you know we're not we don't believe you um you know they they can't really do it without our permission for a lot of these things unless they go full authoritarianism and then that's time that you uh kick them out and start again so all right good luck with that hopefully hopefully uh we were able to uh prevent that from happe ning"

    "body": "member asks how to start eating a carnivore diet focused mainly uh ground beef without getting food aversions almost immediately well some people really enjoy that you know it depends on how you cook it depends on how much fat is in it if you're getting much more higher fat content in the ground beef like 5050 6040 ground beef uh from your butcher special made tastes amazing it tastes way better than uh even the 7030 stuff certainly you know 80 85 90 937 sort of nonsense I mean that's just I mean you're just you're just cooking a brick it's disgusting it this does not taste very good and that sort of tells you your brain's just like no you need something else here you need fat um so that lean me is not that good also you cook ground beef well done doesn't taste all that appealing So you you're doing patties it's like medium rare to rare much better going to taste much better can be much more interesting and and um you can also if you're okay with dairy putting a bit of sour cream or yogurt or a slice of cheese on those patties that can potentially uh make it a bit more interesting as well but I think Dairy should be used very sparingly and only as a condiment and there are a lot of people that really just don't uh do well with it at all especially people with autoimmune diseases and if you're trying to lose weight good idea to avoid dairy in general it's a it's a classic weight loss stall on Carnivore uh is dairy so just be mindful of that you know cook it you know find a way to cook it that you enjoy get much fattier meat melt butter into it tastes a lot better with that"

you can point out you just ask him it's like okay do we get rid of all the all the predators in the world 70% of all animal species are carnivores and their predators and say okay so we get rid of them you know we kill all the fish kill all the whales kill all the birds kill all the dolphins kill all the lions kill all the hyenas and the and the foxes and wolves and all these sorts of things and the Bears and they'll just say no well that's just part of Nature and it's like well yes we're part of nature too we don't exist outside of Nature and also you kill 25 times more sentient animals sentient animals than uh um than you do eating meat by by eating crops to grow one pound of plant-based protein you have to kill 25 times the number of sentient animals than to grow one pound of animal-based protein from from large livestock animals like cows and sheep so uh no you know there's no such thing as a bloodless meal and um you know they may remove them have be one step removed you know from that killing but that doesn't mean there's not killing involved and say well you know it's incidental if you're driving on a road you hear all these stupid scenarios no something died and you're responsible for that death and so you own up for it and you own it and just say yes you know we did and I respect this animal and respect their life and I'm going to give them as as good a life as possible as clean a death as as there can be and um and and respect them and appreciate them as opposed to just you know putting my fingers in my ears and and pretending that this isn't happening because it is you know when you grow a single crop you necessarily have to destroy an entire ecosystem you have to kill every plant and every animal that's in that area and grow one crop you destroy the soil you destroy the the soil's microbiome you kill all the plants you kill all the the weeds that come up you kill all the insects that are trying to eat it in America alone with the spraying of pesticides and insecticides we kill over one quadrillion insects every year that's just in America that's the base of the food chain so how many billions of birds and lizards and other sorts of smaller animals that rely on those bugs and insects for for food and life die out starve to death or don't exist in the first place because their parents couldn't get enough food to then support uh babies and eggs right um you're using those those pesticides insecticides that that hurts and injures 700 billion Birds a year just in America and um or was it billions million yeah uh 7 700 million birds in America and about a tenth of those die so you know around 68 million Birds die every year from these pesticides that we spray on crops um we shoot the deer and the pigs and the moose and the other animals that come in the big Harvest um Harvesters just chew up and rip apart all the little animals that are in the crops and you know all the the bunnies and the squirrels and the mice and the snakes and the even deer they're out there in the corn field just get just chewed up and mowed down and chopped to Pieces um you know in these big combine Harvesters and um you know it's pretty you know it's pretty it's pretty wild it's pretty uh destructive um 55% of borneo's rainforests were bulldozed for Palm crops palm seed oil crops so they killed all the orangutans all the snakes all the birds everything they destroy this entire habitat and they bulldozed these things and there are videos and pictures of these orangutans falling out of these trees they bulldoze these trees orangutans fall out and crash and just shatter themselves break their spine and just suffering and just die slowly over the next few days you know it's just disgusting in you know what they're they're doing um for these these crops and then you the vegans will say well no but you yes you you you destroyed this whole you know virgin rainforest but then they replace it with trees so you know same same no it's not same same that's a monocrop that's not an ecosystem and all the and all those animals are dead now you've killed them and then the animals that try to move in and and uh eat that crop because that's why they're there um they get shot right because they're messing with these people's money so uh no it's it's actually extremely immoral to grow crops it's dreme extremely destructive to grow crops it's immoral you're killing 25 times the number of sentient animals you're destroying the E the ecological base of the food chain and and killing quadrillions tens 50 you know you know dozens of quadrillions of uh insects all around the world and and you are um responsible for losing 27.5 billion tons of top soil every single year it takes 500 years to grow a centimeter of top soil right that is a Vanishing resource you know Screw oil like top soil is what's going to run out next right and um you know and we're just when we're pretending that this isn't the case it's already been calculated that we probably only have about 50 growing Cycles left on planet Earth and we're trying to go more plant-based and speed that up right that's dumb right animals regenerate the land they regenerate the nutrients in the land they make top soil and you can run them on arable land which is 4% of the Earth's surface including water but you can also run them on Range land and Forest land which makes up another 25% of the Earth's surface right you can't grow crops on Range land or Forest land and you don't need to tear down the forest to put animals through it you can just you just run them through and they just eat what they eat right so and it's the animals that replenish the nutrients in the soil actually makes the the land more fertile in the first place you cannot have plant agriculture without animal agriculture you have to have it you have to have those nutrients coming from those animals you can't get away from that and and plant agriculture destroys the planet destroys the um the ecosystem destroys the uh animals so no it's actually evil and disgusting to eat plants and you should uh tell them that that they sicken you and uh you don't want to hear anything from morally bankrupt people that are trying to destroy the planet maybe leave that last part out do what you want"

    "body": "Member asks is lamb just as good as beef for strict carnivore or is beef a little better is grass-fed meat critical I have a hard time finding it thank you it's not critical it's object objectively has more micronutrients and has a better omega-3 to Omega 6 profile but it's not critical I mean a lot of people are doing extremely well on on grain finished beef grain finished beef or lamb and so I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about that if it's not accessible to you it is you know really really like that's the best is grass-fed and finish regeneratively raised beef right or Wild mastedon would really be the the top notch but it's um it's not it's not critical it's not like no you have to do this you can't do it any other way no just eat the meat that you enjoy that makes you feel good that you have access to and that you can afford and so if that's grass-fed beef for some people that's great and if it's grain fed beef then fine and if that's pork chicken fish and eggs for other people that's fine too so just it but any meat is going to be better than every plant because all meat is good for you while every plant causes harm so but yes there are there are better or less good uh types of meat so lamb is is pretty much just as good um Salsbury back in the 1800s when he was telling people to go on a just a red meat and water diet he thought that beef was definitely the best and lamb was a distant second and I think that's probably due to age of the meat back then back then they weren't they weren't um you know H I don't I don't think they they ate the steers um when they were you know like yearlings like they do now and so they maybe didn't have enough time to to build up as much nutrients and um so that might be part of it but he thought that beef was definitely better um you know the younger the younger the animal the less time in has to sort of build up nutrients in the body so that could be that could be part of it so um having having um younger animals may not be as nutrient intense I certainly found that the 10-year-old cow that I got was just delicious it was had really very rich beefy flavor it wasn't gy or anything like that it just had more beef flavor there was like overpowered other steaks that I had I I couldn't even taste the beef flavor in those other steaks I think what that what you're tasting there are the all the nutrients that you get out of the meat that's that's what the taste is you're saying you know that's good those are good nutrients and that's what that strong flavor was so in that sense you know an older Animal I think would be better and um you know but that was you know grass-fed and finished for 10 years and had only eaten grass its whole life so you know that's probably why that was that was as good as it was but you know if you if you like lamb you enjoy lamb and you feel good on lamb eat lamb it's great uh Primal Mike uh says how exactly does dietary fat absorption work if the digestion is not disturbed by artificial sweeteners or other factors is all that fat either converted um to BHB or excreted or maybe stored well your your body's really only going to be able to absorb fat uh from your diet with if you have enough bile and if everything is digested properly and then bile emulsifies it then it's absorbed into your lymphatic system as kyom microns it actually bypasses your liver because things go to your liver I either either to get detoxified before it hits the rest of your body uh and or convert it into fat and U for for storage and utilization but if it's already fat your body's like yep get it in that's what we want um that's the important stuff and when you run out of bile then you really can't do that it's very difficult for your body to absorb fat um after that you can absorb a small amount but it's very small amount it's mostly medium chain triglycerides MCTS so when they get into your body your body utilizes them you I I just don't think for a second that your body makes a random amount of B so you get a random amount of fat and then oh my God you've eaten too much and then your body just stores that as fat because you've eaten too much well wouldn't absorb it if it was too much and your body didn't want it so if if your metabolism is low and your body's uh you know thinking that you've been in a famine you need to rebuild up your stores yeah it might store a bit you know a bit of fat this is what those yo-yo diets do people are just chronically starving themselves and burning themselves out their metabolism just bottoms out and then they start eating normally again and their bodies you know so the body thinks that they're in a famine and the metabolism goes down to survive through a famine that's what all animal too um plants do this when they're in a drought they they they slow down the different metabolic processes that require water uh in order to survive we do that all animals do that as well metabolism slows down and we store our fat and and hang on to our fat stores very jealously and then when we start eating food again our body say okay that needs to go into fat we need to you know might be the next famine is right around the corner maybe we're still in a famine you just got a chance to eat so we need toore just hang on to this we're going to keep that metabolism low um and so you might put on fat so you know your body's going to decide you know what it uses for energy what it uses for fat what it uses for you know building blocks of material and um so just I just let it you know our bodies know a hell of a lot more about you know what it's doing than than we do like we're never going to understand things to the extent that our body can you know we're making billions trillions of calculations every second um on exactly how to keep everything in Balance like you think you're going to figure that out I don't think so it's never going to happen and trying to figure well just this this very simple equation one gram of this to one gr it's never going to be that easy your body knows um your body knows what it's doing though so you don't you don't need to figure it out what you need to figure out is that our bodies know what the hell is going on and so if you're eating what you're supposed to eat your body's going to do what it's supposed to do it's going to absorb the amount of fat that it wants to absorb almost all of the rest of it's going to go out and then your body's going to use that maybe store some of it for later use because that's what it does you put gas in the gas tank and then you run on that throughout the day and the week and the month and so um that's supposed to happen that's normal the only time you're going to absorb more fat than your body wants and store excess fat on top of what your body thinks it should is if you do something silly like take Ox bile and then you're forcing your body to absorb more fat than than actually is designed to and then you can then you'll yeah you'll store fat and that will um that will not be what you want necessarily"

    "body": "member says a popular Health blogger recently stated that beef fat from grain-fed cows can lead to fatty liver how important do you think 100% grass-fed is and why would he say that I don't know why he said that um I don't agree with it um you know if you had you know grain finish you know it might be higher linolic acid you know maybe you could you could argue uh that that that that contributes I don't know you know what sort of evidence they have um one thing I have heard by from Dr lustig was that you know he's mentioned um some studies that Associated grain finished beef uh having higher BCAAs the branch chain amino acids and those had some sort of correlation with fatty liver um but I didn't he he mentioned these but it didn't have links to the studies he was talking about so I don't know if uh which ones he was talking about directly but the ones I found I tried to look that up um they they were just sort of just associative studies that weren't really uh very strong and so at least those ones I didn't I didn't I wasn't all that convinced by them and so you know you never know I don't think that um uh I'm not too worried anyway and you know I've been eating you know grass grass-fed beef for years and years and years I I I I've found a source of um grass finished beef now it's actually um be a new sponsor that that I'm bringing on now it's called Stockman stakes and they're just here in Australia Unfortunately they don't ship to the states or or elsewhere at the moment but they might later and they um they do just grass-fed grass finish P raised meat beef and other meat so you know that's great you know so I'm I'm going to be getting that and so I've started ordering from them more and if you want to do that they can actually check them out it's just Stockman stakes. com.au and you can use discount code chaffy you get like a free bag of mints or something like that uh or or something you know there's like a free gift involved right now it's it's mints and they have like fatti ear cuts and things like that for carnivore people and you can just buy chunks of grass fed beef fat and uh carnivore um mince like ground beef is going to be has a bit of organs in it and a lot more fat it's like 75 35 so you know i' up until basically now you know I've been eating you know grain finished beef predominantly I don't have fatty liver all my liver function tests are perfect in my patient population I don't tell them they have to do grass finish to tell them it's the best but you know most most people can't afford it or or don't have access to it I don't have anybody with deranged liver function I don't have anybody that has has um gotten fatty liver as a result of going carnivore I think there all the other things that you eat along with it that's causing fatty liver I don't think it's I don't think it's the cow itself and um at least I haven't seen it and um the other things that you're doing are also going to mitigate any of these damages because you gotten rid of all these things you got I mean fructose directly causes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that's been proven in uh studies with biochemically but also in studies with um uh in humans in pediatric population shown reversal of metabolic syndrome and fatty liver disease by just the removal of fructose and and still keeping carbohydrates and not losing weight right so you know that's um that that satisfied the Bradford Hill criteria for causation and um and then alcohol obviously causes fatty liver disease and that's why fructose causes fatty liver disease because fructose and alcohol are metabolized into the same uh byproducts as um yeah fructose as each other right and so part of that metabolization is is dropping out a fatty droplet and that gets stuck in the liver and that built up so I don't know I've heard that I've heard that claim before I don't really buy it and I certainly haven't seen it in my patient population you know if you're if you're eating grain finished beef and um you know most people's fatty liver disease goes away you know that's what happens um if you start to develop this and and you don't know why fine you know switch to Grass finish beef and see how you go I mean that's that's definitely the Pinnacle you know if you're having any issues that's where you go from there as you go to grass-fed and finished but um you know I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about it uh Tony uh pemsel from Facebook says Hi I atherosclerosis is carnivore safe for me type two diabetic CAC score of 10 and uh non-alcoholic fatty liver disease it's not only safe for you it is uh probably essential for you it will reverse your type two diabetes and uh and your non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as we just said your CAC score that can go up or down for a lot of different reasons U it's only looking at the the hard plaque the calcified plaque not the soft plaque so we don't know how much soft plaque you have and um and so you know could be that you have a lot of soft plaque and if that starts receding but it starts calcifying at the same time your CAC score can go up even though your soft plaque is going down or your CAC score can go down while your soft plaque is going up there's really no way to tell um but it is it is pretty good um useful information anyway and a c a score of 10 is very low so uh yes um oror that is safe for you and it's going to be healthy for you it's going to be healthy and safe for everyone because this is really is our biological diet this is just how we're we're we're built and um uh so you know we're purpose built to eat meat and we get harmed from eating plants it's pretty much th at simple"

    "body": "hello Dr chaffy my wife who has Crohn's disease started carnivore about three weeks ago she is gaining weight and very concerned she only eats beef eggs fatty pork and coffee nothing else what can be the reason for her weight going up well it's uh you know as I was talking about earlier uh in this talk you know talking about metabolism you know when you're starving yourself starving yourself and chronically undereating you actually slow your metabolism down and then you all of a sudden you get real food in your body oh thank goodness like okay we're going to store on hang on to this you can also put on muscle bone things like that three weeks you know you will you know sort of tighten up the muscles but you know it could be that she actually is putting on fat there's there are metabolic reasons for this and hormonal reasons for this there are some people that put on weight early on or even ongo for about six months or more in some cases um and this is largely hormonal so you know you can check things out you sort of see how our thyroids doing um um check her leptin and her fasting insulin these sorts of things are good indicators of her metabolism and is her metabolism in a in a depressed state or in an active State the higher the insulin is the lower her metabolism is the higher her leptin is the lower her metabolism is and the more difficult is going to be to lose weight even on a carnivore diet but the good news is is that on a carnivore diet a ketogenic carnivore diet so no carbs no sugar nothing like that no artificial sweeteners and no Dairy that comes down fasting insulin comes down relatively quickly and fasting lefting comes down more slowly but it happens and it's when that comes down significantly and the metabolism improves then you start seeing more of the weight loss so it's very important to think about this as a as a medical intervention this is for her health first and foremost so for the Crohn's disease I would really stick to just beef I would cut out the eggs and the pork and definitely the coffee all those things can be pro-inflammatory can trigger her Crohn's disease if she just goes red meat and water so the ruminant Meats like beef lamb goat and venison she will have a much better response to this I mean she'll improve dramatically just doing that but she will have far better results if she cuts out everything except uh ruminant meat the beef and the lamb things like that that and and just water no coffee she will do best on that hands down and so doing that seeing how her Crohn's is doing making sure she's doing well also you know if she's on medications for the Crohn's like prazone Picone other cortico steroids she's going to gain weight because that's those medications make you do that but hopefully she'll be able to come off those medications by doing these dietary interventions and basically putting her Crohn's disease into remission which it does I mean that's in that's in the that's in the clinical literature that people going on Elemental diet where you're just eating macros and micros you need nothing else that this is a better treatment for an acute flare up of Crohn's than prazone right so it's just not eating certain things is a better treatment than steroids right so that's showing that cause and effects relationship as well you know you remove something the problem goes away you bring it back the problem comes back that's a and affect relationship so focus on her health you know focus on getting better focus on the Crohn's going away the weight will come the weight will happen if you're worried about it you know check the leptin check the insulin check the thyroid check her her vitamins minerals B12 D3 those sorts of things or or d25 those things are uh very uh useful to the body and most people are very deficient and so you just just optimize these things you optimize her health getting a bit of liver every now and then and make sure that her she's not at some critically low nutritional State and then you just let her body get on with it and she will lose weight you know she will it just may take time and if her lepin is elevated shouldn't really be above five and um you know then that's you know that's going to take time to come down it's going to take more time for her to lose weight it just is um so I would just check those things out and just be a bit patient with it um it's about healing it's about health first and foremost this is not you know this isn't a crash diet to just try to lose weight um it's it's about optimizing your health and when you know you get your health improved your weight tends to improve as well um and remember that muscle and bone also have weight and so you can improve your lean body mass percentage and you can gain weight or not lose any weight and you're losing fat at the same time so you go by how you feel first and foremost very secondarily you go by body composition how your clothes are fitting Etc never do you worry about the scale right if you are putting on fat Okay um likely metabolic issue hormonal issue all the rest just give it time you know the most important thing is is putting nutritious food in the body and allowing it to heal it needs it needs to heal we've been hurting our bodies for decades we need we need to give it time to uh to let let that undo the body fat percentage comes with that but it comes with the healing it's not necessarily the first thing that happens for a lot of people it goes along with it and it happens really early not everybody and those are some of the hormonal reasons why that can be and um you know women tend to do more of the starvation yo-yo dieting sort of things and then going back to carbs and sugar and things like that and then starving themselves and that and they tend to be the ones that are that have a bit more difficult of a time uh losing all the weight because they they sort of that that sort of behavior can really trash your metabolism so just give it time focus on health focus on really healing the Crohn's disease stick to beef lamb and water and um you know you can check you can check those Bloods if you want to and uh and just to give you an idea but eventually it'll happen make sure you're eating enough as well chronically undereating even if you're eating the right thing will again tell your body that you're in a famine your body say no we gotta hang on to this so eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good don't eat anything else try to stick to beef and lamb and just give it time it's this is a long game it's not uh you know it's slow and steady wins the race okay and good l uck to her"

    "body": "member says your thoughts on polyunsaturated fatty acids Omega 6es and inflammatory yeah I think that there's a lot of um evidence to that uh to that um uh to those being pro-inflammatory and there's others going in the other direction and you know who do you trust well you know uh I trust biology and Physiology and um evolutionary biology and um you know how much do we normally have in our body and our system not much less than 2% one to two% and the um Omega sixes that we we get from meat are things like Arad IC acid which yeah we do need but only in a small amount um we don't need linolic acid at all we only need linolic acid that's the plant version of omega-6 is if we don't have enough arachadonic acid then we turn lenic acid into arachadonic acid but it's um you know you sneeze and and you mutate this stuff it's very unstable it can cause neuroinflammation and breakdown products and free radicals in the brain causing distress to the brain um Dr Georgia e talked about this she's a psychiatrist from Harvard and how omega-6 is lenic acid specifically is quite toxic uh to the brain causes neuroinflammation and and so for her field and in Psychiatry um she's she's very much against it and you know these polyunsaturated fats you know as we've increased these things and decreased animal fats and saturated fats um you know heart disease rates have gone up Alzheimer's has gone up cancers have gone up all these other things have gone up these are all associations but it's not going the other way animal fats goes the other way as we've reduced animal fat consumption over the 20th century and into the 21st century heart disease rates and non-communicable chronic diseases cancers uh Strokes Alzheimer's autoimmunity they've all gone up right so that's that's an inverse relationship so we know it's not that we know it has nothing to do with meat fat and and animal fat I should say um how much of a role does Omega 6 play and the polysaturated fats play I think probably a significant role uh but it all comes down to the the over overarching premise of we're eating things that don't belong in our body we're eating things that don't belong to our species and we're getting sick as a consequence and Omega 6 is are part of that you know you're eating these things out of proportion of what we would in nature what we've ever done in our biological past and we're getting harm that's all there is to it um Dr Chris Kenobi has written a whole book on this he thinks that that's the main driver of disease nowadays is is the omega-6s and the polyunsaturated fatty acids you know these seed oils that were industrial lubricants you know like the Germans invented krisco I believe in 1911 they use it to like lubricate their uots the submarines that were going around in World War I and uh then they ended up selling the the recipe uh to Proctor and Gamble then Proctor and Gamble paid the American Heart Association $20 million in today's valuation to uh to lie and say that it was better for your heart than than animal fats so it's just like you know the this the aha I mean I literally just don't believe a word that they say everything they say is uh you have to hold and with a lot of contempt and scrutiny because they've just been there's so many examples of them being paid off by different Industries like the sugar like Proctor and Gamble and then the sugar companies um you know paid them to say to lie about things like the Framingham study and say that you know it said that um that uh uh cholesterol increased cholesterol cause was associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease mortality and was like no actually showed the opposite of that you know so that's that's um uh you know just a completely corrupt organization from the GetGo and you shouldn't believe a damn word they say there are also studies the only uh randomized control trials Interventional trials looking at LDL cholesterol polyunsaturated fats saturated fats and cardiovascular disease and mortality rates um there are three of them and they were all buried because they didn't give the the outcome that the authors wanted and and they admitted to that decades later when these got uncovered um and they found that replacing um saturated fat with polyunsaturated fats in one case linolic acid which is Omega 6 from plants that this did indeed lower uh LDL cholesterol but ended up killing pe a lot more people of from heart attacks and strokes from cardiovascular disease so what do you want is LDL just LDL just no nothing else just LDL causes heart disease right higher LDL causes heart disease okay well we lowered LDL and it lowered heart disease you know or sorry we lower we lowered LDL and increased heart disease right so that's not the case we had higher LDL with less heart disease with less heart attacks with less Strokes right and so you lower LDL and heart disease goes up Strokes go up heart attacks go up okay I've seen some people say like well you know all that shows is that linolic acid is worse than LDL okay well what do you want you know it's like you're saying that LDL causes heart disease okay so are you saying now that linolic acid causes heart disease as well okay well then then what you know when you when you're getting these polyunsaturated fats they come with a lot of linolic acid it's what the hell are you supposed to do right what are you supposed to eat that's natural first of all seed oils aren't natural you can't get those things naturally um and so you know what would we have been eating biologically that wouldn't kill us historically you know you got nothing you know and so you know this is is um it's a bit of a force you know it's just it's just a bit of a mess around you know there's there's nothing that that we're eating now that even existed 50,000 years ago besides meat it just isn't right and so you know the idea that that um we have to eat all these things that didn't exist you know 100 years ago let alone 50,000 years ago um is a bit is a bit ridiculous you know just we've just been unhealthy and miserable and dying of cancers and heart disease you know this whole no you know nature is you know the natural state of all life is is healthy because unhealthy species as a species they don't last and in fact they don't exist in the first place because they come from species that were healthy and survived and adapted to some situation and changed a bit and changed a bit and changed a bit so you know all life comes from those survived all life so we have to be descending from people who were healthy and if we're eating a lot of meat and exclusively meat for a long time we must have been healthy doing that and so uh now we are getting very sick as a population and we are hurting ourselves and yes we're surviving but it's very clear that we're getting a lot worse and it's not going to go very well and fertility rates are going down um diseases are going up and so we're you know if we were doing that during an Ice Age good luck making it through an ice age uh you know fat sick and miserable like that it 's not going to happen"

around so thank you that's really great to hear I'm really thank you very much for for that and thank you very much for sharing that um that's amazing I really appreciate that I'm really I'm really glad that my videos have helped it's sort of funny to think that my videos help anybody um it's just you know there's things that I think about and things I've come across and things I've found to be useful in my life and in in the life and health of my patients and my family and I think it's important that people know about these things and uh and and have the tools available to them to be healthy and not just sit around in misery and just you know get put on more and more medications and have have worse and worse outcomes I just I just you know obviously we're going in the wrong direction that way so something has to change and I'm really glad that people have been able to find this and and be brave enough to give it a try you know you see these people going oh this is this is garbage and all that sort of stuff and they're saying all these things they never tried it they have no idea you know they're they're too close-minded to actually look at the evidence with an open mind and actually think about things they have a discussion they just they just want you to be wrong because people like being right you know they like feeling like an authority you know if they don't have much power and control in their in their own life they feel a bit you know um you know battered around and and they don't feel like they have a lot of control over things in their life or a lot of authority in their life you know they see something like this and go oh that's it's calories in calories out oh plants you have to do that everyone knows this now they're in authority on something and now they get to tell you for sure and it's um you know it's it's um it's understandable it's it's just part of human nature but it it closes them off to something that could actually really help them and and it's sad it's sad to see that I don't get mad at them you know unless someone's like you know overtly rude to someone you know then then that pisses me off but then I'll say something about it but you know if people are just close-minded it's I actually just feel bad for them that they're not they're not willing to try something new and think about something in a different way they could potentially they will not there's no potential about it they will completely dramatically change their lives and their healths in a revolutionary sort of ways so thank you Damen for for that thank you for trying this out thank you for sharing this with your brother and and helping him as well you understand your Ripple effects of every single one of you is is so much more broad than you realize um you know I only have the reach that I have because you all have influence people around you and you've sent these videos to other people and you've talked to them about it and you've tried it yourself and you've had a great results with it and other people have seen that say what are you doing again what's that about you know and and um you know can you send me some resources on it that's the only reason that I have the reach that I have is because you all have influenced have been brave enough to try this yourself and that has influenced people around you to try for themselves that's the only reason this is not me doing I'm not doing anything you know you all are doing this it's your reach that's having an effect and so thank you all for doing that and being brave enough to try this and to to be that example for people in your family and in your in your spheres to uh to just give it be that Beacon of HK and say whoa Dave is looking great what what the hell happened Dave you lost like 100 pounds it's like yeah just been doing this meat diet isn't that crazy I feel great off all my blood pressure medications not diabetic anymore I'm going to the gym and everything's great in my life you know and so you know people see that and they they want that for themselves and so you know uh thank you all for being open-minded most people in here have come from like a vegan vegetarian background and they've been sick and they've been unwell and they've s like okay this isn't working what the hell else is going on the intentions are there you know the good intentions are there you want the right thing for your yourself and your family for the planet for the animals all these things we're all on the same page about um but then you realize like okay you know doing it with a vegan diet actually that doesn't actually help me or the planet or the animals as much as I thought it did Um this can do it better so you know please you know if anybody else has had you know similar experiences please write down in the comments you know let us know what sort of issues you helped you know do you were you coming from a vegan background or a vegetarian background or a plant-based background or a sad background most people say the only benefits that people get from carnivore is because they go from a standard processed food diet and they cut out the processed food and they go meat based which is just projection like that's the only benefit you get from going vegan is if you cut out the processed food it's not cutting out the meat that doesn't give any benefits to anybody ever at any time um it's cutting out the other garbage and they have that honeymoon period where they feel a bit better and they cut out alcohol and cigarettes and sugar and all that sort of stuff and they think oh got rid of meat and I'm feeling great no you got rid of crap and then you're feeling great unfortunately you threw the baby out with the bath water so please leave a comment if that was you you know see what you come you know where you came from um you know they say like oh only people coming from a standard process through down I'm like no that's not it there's people doing vegan vegetarian plant-based diets um or just eating like a like a healthy clean omnivorous diet and they cut out the plants and it just revolutionizes their health and uh that happened for me that's happened for my family that's happened for my patients and that's happening for hundreds of thousands of people millions of people around the world now so please uh let us know in the comments you know were you were you um from the standard food diet or were you from a PL based di where did you come from because I think a lot of this is uh people coming from uh healthy diets um or that they thought were healthy diets and um did as hard as they could you know did everything they could to be healthy and then you know they weren't they weren't as healthy as they could be they did they went to a meat-based diet animal-based diet carnivore diet and they became healthy then so you know do let people know and let everyone else know like hey it's not just cutting out processed foods that's that's the benef it's just it's just going to meat and cutting out everything else all these other things can cause harm it's not just processed foods and processed foods are plants anyway they're all processed plant Foods you know and uh and always remember that the most rigorously study diet on Earth with the highest levels of evidence with randomized control trials with Interventional trials in both humans and animals is the key to genic diet ketogenic diet is just cutting out carbs what do you replace carbs with you replace it with fat and protein but where you could do that on vegetarian diet but they don't it's almost next to impossible to do that safely and effectively and so they don't the ketogenic diet uh in these studies that they St that they test is replacing carbs with meat with animal fat with animal protein so it's a meat-based diet so anyone says oh there's no evidence for this carnivore diet it's the most rigorously studied diet on Earth and it's been shown to be the most effective and healthy diet on Earth be Dash do head to head and had for specific medical outcomes like diabetes Alzheimer's um autoimmunity and many others this shows significant clinical benefit in humans when they go on to a high fat animal based diet with a side salad maybe if they want it it's a carnivore diet light carnivore with a side salad but it's a ketogenic carnivore diet with some veggies if you want them which I don't and I I think you do better without them so the most rigorously studied diet the most beneficial diet ever studied in the literature is a whole food high fat animal-based diet that's what's in the literature don't ever forget that and don't let people uh try to say like oh there's no there's no high level studies first of all there's no high level studies for a plant-based diet second of all the only diet that has thousands of high level studies is the animal-based ketogenic diet always remember that don't give people an inch on that because it's garbage"

    "body": "hi Anthony do you think mainstream nutritionists and scientists will one day advocate for a carnivore diet and why I do because a lot of them are coming around to that because that's what the evidence shows and suggests and recommends um the nutritionist now the curriculum is a plant-based Dogma based on the work of the Seventh Day Adventist Church who still control the curriculum they founded the curriculum they founded the nutritional sciences and nutritional um Academia and um the a the American nutritional dietetics Association was founded by the Seventh Day Advent church member Lena Cooper so um it's just a matter of un undoing that crap but you know more and more nutritionists are graduating with a degree in nutrition from an Ivy League school and they're doing exactly what they're told to do from their their uh classes they should be perfect health perfect nutrition and they're not and they're sick and they're fat and they're dying you know some of some people like um Sally Norton she has a degree in nutrition from Cornell and uh she was plant-based vegetarian vegan because that's what she was taught and she was doing all of that and she nearly died from the oxalates and plant toxins that were in the food that she was eating and she was like can't do that so she's come around she's nearly all carnivore um and um uh you know Dr Sarah Zaldivar she has a PHD in nutrition and she was doing everything exactly the way that she was taught to do it and she was not healthy and she was getting worse and she started going like well hang on a second I'm doing everything right and things aren't things aren't working right things aren't working the way I told they would so what's going on and she looked into it and found like Yep this was all crap and now she's carnivore right and she's doing a lot better as a result of that and now she's teaching that in her classes uh at University and so um I think it will come around there's more and more people coming around to this more and more nutritionists dietitians are coming around to this more and more PhD students and PhD candidates are coming to this and they're doing their research in the carnivore diet and in the meat-based diets and animal-based diets and so I think it absolutely will come around because the truth will out and this these are facts so humans are carnivores it's just the kind of animal we are and no animal is going to do better eating a alternate diet than the one that they are biologically adapted for by definition right right so that goes for us as well and so you know you don't need a study to tell you what an animal eats you just go out in the wild and you look at what they eat right and you give them something else and they get sick it's not that hard right um you do that with humans what do you do you go out with the innuit they're just eating meat okay historically what do we eat before the well we know we know what people were eating up until the Agricultural Revolution and then beyond right and so we have clear records of this and we have clear records in the stable isotope studies and and um and uh just the historical record and then prehistorical fossil record you know we have clear evidence there too so it's it's not it's not unclear what humans have been eating since we've been humans and how we've changed over the over the Millennia and how massively that's that's damaged our health and development our brains have shrank by 11% for men 177% for women overnight it didn't take hundreds of years or thousands of years it was night and day pre- agriculture post agriculture bam and that's persisted until today but happened in all the different places that they independently went to agriculture they shrank by 5 six inches the brains got smaller their teeth got crooked and crowded they had a whole bunch of of health issues and abnormalities to and signs of chronic disease to the skeletons and so that happened independently everywhere you look in the fossil record or in the anthropological record when happened more recently like with the Native Americans and native Australians when they got converted over to a more Western plant-based diet because they were forced to um stop eating their their traditional food either by wiping out the bison or being torn off their land here in Australia and and forced into British schools and and go and and become involved in British Society you know like that's that that completely damaged um entire generations of people and we see clear disparities you know between the before and after right so this is it's not hard we know what we're supposed to eat we don't you don't need a damn nutritional St study or scientist for this and people are seeing that and so nutritionist are seeing that and nutrition students are seeing that and going like because they want to know actual nutrition they don't want to be like oh I want to be indoctrinated I want to do what they're doing no they want to know nutrition they want to know what's right for human body to eat they want to know how to to help resolve health issues with nutritional methods and interventions they don't they don't want to just you know have a degree you you know most people don't they want to actually know what the hell is going on and so that's why they're doing this and when you see this for yourself you're like yep that's not it and so it is turning and when we we uncover why this has been um kept from us for so long I think it pisses people off certainly pisses me off and so that's we just need to get that out there that you know we've been duped you we've been had for these religious ideological reasons and and those those reasons have not left you know it's not just this was pushed out in the 1800s and now it's just sort of self-perpetuating no they are still actively trying to push a vegan ideology on the world because of their own religious ideology and that's not to say anything about the individuals in the 7day Adventist Church I know a lot of Seventh Day Adventist Church members they're lovely people they're just normal people right it's the the the powers that be that are in charge that are pushing this Doctrine um because that's their whole tenants was was their their self-identity was about um you know getting getting rid of meat and things like that and they push on the Blue Zone studies I mean they paid for that Dan Butner is a Seventh Day Adventist Church member and then he sold the rights to the blue zones to the seventhday Adventist Church for like $70 million right this is this is a scam and uh and people are coming around to this and that includes nutrition students and and current nutritionists um who are in charge of doing the research and in char of teaching the next generation of of nutrition students so uh yes I do think it will w ill come around it already is"

the past Century billions everyone almost everyone on Earth is affected by this by these terrible recommendations these outright frauds and lies from these drug pushing  people have gotten sick they've gotten overweight they've died early they've died in disease and suffering having dementia and Alzheimer's and being enfeebled both mentally and physically cholesterol was never the problem it was a scapegoat by the sugar companies you know that's that's their words not mine and so this was never the problem we look at total cholesterol then we're looking at LDL then we're looking at ratios and we're looking at Apple it's just shifting the goalpost it was never the damn problem in the first place you go back and you look at the origin the data that was available at the time there was no association whatsoever between cholesterol or LDL and heart disease at all none and in fact things like the Framingham study showed an inverse association between total cholesterol and cardiovascular death and mortality right so the lower your total cholesterol the more people died of heart attacks and strokes so this was just misrepresented this was the AHA the American Heart Association is a pack of lying some things and they have multiple times throughout the last century in in well documented instances been bought and paid for by the Food Industries um such as the sugar companies or people on their boards or in charge of it being on the payroll of the sugar companies the big food companies Proctor and Gamble bought Crisco from the Germans who who invented it as as machine lubricant for tank gears I believe and Proctor and Gamble bought it and said yeah it was just feed it to these idiots and and they paid the American Heart Association $20 million to lie and say that it was better for your heart than animal fats like lard and butter and say it was really good for your heart it's much better than this don't want that you want krisco this clean wonderful krisco this clean beautiful machine oil lubricant um it's disgusting you know and this isn't this isn't conjecture this isn't a conspiracy theory it's a it's an historical fact it's on the record it's a matter of record so again um I'm I'm you know I appreciate your doctor's concern but you know that is just not what the evidence shows us what the evidence shows us is that high LDL low triglyceride means you're very metabolically healthy healthy you likely don't have metabolic syndrome you're unlikely to have diabetes and those are the major risk factors uh besides smoking and drinking um for um cardiovascular disease and higher LDL is associated with longevity higher total cholesterol is associated with longevity in studies with sorry 12 million people for LDL and um we just see more and more and more data showing that L and total cholesterol have absolutely nothing to do with development of heart disease um there have been three studies that I've found that show these results but um you know one that I'll mention is a 2009 study out of UCLA where they looked at something like 134,000 people who've had a heart attack in uh I believe it was just in America and 73% had low or ideal LDL cholesterol and about that many had um low HDL as well so HDL is much more predictive of getting a heart attack than LDL was and of course the conclusion of that of these authors were oh apparently our our threshold for for LDL is uh isn't low enough we need to lower it even more you know um and see if you keep lowering and this is this is actual uh guideline recommendations if you keep lowering your LDL but your patient keeps having heart attacks you just keep lowering that LDL you know there's no there's no lower you can just get rid of LDL have zero of it it's only poisonous I mean that's why that's why you know our bodies make it um is because it's poison it wants to kill us and we just have to fight nature in order to not die I mean how stupid you have to be to believe that that we have an internal kill switch that that uh you know is just is just killing us from the inside um that's that's ridiculous that's a ridiculous statement for any doctor or biologist serious biologist to to to make um and uh and but that's the recommendations just lower it lower it lower it lower well when are you going to figure out that you keep lowering LDL and they keep having heart attacks when are you g to figure out the LDL isn't the bloody problem there you know use your damn head you know and but the problem is that people don't you know because they're brainwashed we've been we've been absolutely indoctrinated for a long time and that and that includ and I'm talking about doctors have been indoctrinated ated by the drug companies for a long time and and everyone else as a consequence of that indoctrination so you know think about it this way we've had genetically genetically the same so population genetics if you if we will study population genetics you'll understand that if you have a percentage of Le genes in a in a population regardless of how that population grows or or shrinks expands or shrinks that you will have that same percentage of Le in the population unless there's some Mass you know genocide and die off and Extinction event or a mass migration of people coming in you'll you'll keep that percentage so right now we've had we have the same percentage of of people that have familial hypercholesterolemia worldwide that we did in the 1800s the first death from heart attack uh confirmed on autopsy in America was in 1912 there wasn't a single case throughout American history or the colonies before that 1912 was the first one I've been able to find exactly eight case reports of uh people dying from a heart attack in all of Europe throughout the entire 18th century I'm sure there are more but if that were the most popular killer we were eating more meat in the 1800s than we were in the early 1900s because vegetarianism started getting pushed really hard in the 1800s because of the puritanical movement and the temperance movement because they thought that women especially shouldn't eat meat because it give them carnal desires you eat of the flesh you'll think of the Flesh and and can't have that you know can't have people reproducing and being healthy and fertile no no no we need to suppress that and so the idea was if you were a virtuous person you would go vegetarian to suppress your sexual urges in any experiment any model in any observation in nature When Animals stop being interested in mating and reproduction they are sick there is something wrong and that's what we're reproducing that's what they were intentionally reproducing and you see the meat consumption sort of going down throughout the 1800s probably as a consequence of this of this sentiment that you needed to eat a vegetarian diet in order to suppress your sexual urges that's certainly what the Seventh Day Adventist believe and then they codified that in religious Doctrine by saying God said it and then that spread out from there and now you have you know the consequences of that with you know Dr Kelloggs and all the serial companies that that came up as a consequence of Dr kellock and sanitarian Foods U you know um the Seventh Day Adventist like sanitarian Foods who are the major influencers of nutritional studies dietetics the curriculums and um and the studies that are being put out so I mean this is all this just goes crazy but again we're eating more meat in the 1800s there's exactly eight deaths from heart attacks in the in the literature there's exactly one that I can find in the 1700s with the same exact percentage of people have familial hyp cholesterolemia in the 1800s and 1700s before as we do right now when this is the number one killer in the world so that that's a there just LDL equals Death why weren't anyone why wasn't anyone dying then and if you say oh well we just didn't notice it you're right we saw eight of them so people didn't know what to look for read a textbook from the uh medical textbook from the 1800s they are insanely detailed William osler's textbook my great-grandfather was a doctor graduated from Columbia youngest ever graduate from Columbia Medical School to date he was 20 years old when he graduated Columbia Medical School top of his class he has William osler's textbook and it's that big I have it at um at at you know my my family's home in uh America it is is so detailed there are so many maladies and pathologies of the heart all these different ways that people can die and then looking what happened oh and this is what happened this is not a single damn mention of any you know coronary thrombi in in the coronary vessels um why is that it just too stupid to figure it out these guys dissecting everything else about the heart looking at all these different sorts of thing and totally missed that just totally miss this big blockage that killed off half the heart and it scarred over really you know I mean you you have to be a special kind of stupid or ignorant to uh to believe that um it's wrong it's dead wrong so why is it why is it that the first heart attack you know proven on autopsy was in 1912 in America 10 years later there were many more 10 years after that number one killer in America now it's a number one killer worldwide and there were eight in all of Europe throughout the the entire Century of the 1800s why is that is it really because of cholesterol is it really because of meat we're eating more meat in the 1800s than we were in the 1930s when this was the number one killer in America or became the number one killer in America we're eating more meat in 1912 than we were in 1930 when this became the number one killer in America it was U-shaped curve so we're eating less and less and less throughout the 1800s it dips it's at its trough in the 1920s and 30s when this becomes the number one and then it starts slowly coming back up there isn't even a correlation so sorry I Bel belabored that point but it it still really rils me up obviously but watch my video the truth about cholesterol and heart disease this has just killed billions of people I mean do we get that do people understand that like this this has been responsible for the death and disease of billions of people around the world over the past Century billions right so everyone almost everyone on Earth is affected by this by these terrible recommendations these outright frauds and lies from these drug pushing  and people have gotten sick they've gotten overweight they've died early they've died in disease and suffering and in in you know having having dementia and Alzheimer's and being in feeble both mentally and physically by the billions you have 35-year-old uh men and women having heart attacks and dropping dead in front of their children you know they're robbed of their entire life with their kids those kids are robbed from their of their parents for the rest of their life because these you know just wanted to make a a buck you know that pisses me off and everyone should be pissed off by this which oh well you know it doesn't oh F you forever putting this up F you for for trying to push this nonsense on people F you for trying to keep propagating this  when we have hard evidence it was a con in the first place so people like Dr Alo and these other who who just push this sort of probably because they're getting paid off they just want to try to make a name for themselves because they're just they're just desperate to try to be popular like I'm sorry you didn't have friends in school but Jesus Christ don't take it out on the rest of us like no one is benefiting by the nonsense that these people say people are getting hurt and they are suffering and they are dying by the billions because of this garbage that people have been spewing out there and it is just time that this just dies and we just stop doing that and just be like oh but CL like f off that was a scam not talking about it and I think that's what I'm going to start start doing is just be like look watch my video on it it's a scam don't worry about it because it's a scam it is a scam and uh and we just you know the only reason that this is still alive is because we are keeping it alive by even entertaining the discussion you know oh but you have to do this that's  you're wrong we're not talking about that read a goddamn book you know this was just you know this was they made it up they made it up to push their product and to protect their product it's crap moving on with our lives and that's what we should do um and that animals don't get diena in the wild when natural die but they will get their eating they an unnatural die and dementia Alzheimer's dementia at the very least didn't exist before 1906 and any real numbers that people notice let's get back to that I mean people weren't even full carnivore back then you know they're just eating less they're eating more meat more animal fat and less garbage"

    "body": "hi Dr chaffy a significant association between low or lowered cholesterol levels and violence is found across many types of studies why do you think that's the case love the carnivores then appreciate what you do yeah I've I've seen that as well um and depression and mental health issues as well I think that's exactly it your brain is made out of cholesterol your body's made out of cholesterol your hormones are made out of cholesterol you are unhealthy if you don't have enough cholesterol that is just a fact and that's a fact that the drug companies and you know and the sugar iies have been trying to hide from you for the last 60 70 years but it's true and so it's this this is not something that you want to play with and so I think that's why you're just unhealthy your brain's not working properly you don't have the physical structures that that that can help you properly you're also doing other things that um to low you know you're doing things uh that lower your your cholesterol or eating a certain way that lowers your cholesterol that's also going to cause other problems you you're eating low fat you know high carb diets and your body doesn't work properly your brain doesn't work properly you you're not eating enough meat and your your brain doesn't work properly there's that that study out of Oxford in 2008 where they found that after five years uh vegan brains it shrink by over 5% right so you're not getting enough B12 you're not getting enough uh of these other things as well your brain shrinking your your axons are melinated with cholesterol so if you don't have enough cholesterol your brain doesn't work properly your body doesn't work properly hormones aren't able as abundant you can't make them you're going to have uh a lot of problems in fact you know that might just be one of the things right there you know people say it's like oh when someone's their testosterone is super high you know they get Roid Rage and yeah that's possible to freak out if you're if you're just completely off the charts on your hormones but if you're off the charts on the other direction if your testosterone is too low you also get really agitated and really aggressive and really angry and you're really sharp and you like snap at people and so I've spoken to so many doctors that deal with the sort of hormonal side of things and they have men that have low testosterone and they say that you know they're you know you put them on some testosterone you just bump that up into more youthful numbers and and their wives come in with them next time and go thank you he's so much nicer now you know and so you know that could be part of it as well if you don't have enough cholesterol you don't have enough testosterone testosterone is made from cholester olol and so if you don't have enough cholesterol you're not making enough testosterone if you're getting a bunch of plant oils they have plant sterols that's plant cholesterol and that lowers our cholesterol because our brain our body thinks we don't need as much cholesterol and so you don't make as much you can't make hormones out of plant sterols so you're not going to make hormones properly and you're going to have low testosterone and you're going to be grumpy and you're going to be uh grouchy and angry and all that sort of stuff and obviously that can lead to violence bance as well although it doesn't always but uh yeah I think that those are some some significant reasons why that could be 56y old male with no weight issues I have been carnivore for 100 days my cholesterol is LDL 241 HDL 43 drct wants to put me on a Statin says I'm high risk but are you though uh you know cholesterol just doesn't is isn't the cause of heart disease it just isn't that was a scapegoat invented by the sugar company so I have a uh video on uh YouTube just called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease and that goes into that um and Dr Paul Mason has a lot of videos on that um on cholesterol and heart disease and the real causes of heart disease there's a book by Dr Malcolm Kendrick um called the clot thickens it's all about that as well how this is nothing to do with cholesterol um and uh and many many many others that you know cardiologists and Interventional cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons and PhD researchers and professors of everything you can imagine all saying this is complete and utter crap and so uh you know check out that video just the the truth about cholesterol and heart disease there's also a book uh by cardiologist named Dr Aseem Malhotra called a statin-free life and he goes through the data and the literature you know it's it's not all it's cracked up to be unfortunately uh we have just been inundated with this false information and false sense of Hope from the Staten companies and what's happened you know we're reducing cholesterol reducing meat reducing saturated fat we've done all these things and putting people on statins getting them on younger and younger and younger and heart attacks are going up heart disease is going up right and around the world um this is this is the case and and deaths from heart attack around the world are going up out of proportion with the growth in in population so you know the the the deaths and rates of heart disease are going up around the world faster than the population is growing so you know it's um it's just not what it's been we've been told it was the sugar companies made this up they made it up and they paid off a bunch of unscrupulous professors and doctors such as um anel keys and bunch of guys from Harvard who then went on to very you know be head of the AHA and head of the USDA and they start pumping this out the aha I mean it's just a just a mafia sort of organization they they are just I mean were just sellouts I mean they sold out immediately I mean they didn't even wait around you know they uh you know as soon as they got on on the scene they were just like yep who has money let's do it and so the sugar companies bought them out you know they lied about the Framingham study that you know said that the Framingham study showed that higher cholesterol um uh related to or was associated with because epidemiology so it's just Association was associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease mortality and um and in fact the Framingham study showed the opposite it showed that lower levels of total cholesterol uh related was associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease mortality so they lied they were paid to lie that's in the literature that's public data and uh then the American Heart Association was paid off by Proctor and Gamble because Proctor and gam well Crisco was invented by the Germans in 1911 um as a as as mechanical lubricant for their ubro right so they were using they're using submarine lubricant they're using tank lubricants in their in World War I and then Proctor and Gamble bought this from them and they uh then went on to pay U pay off the American Heart Association $20 million in today's valuation to lie and say it was better for your heart than animal fat such as butter and Lord so I mean they're just they're just a bunch of sellouts you know and and they didn't even sell out for much I mean I gu 20 million but a lot of these professors they they did it for like six grand you know it's equivalent of of $55,000 today they got $6,500 back then it's nothing you know they they just they sold out real cheap so your health means not much to them your health is worth about 55 grand to them that's that's what they'll sell your health for um and the health of the world so uh just just you know don't buy into these people it's um it's pretty bad and then you can look at that you can look at the work of Dave Feldman Nick norwitz I had Nick norwitz on my podcast and we talked about the research they're doing just showing that this is crap uh this is not this is not actually something that um is is causing disease and in fact it the treatment is causing harm as well so I would look into those resources before you consider taking any new medications when you're in ketosis more often than not then you're going through autophagy and your body is turning over the mitochondria stimulating more mitochondri you go through mitophagy and mitogenesis so you're turning these things over so they're newer faster better and you have more of them and so they work better so your brain works better and you're also getting rid of all these plant toxins which cause a lot of neuroinflammation and damage and stop your brain from working properly"

    "body": "member asks hey Doc if we are true carnivores why are we able to metabolize carbs sugar or um develop the ability to do so in the first place thanks uh well look we weren we weren't always carnivores we had the ability to to eat these sorts of things historically and does give a survival Advantage because we have we can eat other things we can survive on them um and when when you're looking at at things in evolutionary terms you don't lose the ability to do something unless it confers a survival advantage to do so so because that's just that's just how that works because the ones that don't have that trait tend to die off and they tend not to have kids and so it's that trait that actually is a big survival Advantage so you know making having the ability to break down carbs and sugars and and absorb them is is uh you know an advantage to anybody because if you don't have that ability then you you're limiting more resources and um in a famine period you're trying to eat something else you know that's not that great but you know pretty much any animal can absorb simple carbohydrates you know not all animals make amales but most of them do and um and so they can still break down starches some don't have amalis in their saliva but they can make it from their pancreas and either way uh they can they can absorb they can absorb carbohydrate simple carbohydrates like simple sugars and and there are carbohydrates in meat I mean there's glycogen in meat and and so you actually do get these things on a carnivore diet so you actually do need this stuff uh on a carnivore diet because there are carbohydrates that you're going to break down and absorb as well it's just not the mass quantities of these things that that we see in you know processed carbs or you know starchy vegetables and things like that or fruit you know very sweet um it unnaturally sweet fruit that we've we've uh arranged you know and breed and and intensively bread to be much more sweet so plenty of animals do plenty of carnivores do still have that ability we're no exception it does confer a survival advantage to to be able to eat potatoes and survive um it's just not it's just not optimal but also there are carbohydrates and meat and so you need that ability there too break down the glycogen and uh and certainly absorb the simple sugars and you know I mean look at you look at your cells I mean there's there are carbohydrate components to uh many proteins to many receptors to many parts of your cell to many parts of of the animal and so that's important you know that's important to be able to contend with that break it down and absorb it so yeah that's not actually abnormal um you know i' I've seen some things where they say that that you know like lions and big cats don't make amylase in their saliva but that doesn't mean they don't make it in their pancreas and I've seen other ones that said that they do so I I don't know about that I think it's generally generally accepted that they they don't but I have actually seen some that that said that they did so you know it's um either way it doesn't really matter if we have you had that ability because we were herbivorous before you don't lose that trait unless there's a survival advantage to lose that trait um but also I mean even herbivores I mean look at gorillas you know they're they're not eating carbs they're not they're not eating like roots and tubers and starchy vegetables they're eating fiber and that fiber you know amylase won't break that down you know it won't won't do any of that it's um the bacteria in their gut that is in their in their hind gut which is their cecum which is very very very long or equivalent is the appendix because that was a survival advantage to lose that we did have a very elongated cecum presumably and then that shrunk down to almost nothing because that's very energy dependent and so we traded our gut length for our brain size and we needed more nutrient-dense food uh meat and so we that did uh give a survival advantage to lose that big useless gut that we we weren't using anymore um and so we have a much smaller one so they have a big hind gut and the bacteria eat the fiber because because it's only bacteria and protozoa and these single cell organisms that can even make cellul termites don't even make cellulase it's the protozoa in their gut that eats the the cell cellulose and produce cellulase and as a byproduct they produce saturated fat and then the microorganisms die off and they get absorbed as protein so do gorillas have amylase do gorillas have the ability to break these things down why they don't need it they're absorbing saturated fat and protein so it's the same thing you know we need fat and protein lions need fat and protein gorillas need fat and protein and we get those from our food source that's really the main thing some of us have some amylase some of us don't doesn't really matter you still just need fat and protein that's the main thing"

    "body": "member says GF been trying to increase meat girlfriends has been trying to increase meat but says she has low appetite for red meat and feels sick when eating only meat um even one meal any recommendations yeah you look we we're conditioned to think that this is really bad for us women especially have have um taking that to heart um and uh there's some seems to be some sort of psychological reason for that that you know they're just more much more um much more likely they're just much more coachable and people say this too it's just like you when you're when you're coaching girls like they they really pay attention they really listen they try to try to do what you you tell them to do and like guys just sort do whatever the hell they want so you don't have as as much coachability in some guys and and so you have to you know that's why you know being being able to learn being able to be coachable is is uh is a good trait you know that coaches look for in young athletes um and so but you know girls women seem to have taken that and saying okay well this is bad for me I'm not going to do that okay makes sense and if you believe that that's the that's the right thing to do uh guys are a bit more headstrong like yeah screw that and so I like it I enjoy it so I'm just going to do it a bit more hedonistic and um that can be good in this circumstance when you're being lied to and you're just trusting your your Natural Instincts and the other side of it is that it could be very bad because you end up doing things that are bad uh in any case we train ourselves and condition ourselves to think that meat's bad and to think that um and to think that Fat's bad and we and we have a psychosomatic reaction where it just it makes us physically ill I would get that in my late 30s when I knew that this was the right way to go when I would eat fat I just couldn't do it and I had to slowly work myself into it and so that that's what you do just ease into it you know it's uh just just a little bit more a little bit more doesn't have to eat if it doesn't taste good if she feels unwell don't eat that's fine your body's your body can can tell you that if if meat doesn't taste good you're not hungry and you'll eat a lot less you don't need nearly as much and so you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good if you can't eat big chunks of fat you you cut a small piece of that fat off put it with the lean meat eat that together and say like okay that actually tastes good together and um and you can do that and you just recondition yourself and really decondition you know that programming you know that we had of listening to The Experts and never eat fat because Fat's so bad for you even though it has never been bad for ever in human existence um and then the argument goes like well but we weren't living all that long says who the Census Data didn't say that in the 1800s if you made it to adulthood you'd live you know s very similar length of time that we live now it's just average life expectancy from birth was 38 in 1850 because the infant mortality rate was so high and 50 years later it was a lot higher than that because INF morality or the total life expectancy from birth was a lot higher because it was um it was the infant mortality rate had had uh improved significantly and so um you know it's completely false oh people were just weren't living long enough in the 1800s and before that to uh to experience these diseases like really have you have you read a book because they were written by people and some of those people actually have um biographies and you can actually see like how long they lived you know how how old was Mark how old was Sam Adams when he died how old was was John Adams second president of the United States born in the mid 1700s died in the mid- 1800s he was 91 all the founding fathers look them up they're all in their 80s and 90s when they died Ben Franklin was 64 when the Revolutionary War broke out and then funny enough I I seem to recall that the minimum age required to even apply for the job of President of the United States was 35 is that well that's funny if everyone eyes at 35 that's funny age to set a minimum and I'm pretty sure we've had presidents in the 1700s and 1800s which is funny that because these these people are so smart and they know so much and surely they they'd look it up right and they'd understand that there's historical figures that we have clear documentation of that were much older than that and there's what was it Socrates is that who I'm thinking of who uh was in his 70s when they had to kill him and he was so sharp that it just pissed everyone off in Athens so they had to kill him by eating a plant by the way they made him drink Hemlock so I mean that's just nonsense that people weren't living long enough to um to experience these these diseases that's just ridiculous and I just spoke with a with a gentleman uh Dr Verma from India he's an Emergency Physician over in India and he said he treated a boy who's 17 years old came in with a heart attack 17y old kid had a heart attack right vegetarian by the way vegan vegetarian and of this mostly plant-based nation everyone says oh but and plants are so bad for us and meat is so good for us explain India India explains that you know 20 years ago the average person in India only ate five kilos of meat a year a year right I eat more than that in a week way more than that in a week you know and and um and then in the last 20 years it's actually dropped down to three kilos a year right and the metabolic disease rate has actually sprung up in that time it's gotten worse right um he said something it was like 30% of people had metabolic metabol syndrome and disease and 30% 30 30% of people in India had diabetes full-blown diagnosed diabetes and this is very you know there a lot of people living rurally they may I ever get that diagnosis I me I have access to healthcare so diagnosed diabetes 30% that's three times the diabetes rate of America is slovenly Americans who just eat a whole bunch of processed meat and processed foods and and red meat oh you know these guys are eating three kilos a year a year and a lot of them aren't eating any and 30% they have three times higher uh diabetes rates so it's just flat out ridiculous that that people even make these contentions they're either complete Liars or just too stupid to to uh just too too stupid to to take any advice from anyway either way these are not people that you need to listen to if they're so flagrantly incorrect by their either intentionally or because their brains don't work that like this is this is no one you want to take advice from anything else you know I mean people get things wrong and that's fine you know and and so you know I just I agree with some things that people say and I disagree with other things that they say um that doesn't mean that I hate them you know broke clock is right twice a day you know but um but some people when they get these things so intensely wrong it's so easy to look up it's um you know it's just like okay well what else are you phing in you know like we just can't really we just can't really trust anything you say at this point like Ancel Keys the guys are know fraud he was defrauding people for the majority of his career when did that start when was he when did he start being a sellout I mean presumably had to do some good work in order to sell his reputation and integrity but when did that start can you trust anything he did because he's unscrupulous maybe he cut corners on other things maybe he just did things and published them just so he could just so he could get some recognition fits the profile you know there people with Alzheimer's they say well it's this beta Amyloid plaque that's what doing there's there's this there's a l paper that came out you know supposedly proving that showing that and turned out it was total fraud it was total garbage and that just came out last year so no that has nothing to do with it and they just defrauded people just so they could get the reputation just so they could publish a landmark paper and get their name on the map and um and you know get everyone tenure and everyone's all happy and patting each other's back and now they've got tenure so can't get rid of them but it's fraud it's absolute fraud and uh so when when did the fraud start with with Ancel Keys who knows just don't trust anything he says don't trust anything he does and um you know and uh and the same thing with these sorts of things so long story short we've been conditioned to think something that is inherently untrue and we're getting psychosomatic responses as a result of that so just lead into it just just ease into it you know eat what tastes good stop eating when it doesn't taste good feeling a bit nauseous just stop you know if if she has to sort of do a slower transition and include some other stuff too just eating more fatty meat and less of the other stuff is already going to make a big difference and if you start easing into that and eating more and more meat and getting used to the fat you know eventually she might be able to just drop everything else you know but don't you know you don't want to force it you know because you know it might be that she just goes too much and goes no no no no no I'm not doing this and just mentally can't get her head around it and then you know might might just uh not really want to do it and not be motivated to do it so you know just it's okay it's okay to ease into these things too so good luck to to t o both of you"

    "body": "member asks will intermittent fasting help me lose weight while on Carnivore um yes and no because the thing is is that most of the time you'll you'll naturally be doing something along those lines where you'll be eating in a in a shorter amount of window or maybe only once a day I typically eat once a day twice a day at most um if I'm working out especially and um so that that people say like oh well you're intermittent fasting you're doing that it's like well no I'm not because what fasting is is intentionally withholding food from uh when you're hungry and you want to eat but you're like no I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm going to abstain that's what fasting is just not being hungry is just not being hungry you know if I'm only hungry once a day and I eat once a day and I'm fine that's not fasting but it looks like it it looks like you're intermittent fasting so that's so that's the the yes part of it the no part of it is if you're intentionally withholding food and you continually do that and you do that you know day after day after day you're going to slow your metabolism down you can actually stall weight loss and again it's not weight loss it's fat loss that you're looking for you're not looking for weight loss you don't want to lose muscle and bone you want to lose fat and so if you lose fat but you put on muscle and bone you're not going to lose weight and so you need to remember that and uh quite often when people are having a stall it's not actually a stall it's that they're working out and they're replacing their fat with the muscle and bone uh then you can do things like take o zic that horrible poison that's been foed across the planet um again to make billions and billions and billions of dollars the research on OIC for weight loss by their own estimate was that you lose weight generally because you felt so sick and just nauseated you just couldn't eat and then after that after about two years that that uh those symptoms would go away your appetite would come back and because you just been eating just little bits of chocolate and candy the whole time because you couldn't stomach anything else um and you basically just starved yourself for the last two years now you have horrific eating habits and uh and your appetite comes back and then you eat a whole bunch of garbage and then you end up putting on more weight than you lost initially and the weight that you lost wasn't just fat what they showed was that a large portion of this was actually lean body mass was muscle mass and bone density which you just can't afford to lose at any point in your life especially when we get into to middle and late age uh but I mean kids I why would you Jesus why would you do that to kids so use a lot of lose a lot of lean body mass and then so you're losing weight but you're not losing the weight that's healthy you're losing really un you're losing uh weight that is very unhealthy to lose and then when you put weight back on because you have such horrible eating habits you put on fat you're not getting back the muscle and bone you're just getting back fat you're get back more fat than the muscle and bone that you lost so after two years people tended to regain more weight than they lost um so that's not good so it's not about weight it's about body composition and really it's about health so you just eat what's healthy for you and and the the body composition comes as a result of that and that just happens down the road that's a consequence that's a secondary outcome the primary outcome is your health that's what the most important part of this is and um and if you if you intentionally withhold meals and intentionally withhold from eating you will slow down your metabolism and you can stall and you can actually start gaining weight eating less you know bariatric surgeons will tell you that like women in particular if they eat less than 1,200 calories a day they will not lose weight so they have to eat a minimum threshold to actually be able to for their body to actually let go and um and and and let go of that excess fat because they they're storing it because like no we're going to die we need to save this and because we're trying to save you so your body doesn't it's not a conscious being it just it just it's taking inputs right so the input is that there's no food available okay we're in a famine we're going to shut it down and so that's what's going to happen so no I wouldn't do that I would just eat until fatty meat stops tasting good if that's once a day it's once a day if that's twice a day it's twice a day if that's 32 times a day it's 32 times a day it won't be you eat until you get that bite that tastes like cardboard typically when people are losing weight that's one going to be once a day twice at the outside but just make sure you're getting it up enough fatty meat until it stops tasting good you generally won't eat all that much and you'll you'll look like you're intermittent fasting but you won't actually be fasting you'll just be eating when you're hungry and that's what you do and that that's the other thing you know when when you you do these tricks and gimmicks and you're fasting and starving and doing all these sorts of things eventually you get to the end of it and you just go okay well something's got to change because this isn't sustainable or the OIC and you're losing weight and now your your appetite comes back and now what happens now your pattern of behavior and your and and how your your functioning is now in congruent with a healthy lifestyle whereas if you're just eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good you can do that at any day at any point at any stage in your life because at different times you're going to need more or less and if you're just listening to your body and eating until it stops tasting good your body's going to tell you what it needs today it needs 4,000 calories tomorrow it needs 3,000 next day it needs 4,000 now it needs 2,000 now it needs 5,000 it doesn't matter it's going to change on different on different days if you're losing fat your body eventually gets down to a stable body fat percentage you're going to need more that's all there is to it because you're not you're not going to be going on your fat stores anymore you need to actually get more energy and and nutrients in to run your body and maintain your your body fat and so that's what you do and your appetite goes up and so by the time you get to that stable point now you're you have the eating habits and the lifestyle that are going to be conducive to perpetuate that right so that's really important to just uh lay down patterns of behavior that you're going to be able to continue and perpetuate for the rest of your life to continue to get maximal results and the most benefit out of um out of your uh out of your life and on your health that actually changes your odor and so that can be a thing too it's not necessarily butter and Tallow it could be because your hormones are changing that's affecting way your body smells and so uh that's not necessarily A Bad Thing butter smells nice that's just my opinion but I'm not wrong and and so I you know it may be different but it's it's probably not that much of an issue"

    "body": "member asks can you explain more about weightlifting and muscle gain Pro uh progress on Carnivore my trainer is really on me that this uh about this diet so I'm using your answers to fight him uh well you know the thing is is that you just just results speak better than anything so you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you do that twice a day when you're when you're lifting weights and working hard train your ass off work really hard eat a lot of meat don't eat before you train eat after you train you'll feel much better and you'll get better workouts and you and you'll recover much better and you won't get sore and so you'll be able to work out more have more uh workouts during the week if that's something that you want to do there are different camps on that some people say that you know you want more sets and and and a higher load and that helps you uh build muscle and and build strength and others say no you don't want to do that you want to have big intense workout and then let your body rest for few days and all that sort of stuff uh even before you do the next muscle group so there there there are different schools of thought so you do what's right for you but as from a diet standpoint you're you're going to be able to put on lean body mass more easily on a carnivore diet than any anything else you can put on more mass more weight by eating a whole bunch of carbs but that's fat glycogen and water weight because when you're eating a lot of excess carbs this is bad for your body this is not this is not contentious this is what kills diabetics is high blood sugar and so your body tries to get this stuff stuffed away stores it in glycogen in your muscles and liver uh glycogen pulls in two water molecules for every one uh molecule of glycogen so you get water logged muscles in liver and then you also deposit intramuscular fat and intrahepatic fat and intra organal fat and this called myosteatosis when it's in your muscles and this is a pathological sign that we see on MRI very commonly it's actually uncommon to see it these days um at least in um in in the MRIs that I've seen so sure you can gain more bulk by eating a whole bunch of crappy carbs and sugar and nonsense like that but that's not muscle and so when you go into a cutting phase you're going to lose all that and so oh yeah well that that yeah you you can't put on muscle unless you put on fat at the same time who told you that you know like that all these these obese Lions you know walking around until they get into their cutting phase you know like this is stupid um it's you know the the golden ear bodybuilders Vince Gonda Serge nuub these sorts of guys they were steak and egg steak and egg steak and egg Serge Nu would eat four to six pounds of horse meat a day it's French the French eat more horse than other people do and nothing wrong with it though uh as far as nutrition is concerned and absolute monsters absolute monsters and this was before the the steroid Heyday so it's um it's absolutely uh in your best interest to do a carnivore diet when you're when you're lifting weights so so just do that you know just uh you know just just eat a whole bunch of meat you know point out the you know Vince Gonda and and serge new you know one thing with G is he thought that once a week you had to you had to load up on cars because he thought that was the only way to store up your liver glycogen that's not actually true uh you you do store liver glycogen and muscle glycogen whether or not you eat carbohydrates but at the time that was our understanding of biochemistry and then uh actually speaking with Professor Tim noes who's one of the foremost Sports Medicine doctors and scientists and sports physiologists in the world he has over 750 published um papers studies and books on the subject and I mean the man prolific and he's he's just an absolute pillar in the field and he is very clear that you you do not I you do not need nor want carbohydrates in your training as a top tier athlete because you get the exact same performance and in fact I would argue that you eventually once you're fully keto fat adapted you get better performance that was certainly my experience um you have unlimited nearly energy potential because even in an athlete who has 5% body fat someone very lean they are storing in their body fat 100,000 calories of energy in their body fat right so you don't need to carb load you know a th000 calories of pasta or 2,000 calories of pasta you've got a 100,000 calories in fat stored in your body at 5% body fat for the average sized person so this is not um the you know it's not hard like you get you get way better um access to energy you're not going to run out of energy and crash and all these sorts of things and he was very clear that glycogen is not actually um the the muscle's primary source in fact your body uses that up to then get to the fat and once you get to the fat you you're oxidizing fat you know up to your maximum V2 Max you know they they used to say after 85% V2 Max you can only burn carbs No in fact fact it's you only burn carbs if you have excess carbs to burn once you get through those and you're in a ketogenic State you're just you're just um you're just burning fat after that and he's shown that in clinical trials with athletes right and they've been done in in recreational athletes has also been done in in uh high performance Elite worldclass athletes and like ultramarathoners and things like that so you know that I would watch I would look at at at Prof noes and things like that so you don't you first of all there was a there's the what is it the faster study by volik 2016 where he talked about um well basically showed these these ultramarathoners and had 20 of them they've been doing keto for over six months so they're very adapted and they had you know brilliant performances and they found that their glycogen actually was better and recovered faster in the keto group so the ketogenic um uh marathoners recovered their they did muscle biopsies they recovered their they had similar muscle glycogen before exercise and they had more glycogen directly after exercise and they recovered their gly their muscle glycogen uh faster as well after they exercised and three hours afterwards they had similar amounts of of um uh muscle glycogen between the keto fueled athletes that were not refeeding or eating anything else and the carb fueled athletes who were just sucking down sugar water and things like that so no long story short um you can definitely put on a lot of muscle um but you won't put on the fat the glycogen and the water weight and so it may look oh you could be getting bigger fast bigger is not the point more muscular is the point lean body mass is the point and that's what you're going to get with a carnivore diet it's not going to be you know just putting on a bunch of fat glycogen and water weight so uh yeah uh that's what you tell them and then you just prove it with your results that's the main thing"

    "body": "member says day 42 carnivore no caffeine and lion last eight days really good job I get a normal solid stool in am no constipation later in the day I get loose stools I don't get solid and loose simultaneously they are separate with time any tips um yeah that's interesting it's you know I if you're if you're eating something fatty and that's when you're getting the loose stools maybe you're eating more fat than your body can absorb if it's distant to that maybe something else is going on if you're getting hard dry Rocky stools and then otherwise you're getting like liquid stools regardless of the time of day that it happens it could be that you're actually more constipated than you think and you're getting these sort of semi blockages and then the liquid stool is sort of passing around that and you're getting liquid diarrhea it's called overflow diarrhea or spurious diarrhea and so that's something to consider as well so if it's just sort of normal soft but formed stools and then more liquid stools you're probably on the other side of that you're probably having more fat than your body can can absorb as readily that's not doesn't mean that it's bad for you doesn't mean that you're sick or you have an infection it's just you know inconvenient um but if you're having really hard stools and then liquidy stools you're probably actually more constipated there's sort of a U-shaped curve so uh you have too little fat you'll get diarrhea you have too much fat you'll get diarrhea so you want to be Serv ofing that middle ground so you aim for one to two grams of fat per one gram of protein and um you know that's around you know 65 35 CR beef to 75 30 25 around there and um so you're in that range and uh and see and adjust from there and if it's that's not enough fat you're sort of getting those harder drier more difficult stools along with the loose stools up the fat see what it and then they might have loose stools for a while you get all that clear that blockages out of there and then your body will start sort of forming these things more naturally um it's a bit of a pain but uh you have to sort of play around with it to see and uh and also remember that it's not just coffee coffee is obviously major one but you know coffee caffeine tea uh but also artificial sweeteners magnesium supplements metformin which is a very common medication for diabetes that people are on all of those things can act as a laxative and so you need to um remember that and if there's any of that you know in in there you you can't just adjust your your fat intake um and then after that if you think it is too much fat and and and you're not really absorbing it try staying away from the rendered fat try more solid fat that's in the meat itself and yeah so so a few things to try anyway and and the other thing is you can do a journal right what you eat when you eat it and when you're having solid or loose stools and see if there's a connection there because it could be that you're just having something with more fat than your body can contend with and then it just just comes out and if that's it then that's easy to to deal with but it's uh it's sometimes easier to see when it's on paper"

that's that's great that you're already improving high fat a lot of fat and and really strictly ketogenic no outside carbohydrates that that don't exist in meat or organs and um for psoriasis and other autoimmune issues really a best idea to be just beef and water like beef lamb and water so the ruminant Meats you'll always do best with autoimmune issues if you're just eating red meat and water and uh the Parkinson's as well you just need to get you know very high fat your brain's made out of fat you need High ketones or you know good ketones enough ketones to run your brain properly and help rebuild your neurons check your B12 a lot of people have low B12 if it's in range it's probably low because most of the ranges for B12 are too low because these are an average for the community they're not the optimal range and how do you test this you go to five different labs in your same town that are owned by different companies and you you test your B12 on the same day and you'll have roughly the same number and they'll all have different reference ranges why is that why is one good one's High one's low why why is that none of them will be low because the low is just way too low um so that's because it's not an optimal range it is an average range and most doctors don't know that oh well that's within our range oh we were happy with that right no no no no that's an average that's an average for your patient population but people are sick and people getting blood tests are definitely more often sick and so who gets a blood test people that are unwell and so they get sent to get a blood test and and they rorm these things every every few years and the first few thousand people that come in that is the reference range so why are we looking at this as if that were the optimal range of course it's not we're not looking at healthy people we're not looking at 2,000 healthy people healthy individuals with no health issues and saying okay well that seems to be where healthy people are that's not what they're looking at they're looking at sick people too sick people old people obese people metabolically unwell people diabetic people U you people with cancer all these sorts of things that just that's just that's just the average so that's okay so it's not okay so B12 is typically too low so in America you want your B12 between 1100 and 1,600 in the UK Australia and and most of Europe um 800,00 that's where you want this to be and that's that's generally a lot higher than most reference ranges go but it it it just depends so here in in Perth uh we use a a clinic here and uh the upper range is 650 right so 700 will be too high and yet there's another Lab at 750 is fine so okay so that's fine so you get it done at one lab it's fine you get it done the other lab and your doctor goes oh my God you're at a toxic level you need to shut it down no um and then another one's 800 and another lab is a thousand so that actually gets into the good range but it goes way too low it goes down to like 150 that's way too low under 400 you can actually get demolation and nerve damage right Oxford showed in 2008 that if you had um uh B12 below like 320 uh for a prolonged period of time they track these people uh for 5 years did an MRI every year and they found after five years that they had uh shrunk their brain by 5% volume right not great that's in that normal range right because a lot of the normal ranges go down to 150 or 130 but under 320 under you know 320 or so you know you're you you can actually shrink your brain by 5% after five years so clearly that is a that is a true deficient level and so that's not where you want to be so keep that in mind I fat make sure you got B12 folate and a lot and and vitamin D you know get out in the sun eat fatty um uh animal fats that have a lot of vitamin D and things like that Cod Liver cod liver oil liver in its oil and butter grass-fed butter all these sorts of things um are all all beneficial so that's what I would do and exercise there's actually a studies called um pedaling for Parkinson's where if you um pedal on on a stationary bicycle even if it's like an automatic bicycle that actually moved your legs for you it would um uh and you got your rep range up to like you know I think it was like 80 to 90 RPM uh that and you and you maintain that for like 45 minutes 4 days a week I think for six weeks actually or eight weeks it actually significantly improved uh the motor functions of Parkinson's and and in fact when they stopped that those benefits actually persisted for another eight weeks before they started to come down so that shows that you're actually probably improving uh the nerves and the and the parts of your brain the control movement which which is amazing so that's what I would do um that's what I would suggest anybody with Parkinson's"

through medical school so that's not good and uh and now you're taking a drug that makes that more likely so you know it's something that she needs to you know sort of think about with her doctor but I I can't tell you that you can absolutely improve your bone density without medications with a proper human diet the textbook says that you can only put on bone density up until the age of 25 so you need to get as much as you can because after that just entropy everything's just fading away and dying which doesn't make sense because no other animal species on earth does that no other life form on earth does that you get your certain oh just just breaking down for the majority of your adult mature life you're just breaking down and dying do you see trees doing that no they live they're healthy and then they die you see animals live they're healthy they get eaten by something or they keep going and then they just die um they'll have healthy active adults that are hunting and running away from hunters and then one day they just sort of slow down a bit go to sleep and don't wake up and they don't they don't have this slow degenerative uh breakdown over years and decades and then finally just give it up and and just can't make it anymore that's not what happens uh in the Wilds while when they start slowing down they get eaten by something sure but that doesn't happen in the zoo either uh they don't they don't just all getting decrepit and you know toothless lion drooling and walking into walls and things like that because they're so demented and and sarcopenic and that just doesn't happen and so why the hell would it happen to us and so you shouldn't you got to eat the right thing you eat the right thing and your body will work the right way and uh that goes for your bones too so I I've seen people I have patience I had a lady in her must have been her late 60s um who came in a couple months ago and and she uh had a dexa scan eight months ago she had osteoporosis she went full lion diet carnivore only meat and water wasn't even taking calcium supplements wasn't taking dys phosphinates or any drugs and 8 months later she got another dexa scan and she had normal bone density not only she did she have normal bone density for her age she had normal bone density for a 25y old woman right so that was that was a massive Improvement and uh I can't say everyone's going to get that sort of improvement but she did anyway and she also did resistance exercises if you're if you're doing strength training resistance training you will stimulate the bones to grow as well as the muscles to grow and if you're eating properly they'll actually do it and so I would suggest going not on a ketogenic diet but a full carnivore diet because ketogenic means you can have vegetables and things like that that don't have carbohydrates and those vegetables are going to have things like oxalates which are going to strip out calcium and demineralize your bone and make it very difficult for you to lay down bone density and and mineralize your bones and that's exactly what you need to do so I would cut all that crap out and I would only go to red meat and water and I would have her do as much resistance exercises as she can just body weight exercises light band work whatever is challenging for her to push resistance isometric is very good you know so if you're in like a sort of a shallow Hall and you can just push as hard as you can you just push and you just push and you just push until you get tired and you stop right um or you know you can lay down and and and push against the wall and just push or or even like um you know leg press machine and you just put the weight up to a point that she can't do and she just presses as hard as she can for as long as she can and she's not going to hurt herself you know she shouldn't be able to push so hard that she um damages herself um and just and just do those isometric sort of uh uh exercises and and that'll put pressure and force through the bones and through the joints and that will uh stimulate bone bone deposition as well and if she's eating properly she'll actually get it so I would get a dexa scan do that and then get a dexa scan in a year so see how you go and things are going the right way she probably doesn't need those medications does she because I agree they're not ideal so uh yeah that's uh that's what I recommend you can you can absolutely um sort this out with just diet and lifestyle if it's the right diet and the right lif estyle so good luck to her"

    "body": "member says hi I've been carnivore a month and I've been off OIC for weeks and experiencing fatigue also uh was taken off testosterone would any of these uh be the cause well you know um you're coming off testosterone you know can that can definitely give you less energy and not feel your best especially you you have a bit of a dip but your body will will recover you know the the idea that that if you go on testosterone replacement you'll never be able to come off is is a bit garbage uh I get people off testosterone replacement therapy all the time by going on a carnivore diet it can take months months and months and months for your body to start recovering and uh getting better um and being able to start producing more testosterone and you know maybe you are one of those few people that really cannot make enough testosterone but I have men in their 60s and 70s that double or even triple their testosterone levels and go back to like what you'd expect a healthy 25y old to have so that's um certainly possible that you you have a bit of a dip now because you've come off the testosterone coming off the OIC probably not I I don't I don't I think it's usually when people are on those zigs when they feel pretty rotten um coming off is is gener a good thing uh it's probably the the testosterone coming off the testosterone which is you know uh you know just to be expected you know and just see how you feel in the coming months um get your testosterone checked again remember that testosterone is is very finicky you can't you can't just test it any random time in any random condition if you work out within 48 Hours of the test it will change your results if you have sex within 20 48 Hours of the test it will change the results if if you get it in the morning versus the afternoon you will have very different results you typically give your biggest peak of uh testosterone um an hour before you wake up if you're on your proper circadian rhythm so if you're sleeping properly if you're not sleeping properly you're not going to get the same testosterone bump and so if you test it in the morning one time it's going to be whatever it is you test in the afternoon the next time it's going to be way lower right because you test testosterone goes up but then it comes down right so you're not just pumping out testosterone all day it's in the morning you get one hit in the morning and then it slows down so um that's uh that that's just something to remember as well take it first thing in the morning fasting from the night before 900 p.m. same amount of water a couple glasses of water in the morning nothing else no coffee tea anything else no medications until after your blood test no sex exercise or stress for 48 hours before your test and you do it in the morning and you do it like that every time you'll get much more consistent and reliable results as well"

    "body": "member says been vegan for 25 years since birth have CP Lyme disease IBS um and what is the best way to start adding meat to the diet worried about digestive issues with meat so first of all I'm I'm really I want to applaud you for just being open-minded enough to give this a try you know you were sort of raised vegan and um and now you know it's hard to get out of that and it's hard to sort of uh you know change something that you you've done your whole life especially if you've been raised to to understand that that's the best thing for you I make sure your parents were were doing their best and that was the best thing for you and um you know we all do the best that we can with our kids and everyone's going to mess up unfortunately but um it's great that you're you're looking at this now and and I do think that that you can significantly improve your your issues with that so you are fully designed to eat meat you can have psychological Hang-Ups and you can get psychosomatic sort of Hang-Ups where where you just like oh meat's bad meat's bad and and as you eat it and you're just you're expecting something to be wrong and so you manifest that as physical symptoms that's very common there is nothing wrong in meat there's nothing that's going to harm you there's nothing that's bad for you this is what 70% of all animals on Earth eat and even herbivores opportunistically eat meat when they can there's nothing inherently harmful in meat uh some animals make little poisons and poison sacks and things like that that's not what we're talking about we're talking about just meat um there's nothing in normal meat that's harmful to you so just remember that and so even if you oh this feels so of funny just know that you're fully designed to eat this stuff your pancreas is set up to break these things down and absorb them very well like I said earlier you absorb these things you liquefy them and absorb them very quickly as long as you're not eating with plants that have a lot of digestive Inhibitors um so it's up to you I know a lot of vegans who have just jumped right into it went just from only plants to only meat in a day and because they were very motivated and they were convinced by this they just said this is I'm not eating this stuff anymore and they switched and they did great if you're more hesitant and you're like oh what's it going to do to me you know maybe maybe transitioning a bit more slowly uh might be in your your best interest so if you do Transition slowly just remember that your body is going to digest things differently depending on what you eat it with and there's those Digestive disruptors and those uh nutrient blockers those antinutrients and things like fiber are actually going to make it more difficult for you to break down and absorb meat so I would probably suggest adding in a bit of meat on its own and not eating it with plants and not eating it with the rest of your meal like you could do that you know add some chicken to a salad or something like that or you could just have a bit of meat and just you know do that and see how it feels and you could just be like actually I feel fine actually that tastes amazing um it will especially if there's some fat on it um it's actually quite quite nice it's sort of heartwarming you see these videos on on YouTube and elsewhere of people you know who've been vegan for a long time eating meat for the first time in years and and they're sort of feeling like looking like they're guilty like oh what am I doing they eat they go oh my God oh my God that's amazing because their their body is so happy that they're getting these nutrients so they get this big reward of yes that's what we've been missing so um give it a try you know I would try just just eating it on its own you'll absorb it and digest it much better uh when you eat it on its own if you think that it's better to sort of ease into it that's how I would ease into it I'd sort of have I'd start eating more meat maybe have your other things at other times but start introducing meat on its own don't eat it with other things because that that changes how your body digests and absorbs these things and I talk to people say oh I really can't do it it gives me you know upset stomach and I always asking him I like have you ever tried just eating it on its own because it you're it's a very different story when you're just eating it on its own and I've had a number of patients come back a bit grumpy but still happy because they're feeling good that they're like like I I was I was convinced that you were going to be wrong that it was still going to upset my stomach but yeah damn it you were right it it was completely different I have absolutely no problem eating meat when it's on its own so that's something to remember if you want to jump into it and and you you sort of try some meat on its own and like okay that tastes good you have some eggs okay that tastes good I feel good that's not causing me any problems okay I can have a bit more I can have a bit more and you want to just go in and just start eating meat great you can do that if you want to do it more gradually but you want to if you want to just add meat but still have you know different whole food plants you know that that's obviously something you know that you I still think that's really really good you know you're getting really good nutrients um and so then you can play around with what that looks like for you if you want to eventually get to a carnivore diet and try that to help with all of your your issues which I think would really help you by going on a full carnivore diet you can either jump straight in like I said with that sort of transition path way or if you want to do it a bit more slowly you know you introduce the meat like we said and then you cut out carbs and sugar first and foremost alcohol obviously just get rid of that stuff all cooking oils seed oils plant oils get rid of those things they're just toxic they're not what you want you don't want any of that stuff artificial sweeteners as well just get rid of that crap so that's first and foremost and then you start reducing other things and you have a you mark it on the calendar in your phone or on the wall probably better on the wall you have an X you're like today I'm cutting out carb sugar alcohol seed oils great the next next week big X cutting out night shades potatoes Tomatoes eggplants Peppers right next week big X cutting out High oxalate foods like spinach and those sorts of things and then the next week cutting out uh everything else you know and so you know you have a have a stepwise progression of what you're going to cut out and you start building up more and more meat as you go and then just every week you're just okay you're just cutting something out cutting something out cutting something out and then eventually you have a day that you decide in advance about four weeks later maximum that you say on this day it's gone and I'm just eating meat and eggs if you want eggs and if you do well with eggs most people do but autoimmune issues probably avoid eggs and that's what I would do so sort of a long answer but uh I felt it deserved one so hopefully that was helpful and good luck to you please let me know um how that goes and and how you do in in the coming weeks and I'm sure you'll do really well"

    "body": "member says heard you got men off testosterone replacement therapy 46 that's yes that's true i' I've gotten a lot of people off testosterone uh replacement therapy by going carnivore 46-year-old 12 months carnivore want to get off trt after 3 years is concerned about side effects and loss of muscle mass cold turkey or taper uh what works in your experience it it just depends so I have um I've done both for patients um some patients just say look I'm feeling great I'm coming up to the end of my prescription what do you think like well it's fine yeah your your testosterone level is you know at a good level it's not like 25-year-old level with the with the test with trt uh but it's at a good level especially for the for this person's age he was in his 40s and um and but he felt great and he said look I I don't I don't think I need this stuff anymore I feel really good okay well why don't you just stop it we'll check your your testosterone levels again in two three months and see what it is and um two three months later he said yeah I felt fine the whole time didn't didn't feel like a drop off when I when I stopped the trt because he'd been carnivore for 6 months at that point you're actually longer than than him so you know I think you'd be fine you're about the same age too and his trt or his sorry his pre- testosterone these are Australian numbers these are different than American numbers American numbers because it's a different scale slightly higher um but so in Australian numbers uh like a 25y old you like a healthy 25y old uh you you expect to see between 600 and 900 and uh this guy was 450 so you know closer to it right but then came off trt and 2 months later his testosterone was 650 so it was up in that 25y old range right so it actually went up coming off trt because the thing that people don't realize is that when you go on trt it actually rests your goats so you're you're this is an endocrine hormone end endocrine organ and so yes there's a bit of a dip in your body starts to to make these uh you know U between when you stop taking it and when your body starts making this again but you can actually find that people can start making more testosterone because they've actually rested their um their uh their organs right and so you've allowed this to rest and uh and and you know it hasn't had to produce and work as hard to make testosterone and now it's just primed and ready to go and now you're eating properly you're giving your body what it needs to uh to work properly and then it and it comes back so there's a lot of people that just come right off and then other people um you know they might be on uh testosterone and then we just see check their testosterone and they're taking the same dose and then all of a sudden they're you know they started out at like 150 for like someone in their 40s I have a patient in his 40s is is like 150 170 so that's actually very low very low especially for his age um or even for his age that's that's that's I've had 70-year-old patients that had higher testosterone than that and then tripled it going on a on uh Carn no trt that was a guy 72 he had it's like 220 250 was his testosterone and then um yeah like four or five months on a carnivore diet no trt never started trt 750 right so he tripled his testosterone so this gentleman had even lower than that it was in the 100s 150 170 something like that he got put on te on trt by um uh another doctor at my practice and I inherited him after he retired and uh I don't put people on trt I put them on Carnivore and that that does the same or better as trt and but I've inherited a lot of patients on trt and I get most of them off of it and so this guy was was one of them and so you know he had you know sort of 450 500 testosterone with the trt so that's good that's better than it was and he felt better certainly and but then it started going up and it was and he's taking DHE as well which is over the counter hormone in America but it's prescription in Australia and um and all of a sudden his his taking the same dose of DHEA is just going up and going up and going up and going up and that was actually too high for a 25y old so I said okay well come off the DHEA and it maintained at that 25y old level great and then his test kept coming up and kept coming up and all of a sudden it's 600 and 700 and 900 and 1100 he's taking the exact same amount right so he said okay why don't you just come off and um and so he was yeah and then so yeah we took took him off that and we checked his um testosterone again a few months later hadn't taken um any of his testosterone and it maintained around 900 just over 900 so it's like well there you go you know you don't need to do that and so other people will be like maybe they'll be on an injection form and they'll be on a cream form and um so they might go up too high so okay so stop taking the injection that was one actually um with him we sort of did it uh in that in that manner because uh we tested his testosterone again and it was like a month or so after he had taken his last injection but he was still taking the cream and it was like 960 a month after he he didn't take it okay so obviously you don't need the injection so you know stop the injection because that would just go up from 950 and obviously 900 is actually the upper border of where you think would be optimal for a 25y old in Australian numbers and um and then since then it's just continued to sort of go up so we're just reducing that down so you know for him um he was able to come off all of that stuff eventually but it was a bit you know of a stepwise progression but you know we could have just just come off completely as well I I I have no doubt um so it just depends you know if you if you want to just taper it that's that's perfectly reasonable you know you can just you know you slowly sort of take it down you know sort of a half dose for a couple weeks and then a quarter dose for a couple weeks and more and more uh talk to your doctor you know it's it's it's not something that's um that's a uh you know huge problem you know the thing is if if you're just feeling rotten coming off of it you know then okay taper it you know or or taper it more slow slowly um and then that can sort of ease your body back into making testosterone so it's really up to you um you know you can talk to your doctor and say Hey I want to come off testosterone can you help me with that too so you know it's always a good idea to to talk to the you know to the prescribing doctor to see about coming off of it but I see that all the time and I see people come off cold turkey and they just say yeah didn't even feel a let down because they'd been corn of War for so long their body just sort of got right back onto it um and other others you know taper and I I think both are fine and um uh you know you you are less likely to have side effects uh by tapering so if that's what you want to do then then do that but yeah you can definitely come off and I would I would expect that you know after 3 to six months of being off of it your testosterone levels will be great and you'll feel great as well so and again test it in the morning fasting no exercise sexual activity or stress within 48 hours of taking that uh test and you get it first thing in the morning fasting from the night before fasting in the morning just a couple glasses of water nothing else no medications uh supplements anything it's very important testosterone is a is a  to test if you don't if you don't test it in that way because you just get you just get all random numbers it's just not reliable you can't trust them you just have to test it again because you're like okay you didn't do it right do it again and then you see but uh you'll see It'll you'll be fine and you'll feel fine and that's the main thing"

years and has never heard of a keto diet thank you for your time and passion yeah that that is something that really bugs the hell out of me um they just basically just said you know drugs are easier just just go down that route they work the the the treatment for epilepsy was ketogenic diet and then they started getting drugs and the drug company started pushing that and and just saying oh no no just just use the drugs just use the drugs and so we we started teaching people differently in residency and and and and directing research away from ketogenic diets helping epilepsy uh Professor Thomas C freed when he was doing his post-doctoral uh work over at uh Yale he was in the neurology department there and and he was doing research on ketogenic diets and epilepsy and the and the head of the department just said oh now we we've got good drugs for that now you know it's dead end research don't worry about it you know it's easy just you know give them drugs drugs work you know don't don't about that um so you know I mean that's uh you know maybe he could have been well-meaning but I I I just I think that that's almost certainly due to his the influence of the drug companies you know having him sort of push research away from uh any any alternatives um but you know John's Hopkins um at least last time I checked I found a paper that they published it was a while ago is an older paper but um you know that at least at the time they were saying hey you know this is this is still a really good treatment modality this is still something that we use uh it's not just for treatment resistant um epilepsy it was for all epilepsy um it's just that now it's just like well you treatment resistant and if somebody knows about it thinks about it they say oh well you could try this not everybody does a lot of people just don't even think about it don't even know about it which is crazy to me um really don't suggest it because oh but if you stop doing ketogenic diet then you could get seizures again if you stop taking your freaking anti-seizure medication you get seizures again so I mean what the what's your point it really bugs me um so sorry for swearing but like it bugs me because I've I've seen neurologists um argue with parents who want to put their kids on a ketogenic diet they're no no no just keep taking drugs just keep taking drugs it's like what the hell is wrong with you they're having seizures on the drugs and they and they're desperate to help their child and you're telling them that they're going to hurt their kid and kill their kid by doing something that you admit will work or should work and can help oh but if they if they stop then they're going to get massive seizures first of all no the longer you go without a seizure the less likely you are to have a seizure first of all second of all um you know just just getting out of ketosis it's not like it's just like this rebound effect like oh my go worst seizure ever no it's it it gets better and also don't come off the the the diet then that's easy right you know it's just like not coming off the drugs no have to take the drugs or you're going to have a seizure again all right well then don't come off the drugs oh but don't go on a ketogenic diet because if you come off the ketogenic diet then then you'll have a you you have a seizure like the same argument like you're telling people to stay on the drugs for the exact same reason okay well then stay on the diet you know so it's um you know it's it's just a bit of a weird weird thing but uh no it's not just treatment resistant it works for every well it it will work for a lot of people there are going to be people that are keto resistant you know that that aren't going to do as well um you know for memory things like uh the if you have like an actual epicenter like a like temporal lobe epilepsy would have this part of the brain that's just actively firing it doesn't work as well for those those types but um no it it works for you know not just treatment resistance it just works and I A lot of people are coming off their seizure medication uh at an appropriate time with appropriate uh care from their doctor doors uh or or help from their doctors to wean off these things because you have to wean off these things it's not safe to just come off uh for most of these and um and uh so you know it's um people people are people are coming off of these things all the time uh without an issue uh well not without an issue but they're able to wean off you know a lot of people with with brain tumors like um like um uh Andrew barboro he um he you know he would um um what's going on here and also he uh you know he he got off all his his seizure medications as well and um so you know and he had a had a brain tumor so he had a reason for that um but yeah no you can you can definitely uh do a ketogenic diet and and it should uh help you know raise his seizure threshold even with the medication to make it less likely he'll get a seizure and um improve his his uh his case so yeah so g ood luck to him I do think it would help yes"

    "body": "member says new uh new Doc thinks that I have an enlarged aorta and will be testing for that uh know nothing about this what causes it and can clean eating help like my eight months of carnivore statins in the future I'm 68 so an enlarged aorta um now I'm not not a cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon but just from medical school and things like that um you know there there there are various ways of enlarging the aorta you can get things like an aneurysm that's typically from atherosclerosis or very high blood pressure and just putting a lot of pressure out and it's just sort of bulging the pipes um and um and that can cause issues with like aortic valve regurgitation if it's sort of in that proximal part of the aorta as well um so that's sort of as much as I know about it I mean I don't no one's really told well you know asked the question about you know diet affecting these things it does depend on what's causing it you know if it's something inflammatory and and you know atherosclerotic in nature then yeah I think that your your diet and lifestyle have a huge role to play in the development of atherosclerosis you know smoking drinking sugar seed oils you know excess carbohydrates and um and a bunch of uh you know nasty plant toxins you know aren't aren't going to aren't going to help you um you know causing you know High a lot of high blood pressure damage to the the artery walls these sorts of things um you know low B12 because you're not eating all that much meat and then High home assisting damaging the interial walls of the arteries things like that so um so depending on the cause it could potentially try to mitigate that is it going to reverse that anybody's guess probably not you know I mean there are are these things that we we sort of damage our our bodies in ways that we don't necessarily recover very well from but you know sometimes you have connective tissue issues you know some people are are thinking that um you know if you aren't aren't making proper collagen um then you you may get sort of weakening of this tissue and that can and push this um and so you know going on a carnivore diet quite often people with connective tissue disorders and collagen disorders like Ellers Danos uh will will um will actually see Improvement and they don't have the joint dislocations anymore I I have three patients that I see that don't have joint dislocations anymore and with ell STL and I've spoken to many others online and done some consultations with them as well and seems to help uh a lot of people so you know still you know I'm I've personally consulted with less than 10 but you know that's that's not nothing and um and uh no one else is getting Improvement any other way so it's interesting so it just depends on what's causing the the enlarged aorta and whether the body can heal from that or not I can't tell you really one way or the other Statin I think most people know my view on statins I think it's treating an issue that doesn't exist that that you know lower it stops your body from making LDL but you want LDL that's why your body's making it it also stops your brain from making cholesterol as well which is really bad idea because your brain is made out of cholesterol and U some key components are made out of cholesterol so now you're not going to be able to have enough substrate to build and repair and uh your brain and then recover from from different sorts of uh you know wear and tear and and and insults and things like that so it's actually really important to let your body just actually run in in a normal physiological pattern so um I you know if you want to see more on that just watch my video on uh the truth about cholesterol and heart disease because and then also watch and and I you know go through a lot of studies on that and talk about a lot of um a lot of papers in that and historical records we go through and I link to nearly all of them I I don't think I have all of them all of them put in there but most of them in the description and then you know go watch um Dr Paul Mason has tons of of amazing lectures on uh on um statins and and um heart disease and saturated fat and things like that as well Zoe harkham does as well she has some excellent lectures also on all that so I would check those out and then and then you can make an informed decision on uh whether or not you think that that's that that's good for you uh Dr David Diamond does as well and he even talked about some studies looking at people with Alzheimer's who were on statins that could cross a bloodb brain barrier and um and so they cross the bloodb brain barrier they stop your brain from making cholesterol and is that a bad thing uh well at least in these these sort of Trials or these these papers they s seem to suggest that it did because people with Alzheimer's that were on um statins they were taken off the statins and six weeks later they didn't have Alzheimer's anymore when you know and then they were put back on Statin and the Alzheimer's returned six weeks later so you know this is um you know it's pretty it's pretty good that we have that out there so we say okay hey we can make a more informed decision as patients and as as doctors like oh okay well maybe this isn't the first thing I just slam everybody on uh maybe maybe we think about this but you know the the problem is is that people are still doing this wanly oh well no no that's just we just still have to do it you know and like you're hurting people you are actually hurting people and so uh that that's sort of annoying but yeah that's what I would look at it just depends just take a look you know hopefully it does help uh it doesn't matter what's what's causing it and um you know if you have some sort of connective tissue issue um you know maybe that's at play and potentially that could be helped as well so good luck with that though hopefully that um hopefully that gets better or or at least doesn't get worse and that you feel a lot better on a carnivore diet as well"

    "body": "member asks 56y old female carnivore for four months um cholesterol 5.5 triglycerides 1.1 htl 1.4 statins well I just yeah I I don't feel that statins are treating anything useful because it's it's it's reducing something that doesn't need reducing and because cholesterol was never the cause of heart disease so it certainly does reduce uh your your LDL and total cholesterol and so what uh that was never the cause of hard disease some people ask me it's like well is there what what LDL would be too high well nothing that your body's going to make physiologically in a normal condition um first of all so if you stop eating for five days your LDL goes right up right um it goes up exactly the same as if you just stopped eating carbohydrates like you went on a carnivore diet it's almost as if it was a metabolic issue and had nothing to do with um eating fat and eating meat because it doesn't has to do with eating carbs carbs going are going to suppress that down eating seed oils with plant steriles that's going to suppress that down because your your body thinks you have more than enough cholesterol so it's going to stop making it and so uh that's what's going on uh so we're we're reducing something that does not cause heart dis oh but what if you have too much what about too much well you're not going to make too much physiologically there probably is too much and you maybe get there someday and what would that do but what whatever it gets to it's not going to cause heart disease because cholesterol does not cause heart disease just doesn't you know the only randomized control trials in existent in existence the only extent uh randomized control trials on this subject have all shown that lowering LDL cholesterol does not improve cardiovascular outcomes not and then two of them actually showed that lowering LDL cholesterol causes harm and more people die of heart attacks and strokes by by replacing saturated fat with margarine and plant oils and um in very controlled setting where they had 10,000 people that were institutionalized so the the they controlled every meal that came to these people for years and they found that yeah replacing saturated fat and butter and animal fat with margarine and um and those plant oils that yeah that that did reduce LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol and guess what more people died of heart attacks and strokes as a result so this is this is a bad idea to do that okay so what if it gets too high what if it gets too high it's not going to cause heart disease because it doesn't cause heart disease so it'll do something else but you're not going to get too high physiologically your body's not just going to make too much of this stuff so I don't know how you would get too much LDL or total cholesterol it probably do something but no matter what no matter what level it gets to it's not going to cause heart disease because it's not the cause of heart disease plain and simple and also you know just going back to this uh that looks great your HDL is higher than triglycerides that means you're metabolically healthy it means you H are very likely to have pattern a LDL there's hundred different kinds of LDL and uh from that pattern you have the good ones you know so this idea that oh my God you're going to get pattern B if you go carnivore never seen that in my life um one guy one time had pattern B and remained on pattern B after six months of carnivore and that was because he had an intensely stressful um work uh situation and um and you know but after he switched out of that and the stress levels reduced and his sleep got better uh that just corrected just corrected on its own so you know there are other outside factors that can affect this you know stress um serious stress will raise cortisol that will raise glucose that will oxidize and glycate your LDL and cuse a pattern B uh type pattern sure but um that's not anything to do with your food and anything to do with what you're eating so you look great so that looks fine I wouldn't worry about that um so another followup member: faint 1 millimeter infar in 2022 on MRI um scan uh anti-platelets well that that's something you have to talk to with your doctor about on if antiplatelets are warranted um so you know it does depend on what sort of caused that um you know sometimes anti therapies can can help in all this but just going onto a very lwi inflammatory diet like or an anti-inflammatory diet like a carnivore diet can can definitely help but um those those sorts of things you need to talk to your doctor about um because you know I don't I don't you know I don't have enough information and I can't give you uh you know medical advice in this capacity so good luck with that do do follow up with your doctor if this happened in 2022 and they thought that antiplatelets were the right thing to do they probably would have put them put you on that at the time so just whatever you know I I would go with your doctors on on this one as as far as medications are concerned"

    "body": "member says uh big fan U thank you very much I appreciate that a friend's cholesterol is high even though she is not really carnivore should she be concerned is an indication of another health issue trying to get her on full carnivore um it's it's typically more to do with being in ketogenic ketogenic state so it's um if you just stop eating for five days your cholesterol goes up if you stop eating carb for five days your cholesterol goes up you know so if you check and depending on the time of the day you check your your cholesterol if you fast for 10 hours versus 14 hours you'll have different cholesterol numbers if you test your cholesterol 10 times through the course of a day you'll get 10 different results it's a a pretty fiddly test um which is another reason why may it's it's a bit useless but um it's more to do with that that's that state change that metabolic State change so if you are on a keep enic diet it's not to do with eating meat it's to do with not eating carbohydrates and your your your uh cholesterol tends to go up when you don't eat carbohydrates or you just don't eat you know but it's not not eating it's not eating carbohydrates so when you're eating carbohydrates you have way too many carbohydrates in your blood way too much energy out your body's just trying to get this out of there because High car high blood sugar actually harms you causes direct harm and damage is what kills diabetics it's high blood sugar right and so uh your body's trying to to get that down and so when your insulin goes up to to do this it locks down your fat store you can't mobilize energy and so you know uh what mobilizes fat from your fat cells to your liver to make energy it's cholesterol this is how you transport these things these the these transport molecules like HDL and LDL they transport fat around the body so you're running on fat when you're in a ketogenic state right if you're not eating or just not eating carb hydrates so you're running on fat you're running on your own fat Fuel and should you need to transport that fat you running on more fat you're going to need more uh uh LDL and HDL to to transport these sorts of things so that's what you're going to find you just stop eating for five days your HDL is going to go up your LDL is going to go up triglycerides are going to go down if you just don't eat carbs for five days your HDL is going to go up your LDL is going to go up Trier are going to go down you carnivore HDL is going to go up your LDL is going to go up triglyceride is are going to go down it's almost as if it's a physiological process that's normal and it is and typically when people are healthier and they're fitter and they have lower U BMI they're less less obesity um lower lean more lean body mass they typically have a higher corresponding rise in their cholesterol right and people that are more obese they tend to not have that rise in cholesterol so it's actually a marker of Health you know that your LDL goes up in that situ situation everything else gets better all your other blood markers get better your health is getting better your weight is getting better your body composition is getting better which is more important than weight weight doesn't really matter it's body composition and health and so all these things are getting better and objectively the numbers are getting better and then your LDL is going up but it doesn't people that are less well until they get better so why are we calling that a sign of poor health I call that a sign of good health so uh I wouldn't worry too much about that um I would watch the uh my video on the truth about cholesterol and heart disease i' show your friend that as well because it's just a con you know this was this was made up by the sugar companies they invented that idea and then they paid off a whole bunch of people like anel keys and other you know demons from hell that that pushed this on people and ended up killing you know billions of people at this point um and and ruining people's lives so um you know it's uh and and then they're still just changing the go post it was total cholesterol and then it was LDL cholesterol then it was L sdldl cholesterol now it's app o just they they keep shifting from point to point it was never cholesterol in the first place stop making up you know this is just nonsense just move on with your li fe"

    "body": "member says give me the big rant: Dr marola says a carnivore diet is calcium deficit Dr lustig's Facebook post yesterday said that meat drives Coline drives tmao drives heart disease high protein drives mtor uh that's cute I haven't seen Dr lustig's um Facebook post so I don't know uh sort of what he's talking about there but um you know does it you know I first of all who why are we saying that choline is a Bad Thing Chine is required for your brain uh now we're saying that's bad apparently you know tmao and all all these sorts of things these are these are all mtor all these sorts of things these are these are one part in a very complex multibillion piece puzzle and uh and machine and so and we're talking about just like one thing is clicking off here it's it's really myopic and missing the force for the trees when you just look at this one little thing and this is everything there's nothing else that matters is just this one little molecule and it's just like so even if it does drive up tmao is that necessarily going to always cause heart disease in all contexts forever probably not same with mtor you know and uh and also that's just it's assuming a fact it's not an Evidence there's absolutely no hard evidence that any of that stuff is true um so it's um and and flat flat out answer is no of course it doesn't because like you know the heart disease rates in Inuit when they when they're just eating meat basically non-existent same with the Messi when they're just eating you know high fat you know uh meat and in their traditional diet now that they moved to more grains and more sugar and like that yeah that's going up yeah absolutely but when they were only eating meat non-existant you know there's that study um uh I might be able to find it and put it in the chat but um if as a study back in uh the late 2000s um oh no sorry not the late 2000s the the late 1920s that um that's uh the I actually have it here I'll put it up in the chat in the late 1920s that um put in the chat now for people who want to check it out late 1920s that that found um uh they looked at the Maasai (tribe) looked at the Kikuyu (tribe) and Kikuyu (tribe) were largely plant-based Whole Food plant-based growing it themselves no pesticides no no pollution anything like that just this perfect idyllic situation they were very sick they got much more sick than the Maasai (tribe) um and the Maasai (tribe) didn't barely got sick at all they never really got sick the males certainly were less were the most healthy out of all of them um both males and females from the M Maasai (tribe) and Kikuyu (tribe) the male Maasai (tribe) were the healthiest the female Maasai (tribe) were the second healthiest and way down distant third were the Kikuyu (tribe) women who had a more diverse plant-based diet and the dead last were The Kikuyu (tribe) Men Who at mostly grains I've seen um you know Liars on the internet pushing a vegan that that completely lied about that um uh study and said that the the Kikuyu (tribe) women were the most healthy out of all for complete and utter they were better than the men the akiyu men uh but they were worse than both the males and females of the Maasai (tribe) what about the Maasai (tribe) mtor what about the Maasai (tribe) tmao um what about the Maasai um you know calcium and they drink a lot of milk but where do they get that milk from they get that from an animal well how how much calcium is in Grass how much calcium is in meat I mean I get is that enough for bones well I don't know why don't you ask a lion they have bones you know and um you know they drink their mother's milk and so they get a lot of calcium there okay yeah I guess they're drinking milk where did the mom get the calcium to make the milk she's just eating meat she's not drinking someone else's milk she's not drinking her mom's milk it was just like this you know wor oroborus where you just like you just just drinking milk milk milkk milk milk milk milk milk milk we just drink each other's milk and pass along the calcium to make each other's milk that's not happening right so they're getting the calcium from the meat that they're eating so you're dumb you know so obviously there's enough calcium in that meat right or else they wouldn't have any milk or they wouldn't have any milk they wouldn't have any calcium in their milk and they wouldn't have any calcium for their bones either because um you know baby cats are all mammals they drink their mother's milk and then they get weaned onto their mother's diet when they're very small when they're very young and then they eat that D for the rest of their life when lions are weaned onto and humans are weaned onto meat that they're still very small and so the majority of their bone growth and Bone mineralization happens after weaning happens after they they get off their mother's milk so it's not the milk that's doing it and again the calcium from the milk has to come from somewhere right um so you know the thing is is that you know you can you can say all this stuff and you can say oh well there's not enough calcium in there well okay where the hell does it come from the thing is is that when you're not eating with plants you're not getting these antinutrients that are blocking out the absorption of calcium you're not getting with oxalates that goes into your bloodstream and strips out the calcium you need way more calcium uh you know in those circumstances just to get anything than you would than you would otherwise also what about bone mineralization you have um bers cats they fed raw meat and cooked meat the cooked meat ones got sickly got small the Next Generation were smaller more sickly and had less bone mineral dens density and Bone mineralization and uh it was like from 14% to 7% and then the third generation was down to 3% right there's the exact same amount of calcium in cooked meat as raw meat right so it's not about the amount of calcium there's enough calcium there obviously because the raw meat cats had bones and made bones in their kittens and those kittens grew up to be adults with bones um the calcium was fine it was something else that was lacking in the cooked meat that made it impossible for them to function normally in a physiological manner so they weren't able to to mineralize their bones properly to make proper collagen um because you know they have torine and other sorts of amino acids that were getting cooked out that they require so that's what that's what's going on so you know you're looking at these things you're looking at at a mixed diet and we're looking at these uh rdas they were made up by some named Ancel Keys who I I don't trust a damn thing that guy's ever done because he's just a paid shill sellout and probably a spawn from Satan sent to this earth to destroy humanity and he um he came up with these damn things but he came up with them at a time when everyone was eating a mixed diet and so maybe that's correct for people on a mixed diet but that's not necessarily correct for anybody else because you don't need 10 milligrams of Vitamin C A Day To Save off scurvy on a carnivore diet you just don't you know because you you don't need Vitamin C in the first place to make collagen otherwise I'd be dead right now my vitamin C when I checked it was was Trace right so look at that you don't need that for scurvy right um so it's uh it's nonsense and so these rdas they only matter in the context of a mixed diet so they're saying well there's not enough calcium here because we know well no we don't because you haven't checked the rdas and the requirements for people that don't eat and don't eat plants that have anti-nutrients and block out the absorption of of calcium and strip out the calcium from your body they gave people spinach back in the 1950s spinach has a lot of calcium it's not bioavailable and they come with oxalate so in fact they gave them spinach because of all the calcium and people's calciums went down as a result of that right because none of the calcium was available to them it's not bioavailable it's all locked up in in bonds that we couldn't access right and couldn't break down and then the oxalates would get in the blood and strip out the calcium so if you're eating this crap you know uh then you're you're going to damage your body's your body in general but you're also going to damage your body's ability to maximize its nutrient profile in in the food that is bioavailable so um and again you know it doesn't matter what any any study says it doesn't matter what any you know really smart guy I have a lot of respect for Dr Lusty he's a very smart man but it doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is doesn't matter how smart you are if it doesn't agree with experiment it's wrong and The observed phenomena is that when people exclusively eat meat they don't get heart disease there was no heart disease to speak of certainly not rampant deaths from heart attacks before the 20th century in America or Europe just didn't exist in any real numbers there was a couple in Europe in in uh in America the first diagnosed um death from heart attack uh on autopsy was in 1912 it didn't exist before then right U they just they didn't see any of these things maybe they happened but they they were doing thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of autopsies um like each doctor would be doing hundreds of these things and they just never saw these things and they was like hold on a second that's you'd see that you it's not a subtle thing someone dies from a heart attack it means they have a blockage that kills an area of the heart and that muscle ruptures and has a massive blowout bleed and that stops the heart funny enough or they survive that it doesn't rupture and it scars down you have a whole side of the Heart Ball just scarred out and thinned out and then it might rupture or it might form an aneurysm out here are very you know not subtle signs right so you would notice that and yet they you we weren't seeing any of that stuff on autopsy not C certainly not to any great degree and uh and then all of a sudden 10 years later 20 years later it's a number one killer in America that's funny that's odd we don't see any of these things and now they're the only things we're seeing you know that's complete so we were eating plenty of meat before that the Native Americans the Plains Indians these guys really to be 110 120 sometimes 130 plus years where were their heart attacks when they're just eating bison what about the Inuit when they're just eating um you know uh seals and everything like that you don't get these things Anthropologist calls this the diseases of civilization um you know you get these um populations you know they have like you know uh they get injuries accidents infectious diseases it's only when they they sort of go into society and C cities they start getting the diseases of civilization um and the disease that you see in developed in developed countries and why is that these people are living plenty old but they're they're just not developing these diseases and people I saw this one idiot on um he's a doctor and he's an idiot doctors are people and some people are idiots that's all there is to it U this guy was on Tik Tok can't remember his name maybe someone remembers his name in the chats or something like that maybe they saw it but this guy he look something that Paul saladino said about you know there weren't really heart attacks in the 1800s and we were eating far more meat and uh he just goes like a well that's ridiculous people just weren't living long enough in the 1800s to to develop these sorts of diseases that guy's a he's um he's just pushing a really shitty ideology and trying to profit off of it um and he's he's a bariatric surgeon by the way so he's a he's a weight loss surgeon so um it's in his best interest to have really bad advice on weight loss right because um you know if his advice was so damn good he wouldn't need to operate on anybody uh but he does because he's he's a hack um and he's and he's just too stupid to even just look up the numbers I mean it's really easy I mean it's just like just just Google's your friend you just look this up I've got the statistics on my phone they got statistics going back to 1850 through you know the the 19 or the 2010s showing average life expectancy from birth and so it's just like yeah sure you know um life average life expectancy from birth uh in 1850 was only 38 does that mean that people were dying in their 30s that they were just dying of old age in their 30s well that'd be funny because the minimum required age to run for president of the United States was 35 and that rule was come up with they came up with that rule in the 1700s right so that's pretty odd people are just dropping dead of old age um you know or just getting killed by things everyone was just dying in their 30s they just weren't living long enough to develop heart disease and people do die of heart attacks in their 30s right but if the minimum age was 35 obviously that wasn't the geriatric population was it right that was a minimum age um Ben Frank was like 64 at the beginning of the Revolutionary War right I mean do I don't I don't I don't know if people actually think anymore you know they certainly don't look up it's really easy they can just check well people were dying there but but wait were they do I know that because people speak so authoritatively and and some of these things they have no business doing it some things they they that's the thing people you know um Thomas Sowell writes a lot about this about intellectuals you know because they they're really good at their area and they get so used to being an authority figure and just know like well I think this and I I spent 20 years 30 years in my field I know what I'm talking about and they just know what they're talking about so much that other things that they haven't spent 20 30 years looking into they just be like they just they just have this preconceived notion they're like oh yeah people died in their 30s back then yeah authoritatively what did you look at it up is that from your years of research and and clinical experience that you're you're coming at this no you just pull it out of your ass and it fits your narrative and so but now you're speaking authoritatively because you've been youve so used to speaking in that manner for so long so it's complet completely under garbage uh so no people were not dying in their 30s they were certainly living long enough look up every Founding Father you know um you know John Adams was 91 when he died and he he was born in the mid 1700s right Jefferson was like 82 you know all these other guys were in their 80s and 90s unless they were killed by something you know like George Washington died but in his his what late 60s or 70s but you know he he got sick he got pneumonia and they just kept like doing blood leting and cupping and all these sort of horrible things they basically killed him you know they just sort of just ex sanguinated him the poor bastard um he probably would have just been fine just let let the let the poor man rest but um uh he ended up he end up passing away as a result of these very well-meaning people most likely who knows but um but either way you know he he was he wasn't he didn't die of old age and he was plenty old enough to get heart disease and yet didn't get heart disease and he smoked and he drank four out of five men smoked in the 1800s where was that where where was that with heart disease why is why is why I mean that that should be a high risk and yet people weren't dying from this stuff you see it on on autopsy you can see some plaques they saw some plaques going back hundreds of years yeah but no heart heart attacks they're just like what's that and they recognized it as pathological they're like that's not supposed to be there that's normally not there that's wrong that's different H I wonder why that is so we documented that we did see this stuff but it never hit the prevalence that it did or or got bad enough to like actually stop people's um you know stop people's circulation and cause heart attacks or Strokes until until the 20th century and it's not because we were living longer so if you look at those statistics 38 from birth but infant mortality rate was very high and so that's an average because a lot of kids are dying in infancy the adults have to live a lot longer than that to pull that average up from zero right so you know that's a big difference and so the the PE people taking those statistics were a lot more intelligent than that that idiot Tik Tock doctor um who was like like this white-haired guy I mean he's he's a grown ass man he should some grandfather presumably he should know better than to just talk out of his ass and just make up that he hasn't looked up um so the people making the statistics much smarter than that guy who doesn't know how to think um probably wasn't taught how to think um in life expectancy from birth was 38 but if you live to be 10 years old it was 56 big difference right so you made it to 10 years old you make it to 56 you made it to 20 you'd live longer and so if you made it to adulthood you made it out of those early years where you can get killed by something or dying a war or famine or something like that the majority of people were actually living similar ages to to what they are now and that's what this that's what the the statistic showed and that's the official statistics so they went decade by decade of year and decade by decade of life it's a whole big chart and so in 1870 if you live to be 50 you were going to live this long on average again these are averages and they had that go up all the way to the 80s so in 1850 they tracked this out if you made it to 80 on average you make it to 86 now it's 88 right not much difference but the simple fact that they kept records and statistics on people getting to their eighth decade means that there were enough people getting there eth decade that it was worth taking statistics on right so I mean use your head I mean you just look up famous people from that era and how long they lived how long how old was was Mark Twain when he died you know my great-grandfather was was born in 1875 he died in 1975 at home fully accomplish MST he was a 100 years old born in 1875 right and um where where was his where was his uh um you know death at 30 I mean like he should have been I guess dead at the at the uh you know the turn of the century you know according to this guy this genius I mean how many people you see in these pictures they're just they're old men in the 1800s in the 1700s I mean Socrates was in his 70s and they had to kill him right and he there's no accounts in Plato oh my he's just the oldest man on earth I was like no one just could could imagine that anyone would live that long so you know this is just these are these are very very very shortsighted View and I would I would I would say that the marola is saying that calcium deficient is a short-sided view as well because it's not clearly your The observed fact is no it is not you see carnivores eating meat not chewing Up Bones getting calcium where did the calcium from the bones come from you know and of the animals that they're eating and then you know making you know calcium in milk and all these sorts of things and just and just being so reductionist that you say well meat has Chine Chine will drive tmao TMO will drive heart disease and high protein will drive mtor will it though and will it do all of those things the evidence is strongly in the negative it does not do any of that crap and um I yes I would bet my life on it and I am so thank you very much oh and it drives cancer what are they on about yeah smoking crack that's all there is to it yeah I actually really like Dr lustig I don't know why why he he's arguing that but you know the whole mtor thing I went into this with with um uh Professor Bart Kay um who uh you we sort of went into that the whole idea with mtor is that you eat protein it gets into your large intestine and there's certain bacteria there that could work on that protein that may secrete mtor and that could be absorbed and that may cause a problem lot of ifs ANS CS mayz or butts and uh because the but there is if you don't eat meat with plants and fiber and antinutrients and proteas Inhibitors protein is not getting your colon in the first place you're absorbing it right and so you know you're not it's not going to get down there so even if you had those bacteria which you may or may not because you're eating something different so you may not actually cultivate that bacteria right so even if you had that bacteria there wouldn't matter because the protein's not getting there anyway so it's a moot point and and I think people just really don't understand that um and if you're eating meat in a mixed diet and you have all this other crap in it that's delaying the absorption it's going to get there yeah maybe maybe and does that do something in your body that's negative maybe but maybe not there's literally zero hard evidence of that it's all conjecture and supposition and again it's a moot point because br's not going to get there in the first place because you're not eating it with a whole bunch of other stuff that's going to delay the absorption marola never really a fan of marola I I sort of half watched some of his things early on really wasn't impressed and just sort of got bored with him pretty quickly um he's pretty flighty pretty just goes where the wind blows him so he's all pushing oh keto keto keto and then one guy says one thing about Ray Pete and he's just like oh my God keto so bad you're all gonna die like okay okay you know but um you know I I and then just saying things oh it's it's deficient in calcium and yet it isn't so you know in real practical terms it isn't so there are people doing carnivore right now that have carnivore babies there's the Inuit who exist as a species generationally and their kids eat a bunch of meat they make milk from the calcium they get in meat and the kids eat meat and they build more bones and so it is it just does not fit The observed facts and if things it doesn't matter what your theory is it doesn't matter who you are if it doesn't fit The observed facts it's a dumb Theory I mean it's just it it's not even like the you know if if it doesn't meet with experiment it's wrong if you if you have a theory and you look out in the world and you see it goes completely counter to that theory it's a dumb Theory you need to throw it away or you need to think about it and go like oh okay I didn't I didn't realize that I didn't think about that um but if it's in your face going like well then how do lions make milk and you trying to make excuses for this or whatever you know it's just like okay well how did the innuit make milk you know if you don't say like okay yeah good point I guess I guess it's not what we thought it is I guess the RAS aren't really what we should judge this by you can't do that you know it's it's a dumb Theory and if you've looked at all that but no but the RDA the RDA said it you know you're being you're being kind of stupid at that point so Debs thank you for the"

    "body": "carnivore for about four months still no weight loss how much longer do you think till it comes off still facing brain fog am I not fat adapted yet so this was this was the question about uh Dairy so look you're in that situation where you're not necessarily uh losing much weight remember that if you put on muscle and you lose fat you will stay the same weight so the scale is really not what's important a lot it's really important for people to really focus on their health as opposed to the scale the vast majority of people will lose weight and fat uh early on but other people will be you know everyone comes from a different situation metabolically and hormonally and so you just need to look at things from from where you are and focus on your health this is about being healthy first and foremost this is not a weight loss gimmick this is a health optimization technique this is this is eating to our biological design and being as healthy as we can possibly be that's the main thing weight generally comes along with that fat loss generally comes along with that but it's that's that it's important to focus on the health aspects so think about how this is helping you think about how this is benefiting you and um and and go from there and let the other things come as well brain fog is rare but again there's there are some people that it takes months before they really start seeing the full benefits and we don't exactly know why I haven't figured that one out yet um U because it's very rare we just don't see it every now and then and then just all of a sudden something just ticks over and just people feel massively better and their weight starts coming off there are a lot of reasons for for weight loss stalls could be Dairy could be other things that you're including in your diet like artificial sweeteners that's a common one people including orthol monk fruit sugar Stevia these sorts of things because they think well it's natural sweetener well Sugar's a natural sweetener right and so you know we're we're avoiding that too so you know you just want to just just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good just cut out everything else just keep it simple um and have uh you know a bit of organs things like that the higher nutrient density the more satiated you're going to be earlier on your body's chasing nutrients it's not chasing calories so you don't want to eat a ton of organs because that can be overwhelming to your system you can get too much of a good thing and have hypervitaminosis or you know increase it especially the fat soluble vitamins like vitamin A or things like copper and the different metals they build up and take longer to clear out of your system than say like water soluble vitamins like B vitamins right so just be mindful of that but having a bit of organs especially early on when you're transitioning it's great idea you know it's it's Nature's multivitamin right and so and uh so you can try that there are other reasons different hormonal reasons things that people have leptin resistance Le tiin that's elevated it's generally very difficult to lose weight for most people and um some people still can but a lot of people don't a lot of people when they have high leptin it's very stubborn weight loss and that can be in indicative of a slowed and damaged metabolism and so you need to coax your metabolism to increase you don't want to starve it and suppress your metabolism more and that's what happens if you can if you chronically limit the amount of nutrients and energy available through your diet your body's just going to shut things down and you're going to feel really tired you're gonna have horrible brain fog you're going to feel wretched and you're not going to really lose weight because your body saying no no no we have to store everything everything coming in is going into fat because we need to survive a famine and so energy levels are down because less coming in less is going out so you want to do the opposite you want to coax your system you want to coax your metabolism and speed it up so you want to do things like exercise anerobic exercising so resistance training sprinting those sorts of things even though you feel tired just do it you'll get something done you you'll start encouraging your system to work but you need to eat enough as well you don't just want to exercise and not eat enough because then you're doing the opposite as well your body's like well now we really need to save everything because you know we're having a high demand output and you know we're not getting enough in so we really need to hang on to this tightly so don't do that uh eat enough and eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you know try that twice a day if you need to especially if you're working out and see how that goes you can check test your blood you can test your thyroid you can test your uh leptin you can test your fasting insulin these are signs these These are different things that if they're out of balance that can cause uh slow weight loss and and slow metabolism you can also check your your nutrient status your B12 your vitamin D your zinc and your magnesium these are very important things um you get them with meat but people are when you're starting on this thing most people are on a very deficient diet and not taking supplements and so they're going to be quite deficient in these things to to the extent that the reference ranges have actually slid down and gotten and gotten lower because they're just an average for the community since everybody's deficient in magnesium B12 zinc and vitamin D they're just just move that reference range now well this is normal now it's like this is the new normal deficiency is The New Normal apparently and uh no it's not normal and so if you're in the reference range for these sorts of things you're not on the really upper end of that reference range or above that reference range you're low that's all there is to it it's I've never seen um any country uh any any lab that had a reference range for B12 that's actually made it into what I would consider an optimal reference range for B12 so the other ones you know sometimes they sort of lip into the right range but not always um so you want to be on the upper end of their reference range If you're sort of low normal for them you're really low if you're low low for them really low um so you can check those things as well uh but just be patient get out everything except fatty meat and water and make sure you're eating enough make sure you're sleeping well because that can be a major stall as well if you're stressed out you're not sleeping well that raises cortisol and that will stall your weight loss and um there a lot of different things it's it food is the main factor here but these other factors really matter as well so just keep that in mind uh as well and and um and then just just keep giving it time you know it uh it can take longer for some people than others even when they're doing it right the vast majority of people don't uh have uh as much of a delay as this but you know it will happen for you too i' I've never seen anyone not get there and some people I see that their letin massively elevated and it just takes time and they're not really losing weight not really losing weight not really losing weight and then all of a sudden their leptin's coming down the whole time and then all of a sudden Just Hits that Tipping Point and the rest of their metabolism other sorts of factors coming play and then they start losing weight um I just had a lady actually been following since last year she uh has been doing this and you know explain that to her and and she'd been overweight her whole life nothing had ever worked and um and she came around this and she said okay I'm just going to give it a try you know I knew it can take longer and and she's doing this for her health and she just really enjoyed it she was eating well and things were and and know it wasn't hard for her to do so she's like okay you know I'm enjoying this she wasn't really losing much weight but her leptin was Skyhigh and her fasting insulin was very elevated as well and she had other other markers that you know this was going to take a while and um you know so we we corrected things and added a bit of liver and all these sorts of things that she was able to eat and we just sort of tracked her every month and she's losing a bit but not all that much and uh you know really just very slow but she's like okay I'm just I'm in this for the Long Haul you know I feel good I'm just going to focus on my health and just give it time that was back in August right so was a long time ago right and just last month she came in hadn't seen her for sort of a month before that and every month she was just sort of like losing just a a little bit little bit a little bit and then all of a sudden bam 16 kilos which is significant right I mean that's like 35 pounds right so that was in a month month six weeks you know and so that just that just happened to hit just that was it her her Leon was coming down down down and then bang just dropped all this weight so you know that that is generally what happens your body needs to just get to a point where it's happy and it's saying okay we're not in a famine anymore we can release this so fix all those other things and then after that just give it time and I think you'll do fine I'm sure you'll do fine"

step I need to take well first of all it came down and that's good doesn't doesn't do that any other way right I mean what what you know have you what have you done so far that has given you even that much of a drop in your A1C right so you know I mean this is we need to be appreciative of this as well you know count your blessings uh some people have have more of a drop than that but you know who cares you know I mean some some people have you when you're coming from the very higher levels of A1C that can have a more dramatic drop so I mean I've seen people with a hb1c of you know 13 14 drop down to you know five or six after three four months that's that's incredible right so that doesn't happen but that doesn't happen either it's not supposed to go from 6.8 to 6.4 it only just goes up it just goes up it goes up it goes up and you try to slow it down with medications and lifestyle but it only goes up that that was the previous thought and teaching was that this is a progressive disease and it only gets worse right not anymore so you're already improving and that's that's you're already breaking the norm breaking the standard so that's great you should be really happy with that also how long was it between tests right you know was it one month two months three months five months six months a year right obviously that's going to matter too so the point the the main thing is is the trend you're trending in the right direction also if you're on blood sugar medications for your diabetes you should not stop them until your blood sugar indicates that it's appropriate to if you're if you're you're fasting blood sugar um you really should be between four and five that's what you want to keep it and so if you need medications to keep it there take medications to keep it there right um going from 8 to 7.2 and dropping from 6.8 to 6.4 that that seems is about right you know you want to be you want your fasting uh fasting blood sugar to be between four and five really so you still have insulin resistance you still have diabetes you still need to take medication if you're on it and you should probably be be on it uh in this case that can help you bring that blood sugar down and reduce the insulin resistance or give you enough insulin if you're not producing enough uh for now but it's um most people can come off insulin um but it takes time right so it can take you know people you know people get you know very excited that that this can help reverse their diabetes so they go okay if I just stop eating carbs I don't have diabetes anymore no not yet you know you have you have lead poisoning right and so you stop drinking leaded water great there's still lead in your body there's still poison in your body your body still has to recover from that and if you need medications to get that lead further out of your system and heal and repair the damage from that lead great you know then so be it thank goodness there they have medications for those things I don't think we use that as a crutch to justify eating a whole bunch of carbs and sugar definitely not but if you need it uh because you have damage and you're you you're using it as a bridge when you're transitioning to a proper diet great that's very useful and so that's what medication is supposed to be for it's this temporary bridge to get you to where you need to go not just a lifelong um you know lifelong condition that you have to chronically be taking even though that's what they are buil for and designed for because that's what makes them the most money is if you take this the rest of your life you don't need to take it the rest of your life but you may need to take it right now so if you if you're on medication I continue taking your medication I would try to get your blood sugar down between four and five when especially when you're fasting and um and if you need you know metformin or whatever you're taking to to achieve that that so be it don't come off your medication until it's actually appropriate to you but you know what whatever you're doing is working so that's good you know it's all about the trend you're going in the right direction and so why would we be upset about that it's going in the right direction you know we can all want in instant results but this is amazing that doesn't happen normally right and so doing anything else that doesn't happen this is the only thing that has ever done that right there right and so you be very happy about that be very proud of that and just look forward to the rest look forward to it it continuing to get better you know if um you know if you're if you're not pure pure pure fatty meat and water get there and um and get rid of all artificial sweeteners everything I I don't care if they don't have carbs in them I don't care if allulose has a much lower glycemic index just don't eat it just don't have it just eat fatty meat only drink water eat until you're full stay on meds when you need them come off when it's appropriate and you will do you will do just fine and you will reverse your diabetes that is what people all around the world are doing uh by the millions now it's it's absolutely incredible so um you know just keep it up keep going get as pure as you can and uh just be patient it is going in the right direction and you're doing gr eat so just keep it up"
