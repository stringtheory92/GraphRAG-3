    "transcript": "foreign hello everyone good morning good evening good early early morning for people in the UK and Europe you can type okay all right well hopefully everyone is doing well so it's the same ideas we have um some messages and everything like that or sorry some questions set in um early on and [Music] um and we'll also be able to to people can ask questions uh live and I'll try to keep an eye on on both and um but obviously um you know if I miss something in the chat or something like that just someone maybe bring it to my attention or something like that okay see here good morning pretty time for hanging during the hurricane oh God sorry another hurricane that's fun all right let's see okay so I we'll just um they may have any any questions they wanted to just ask well because Mike says Where do I get this shirt uh so my sister got this for me um which is kind of fun so uh yeah it's all the different different parts this is obviously the head if people didn't know that and the Chuck the brisket ribs things like that where all the different things go and um but yeah my sister ordered it I don't know exactly where she she got it from so so Aubrey just has a question let's see if one falls off the wagon at a social occasion how long does it take to reset back to fat burning Etc well technically it takes 24 hours um strictly speaking um that that's how long it takes you to buy your your biochemistry to sort of flip over metabolic States um will you be as efficient uh burning fat as you were previously maybe maybe not sometimes it takes a little bit longer uh to to reset but it's generally about 24 hours and then um you know if you just sort of slip up once but you're pretty much that adapted then you know it's it's actually not going to be that hard to come back and so it's it's definitely in your best interest to come back it's not going to take like weeks and weeks and weeks to come back all of a sudden because you you are fat adapted your your biochemistry is primed to to run on on fats uh primarily and um and so if you screw that up you basically have sort of low energy uh or you could have a bit of low energy uh for the next sort of day or so and then after that you should be you should be fine you'll have still have a bunch of toxins and garbage in your system that won't make you feel good you may it might be sore you might be uncomfortable you might have swollen joints uh or back pain joint pain and or just be just just feel a bit crummy for a few days afterwards depending on what you eat and how much you ate and and then that goes away too so all told you're probably looking at at you know probably like four or five days depending on how much how much you eat alcohol uh is longer I noticed that I don't really feel my myself um with my same energy levels at exercise tolerance for for really about three or four weeks but that's you know but that's like with working out a lot I mean I I you know when I'm when I'm working out I do big workouts and I'm not really able to do those full workouts for up to three weeks after I I would drink alcohol even if I'm even if I'm not hungover the next day so that's why for me you know it has to be like a very very good reason to to drink so but yeah so yeah basically you'll you'll you'll kick back into fat burning in 24 hours and your body will get launching junk out in the next sort of three four days and um but yeah so it's definitely well worth getting back into it so Mike X metabolism gets gets back quicker and residual side effects are what takes time then yeah yeah when you slip up yeah so in in Biochemistry when you talk about like the FED State and the fasting State fed state is just always there if you're eating carbohydrates fasting State happens of around 24 hours after you stop after your last carbohydrate and the intermittent fasting people will um suggest that maybe it's not 24 hours maybe it's more like 18 hours 16 hours you know so you have that eight hour sort of window that you're doing a little better but I mean it's a gradient so like your engine won't go up and it'll have a half-life and it'll slowly come down so while it may not be like perfectly uh you know reduced at 16 hours it might be low enough that you're getting getting good good um good results from an intermittent fasting point of view [Music] um and then Maria asks says that she was listening to Bill Schindler talk about fermented dairy what are my thoughts um big fan of Bill Schindler I really like that guy uh and uh yeah that's something that humans have been using for a long time you know fermentation you know he talks about niche terminalization as well and a lot of other different techniques that that native peoples used to you know reduce the toxicity of plants and also increase uh the the um bioavailability of different nutrients and so fermentation is just one of those things too for for you know plants as well as dairy we've been we've been fermenting Dairy for a long time that gets rid of the lactose and and then you get a lot of the of the the positive animal proteins and fats without the the black you know the lactose and the carbs and things like that which we we don't really handle as well and um and you know as he shows is like a lot of people are actually still lactose intolerance like like the Mongolians who eat a lot of dairy who they eat a lot of but they it's all fermented dairy so actually they have they're very lactose intolerant in Mongolia but they still eat a lot of dairy that's because it's all fermented so um if you're gonna eat dairy from fermenting is probably a good idea you know and you get you get more out of it and you get less of the uh you know the the lactose or no lactose and so that's that's what like you know yogurts and you know kefir and um uh you know and sour cream and things like that that's what these things are and and so they're they're a little better but you know I still you know if you're if you're looking at it as what's what's like the best of the best like gold standard is still going to be just meat you know um and so you know if you need to flesh out your diet you know with with Jerry then yeah fermented dairy is great is a great way to do that um if you can just afford and have meat accessible all the time you know then you can do that as well I definitely feel the best when I'm when I'm just eating um when I'm just eating meat but you know a bit of yogurt every now and then like if I if I needed to take um you know uh antibiotics for whatever reason at any point I would I would certainly consider uh taking some you know live live Culture Yogurt with it and then I would and then I would be able to you know sort of replenish the microbiome and things like that um Jordan says I want to know about eating meat and diverticulitis uh is it okay what are your thoughts it's it's more than okay it's it's probably the only safe thing that you can eat diverticulitis um so when you have diverticulitis diverticulosis is is the out pouching of so your colon supposed to be a tube diverticulosis is when that thing basically blows bubbles because it's the muscles have failed and so you have these little out pouching and these diverticulate which are little bubbles you know sort of like little herniations out of the of the colon and um diverticulitis is when those diverticulosis you know diverticulosis gets infected itis just means inflammation and so um when people have diverticulitis they still eat we don't tell them to not eat we tell them to eat a low residue diet what is meat meat is the most low residue diet that you can get you absorb 98 of it and if you're not eating the gristle you're absorbing 100 of it so uh yes meat is exactly what you want to eat with diverticulitis uh can you heal histamine intolerance I have normal levels of Dao but I'm still very sensitive to histamine uh that's a good question um that's not something that I'm too familiar with as far as I don't have any like real numbers for you um you know it's yeah so I wouldn't be able to give you any any hard answer with that one um you just have to sort of see how you go if you're just eating a carnivore diet you're not eating anything else your body's going to be able to handle things much better and even if things you're intolerant to you will probably find that you you have an easier time with them coming coming from meat as you go but just you know either way if you have a problem eating certain kinds of meat because of histamines or or whatever then just avoid those you just eat the meats that that work for you um so you don't have to you don't have to force anything and every now and then you can just sort of you know dip back in and try them try these other things and and see how you go so I don't I don't have any studies that they're only well I don't know of any studies that sort of answer that question either way so we just sort of you know see how you go um okay so question from Madeline I've been eating Kia horse since April last four weeks carnivore 1.5 weeks into carnivore I started to become over emotional I wanted to cry several times a day last for two weeks until I got my period I noticed that I was estrogen dominant at the end of my cycle and the cycle was several days shorter when the period came I felt awful like I had a dark cloud over my head I took three hour it took me three hours of mental battles to cook some food I think I have very low serotonin now so I ate salmon to get some tryptophan to then get more serotonin and it felt a bit better I had only been eating beef and pork with ghee salt and black pepper until the salmon I only drink water and eat three meals a day the first two meals are smaller and the last meal I eat until I get completely full I also get about 65 to 80 percent of my calories from fat can I do something to feel better and why do I feel worse since going carnivore I think that everything you're doing there is actually really good I mean I don't see anything I mean except you know pepper you know um that's I think the only fly in the ointment but I don't know if that's going to be enough to to cause your problems probably isn't but you know it's it's um you know you might might try taking it out uh you know it it if your your hormones are sort of getting back into back into balance that's that's quite normal I mean you're very early on in carnivore but key Devore you're going to you're going to sort of be able to rebalance a lot of your hormones but you know normally people get people get back into a normal hormonal Rhythm but it doesn't necessarily happen overnight it can take weeks it can take a couple months but things generally you know progress into in a positive order so I I don't I don't see anything that you're doing wrong I think everything you're doing is really good and so I would just I would just keep doing what you're doing you know do try to get and make sure you get enough fat you make sure you're eating enough and and eating until you're full um which it sounds like you are you know it sounds like you're doing really really well I'm very sorry that you had such a rough patch this last uh this last month but I would just yeah I would just keep it up I think this will will smooth out you know because you're doing you're doing everything right I think your your emotions will will settle down um obviously outside of food we can be you know very influenced by our environments so just make sure that you're in a in a secure environment as well and that things are good and happy and safe around you and um and that your you know you're sorting things out from a stress standpoint from a sleep standpoint and uh and from everything else very sorry that sounds uh it sounds awful but I think that that if you you know just sort of you know I think that your food is optimized I think the only thing that I think that you could do other than this is get rid of the black pepper that black pepper Salmon's fine go to town on salmon if you like it and if it makes you feel better and um and just focus on on sleep and stress and reducing stress levels and see how you go I would imagine that this that will get better I think you will get better and I hope you do um I think it says we'll try to stick to things and that's great yeah yeah keep it up so Wendy in the last six months I have slowly titrated off Gabapentin from 2100 milligrams to zero awesome um used for an insomnia and anxiety and RLS and restless leg syndrome that's a lot of you have a pendant for just restless leg syndrome and anxiety completed so anyway completing two weeks ago uh she came off a bit I'm going doing great without the meds which is great however waking up drenched in sweat every morning even more so since I upped my water based on recommendations from eight ounces two gallons a day in the last week and I've started craving water today could the sweating be from the meds or too much water should I be concerned no other issue sleeps fine legs are great no anxiety unless everyone have rib eyes um no I don't think that's a side it's usually a lot of side effect from coming off medications I mean for bodies are sort of you know used to something and then you know maybe a bit of a weird reaction afterwards but [Music] um it would be uncommon I mean I don't I've never really heard of people getting night sweats from stopping Gabapentin or even from taking Gabapentin uh 2100 milligrams is up a big old dose though that is um that's quite a lot I'm so I'm I'm pretty surprised that they had you on that I'm very glad that you're off of it because that's a big whack um no I don't think well I mean if you if you're just drinking enough water that your body is just that can be like oh thank God I can actually sweat now that's one thing you know because eight ounces is is pretty low I think you know no matter who you are um if a gallon of water is is feeling good for you then that I just listen to your body craving water today yeah sometimes when you get when you get dehydrated enough you just sort of shut down your your signals and then all of a sudden you drink enough water to realize how thirsty you are um I'll uh I'll put out a um a video with uh uh Dr Gabor somla who's actually an expert in deuterium which is very very interesting actually that throws a whole other dimension into the whole whole Health discussion um but deuterium is heavy water it's just a hydrogen that's twice the weight of of normal hydrogen and but it has the same you know um uh positive sort of charge interaction and so it responds to the same similar chemically but it's a different isotope it's twice as heavy so it actually behaves differently in it and it and it makes molecules act differently and sometimes you'll have tighter binding receptors or more loose binding receptors um areas and and they change it changes how your your body works and so he was saying that you know you don't want to drink like massive amounts of water because there's you know as higher levels of deuterium and you want you want to keep it sort of a lower level which you will actually on Carnivore which is which is uh very interesting uh it when you guys watch this and so I told him I was like yeah I'm one of those guys who drinks like a gown or two a day and he's like oh my god oh Jesus from a deuterium point of view he was saying that if you want you wouldn't want to do more than two liters but I don't know but either way and no matter how you look at it I think eight ounces is too low but I would just I would just go with your your thirst and uh and just and just follow your thirst and um and if you're thirsty just drink water I don't think there's any any problem with that I definitely feel better when I when I do that especially when I'm when I'm working out the the night sweats I don't think is I don't think it's caused by drinking you know the water anyway um it could be from coming off a Gabapentin but it's not something I've heard of before um but who knows and just see how you go you know if you're if you're feeling fine otherwise I wouldn't worry too much about it it could just be that you're maybe just getting a little overheated and that's it um okay there's a follow-up to this also I just dropped my meds for insomnia and have uh trouble sleeping fair enough I'm continuing to take the prescribed melatonin to help what are your thoughts on melatonin uh do I need to stop that as well no I don't think so you know melatonin especially because we live in just this light flooded environment our melatonin levels aren't what they're supposed to be if you can get yourself back into that where you don't have these lights on you don't have all this stuff I mean like we I even when I go would go camping now you know you get away from the light pollution light light goes down even if you have a fire or something like that you just naturally just go to sleep and you sort of sleep with the dark and the light sleeping uh you know uh light patterns and it's like it's just your body you just feel so much better we don't live in that environment anymore we have a bunch of light pollution one thing with melatonin is it doesn't work if the lights are on you know it's it you still need Darkness so you know you take the melatonin an hour before you want to be asleep and you turn the lights off and you get off your phone you get off your computer you don't watch TV you maybe you'll listen to a book on tape quietly sort of in a low light room room or read a book with low light and you know and don't um uh you know have any sort of screens and as little light as possible going on and this this will help you you know get to sleep and it will help your body sort of reset that you know taking melatonin in these circumstances I don't think is is a big deal and can help reset your body clock as well uh when you're when you're trying to get get to sleep and it also has been shown to help sort of you know kick because your body's hormonal cycle your circadia Rhythm like it has these certain points and checkpoints that you have to have these little signals to like activate um the progression at certain times melatonin is one of those things you need to kick off your melatonin at a certain point get through a certain threshold and that triggers growth hormone uh while you're sleeping and and uh and and starts this circadian rhythm going from that standpoint so it's actually been shown to improve uh growth hormone production as well which can help in other ways too so I don't I don't really have a problem with melatonin if you're but you need to take it in the right way and you need to sort of do things around sleep the right way anyway and if you're taking melatonin and you're waking up groggy in the morning then you probably need to lower your dose so just a couple things um Rob siewis says that we over drink and urine should not be pale yeah I mean it's uh many people say that and you know like Gabor and some of the other deuterium guys I think that uh you know you should drink as little water as possible I sort of look as the enemy yeah because all the deuterium in it or unless you're drinking deuterium depleted water uh which is harder to come by and and more obviously more expensive than than normal water because it's a process that's going through it it's not just filling up a tap and um uh as as far as and um as a professor of um Pediatric or Pediatrics in the medical school UCLA Medical School who was like a student of um gabor's a Laszlo borosh who's uh they're both from Hungary and um he he's also you know in in the deuterium space and um and apparently he just drinks one cup of coffee a day with deuterium depleted water I guess and um and uh and did a lecture called you're you're drinking away your health or something like that of people that drink too much water but I don't know I feel better when I do that um and you know when you're when your urine is clear it means that you have it you have an abundance of water so could you drink less yeah potentially um because your body is saying okay we don't we don't need all of this so it's going out but it's also it's not it's also sort of resting your kidneys as well because you're not your kidneys aren't having to concentrate things as much to conserve your water because that we don't need all this so we'll just let it flow out and we don't need to work as hard and that that sort of a thing too but you know animals in the wild they you know that's their urine is is much more concentrated uh because you know they're not drinking all that much water so you can you can make arguments either way and from a deuterium standpoint they say you know you know drinking you know less is more on that one I'm just still going to feel I'm still going to drink the amount of water that feels good to me though and uh and go from there and from Maria what is the best test to detect an egg tolerance if so is it possible to overcome this yeah best test is is just um you know you you any anytime you're you're testing for a food sensitivity just stop eating it for a month or at least two weeks but a month is better and then you reintroduce it and you just reintroduce it on its own you don't have a whole bunch of other things you don't have eggs with a whole bunch of other crabs you don't know what's doing what so stop eating eggs for a month and then have the egg again if you if it causes reaction then you have to ask yourself is it the egg or is it egg yolk or is it the egg white and so you can sort of repeat that process and see how you go or you can just sort of you know head that off and um you know try some egg yolks after a month no problem try the white again you have a problem well now you know your answer so that that's what I would do is just uh take it off for a month try it on its own see how you go uh from Eli how to best do carnivore without a gallbladder how to intro introduce and increase the amount of fat without having right upper quadrant pain added in some MCT oil a couple days ago and since last evening have a lot of pain oh I'm sorry wondering how long it will last um and any other ideas I'm getting some OCT Buscopan to help with the spasms good idea um so if you don't have a gallbladder you really shouldn't be getting you know gallstone pain like you would when you're eating fat the reason you get pain when you have uh gallstones and a gallbladder is because your gallbladder squeezing out the squeezing out the the bile and then some of the stones are going with it and they're getting you know either temporarily or permanently stuck in uh in in some of those pipes and openings and and that can be a problem if that gets permanently stuck it can cause infection cause backup cause jaundice and you might need surgery um but if you don't have a gallbladder you shouldn't really have anywhere for stones to form unless you've formed a pseudo- gallbladder and some unlucky howl formed stones in that pseudo gallbladder which is theoretically possible you know for the same reasons that getting that in the gallbladder is is possible which is issue you concentrate up bile and and you get Stones because that's what happens when you when you concentrate a solution things can precipitate and form crystals um I would you know if you if you are getting right upper quadrant pain after you've had your gallbladder out um and and only when you're eating eating uh you know fat I would see about you know talking to your doctor about getting like an ultrasound see what the hell's going on there because you that it's very unlikely that it's to do with with more Stones if you don't have a gallbladder and and that's what causes that pain after you eat uh fat is a stone getting stuck and that hurts when things get blocked up and your body it hurts you know when you have your your bladder is blocked and it's filling up with urine it hurts same thing with an impacted bowel like it hurts you're having that backup pressure uh is really painful so I would check that out it could just be could just be on you know something else unrelated um and you know so if you're having MCT oil a couple days ago and since last evening having a lot of pain probably not related to the MCT oil because that's it that's you know that that's too distant you know like if if you're talking about gallbladder stones let's say you have your gallbladder let's say you have Stones you eat the fat right then right then the thing gets stuck right then you have the pain it's not like a delayed fashion a few days later so that sounds like that's unrelated so there might be something else going on and but it's in in the same area So that obviously you're going to be worrying uh for for gallstones before but um you know so you might want to just just have a chat with your doctor and see what else is going on you you could you know if he's worried or you know she's worried or whoever's worried uh you could you could get and there is sort of a suspicious timing for that when you're eating fat getting this pain uh an ultrasound of that area might be worthwhile to see what the hell is going on and if there's nothing there you don't have a pseudo gallbladder and there's no Stones there then you can safely say that's unrelated um it's probably unrelated though the best way to do carnivore for someone without a gallbladder is uh it depends if they have a pseudo gallbladder or they don't generally you know your body's just going to be making your liver is going to be making bile and it's going to be just dripping out at a steady rate um because it's not going to have anywhere to store up like a gallbladder or a pseudo gallbladder and because of that that's what died or or allows your body to absorb fat so you're going to have to sort of eat smaller meals of fat throughout the day because if you eat a huge bolus of fat um it's just going to go through you pretty quickly and and you're not going to absorb much of that at all so you need to if you're having that and you eat a big meal of fat and you have like you know diarrhea afterwards then your body's not absorbing a lot of that fat and so you need to break up your fatty meals throughout the day some people can actually do you know one meal a day big fatty meal uh on Carnivore once a day without a gallbladder those people almost certainly would have formed a pseudo gallbladder so it just depends on where you you fall in with that um let's see and from Ian I was looking for guidance on gaining weight on Carnivore um I am quite active five foot nine 150 pounds and struggled to put on weight properly and healthfully my whole life I already eat uh usually about two pounds of beef probably a minimum of 12 ounces of raw milk okay um six to eight raw egg yolks and some raw cheese each day I don't know if I could bump this up to four pounds of ground beef a day economically or realistically or am I just my optimal weight and just accept it potentially um the thing is though is that your your your body's going to grow with stimulus right if you're not stimulating your body to grow why would it grow right so you need to be lifting weights you know if you want to put on muscle you've got to stimulate your body to put on muscle so you know you need to you need to work out you need to do uh you know get into a fitness program and do like resistance training if you want to put on if you want to put on muscle the best thing to do is anaerobic activity and um that will stimulate muscle growth much more than aerobic activity certainly and that will also stimulate you to eat more so you have to have both so you have to you have to do the work and you have to you know uh give your body enough resources to to grow in response to that raw milk is great um in comparison to normal milk but I think it's problematic because it does have enough lactose it's gonna it's gonna kick you into an aberrant metabolic State and you're more likely to basically put you into a fat storing State instead of a fat utilizing State and I don't think that that's necessarily what you're going to want to do um so I don't know maybe maybe you could try just just you know uh working out more and then just like maybe just giving the raw milk a skip meal some raw cheese with the meat fine not a big deal um but I would I would be cautious with the raw milk especially every day because you know like we said before you know if you mess up it takes 24 hours for your insulin to come down that same is true for the lactose in milk and this is why a lot of people use fermented dairy products because they they want to get they don't want to deal with that lactose and so you can be changing your metabolic State there as well and um and that can be a bit more difficult to put on healthy weight as well so that's if if it's for me doing it that's what I would do I would I would you know stop taking the raw milk for now and I would start working out and lifting weights and and that and and I have videos talking about working out but the main thing is you have to work out too fatigue you know you have to push yourself until your body can't go anymore and then you have to keep going you know like if you're doing someone spotting you or something like that you keep going until you you are you cannot go anymore and then you have them help you do a couple more reps you know that's how you get results that's how you get um you know you know gains and all that sort of stuff so it's there's a big difference between the people who sort of stop when things are really difficult and the people who push past what they could normally do with a spotter it makes it's only a couple reps different it makes all the difference in an actual uh uh performance and and results like I've worked out with with guys who just who sort of do a similar amount of reps than me but I always go to failure and I've always had way better results than that and it's you know it's just it's just not even a comparison I'm not doing all that much more I'm just I'm just maxing it out or they are not and it's just that is that going to complete muscle fatigue that's what really stimulates your muscles to grow and so if you want to put on bulk you've got to be doing you've got to put in the work and you got to know how to you have to put in the work properly so I have I have videos uh working out with the X3 bar and other things and I talk about that I always talk about going to failure going to muscle fatigue and so that's what I would do I'd stop the raw milk I start lifting weights as much as you can make sure you're getting you know enough fat like if you're doing ground beef I would try to get a fattier ground beef you know I go to the Butcher and try to get like 60 40 ground beef or even 50 50 ground beef that's going to give you that 70 30 fat to protein by calorie ratio that seems to be about where most people are at and need to be and then you just need to eat enough so work out really hard eat enough to where your body's full and your body doesn't want anymore and that will that will give your body what it needs to grow and I'll just cut out the raw milk and see how you go and then work out properly um oh yeah I just answered at least oh oh sorry Eli is that um well hopefully hopefully you made it but watch the first half again yeah okay yeah be able to watch that um Olivia's uh when you mentioned the X3 Advantage uh it creates constant tension is it possible to recreate this in normal ways yeah it's a lot of things is time under tension so you're just you're just constantly going now if you're on free weights you're sort of always under tension as well because you're holding this thing up so it doesn't you know Crush you right um and um with the bands you can actually cheat a bit and rest because you want you want like if you're doing a chest press you're coming out here if you lock out then you know you're not hold using your muscle to hold it out there right because it's locked out and uh and your in your joints are sort of holding that together it takes a lot less effort and and then if you come back here you can let it sort of rest there and you can take tension off the Bands so you don't want to do that you want to come out here not to full lockout but just before so your muscles have to hold it together and you come back here and when you feel the tension sort of almost coming off that you you hold it there and you don't go back any further and you're going out and then you're constantly keeping that under tension and you'll just wear yourself out faster now you can do it the other way and you can lock out and then and then come back and get a bit of a rest all that's doing is that it's just going to take longer until you get to failure and so it's just it's just going to prolong the pain and so you know in your if it's if it's hurting you and you're going oh I really want to rest it's in your best interest to not rest because you're not done until you've maxed yourself out and so you if you're keeping the tension on you actually max out faster and so you're getting to that state quicker and so it's actually in your best interest to to not take a risk and not do that um you can definitely do that with weights I've been doing that my whole life um I've only recently started using bands and um the but the the point is is that you want to go whatever you're doing you want to go to the point you really can't anymore so with it with the bands you're going out all the way in the back and out and back and back and then all of a sudden you can't and you're just sort of going half little reps and little quarter reps and then little you're only sort of jiggling it you can't move it anymore and you say okay I'm done um same sort of thing is going to be true with free weights if you're you know doing a press or doing whatever you just keep going until you're not really able to go any further and and then you sort of you get stuck and you're trying to fight it and you're trying to fight it you're trying to fight it some people just go oh yeah I'm done and they'll let their spotter take it or something like that or they'll kind of go like oh yeah that's pretty good and they'll put up on the rack so you just you keep going keep going until you're stuck and then you fight it so like I often I'm working out I don't have a spotter and so I know sort of how it feels when I get to like that like or sort of like e come on out and just barely get it up and think like do I have one more in the tank or am I gonna or am I not gonna be able to make it someone I'll just go screw it I'm just gonna do it and I just go for one more rep and I go stuck and I have to just run but I'm like I don't have a spotter you know if I don't want to make a scene and dump these weights and just make a big clattering noise and and then have everyone look at me and see who's the idiot who did that you know I've got to get this thing I've got to get this stupid thing up and so I'm just just finding this financing and so I'm like stuck like completely stuck and then I'm just fighting funny and just slowly moving and slowly moving it up I've rarely gotten stuck where I've had to you know drop the weights or something like that rarely um but doing that you know that gets everything out of your system and you're and you're and now you're it takes even longer to get that up and you're under tension the whole time so that's how you get to to real failure it's harder for some things you know with squats you have to be able to time that because you fail on squats and you're gonna you're you're you know you're sitting down and so if you don't have a spot so just be careful with that foreign [Music] okay uh from Linda what do you think of fat fasting eating and drinking only fat for 24 to 72 hours for weight loss any negative effects I've never looked into that I don't I've never really seen a reason to look into that uh I think you just eat meat I I don't think you need to have these complex um you know algorithms and equations you know and if you do this for 72 hours and you do this in this way and this percentage and that for all that sort of stuff that's gonna I mean maybe maybe you can sort of screw with things in a certain way I don't think it's going to necessarily be healthy and healthful it's um it's you just your body wants meat and that and that's it and if you just give your body what it wants and what it needs it's going to work itself out and so you know you will lose weight you will lose fat you will get healthier period now if you've been unwell for a long time and you've been eating the wrong thing for a long time and you're eating poison you've been poisoned you know there is such thing as damage done and you're going to have some problems to contend with but most of this stuff is going to improve dramatically and you just want to to go back to eating a physiological physiologically appropriate diet in a physiologically appropriate way so you just you eat fatty meat when you're hungry you drink water to thirst when available and you just you just let let your body take care of the rest you know you when you start screwing with your biochemistry you will generally lose because it's very complex I mean you've got you know tens of millions of interactions chemical interactions every millisecond in your body you know and I mean and I mean that in each cell all right and you've got you know trillions of cells okay so the amount of complexity that's going on here is is just insane so to think that we're going to Tinker with that it's it's you know it's a bit unrealistic you know so I would just I would just keep it simple just eat fatty meat when you're hungry eat until you're full eat until meat stops tasting good and drink water to thirst probably not around meal time because you'll fill up your water your your stomach with water you might not eat as much as you would normally want to and you'll also you know dilute your your uh you know digestive enzymes and things like that and um so but yeah but that's it just just keep it simple you know like the old saying just keep the symbol stupid I just cool down just do it as as natural and physiologically as you can and I think you'll you'll find that that just works better for for pretty much everyone um do you think that you need us to supplement vitamin D when you can't get it from the Sun in the winter potentially most people are okay though you know when you're on a carnivore diet because because that uh certain fats have more than others but fat in general has vitamin D butter has vitamin D um you know I don't know how many people have access to seal but uh you know the the Inuit they don't you know they never get enough sun to get vitamin D and they have uh no problems with vitamin D because the fact that they like you know the the seals and the and the polar bear and the whales and whatever other marine animals that they're eating or fish have a ton of vitamin D in it and so you know they don't they don't need any of that um my vitamin D when just being you know going to work before light the sun came out and coming back after the sun went down my vitamin D was in the normal ranges as we would consider that um with with just a you know normal lab lab results and nearly perfect in the optimal range that we would actually look at in functional medicine and say this is this is the range that we see in 25 year olds who don't have anything wrong with them who are healthy you know as opposed to the first 2 000 people that came into the lab that year and that's your reference range which is how Labs get their reference ranges which is why there are different reference ranges in every area because it's just an average of the community it's not actually it's not actually showing you a range of Optimal Health and in fact some of these things things are well outside the range of Optimal Health like like B12 B12 reference ranges are way too low and that's because most people's B12 is way too low and so like here in Australia and even in the US the range is you know uh dips down into a level that if you're actually that low and you're in the in the so-called normal range you'll get demyelination and nerve damage so how the hell are we calling that a normal range because doctors who don't know that look at that or you look at that and just go like oh I'm in the normal range so that's normal no it's not no these are these are these reference ranges are for just the average in the community most people are sick now you know something like there was like a study so that was like like only like seven percent of people in America are metabolically healthy that's nuts and so these are the these are the reference ranges that you're using is very sick people that aren't metabolically healthy so oh okay okay my my Bloods are in that reference range like what do you do like everyone is sick everyone is unwell so um but most of the time you don't need to um but you can check you just check and so if you're getting a lot of butter and you're getting a lot of fat especially you know depending on what what kind of fat you're getting um You probably don't need to but you're gonna you can always check and you can and you can try to go to like someone who who knows a bit about functional medicine um and uh and see those ranges I might I might see about posting something in the patreon group about sort of the reference ranges that that we use uh in in functional medicine practice to sort of think about and these will be these will be in an Australian um uh Australian units so just just be mindful of that I might I'll see about putting something together and I might post something up there and then you guys can sort of take a look at that and sort of get an idea this is not a substitute for going to your doctor this is not a substitute for you know getting this these things interpreted in context with with your with your provider it's just reference rate it's a reference so just just so you guys know that don't use it to like diagnose anything or um or stop or start any sort of medications or treatments or anything like that without without direction from a doctor just be just be mindful of that is Australian the same as UK I think it is for most things but not everything like um you know I I know that uh B12 you guys do differently um B12 ranges um I think we were talking before there's like the UK it's like over 150 is High um here it's the the reference range is 169 to um 650 something like that and um and Below 400 you're getting demyelination and nerve damage so that's clearly going to be on a different scale but yeah so I think it's going to be same for some and different for others in the UK and Australia um from Rebecca my child has Down syndrome and eats mostly meat eggs and sausage very good he has low thyroid which he takes a supplement for uh which is typical and um the only thing is he has to have peas and oranges every single day could this derail him is that is that a a preference thing he has to have those or um they just really likes them and they want he wants to have those or is that uh is someone saying that he needs that is someone who's like a doctor saying that he needs that I guess that's the question it sounds like it's more of a preference thing um look you know oranges probably I mean it's not as bad as candy bars and and soda certainly it's going to have much less fructose and carbs but it's still going to have some the fiber in that context is going to delay some of the absorption of the fructose and you're not going to get as much so okay so it may not be causing all that much problems peas are gross I don't know why you would eat those anyway but um same with the fiber there but it can also sort of delay absorption of everything else look it's not the worst thing in the world if you really really loves them you know you can't get him to stop you know just do what you can do I think it would definitely be best if he didn't have those and you know especially things with with carbohydrates you know it's just going to screw with your insulin and things like that um but you know Down syndrome is it's going to be the same as any other person you know he's still he's still a carnivore you know that's just the kind of animals we are and and he has a a specific condition but that doesn't change him from being a carnivore and that doesn't change uh you know his sensitivities to you know plant toxins and um and and and carbohydrates so it could derail him and I think it's far better than basically anyone else on Earth is doing but to be optimal and optimize him yeah I would I would I would try to get him off the the peas and the oranges if you can and if you're able to uh and just see how he does does with that you know it may it may be that it doesn't make as big of a difference and you know maybe an orange every now and then isn't isn't that big of a deal which it probably isn't but um you know a little can turn into a lot especially with things that are addictive like fructose so I just just be mindful of that but um I would uh yeah I just see how you go and but I mean he's obviously doing you know much better than just everyone else um sausages sausages can have different things in them so just obviously checking ingredients make sure it doesn't have a bunch of starch and carbs and fillers and sugar added in them um and then what do you think of chocolate fed beef never never heard of that um but you know a cow is not meant to eat chocolate so I'm even meant to eat grains and so when it when it's eating something that it doesn't eat normally um it's not going to have the requisite defenses to um you know to get rid of you know a bunch of toxins and things like that and poisons as well and so it's not going to be as healthy um chocolate is this is a sugary chocolate or just it's just bitter horrible chocolate I don't know um I I don't know I I would be skeptical it's probably not that much different but because that's not their natural food either it's not going to be it's it's not going to be as as uh nutritious and it can have some some stuff in there that it's not able to break down either but um you know it's like you know grain-fed beef is it you know it is definitely different from grass-fed beef but it's still better than any alternative but um I don't know chocolate fit beef just sounds sounds weird um um let's see so you're saying from Jason part one um I have mostly moved away from plastic uh oh yeah that's right so I mostly move away from plastic do you buy uh water from local water spot now how bad is plastic and what are the benefits of clean water over City Town water well answer the second part first um it really depends a lot of people are actually saying that like brackish water you know like from you get from like a creek and things like that this is going to have minerals and electrolytes and things like that that are actually good and um you have to weigh that against you know how how badly you want to not get Giardia um so uh you know City Town water they're gonna have a bunch of crap in it they have a bunch of uh chlorine things added to it potentially um uh you know fluoride and things like that I'm not an expert on fluoride but you know you you do sort of get suspicious on these things when um you know it's not even the right you know when you're talking about like oh this is good for your teeth or whatever um is it really because the fluoride ion that they generally put in water isn't actually the right kind to actually affect your teeth so what the hell is that about um so I don't know but you know there's a bunch of chemicals and crap in there so City water is not not the best but it depends on the city it depends on the town because a lot of there are some places that it's just like it's just mountain spring water basically and that's just going through everyone doesn't necessarily get treated maybe it has a bit of chlorine put into it which you can you know certain filters will get that out but those filters will also get out all the minerals and everything else in there as well um and um you know so you know having that sort of brackish bar is a local sort of stream or whatever without any of those chemicals in it you know potentially better but you're going to contend with microbes that are in there which sometimes which is actually something that we've evolved to do so you know it's not actually necessarily a bad thing but be mindful you could potentially get exposed to something plastic is bad it's super bad um and uh is that how they make chocolate milk like chocolate cows yeah I think so I think that's probably it chocolate milk comes from chocolate cows and um so plastic in in uh is is you know it's not it's not something that we've ever sort of come across in nature so our bodies are like what the hell is this it has like weird different chemical effects in our body you know there's the different sorts of things that um was it like pcbas or something like that whatever the hell the acronym is I'm just not um not sure what it is you know offhand but um they have been shown it caused quite a lot of problems and and hormonal disruption and actually uh screw with your your hormone so if men are drinking you know using this or like cooking with you know plastic that has this stuff in it it can um it can actually reduce your sperm count okay so that's not good that's obviously doing something in your body screwing with your hormones and then screwing with your biochemistry in a certain way that's not beneficial and in women it can screw their hormones as well but it actually stays in their system longer well it stays in all of our systems but it for women it's more important because you can stay in your system for a while and they can actually affect uh your fetus if you if you get pregnant and it's been shown to cause problems in the Next Generation to like change the distance between like you know the penis and the anus and this has different sorts of markers and effects of fertility and health uh apparently um I forget the lady's name but she's uh there's a there's the lady who studied this in depth and um and and and penis size so you actually like so women who are having like plastic cooking with plastic or plastic water bottles things like that especially heat treated you know obviously every 10 degrees Celsius you increase reaction uh it doubles the reaction rate right so that goes for the chemical reaction of eluding those chemicals from the water bottle into your water that heats up that's doubling doubling doubling doubling depending on how you go so if you're cooking with it you put some food in a plastic dish or a tupperware dish and you microwave that you know that's that's sucking a lot of this this chemical crap into your into your food and that's the problem she should never ever cook or put hot liquids in in like plastic or Tupperware or anything like that even if it says it's safe and uh because it's not safe compared to what like what what what's the what's the marker of Health that they're using to say this is safe you know um it's not going to be the same as I would use um and so so that's the thing and so they found that I'm sure this was done in Pratt models or whatever but they actually did this with people as well and measured and measured um the all this stuff and they found that this these sort of plastics that got in um in when women were were pregnant or or soon to be pregnant it uh it you know sort of had different hormonal effects on on the kids and one of those down one of those effect Downstream effects was to make penis size smaller in in men and so you know I don't know why you would just sabotage your child like that but um uh but that they can do that here's the crazy thing it lasted two generations so that's more than just uh you know you've had an exposure to you know a hormone and then there's something else going on so there's having some sort of you know really sort of meta effect you know that's that's that's lasting two generations so so you cook with plastics and things like that you get this Plastics in your body your your son has a smaller penis size his sons will have smaller penis sizes as well so it lasts two generations just because you know you didn't want to use like a plate to microwave something you know and you want to use Tupperware instead um so I would definitely stay the hell away from those things and um and again like even even as an adult it will it will reduce your sperm count so this is doing stuff to you here's here's the trickier part because people know this they know that these these certain Plastics are bad so they'll say this is non-pcv or whatever I did I really hope it is pcpa but I don't I don't necessarily think it is but anyway whatever it is you know saying this is this is not that oh great this must be safe then no because they just changed the chemical slightly so now it's technically something else it actually acts the same way and so the same lady showed that those other chemical those other Plastics actually work in the same same way in the same manner and do have the same results but they're just called something different so they say oh yeah no this is safe this is different this is this isn't that kind of plastic this is pcba free okay right well this is pcba1 and now it's the same exact thing so I wouldn't use any plastic any Tupperware certainly not to cook with you know if you have things cold and you bring something to work fine class is better metal is better and um you know so just avoiding all that I think is well worth it and drinking with class classes instead of plastic classes and certainly with any hot liquid you know styrofoam things like that that just you know you warm water and styrofoam that just leeches that stuff out um you know having coffee and a styrofoam cup at work or something like that bad idea so um I would definitely get rid of that stuff um Okay so I think we got through I think that's exactly on the hour um bpas that's it thank you very much for that yeah I knew it wasn't bcba I was like I couldn't think what the hell it was but bpas yeah so bpas and then I'll say you know BPA free I was like great well they're using things that are just slightly different from bpas and um and but they still have the same effect so it's the same thing and so it's just marketing you know it's just like it's just like you know you know saying sugar-free candy and it's like okay that must mean it's good for or sorry sorry fat free candies on fat free candy it's like it's candy you know like it's not let's not kid ourselves like whether whether or not Fat's good or bad for you fat free or fat full candy still candy and still not good for you um and so that that sort of thing it's just a marketing thing so they say BPA free and you go oh that's great I heard bpas are bad this doesn't have it this is safe plastic no there's no such thing as safe plastic so just stay away from it in general so okay all right everyone well I think that's um uh you know sort of if for the questions on the emails so if people have other questions you can you can type them in I'm happy to stay a bit longer um or um or we can wrap up if someone has anything else Olivia's saying that we have 16 people signed up for the October book club uh which is great uh that's that's really cool so you know if people want to do that the the book is Guns Germs and Steel and um and we're just trying to do like a different carnivore-esque book a month um I don't know if we necessarily need to add in Thomas solo books everyone knows I love Thomas Soul if you wanted Thomas Soul reading list you can always ask me um but he's just just read anything the guy writes basically he's awesome and um so this will stick to sort of try to keep it more geared towards um you know this sort of stuff and um and uh yeah so 16 people signed up for that which is great anyone you know can can read along or if you join the Discord Group which is which is great I you know I think it's very positive sort of things happening there and people are enjoying that which is really good um you can join that Discord group and and join the book club through the Discord group and and just just read along and uh and and come along with for the discussions about the book as well and then uh we'll go from there so um all right anybody any last burning questions that people have uh before we go situation Mike has a comment here about the estrogenation estrogeneration how estrogenics are making you fat sick and infertile book by Anthony J um Anthony g j um that's weird having a last name that is the same as a letter and having a letter as your middle name and just doing that I just dropped the G um what is the meaning of life procreation that's what it is that is the biological meaning of life is to have kids and have more have babies and and that's also a pretty good answer for uh fulfillment in life as well and you talk to people who have um you know sort of close to the uh you know close to to death and ever like every one of them says I wish I spent more time with my family or I wish I had a family it's very very rare that people said you know I wish I worked more I wish I you know went to Belize or something like that they all say I wish I spent more time with my family I wish I you know spent more time with my kids and things like that and so that I think is is very uh well certainly the biological meaning of life that is life of the point the purpose of life is to create more life and make more copies of you and pass your genes down that is the meaning of life from a strict biological sense and I think from a meaning sense as well in a spiritual sense it also comes down uh to to having kids having family and just having a fulfilling meaningful life whatever that means to you it doesn't have to be with kids but a lot of times um you know I'm having people you surround yourself with people that are important to you makes your life more more full so okay great well thank you everyone um I hope you guys enjoyed that I definitely did it was a bunch of interesting questions today and uh hopefully uh you guys like that so uh take care everyone enjoy the rest of your week and I will be back to my normal hellscape of a schedule next week and actually this weekend because um a colleague just had a baby which was awesome and then so I'll be covering him on his weekend shift so um I'm going back to work a bit early which should be okay my knees feeling all right as long as I don't do too much walking and uh great so we'll have to sort of schedule these for the zoom meeting on Sunday might have to do that a bit earlier because I will be working I don't want to do that just a bit earlier in the day um and so we'll try to try to schedule that uh probably for six a.m this coming Sunday and then we'll just just uh play it by ear after that okay all right thanks guys enjoy the rest of your day"
