    "transcript": "[Music] Dr chaffy thanks for the presentation any issues with carnivore for patients with renal failure no actually I see patients with uh you know CKD 4 and five improve significantly and even get back to normal re renal function the the literature that I've found in speaking to nephrologists on the subject they they see that they say that the it's actually the opposite of what we sort of grown up thinking which is um uh we've been told that by some people some people still practice this that that higher protein diets are actually harmful to the kidneys in fact that's not what the literature shows the literature shows the opposite it shows that that higher protein diets actually improve kidney function and that's certainly what I've seen I've seen very well it's a high fat diet really because you proportion of calories and grams typically higher of fat than protein but it is typically higher much higher protein diet than you would get on a standard diet any other sort of diet so it is a higher protein diet and I do see people doing much better on it and you're also going to improve kidney function because you're removing out different nephrotoxic elements such from Plants such as oxalates which can be D directly damaging to the kidneys as well so you're removing out a lot of things that can cause harm you're and you're improving the nutrition and increasing protein and increasing uh different available nutrients that are going to benefit the kidney I have seen a number of people uh narrowly avoid uh dialysis by by going on a carnivore diet and um uh either patients friends or just and countless people on the internet um a great place to to look is are those older Facebook groups that deal with with carnivore diet it's specifically called zero car there that's what carnivore was called before it was called carnivore it was zero carb so zeroing in on health and zero carb Health uh they do great and they do they they've been around for a very long time they're very strict and so they get much better results and so they uh they have a lot in their in their um history so you can go into the search function and you look up you know kidney disease kidney failure um dialysis I've seen three people now and I haven't been as active on the Facebook groups I've seen three people in those groups uh discussing about how they they come off dialysis that was the first time I saw that was probably six years ago was in one of those zero carb health or zeroing in on health and and this lady had been on Carnivore you know just red meat and water for nine months and her doctor was telling you you're going to kill yourself and she's like I'm already on dialysis I already have zero kidney function you know I'm already on the transplant list what more do you want from me you know this is not this is not going to make my kidneys worse anyway and after nine months she actually came off dialysis which is shocking it's normally that's a one-way street it's just like you once you once you make that decision you go on dysis you're never coming back well for her at least she she was able to come off and and I've seen two other people that's not that many people so presumably most people that are on dialysis probably permanent damage that's not going to recover but a couple people may be in that boat maybe just right on that bubble there's another gentleman I'm I'm in contact with now who who is on dialysis but he still makes urine and by since going cornival he has been making more and more urine so he's giving it a year and and if he's able to come off dialysis in a year then you know then that's great and if not then you know he'll go down the transplant route but um it's very promising and and I have absolutely seen people in the pre-dialysis stage improved dramatically uh so yes it's it's um it's very safe and in fact it it generally shows significant Improvement so hopefully uh you see that as well in your practice which I would expect that you would because that's that's what happens Crazy K thank you for the Super Chat hey doctor uh does ground beef have a lot of vitamin B12 in it uh it's all I usually eat yeah it's got a ton usually enough if you have an absorption issue or you have MTH hfrg mutation you may need a little more in your diet and uh and liver is a great option for that uh liver Nature's multivitamin so I don't think you need too much most people don't need any at all um they'll get you know Ample Ample nutrients from from their diet but it will bring you over the line if If you're sort of on the lower end of optimal and then some people that have um nutritional malabsorption issues that is very important to make sure that you're having things that are more nutrient dense such as such as liver and organs and uh just check you know so you know you've been eating you've been eating ground beef for however long check your B12 it's um the reference ranges are completely wrong because they're just the average for the community Community is sick and malnourished so that's not really good good level to check at but people have done studies looking at 25y olds in good health no issues um you know not overweight all these sorts of things very different reference ranges very very different reference ranges and and then other sorts of researchers have looked at things and say hey this is this is really where we're optimal and so you know if you look at those sorts of things the you know the 25 year olds that are healthy and um and studies that have looked at you know what's a more optimal range for things very different from the reference ranges so in Australia and most of the rest of the world besides America we want to be between 800 and 12200 that's what we go for at my clinic anyway and in America the in those units so translate to 1100 to 1600 so typically you want to be on the higher end of the of the scale for them if not above um and above below 400 in Australian and elsewhere and Below 540 in America that's actually a critical deficiency you can actually uh get demyelination of your axons and you your brain will shrink and your spinal cord can thin out as well and an Oxford studied that in 2008 they showed that um that people under that certain threshold um and it was you know basically under 400 um that they their brain shrank by 5% after five years right so that's not good and yet the reference range goes down like 130 in England up to 540 in England and so that that's clearly not what you look at doctors look at these reference ranges as if they were um as if they were the optimal range well that's optimal that's where you want to be you want to be in you want that number to be black you don't want it to be red or in bold so if it's too high oh that's too high o no too low oh okay now we got got to do something about it um but if it's that oh that's normal everything's fine so we're treating those reference ranges as if they were optimal reference ranges as if someone else set out and said this is where you want to be but that's not what they are and that's not what they're purported to be they are averages they're just averages for the community and that's all they are and we need to treat them as averages and then say okay well that's the average that's what everyone else is doing but everyone else is fat and sick so maybe don't want to be average okay what's optimal then oh that's very different okay so that's uh that's that's something that you need to know about uh but yeah you typically get all the B12 you need just from from ground beef ground beef is the same as any other part of the cow as far as the muscle Meats concerned you'll get the same amount of B12 from a from a fancy steak as you will from uh Crown beef um you'll get a lot more in liver and so if you check and your B12 is not optimal add in a bit of liver doesn't to be much but uh but it will it'll be good hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products there will be be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys da Donata if I'm 17 if you're 17 so are you 17 and I get a reasonably full fully Carnivor diet can I grow from 5' 10 to 6 foot if anyone in the chat can answer that'd be great as well uh well you may you may not but your growth plates should still be open at 17 and if you go on a carnivore diet you will you will have a better chance of doing it than you would if you don't I typically see people in that age range as teenagers or younger Sprout up when they go on a cornivore diet and absolutely remarkable uh growth H and so uh yeah absolutely you you very well could do that you could very will grow taller than 6 feet um you know 's uh son is 14 and he he went carnivore like eight months ago and he's shot up I mean he's grown like six seven inches you know he's he's like looking looking me in the eye now he's not as tall as me but he's getting there and um and he was you know overweight and he had you know some carrying extra fat and um was shorter and and they just just sprouted up and it was it was actually pretty pretty dramatic how quickly he grew and how much he grew and he's still growing you know so uh yeah it can make make a big difference and your growth plate should still be open to 17 some people do close prematurely but you know as long as you're not your growth plates aren't closed you can absolutely Still Still grow so yeah and so if you are still growing I would probably expect you to grow more than six feet um but uh you got to be strict you got to do it right and you'll get the best results and your testosterone levels will go up your growth hormone levels will go up which also make you grow and and will make you much healthier in general and a much better athlete as well so good luck with that so there's a comment from uh bm7 tri8 I've learned so much in the past couple days thank you so much Dr chaffy your older videos are packed with great information well thank you very much I appreciate that yeah I almost didn't continue on making videos um because I just I just I I said some of things that that I wanted to say and I got things out there that I thought were important and I didn't want to sort of you know drown out the message and just sort of water everything down by just sort of putting too much out there um you know so I'm glad that people are finding the back catalog but they go into the uh you know playlist it's just the podcast playlist you know the plan 3md podcast playlist on YouTube and then just the podcast you know that has sort of the more more important ones the interviews and especially like in the early earlier ones those the ones I sort of okay what about cholesterol and what about this and what about that and just sort of specific topics we're talking about and and then I also have a playlist called um getting started on a carnivore diet something like that and that I sort of have a curated list of of the videos I think are probably the most important ones to know about or or at least you should you know the at least very important ones anyway so yeah so I'm glad you found the the back catalog and I'm glad you like them uh there was someone else here that actually found that they didn't need their glasses either so fine dendu says that I no longer need glasses I notied and I sit on a screen 10 hours a day that's that's fantastic uh so that's really really cool that um that you found that as well there does seem to be something there and it's uh I don't know what it is yet I bounced it off Dr Weedman and you know she she wasn't quite sure exactly uh what was going on well she had done a lot of other videos on on these sorts of things that can improve um but as far as you know people fixing stigmatism and and things like that you know like some people are going to improve and some people aren't and so we don't really know exactly you know who the patient population is is going to be that that is going to improve on this but you you just try and find out you know that that works that's that's worked for quite a long time so keep going with it um Frank calaby had a question here um said hi doc blood show high Crea level doctor says stop carnivore says that I'm CKD stage three B blood seven months ago all good and I'm confused drink more water you're dehydrated it's not the carnival diet um if your creatinine is going up it's because you're not drinking enough water um your creatinine is not going to go up on a cornivore diet because of a carnivore diet it'll go up because of other things um so you drink more water there can be other things going on too there could be some other process happening it's not from meat though uh meat May raise your Ura because you're metabolizing the that nitrogen group and then that turns into pneumonia and that gets turned into Ura and that gets passed out through your kidneys oh your Ria goes up oh that's bad but your cranon is staying the same and your Ria goes going up independently that's that's uh not related to kidney function and um you know and like I said earlier the data actually shows that higher protein diets actually improve kidney function and so Ura may go up but it's not going to raise creatinine and so um that's going up for another reason and it's almost always dehydration that's the first protocol crine goes up you drink more water very simply you don't make your kidneys work as hard so you don't have to concentrate urine as much to get out all the all the all the crap right so your kidneys are working a bit too hard right now drink more water and help them out test it again um your your doctor obviously has your best interest at heart but he just isn't aware of this data and the literature on the fact that higher protein diets improve kidney function or on all the hundreds of thousands of people on a carnivore diet now who don't get kidney problems and in fact many people with ckd5 ckd4 reversing their kidney disease so uh drink more water and you'll be fine a bet and then just check your kidney function again in a month drink a buttload of water whatever you're drinking drink more you know double it try anyway I don't know how much you're drinking but drink a hell of a lot more water and then see what you're doing also s months is a long time you're going up and down you don't know what's going on in that time check it again in a month drink a buttload of water and then check it again in a month graning will go down don't worry about that hey everyone really happy to announce a new sponsor for the show and for everybody down in Australia Stockman steaks who are delivering highquality grass-fed and finished pasture raised beef and other meats flash frozen and vacuum sealed to your door something I've been enjoying a lot of myself recently as well they also have have a great range of specialty items such as high fat keto mints and carnivore beef and organs mints with liver kidneys and beef heart as well so use code chaffy today for free order of beef mints or another specialty gift along with your order at Stockman steak.com and I'll see you over there thanks guys my father is 80 years old has kidney failure stage 4 so that's ckd4 um seriously diabetic using multiple insulin shots want to put him on Carnivore should I be concerned about oxalate dumping he has no gallbladder um well first of all you know that's a very good point about the diabetes you know when you go on a carnivore diet that will reverse your diabet ketogenic carnivore diet will reverse diabetes and that's a that's a major major killer of of kidney function right so you know tell oh my God stay the hell away from from carnivore okay so go back to being diabetic with diabetic retina with diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy and diabetic um you know peripheral vascular disease and and um and peripheral neuropathies and and all the amput oh yeah because oh my God that that meat's gonna kill you eventually in sometime maybe 40 years from now no it won't shut up you know this is reversing illnesses that that cannot be reversed apparently and are improving people's lives in so many ways so uh no that's that's not going to hurt you um so I think it's a great idea to put him on Carnivore I think that will help him in a number of ways I don't think you necessarily have to be concerned about oxide dumping but keep it in the back of your mind if he starts having different sorts of issues that may be attributed to that you know potentially you could get some kidney stones or something like that but you know it's better out than in you know I mean you want to get these things the hell out of there if he's getting a lot of oxalate dumping he's getting sick from that then you can go with the low oxalate sort of things as per Sally Norton so watch her videos on exactly how to do that she's the expert on that excuse me and um but the vast majority of people can just do this and go carnivore and actually do really really well with it and uh and don't don't need to worry about it even you know Sally once said to me that that most people even when they do dump out a lot of this stuff they'll they'll maybe have a bad few days or a bad couple of weeks and then they get over it and then they don't have any problems after that that's most people you know her concern is that the the the you know those people and the in the minority they get a really bad dumping and actually it's it's life-threatening and it's it's very dangerous to them um well I don't know if the dumping can be life-threatening but it's certainly debilitating and and can be very nasty and um so so yeah so just to keep an eye on that and if you start getting these problems then you know I I would look to Sally Norton's work and and uh on how to mitigate that but I wouldn't just I wouldn't I wouldn't not do it just for concerns of that I mean it's better to not eat oxalates than to eat more oxalates and and and to keep compounding that issue uh the no gallbladder thing is not a big deal you just need to spread out your fatty meals throughout the day uh most people with a gallbladder will form a pseudo gallbladder which works exactly the same as a normal gallbladder and so we won't even have to worry about it but if he finds it if he eats a big fatty steak he gets diarrhea afterwards like immediately afterwards then fine don't eat that much fat just space out the meal cut it in half eat half the steak earlier if that's still doing it do it in quarters eat it four times a day things like that um so if you split up your fatty meals you shouldn't have a problem even without a gallbladder or a pseudo gallbladder but most people get a Pudo gallbladder and they don't have a problem so hopefully he's in that camp either way will absolutely help him uh at 80 years old it will give him a new lease on life absolutely they get rid of his diabetes and uh signic L reduce his Demand on insulin if not completely remove it um a lot of people are able to come off insulin as well so keep doing that um he's probably on that form because he's a diabetic get B12 in him because he's almost certainly deficient um if you you haven't been on a carnivore diet you're deficient in B12 if you're on met foran even on a carnivore diet you're probably deficient on B12 so um get him a shot get him checked or get him checked and then get a shot and um three shots generally is in the in the treatment protocol and um and then get them on a carnivore diet and just and keep track of his of his B12 just check it every six weeks or so and if it keeps dipping down he just needs regular injections or sublingual under the tongue B12 and good luck to him and you seven thank you for the super chat or sine however you pronounce it uh can you explain more on cholesterol and how it affects men and women differently um well it just affects men and women differently in the sense that men and women are different and we use those things slightly differently and we make different hormones so I mean cholesterol is just is just a ubiquitous chemical in the body and it is used as a precursor to all your hormones and so you know for proper hormonal Health you need you need appropriate amounts of cholesterol and you need that from your your body making it which is predominantly where you get your cholesterol from your body fills in the gaps by dietary uh you know dietary cholesterol but generally dietary cholesterol doesn't really affect your serum cholesterol very much at all and so it it doesn't necessarily affect men and women all that differently but the cholesterol is used differently because it's you know it's turned into more testosterone in men and uh you know different amounts of estrogen and DHEA and all these other sorts of things in women so you know the balance the homeostasis of these different hormones is different in men and women but the cholesterol is used exactly the same it's used as a precursor for all of those hormones so you know while men and women are different and they're going to use cholesterol slightly differently in the amount of hormones that you that you have it's uh actually pretty much the same in both men and women that um that it affects us that is necessary for all these different processes our brain is largely made out of cholesterol every cell in our body the lipid Bayer is cholesterol those are cholesterol molecules B made out of cholesterol hormones are made out of cholesterol cholesterol is very important for both men and women so um I don't actually think that it affects us all that much differently it's actually vital for both it's just we have slightly different hormones and those are technically made from cholesterol so I guess you could say that or unless unless there was some sort of specific thing that was going on there that uh you may had in mind about the cholesterol but that's um sort of all I can think about at the moment to do with cholesterol and differences between men and women Mary Franco thank you very much for the Super Chat I'm not seeing um a question attached but maybe there's one down the chain uh there is a super chat from Robert Walcott which I appreciate and the question was down further um so thank you Robert Robert says I'm a type 1 diabetic so on Carnivore I will sometimes get low blood sugar what you recommend to eat to recover from a hypo I'd probably sck with milk probably I'd probably I'd stick with animal products you know any p in a storm if you're out in the middle of nowhere and the only thing they have is a soda you know get a soda it's not ideal but you know it's not something that you're doing every day it's just something that you're doing to avoid uh hypoglycemia when you're not feeling well if and you're symptomatic you know if your blood sugar is a bit low but your ketones are high and you feel fine you know is that is that the end of the world if you um if you have ketones your brain is going to be running properly and they've done experiments on people which probably shouldn't have done where they they raised up their ketones uh and then started dropping their blood sugar and they found they actually dropped them down to a level that they would normally be in a coma perfectly fine no issues didn't feel bad fully Compass MST answer questions easily all that sort of stuff so you know go by how you feel you feel great your ketones are up or or at normal levels and and you feel fine fine if you do take too much insulin that could suppress your ketones and suppress your blood sugar and so you might you might not feel fine drink some milk you know grab some whole milk raw milk if you can you know treat yourself but um you know I I would probably stick with with animal products myself um but if you don't have access to milk then you know get something else you know other other sorts of of easy easily absorbed carbohydrates and then you know just dose the insulin appropriately if you are getting you know the right titration of your insulin you know it should be easier on a carnivore diet you're not having all the swings and blood sugar so it should be much easier and hopefully you don't have as many hypo or or any hypos um but but if you do I'd probably go milk and then just you know just hopefully don't you know have the issues with the the the too much insulin in the future so yeah good luck with that hopefully hopefully it doesn't come up but that's what I would do without all the scents and things you can get it with sense but I just get it without the scense you can also get soap and all that sort of stuff and I find that that that's really helpful for skin especially the Tallow on your skin my God that's like the best thing you'll ever put on your"
