    "transcript": "hello good morning good evening uh for everyone who is in America uh today is the live for April 25th in America 26th in Australia and other parts of the world thank you everyone for joining um sorry again for being late seems to be a habit I should probably start organizing these for times I can actually make but thank you all for joining and uh try to answer all the questions that are available um I do have to leave for work in about I hour and a half but I'll try to get to everything as much as I can and uh thank you to L for letting people know that I'm on my way and good to see you in live okay let me just get going on Instagram here as well and we're on X Instagram and YouTube as usual so great so we'll start with some of the the super chats first one is from cby thank you very much cby early Q because I'm in the UK oh yeah so geez in the UK so it's the the middle of the night uh UK won't catch this live um are egg whites inflammatory is they are meant to protect the Yol and obviously animals don't want anything eating their eggs so there must be some level of defenses in them there there is a level of Defense in the in the egg whites and some people can be more sensitive to them some people have more of a problem especially if you don't cook them so if you cook the egg it can be or the egg white it can be safer you'll denature some of these things uh some people don't have any problem with that some people drink eggs uh raw I've done that myself had no issues that I've noticed but some people do especially people with autoimmunity should probably avoid uh certainly raw egg whites if not egg whites in general um quite often they'll have won't have a problem with egg yolks but just uh just be mindful of your own situation um you know there can be a lot of reasons why some people will feel better or worse on different sorts of meats or eggs uh at the end of the day it doesn't really matter if they if you respond differently and negatively towards them just you know eat something else eat something that that makes you feel better it could be a psychosomatic sort of issue that you're just not used to eating red meat or fatty meat and your body's sort of like what's this and get over that with with more exposure but you know if you're not enjoying something or it's giving you some sort of weird reaction you know just eat eat another meat or Animal product that doesn't do that to you and uh you know just eat the things that you enjoy and make you feel good uh as long as it's meat uh nav thank you for the Super Chat hi doc I've been told I need to temporarily stop working out when starting carnivore to let my body adjust is that true and if true for how long I don't think that's necessarily true I think that you just keep doing what you're doing most people feel better straight away I mean I I don't know why you have to adjust to not introducing poison into your body if anything you should probably avoid working out if you're poisoning yourself because your body is being hurt uh now you're not being hurt your body's allowing you to or you're allowing your body to sort of work the way it's supposed to work I guess the argument could be that when you're fat adapting your body getting used to running on ketones immobilizing fat stores and making your own carbohydrates there could be a lag in your energy levels and that could you could see a bit of a dip and not feel as good so maybe you give your body a rest to just get over that uh but you don't have to you know you just be mindful that you might have a dip in your energy and your and your exercise output that's usually only lasts a couple weeks two three weeks at most for most people there are the rare few exceptions that take several months you know some people have pretty wretched energy for many months and then all a sudden just something comes out of it and they they they get out the other side and so don't necessarily know why the hell that is but it does seem to be a slower conversion for some people than others the vast majority of people will feel fantastic after about two weeks uh as far as energy levels are concerned even with their exercises I know a lot of people that convert over and they don't have any dip in their exercise or their output I was one of those people and then after two weeks it just took off so that could very well be you so I don't know I don't think you you need to avoid exercise if anything that can help stimulate and spur your body into adapting further and faster so I wouldn't I wouldn't avoid that unless it's you know just making you miserable and you just need to give your chance it to make energy properly David Walker thank you for the Super Chat day 75 of carnivore day 15 of the lion diet if my second fasted blood test still shows triglycerides of 1937 uh should I then continue the diet 21y old male 180 pounds so I believe this is this was a gentleman from from the last live where we talked about uh um he said triglycerides were like 1900 something I've never seen that in my entire life I've never seen anybody with that and that's what saying you you need to get multiple data points so meat does not raise triglycerides fat does not raise triglycerides dietary fat does not raise triglycerides eating carbohydrates eating sugar drinking alcohol potentially seed oils raise triglyceride so does stress and so does poor sleep I've still never seen anybody with a 1900 on their on their triglyceride and I've certainly um never seen it go go like that because of a meat diet I've seen a couple people that have gotten worse no really only one that has gotten worse triglycerides when on a carnivore diet but that was because they were in an extraordinarily stressful situation at their work and when they came you know got out of that situation just all came right down so that that just normalized itself so stress is a major factor sleep is a major factor food is is of course the main factor um but it's it's the carbohydrates and the sugar and the alcohol that are going to raise your triglycerides not meet um so yes I would continue that I just try to figure out what the hell is going on with your your blood test and try to maximize your sleep optimize your stress levels and and make sure there's nothing else that's sort of sneaking in that might be complicating things um you know a 1900 I mean that sounds like it's it's not a fasted uh test they're saying here if my second fasted blood test still shows this so that sort of suggests that the first one was a fasted test when you get an aberant test like this that's just way off the scale you need to check it again just basically straight away because it could just be a lab error um if you're if you're fasted and you're doing everything uh in the correct way first thing in the morning no exercise no sex no stress or poor sleep leading up to the test by a couple days then and you get some crazy number like that you check it again you see okay was that an accurate reading and um and then you try to figure out what the hell's going on there if it is an accurate reading uh I would still continue the diet because the diet's not going to cause that it's something else that's going to cause that and you know going off you know you you'd still be eating meat right but you're adding in sugar and carbs and all these other sorts of things which will generally make your triglycerides worse so that's sort of adding to the problem as opposed to helping the problem even if you just went off meat altogether that's not going to lower your triglycerides you're going to be replacing that with carbs and sugar and Seed oils which is going to raise your triglycerides so that's that's going to be the last thing you want to do you're going to want to figure out why your triglycerides are crazy high like that but again like that's that's a very aberant number that is very likely a lab error if you had actually if you've actually done that fasted so just check it again and then see how you go fix your sleep fix your stress make sure there's nothing else sneaking in and get more data points you know it could be some sort of genetic issue that I've never heard of that will slam your Tri triglycerides up to to nearly 2,000 but again I've never heard of it and um uh but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist and could be other factors that are going in but it wouldn't it it won't be from meat meat does not raise triglyceride fat does not animal fat does not raise triglycerides so you need to find what else is doing that but first first things first check it again do it in all that the same way no stress no exercise no sex for two days leading up to it certainly not the morning up drink a lot of water fast from the night before 9:00 P p.m. get your test first thing in the morning between 8 and 9:00 a.m. don't take any pills or medications and stop any multivitamins or B vitamins containing biotin which is a B vitamin should just stop all vitamin supplements basically for 3 days before because that can change your results as well and yeah just get more data points and then um try to figure out what the hell is going on if it's an act accurate number which is just really unlikely but please do uh let us know how that goes um and uh yeah and see how you do Lena thank you for the Super Chat does the amount of dairy CA was weight stall or is it simply just the dairy itself I only have 1 to two ounces a day I even heard that canall um so you know more more is going to cause more of a problem more can make you gain weight uh some can make you stall the thing is too is that it's it can cause compulsive eating people just sort of go to town on cheese and dairy and uh you know it there's you sort of start removing the stop mechanism or down regulating the stop mechanism that your body automatically does um the when you're only eating meat if you're just eating fatty meat you can eat eat until it stops tasting good your body's going to regulate that and tell you hey stop now if you're if you're eating other things even Dairy that can upset that and then you end up eating more than you may want and you end up eating the exact same amount of meat but you're add also adding on cheese so it just make you overeat a bit one to two ounces a day not all that much so from an overeating point of view probably not an issue there are some there are some things that can cause inflammation and that could potentially lead to a bit of disruption in your hormonal physiology and homeostasis you know we don't we don't have exact reasons why that could be but some people do find that Dairy is a weight loss stall so one to two ounces a day not all that much using it as a as a condiment melting it onto meat or into eggs or something like that that's fine for most people see how you go if you're not getting the results that you want if you're not losing weight uh as quickly as you think you should or losing fat specifically as quickly as you should because if you're putting on muscle and you're losing fat you're staying the same weight so just remember that so if you don't think you're losing fat in the way that you should just drop the dairy it's really easy it's only one to two ounces it's not all that much shouldn't be hard to give up and so uh you just see give it up for 30 days give it give yourself an honest chance to to see a difference and and see for yourself but it's a classic weight loss stall one to two ounces a day for most people probably not that big of a deal just see how it affects you Beth moer thank you very much for the Super Chat in general how long after starting carnivore would someone be fully adapted cleared of toxins and experiencing the full benefits thank you um well full benefits is is a bit different majority of benefits within a few weeks um you're going to get a lot of these toxins out of your body a lot of them seem a lot of people seem to feel a lot better after about two weeks alcohol generally takes three to four weeks to get fully out of your system but it's know it's better every every week every day and so that's why I tell people you know give yourself a full 30 days because then you'll get most of this stuff out of your system then you'll start feeling really really good by the end of that time and you can give yourself you know an accurate depiction of what you might feel like with all this stuff out of your system some things take longer so Omega sixes seed oils these sorts of things have a longer halflife you it's like a couple years halflife so it can take years to clear this garbage out of your system and after 3 four months you end up radically increasing the amount of mitochondria you're going through autophagy this whole time you're turning over cells you're turning over cell lines you're turning over organel and so usually about six months on you sort of recycled and turned over all of yourselves you feel a lot better but you can continue to stimulate more growth and um increase the number of mitochondria and their efficacy going on to you know 2 3 years right so you're just going to keep getting benefits you're going to feel fantastic after a few weeks you're going to get tons of things out of your system if you have any sort of medical issues they can take longer or shorter to go away a lot of them clear up quite quickly which is remarkable because people live with these things their whole life and they're just taking medications and medications and just getting worse and worse and worse and now all of a sudden just you know a month or two in then these these serious medical issues are improving dramatically or even going away others take longer so Hashimoto can take a year or two before you really get your antibodies down to zero depending on how high they were and and then allow your thyroid a chance to repair which it may not do all the way there is such a thing as damage done if we if we permanently damage ourselves due to exposure to the wrong food and causing autoimmunity or just direct toxic damage you know from eating you know cyanide containing things like almonds and cassava and flax seed and these sorts of things that that can permanently damage your thyroid that can permanently damage your neurological system so you know that uh that that can leave lasting damage that's not going to heal fully but you'll get as you'll heal as much as your body is able to heal um so you'll feel a lot better most people feel a lot better after a few weeks two to three weeks weeks they feel dramatically better and I mean I felt like a different breed of human just superhero after two weeks and most people report that as well some people it takes longer like I said to get that energy level and all that sort of stuff um but if if you are um if you're you know if you're coming to like a very strict carnivore diet and you're only eating meat and only drinking water most and getting enough fat getting enough food most people will feel a lot better after two to three weeks but you get continuing benefits you just keep feeling better and better and better and then you start having more energy you want to start working out and that's going to obviously improve your health even more so you get a vast amount of benefit within a few weeks and then you keep getting more benefits after that if that makes sense so full maximum benefits that's a lifelong expression right but you keep getting you get a lot of better benefit just right away getting this garbage out of your system and that that can make you feel dramatically better within a couple weeks uh another question from Lena thank you very much Lena carnivore for about four months still no weight loss how much longer do you think till it comes off still facing brain fog am I not fat adapted yet so this was this was the question about uh Dairy so look you're in that situation where you're not necessarily uh losing much weight remember that if you put muscle and you lose fat you will stay the same weight so the scale is really not what's important a lot it's really important for people to really focus on their health as opposed to the scale the vast majority of people will lose weight and fat uh early on but other people will be you know everyone comes from a different situation metabolically and hormonally and so you just need to look at things from from where you are and focus on your health this is about being healthy first and foremost this is not a weight loss G this is a health optimization technique this is this is eating to our biological design and being as healthy as we can possibly be that's the main thing weight generally comes along with that fat loss generally comes along with that but it's that's that it's important to focus on the health aspects so think about how this is helping you think about how this is benefiting you and um and and go from there and let the other things come as well brain fog is rare but again there's there are some people that it takes months before they really start seeing the full benefits and we don't exactly know why I haven't figured that one out yet um U because it's very rare we just don't see it every now and then and then just all of a sudden something just ticks over and just people feel massively better and their weight starts coming off there are a lot of reasons for for weight loss stalls could be Dairy could be other things that you're including in your diet like artificial sweeteners that's a common one people including orthol monk fruit sugar Stevia these sorts of things because they think well it's a natural sweetener well Sugar's a natural sweetener right and so you know we're we're avoiding that too so you know you just want to just just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good just cut out everything else just keep it simple um and have uh you know a bit of organs things like that the higher nutrient density the more satiated you're going to be earlier on your body's chasing nutrients it's not chasing calories so you don't want to eat ton of of organs because that can be overwhelming to your system you can get too much of a good thing and have hypervitaminosis or you know increase especially the fat soluble vitamins like vitamin A or things like copper and the different metals they build up and take longer to clear out of your system than say like water soluble vitamins like B vitamins right so just be mindful of that but having a bit of organs especially early on when you're transitioning it's a great idea you know it's it's Nature's multivitamin right and so so and uh so you can try that there are other reasons different hormonal reasons things that people have leptin resistance Le P TI n that's elevated it's generally very difficult to lose weight for most people and um some people still can but a lot of people don't a lot of people when they have high leptin it's very stubborn weight loss and that can be IND indicative of a slowed and damaged metabolism and so you need to COA metabolism to increase you don't want to starve it and suppress your metabolism more and that's what happens if you if you chronically limit the amount of nutrients and energy available through your diet your body's just going to shut things down and you're going to feel really tired you're going to have horrible brain fog you're going to feel wretched and you're not going to really lose weight because your body saying no no no we have to store everything everything coming in is going into the fat because we need to survive a famine and so energy levels are down because less coming in less is going out so you want to do the opposite you want to coax your system you want to coax your metabolism and speed it up so you want to do things like exercise Anor robic exercising so resistance training sprinting those sorts of things even though you feel tired just do it you'll get something done you you'll start encouraging your system to work but you need to eat enough as well you don't just want to exercise and not eat enough because then you're doing the opposite as well your body's like well now we really need to save everything because you know we're having a high demand output and you know we're not getting enough in so we really need to hang on to this tightly so don't do that uh eat enough and eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you know try that twice a day if you need to especially if you're working out and see how that goes you can check test your blood you can test your thyroid you can test your uh leptin you can test your fasting insulin these are signs the these different things that if they're out of balance that can cause uh slow weight loss and and slow metabolism you can also check your your nutrient status your B12 your vitamin D your zinc and your magnesium these are very important things um you get them with meat but people are when you're starting on this thing most people are on a very deficient diet and not taking supplements and so they're going to be quite deficient in these things to the extent that the reference ranges have actually slid down and gotten and gotten lower because they're just an average for the community since everybody's deficient in magnesium B12 zinc and vitamin D they're just just move that reference range down well this is normal now it's like this is the new normal deficiency is The New Normal apparently and uh no it's not normal and so if you're in the reference range for these sorts of things you're not on the really upper end of that reference range or above that reference range you're low that's all there is to it it's I've never seen um any country uh or any any lab that had a reference range for B12 that's actually made it into what I would consider an optimal reference range for B12 so the other ones you know sometimes they sort of lip into the right range but not always um so you want to be on the upper end of their reference range If you're sort of low normal for them you're really low if you're low low for them you're really low um so you can check those things as well uh but just be patient get out everything except fatty meat and water and make sure you're eating enough make sure you're sleeping well because that can be a major stall as well if you're stressed out you're not sleeping well that raises cortisol and that will stall your weight loss and um there are a lot of different things it's it food is the main factor here but these other factors really matter as well so just keep that in mind uh as well and and um and then just just keep giving it time you know it's uh it can take longer for some people than others even when they're doing it right the vast majority of people don't uh have uh as much of a delay as this but you know it will happen for you too i' I've never seen anyone not get there and some people I see that their letin is massively elevated and it just takes time and they're not really losing weight not really losing weight not really losing weight and then all of a sudden their leptin is coming down the whole time and then all of a sudden Just Hits that Tipping Point and the rest of their metabolism other sorts of factors come into play and then they start losing weight um I just had a lady actually I've been following since last year she uh has been doing this and you know explain that to her and and she'd been overweight her whole life nothing had ever worked and um and she came around this and she said okay I'm just going to give it a try you know I knew it could take longer and and she's doing this for her health and she just really enjoyed it she was eating well and things were and and know it wasn't hard for her to do so she's like okay you know I'm enjoying this she was really losing much weight but her elpin was Skyhigh and her fasting insulin was very elevated as well and she had other other markers that you know this was going to take a while and um you know so we we corrected things and added a bit of liver and all these sorts of things that she was able to eat and we just sort of tracked her every month and she's us losing a bit but not all that much and uh you know really just very slow but she's like okay I'm just I'm in this for the long haul you know I feel good I'm just going to focus on my health and just give it time that was back in August right so was a long time ago right and just last month she came in hadn't seen her for sort of a month before that and every month she was just sort of like losing just a a little bit little bit little bit and then all of a sudden bam 16 kilos which is significant right I mean that's like 35 PBS right so that was in a month month six weeks you know know and so that just that just happened to hit just that was it her her leptin was coming down down down and then bang just dropped all this weight so you know that that is generally what happens your body needs to just get to a point where it's happy and it's saying okay we're not in a famine anymore we can release this so fix all those other things and then after that just give it time and I think you'll do fine I'm sure you'll do fine aen thank you for the Super Chat question um I've just got my first A1C after starting carnivore serum sugar from 8 to 7.2 A1C from 6.8 to 6.4 Tri Str 1.1 HDL 1 I am disappointed my hba1 C isn't lower what might be the next step I need to take well first of all it came down and that's good doesn't doesn't do that any other way right I mean what what you know have you what have you done so far that has given you even that much of a drop in your A1C right so you know I mean this is we need to be appreciative of this as well you know count your blessings uh some people have have more of a drop than that but you know who cares you know I mean some some people have you know when you're coming from the very higher levels of A1C that can have a more dramatic drop so I mean I've seen people with a hb1c of you know 13 14 drop down to you know five or six after 3 4 months that's that's incredible right so that doesn't happen but that doesn't happen either it's not supposed to go from 6.8 to 6.4 it only just goes up it just goes up it goes up it goes up and you try to slow it down with medication and lifestyle but it only goes up that that was the previous thought and teaching was that this is a progressive disease and it only gets worse right not anymore so you're already improving and that's that's you're already breaking the norm breaking the standard so that's great you should be really happy with that also how long was it between tests right you know was it one month two months three months five months six months a year right obviously that's going to matter too so the point the the main thing is is the trend you're trending in the right direction also if you're on blood sugar medications for your diabetes you should not stop them until your blood sugar indicates that it's appropriate to if you're if you're you're fasting blood sugar um you really should be between four and five that's what you want to keep it and so if you need medications to keep it there take medications to keep it there right um going from eight to 7.2 and dropping from 6.8 to 6.4 that that seems about right you know you want to be you want your fasting uh fasting blood sugar to be between four and five really so you still have insulin resistance you still have diabetes you still need to take medication if you're on it and you should probably be be on it uh in this case that can help you bring that blood sugar down and reduce the insulin resistance or give you enough insulin if you're not producing enough uh for now but it's um most people can come off insulin um but it takes time right so it can take you know people you know people get you know very excited that that this can help reverse their diabetes so they go oh if I just stop eating carbs I don't have diabetes anymore no not yet you know you have you have lead poisoning right and so you stop drinking leaded water great there's still lead in your body there's still poison in your body your body still has to recover from that and if you need medications to get that lead further out of your system and heal and repair the damage from that lead great you know then so be it thank goodness they they have medications for those things I don't think we use that as a crutch to justify eating a whole bunch of carbs and sugar definitely not but if you need it uh because you have damage and you're you you're using it as a bridge when you're transitioning to a proper diet great that's very useful and so that's what medication is supposed to be for it's this temporary bridge to get you to where you need to go not just a lifelong um you know lifelong condition that you have to chronically be taking even though that's what they are buil for and designed for because that's what makes them the most money is if you take this to recipe your life you don't need to take it the rest of your life but you may need to take it right now so if you if you're on medication I continue taking your medication I would try to get your blood sugar down between four and five when especially when you're fasting and um and if you need you know metformin or whatever you're taking to to achieve that so be it don't come off your medication until it's actually appropriate to you but you know what whatever you're doing is working so that's good you know so about the trend you're going in the right direction and so why would we be upset about that it's going in the right direction you know we can all want in instant results but this is amazing that doesn't happen normally right and so doing anything else that doesn't happen this is the only thing that has ever done that right there right and so you be very happy about that be very proud of that and just look forward to the rest look forward to it it continue to get better you know if um you know if you're if you're not pure pure pure fatty meat and water get there and um and get rid of all artificial sweeteners everything I I don't care if they don't have carbs in them I don't care if allulose has a much lower glycemic index just don't eat it just don't have it just eat fatty meat only drink water eat until you're full stay on meds when you need them come off when it's appropriate and and you will do you will do just fine and you will reverse your diabetes that is what people all around the world are doing uh by the millions now it's it's absolutely incredible so um you know just keep it up keep going get as pure as you can and uh just be patient it is going in the right direction and you're doing great so just keep it up Beth Ramer thank you for the Super Chat I heard that ground beef is higher in histamines than other meat how do you know if you're sensitive to me sorry with so many questions it's perfectly fine so you know the thing is is that um you know whether or not there histamine is in there doesn't matter if you react to it that that's that's the thing so some people get some sort of of a reaction that they that is unpleasant to them when they have ground beef or when they have uh leftovers they put in the refrigerator they have it the next day and it gives them some sort of weird reaction um is is that histamines is that something else who knows I I talk to people all the time that they swear by it being histamines I talk to other people they're like there's no chance in hell that that's the case it's U I think it's something else doesn't matter what matters is that you're reacting to it right and so uh that's the only thing that matters so it's not a matter of of of knowing if you're sensitive to histamines or not if that's even a thing maybe I don't know I don't really care I'm I'm looking at this more from a practical standpoint do you eat ground be beef is that giving you a reaction that's negative yes eat something else no go to town that's the only thing that matters so it doesn't matter why you're getting a reaction or you're not getting a reaction if it's just can you eat it do you enjoy it is it making you feel good yes keep eating it no find something else that doesn't give you the same reaction and so that's the main thing so just try it out try some ground beef if you don't have any problems with ground meats and no problem uh Beth rar thank you for the Super Chat uh hunger changes from day to day so it seems like I eat at different times every day is it okay uh not to have any kind of schedule thank you as always that's fine just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good if you're doing that in the morning or during the day you're going to get a bit more tired especially if you're eating maximally and so you just may bung up your day um so if you're doing that during the day maybe try to eat less than your body wants just sort of half as much take the edge off so you can keep going and still have good energy levels I tend to eat my bigger meals later in the day later at night because that automatically just makes me a bit more tired and I want to go to sleep and that's a good time to go to sleep is at night so uh but yeah just eat fatty meat till it stops tasting good and do so in a way that's logistically feasible for you so you're not getting tired at work and things like that Tom cornivore says not a question just want to thank you for doing this Dr chaffy we need more people like well thank you very much Tom I appreciate that RAB Bell thank you for the Super Chat is there any type there's any hope for someone on the carnivore diet who had to stop carnivore due to Alpha gal syndrome carbohydrates messed me up so bad as well and I don't know what to eat anymore yeah no you absolutely can it's just you have to avoid red me meat so the other meats are fine so like chicken and fish possibly pork don't look that up though um and um and and and take a look but yeah so uh yes you can it's it's really just like the red meats that you that you need to avoid and from what I have um what I have been told by other doctors is that it is is basically temporary um and so after you know after a couple months or you know six months or a year or something like that you you lose that sensitivity and you can start eating red meat again so yes there's definitely hope um not even hope you can just keep doing this right now you just need to avoid the red meats and so focus on chicken fish eggs and things like that I mean you can you can find online which Meats will have the alpha galactose whatever the hell it is that you you react to from that tick bite um it's it is thankfully still pretty rare um who knows how more how much more prevalent that's going to get pretty you know coincidental this is this is happening people are trying to get us to eat less red meat and all of a sudden people developing allergies towards a red meat uh when that's what people were saying well this is what we should do just to make people allergic to red meat so that they they don't eat as much so we forced them to not eat as much like H that's that's kind of funny that this is coming out exactly exactly the same time that you said that that's a way that we should uh uh way we can control people to eat less red meat not saying that that's what it is but it's a bit odd that they're saying that I don't know how the hell they would do that um there does seem to be a tick by you know the lone star tick that's that's causing this or at least that's what's being reported and we all you know have our opinions on how accurate and um authentic and honest the reporting is these days either way it seems that red meat's the problem there and so you just eat chicken fish eggs things like that and um you know look up the different sorts of things that that are safe to eat on Alpha gal and you know in six months or so you know try some beef again see how you go with it and hopefully that goes away but yeah you can absolutely still just eat meat now you don't have to eat carbs or any of the other garbage um so yeah you can still definitely just eat carnivore Joe comic thank you for the Super Chat ever seen carnivore for prostatitis issues 58 years old uh dealing with prostatitis after stream injections or steam injections for BPH uh 20 months ago PSA 2.5 pain inflammation pelvic tightness sex issues all post procedure I'm really sorry to hear that um you know it really just depends on what what's causing these things if you have a a sort of a post-operative complication it's at least going to give you body a chance to heal as much as it as it can it can help with BPH and you know just reducing the insulin can help reduce BPH so you know the actual damage and pain and dysfunction from that procedure I I don't know I you just have to sort of see but you know being on uh on an optimal diet like a cornivore diet or the cor the optimal diet of the cornivore diet is at least going to put your body into a position that it can heal as well as possible and and be as healthy as it's possible to be and recover and heal from as much as you're able to heal from I don't think that you're going to be able to heal as well if you're on anything else anyway so it's definitely worth a shot hopefully it does help you but um there's really no way to tell you I mean there's things there there is again such thing such a thing as damage done and if you have permanent damage due to injury from a procedure it may not recover but a lot of things do recover and this will at least give you the best chance to uh to recover that you that you can you can get and good luck with that I hope it works uh George story thank you for the super chat um how do the micronutrients in bacon and eggs compared to ruminant meat are bacon and eggs sustainable longterm as a primary Food Source on Carnivore yeah you know I mean it's it's probably better with the red meat the ruminant meat they're also going to be able to filter out more of the plant toxins especially when they're being fed things that they're not designed to eat pigs and chicken being fed corn and soy they're not designed to eat that stuff they're not going to be able to detoxified as much they're not going to get as much nutrients from it they're not going to be as nutritious they're not going to have uh uh um be able to filter out more of those n those toxins whereas a you know ruminant animal like a cow they ferment this stuff and break it down make it much more nutrient Rich even if it's not their natural diet and uh detoxify more of these things through that fermentation process and so it's safer lower toxic load higher nutritional Avail nutrient uh density but there's a difference again between grass-fed and finish regener ly raised beef and feed lot beef right it's only you know a couple months in the feed lot or three months in a feed lot and that can significantly reduce the amount of nutrients that are in there and doing it on a regenerative pattern where you're moving the animals around and you regenerating the land you're actually regenerating the nutrients you're building up more nutrients which is pretty crazy to think about you think you at least you just keep it sort of stable but no it actually increases the nutrients in the soil in the grass in the cow and then more nutrients go around just more and more and more more and more so doing in that process makes the makes the cow more nutritious makes the land more more viable and fertile uh it's pretty amazing it's absolutely amazing amazing um uh vehic ly of it all so bacon and eggs you know are you getting pasture raised pork are you getting pasture raised chicken and eggs that's going to make a big difference too a massive difference you have a massive difference in the amount of micronutrients available as well yes you could eat bacon and eggs the rest of your life if they're pasturised bacon and eggs it's going to be a lot better A lot better and uh some people just can't do that some people with autoimmune issues or other issues can't really do pork or eggs or even chicken or farmed fish in particular so but you know if you do good do well on um uh bacon and eggs and you feel fine just make sure you get bacon that doesn't have bunch of sugar in it try to get like no sugar cure bacon and um you know and you should be fine if you feel good you feel good I feel best on beef hands down uh I feel great on bacon and eggs certainly taste good but I always feel the best on beef red meat in particular bread meat in general anyway so just see how you go but yeah you could you could eat bacon and eggs the rest of your life uh TBO thank you for the for the question I'd like to ask Dr chaffy to address my sick feeling after just eating meat 10 days in a carnivore please uh yeah often this is this is that psychosomatic sort of condition response where we're like oh meat's bad for me Fat's bad for me I'm GNA avoid this um and so you your brain is telling you oh this is bad this is bad you need to avoid that but also you if you're getting a negative feeling you're sort of feeling sick and it doesn't really taste good your your body's telling you in no UNC terms that you are not hungry anymore so you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good if you if it's if it's the fat is making you a bit queasy and nauseous you need to ease into it just have small amounts of fat cut off a piece of fat put it with a lean piece of meat eat it together say like okay that actually tastes nice together and you go on from there you sort of build up it can take months before you undo that conditioning that we've all had for our entire lives about how horrible fat is for you so we actually get a visceral uh response to that where we feel sick so you can easy into it that way but also if you're eating fatty meat and it tastes good eventually it's going to not taste good and that's your body telling you to stop and if you keep going well I have to finish my plate I haven't eaten that much and but oh I feel sick I'm feeling that's your body telling you to stop it doesn't matter how much is on your plate stop just put it in the fridge right your body knows what it's doing as long as you're just eating fatty meat and water let your body handle it so if you're if you're not feeling well feeling sick or queasy you don't really want to eat meat don't eat right but if your body's telling you not to eat meat it's telling you just not to eat it's not just telling you not to eat meat it's telling you not to eat okay so that would be that would be my advice um question from Charles bandari uh hi I have been following you from Ghana very cool can you explain further to me uh that we don't really um we don't really like vegetables is it because of the chemicals applied to them or naturally not good for humans yeah they're just naturally not good for humans think about it this way you get lost in the in the woods or the jungles of Ghana and you run out of food you know can you eat any random plant in the in the forest no most of them will make you very very sick or even kill you um the vast majority of plants will kill you and every other animal on earth right um so all plants are poisonous it's just that certain animals have evolve the ability to eat certain plants and detox ify them safely and they can eat that plant but if they go outside of that they get very sick and this is why animals in the wild they eat very specific plants and they venture outside of that they can get very very sick or they can even die so the plant itself is bad for us and then we add insult to injury and we dump a bunch of chemical toxins and pesticides on them make them even more poisonous so there's definitely a combination there you know the pesticides are definitely not good for you uh the plant's worse so I would um I would avoid that if you if you watch on uh YouTube there's a there's a a lecture I gave at a medical conference that I just you know just went from Big Air and just named it plants are trying to kill you and I made this argument in front of uh a room of 300 doctors uh saying that you should not eat vegetables you should not be recommending these things to your patients and um very skeptical crowd at first uh by the end of it you know I it was very well received and I a lot of people coming up to me after that you know it was like you know white-haired professors of medicine you know very austere and Suits coming up to me saying like I never want to eat a goddamn vegetable again in my life and I was like great um you know job done so it's uh you watch that it's on the low carb down under YouTube channel and um I have I have one called by the same name PLS are trying to kill you on my channel it's more of a discussion we talk about very similar points but I like the one on low carb down under because it's just um you know it's it's a presentation you know it's not a discussion I'm just you know just hitting points and and there's you know there's visuals because I have a PowerPoint presentation as well so it's um uh that's a one to watch and that tells you exactly you know why uh it's the plant themselves that we have to worry about more than the pesticides and and actually we looked at the comparison of this and found that the natural plant toxins are actually worse than the pesticides at least the ones that they've studied um back in the the late 80s early 90s so yeah check that out but yeah it's the plant itself and and the chemicals we apply to that just make it worse de thank you very much for the generous Super Chat devout carnivore for seven months plus uh dealing with tartar buildup which I understand is more calcium in saliva I don't hear a lot of people mention this is this normal yeah it can be you know if you look back at the at the fossil record you know pre agrarian people that big wide Jaws Perfect Teeth all 32 erupted and and perfect and um there's buildup there there's there's um you know there's uh calcifications or or whatever the hell some sort of sort of harder buildup in between the teeth so you know they're goes flossing you don't need to floss and it probably protects those the the teeth and and the gums and things like that has this little little layer so they had they had excellent teeth excellent teeth health and you see that sort of patina of buildup in there and actually you know survived in the fossil record so you know when when you have the normal oral biome that's probably very normal you know we like having clean teeth with all that stuff scraped off so we do fine um but it seems that in in the wild in nature that was a very normal thing to have that build up in between the teeth and protecting the gums and things like that so if you're eating carbs and all those sorts of things you're going to get the wrong kind of bacteria you're going to get a different oral biome and you are going to have you know rotting and nasty sort of things you get that build up uh you're going to have a whole bunch of bad bacteria in there and that's going to cause other problems the other thing too is that people find that um oxalates can do that as well so you have sort of O your body sort of getting rid of oxalates you get more tarar buildup in your mouth and it can you can get pretty dramatic and so you might have to get more cleanings or uh you know you know scrape that off more regularly and that can be from from uh the oxalates as well and some people don't have much of an issue as well so it can be normal uh you know long before we had dentists you know we had teeth and that didn't rot out of our heads and animals in the wild don't have dentist and their teeth Don't rot out of their head so what we we noticed was in the fossil record was that you did get that sort of buildup so that can be normal but also it can be a buildup of you know from from dumping out oxalates and building up sort of calcium oxalate deposits around your teeth as well because your bra's just trying to get this stuff the hell out because it's just poison and um you know but if you if you you know want to get that stuff scraped off get it scraped off you know that's fine and um if it's oxalates that'll slow down eventually and and just get just a be a bit more normal but you shouldn't get cavities anyway as long as you're not eating anything else besides meat carnivorous Clan thank you for the Super Chat uh does carnivore help with her sism her sism is inappropriate hair growth um on women so body and facial hair that would be in a more typically male pattern uh due to high testosterone typically so it depends on what's causing it but the leading cause of PCOS which is elevated testosterone in women and lowered estrogen levels um leading to infertility and and polycystic Varian syndrome PCOS that um the leading cause of that and that's the leading cause of infertility in women is insulin resistance so high insulin having high insulin chronically High insulin because women make estrogen or testosterone first and that converts into estrogen in the ovaries and so elevated uh insulin will block the conversion of testosterone into estrogen so you get too much testosterone not enough estrogen and you get her because you get you're getting too much uh too much testosterone so it can help with that um are there other causes of heroism are there other causes of Having excess testosterone yes absolutely but it can certainly help with the some of the more common causes which is what I just described there that the insulin resistance uh any ketogenic D should do that especially when you're getting rid of lectins with different plant toxins that can actually bind onto the insulin receptors five times more tightly than insulin so you get even though you're not eating carbohydrates and your insulin is normal you still get insulin like effect and Insulin affects over a hundred different processes in your body including the conversion of testosterone into estrogen and so um even just the lectins can do that as well and so yes it can definitely help that but again it depends on what's causing the heroism I mean medications that can do that too um Gunther SB thank you for the super chat if oh also um we should probably stop super chats now because we got a butload of them and um um uh I I need to leave at around 11 because I have I have uh an appointment um shortly after that so if ribe eyes have a one to one fat to protein ratio what are some good non- rendered sources of ruminant fat uh I can add to boost to a CH to one fat to protein ratio non- rendered uh the not only non- rendered would be just getting um cuts of of fat the fat trimmings from The Butcher and just frying those up in a pan and eating those together just having a little pile of fat next to your your meat as well um you know if you wanted the other forms be like melted butter Tallow those sorts of things but really just the the fat trimmings that's the best way to do that especially in a non- rendered form KNN KNN thank you for the super chat um hi doc I have a family member with type two diabetes and stage three colon cancer they are on a lot of meds I tell them to try keto or carnivore please help well look I'm I'm you know that's that's very good of you to to recommend that I think it will help both um we know we that that TI two diabetes is reversible clinically by putting people on a on a high fat meat-based ketogenic diet like a carnivore diet so we know that so that'll help but also that high blood sugar from the diabetes is feeding the colon cancer so I ask them if they ever got a pet scan and you get that pet scan you see where these hot spots are oh that's a cancer lighting up like a Christmas tree why does it light up because we give them an injection of glucose that's radiol labeled and then we see where that glucose goes where that Sugar goes right where those carbs go and it goes right to that cancer and go and that cancer just sucks it all up right every time they have carbs they need to remember that pet scan that their cancer is now lighting up and all those cancer cells are flush with energy that's what happens every time you eat carbs and you have cancer so uh colon cancer is not caused by red meat that's an insanity that's a just it's liable really and slander and I wish red meat could sue the people and doctors that that push out that slander because it's complete um there are a lot of people treating colon cancer by going on a pure red meat and water diet only and it's pushing back their disease um look up ketogenic metabolic therapy uh work of Professor Thomas seed look up Thomas CED s YF r i d um check out my interview with him on this channel and uh and and you'll see what I mean this is this is um you know this this is uh uh you know if you understand the the biology of cancer it's it's it's very straightforward and you would treat this very differently than we're treating it now um I also gave a lecture at another medical conference called ketogenic metabolic therapy as an adjunct to as a novel adjunct to uh standard of care in cancer and and it sort of goes through this but there are dozens and dozens and dozens of studies in multiple different kinds of cancers like dozens in each timee of cancer showing efficacy and benefit and and hundreds in animals showing benefit of ketogenic diets in cancer so you know it's just and just remember the warberg effect uh Nobel Prize winner OT warberg showed that cancer cells require 400 times the amount of glucose as normal cells and they can't run on ketones so you limit the supply of glucose you limit the energy to those cells and your cells are all fine because your your cells primarily run on ketones anyway so um watch those things I have a playlist on YouTube on my YouTube channel just cancer has a lot of videos on cancer and so I would just go through those and U try to get your family member to watch those because they will reverse their diabetes and by doing that it will significantly help their their fight with cancer and help help manage it much better good luck with that I hope they do well uh Tyler Duren um has resurfaced and um thank you for the Super Chat I'm not seeing a question attached but maybe down the road Jules Anderson thank you very much for the very generous Super Chat following your advice Dr C day six of no coffee previous only one organic coffee in the morning um head pain fatigue light sensitivity woke up during the night with reflux never had that before had chamomile te sorry and sat up for hours any tips I mean these are just withdrawals you know it's like it's this is a drug withdrawal and so you know that that does go away your day six that's usually the the sort of the tail end of it um you know early on if you're if you're really getting really bad headaches if you take like a no dose like a caffeine c tablet and take like a quarter of that like 25 milligram that can take the edge off the headaches and the and the um and the different sorts of withdrawal side effects and sort of wean you off of it quickly um but you know uh you're sort of through most of that at this point most people feel a lot better after the first week the first week is usually the toughest so drink a lot of water um eat meat until you're satisfied if you know and uh and you're almost there I I wouldn't even I wouldn't even recommend taking a tiny amount of caffeine unless you're having just a massive splitting headache but most of the time at at this point you're pretty much through it so you why start that up again why start the addiction process up again um you know I would just I would just um you've weathered it this far generally this is the tail end of it I think you'll do uh much better very soon in the next sort of week or so you should be you should be uh through the worst of it and feeling a lot better so good luck with that the real Carolina guy thank you for the Super Chat uh I'm about to start carnivore and do not want to lose a lot of weight as I am at an optimal for my fitness I just want to shed body fat any suggestions well if you're going to shed body fat you're going to lose weight if you're not putting on muscle but if you're working out and you're and you're doing Fitness then the body fat you lose you'll put on muscle mass as well but if you have excess body fat then you have unhealthy weight that you don't really want on your body you know the number on the scale doesn't matter what matters is your health and your B and your your composition your body composition that's what really matters and so um if you just eat fatty meat till it stops tasting good and you lift weights you know you should be fine um and um and you should actually put on muscle as opposed to uh losing it and um uh you should be fine so just work out lift weights eat meat be happy eat until it stops tasting good you want to get enough nutrients or else yeah you could you could lose uh more lean body mass and you want you won't be able to maintain more lean body mass you're going to lose inflammation you're going to lose water weight you're going to lose some unhealthy fat those all have weight to them and so you're going to lose some weight but that's not lean body mass That's not healthy weight that's weight that you didn't want and if you're working out if you're exercising if you're lifting weights if you're doing sprinting you'll put on muscle and um you'll gain muscle and you'll probably gain weight in the long run so good luck with that venetos thank you for the Super Chat uh hi chaffy uh have you had an experience with patients who have Lyme disease and how uh carnivore has helped affected them or come across any studies before well um you know we treating Lyme disease and things like that since the 1800s with the red meat and water diet and yes a lot of people have come to a carnivore diet because of their chronic lyme disease I've had a number of people on my podcast who have uh put their Lyme intermission by using a carnivore diet and you you can find them on their Angela I'm blanking on her last name but um um she did I I think Rebecca heishman did as well and a number of others um but yeah if if you go to um so you can watch those those videos and and you know they they dramatically improved their their health I mean massively I mean these these these poor ladies were nearly dead at at a certain point and um it's completely reversed it had horrible Lyme disease for a long time gone now um or at least so reduced that they they don't really notice it anymore and you can watch those for inspiration you can also go to um the older better uh um the better older um Facebook groups such as zero carb health and zeroing in on health you know 15 plus years of data um just go just join those and go into the search function and just say limes disease you'll get tons of threads of people asking the same questions that you have and getting getting answers from people that have gone through this and uh but the answer is yes it does help dark sky thank you for the Super Chat have you heard any testimonies of people improving from Ms or CP with carnivore uh yes absolutely I mean Ms like any autoimmune disease improves dramatically um on a carnivore diet but you really have to be very strict just red meat and water very high fat um the brain and the um and the the nervous system uh the myelination this is made out of fat the myin uh is is specifically um made out of fat so when you have a you know chronic you know demalation process such as m or CP then uh you you need the building blocks you need the cholesterol you need the saturated fat you need the B12 as well B12 is required for myelinating your your axons almost everyone is deficient in B12 if you're in the range for B12 you're low on B12 that's a fact in America if you're under 540 that's critically low and just that level can cause demalation in and of itself so if you have an demalation disorder you really need to make sure sure that your your B12 is is above that really way above that because that's a critical deficiency uh you need to be a lot higher than that you need to be double that basically um critical deficiency in Australia these different units Australia Europe England things like that it's under 400 that's a critical deficiency that you can get demolation of your of your axons right and so you want to be between 12 800 and 1200 in those countries in America you want be between 1100 and 1,600 right so the reference ranges never make it up that high never and in the UK the reference range goes up to like 540 right you know 550 something like that it's just like nope nope that's not good enough and um you know even Oxford showed that you get get levels below um you know 3 350 something like that um after five years people's brains were shrinking by 5 per. how are we how are we pretending that that's in the normal range right um and it does it goes down to like 130 in a lot of places so it's like so clearly that's ridiculous so um make sure your your B12 is up um make sure you're just eating fatty meat um make sure you're just eating red meat because that reduce that's going to be the best thing to do to reduce your antibodies uh and then there's protocols using uh vitamin D most people are low on vitamin D too it's very important hormone so you know uh add in liver for the B12 and vitamin D even some folate in there although B12 um uh you depending on who you talk to um there's people that think that it's really not about the folate it's just about the B12 as long as you have enough B12 folate isn't as much of an issue um and but then vitamin D all these things exist in in abundance in liver so you know just you hit cover all your bases with that um even take a B12 shot if you're if you're below that critical level I mean just don't mess around just get it get a shot get it taken care of and um and you know you might have a nutritional deficiency or an absorption issue you may have a pernicious anemia where you're just not going to be able to absorb B12 properly you need to find that out need to make sure that you're either through an injection or under the tongue supplement uh getting enough B12 if you're not able to absorb it properly and of course B12 doesn't exist in plants or fungus so you need to get it from meat um in your diet good luck with that um those are the main take-home points though um I have a a lady that I interviewed uh who did recover from Ms very severe case of Ms um Dr Sarah and it's sort of the episode called from wheelchair to walking she actually was wheelchair bound and in her early 30s she was basically dying and six months later on a carnivore diet on a lion diet with high does vitamin D she was not only out of her wheelchair but she was back doing ballet which is amazing and so that's what she did she did high dose vitamin D and a lot of red meat and nothing else uh make sure your B12 is up jump start that with an injection if you need to and then then maintain it and build on that with your diet and make and but check it again because if you have an absorption issue or pernicious anemia which is if you have one autoimmune disease you almost certainly have another autoimmune disease and pricious anemia is an autoimmune disease that attacks a part of your stomach the releases intrinsic factor you have to have intrinsic factor to bind a B12 to absorb that complex without intrinsic factor you don't absorb B12 right so if you've attacked and damaged that part of your stomach that makes intrinsic factor because of this autoimmune disease you know that's just something you need to know about and you need to get in regular injections or under the tongue sublingual supplementation so you can absorb it in another way because you're not going to absorb it through your gut because you know you've got permanent damage there okay so keep that in mind and check everyone should check because this applies to a lot of people the the deficiency side of things and the mountain absorption side of things uh Stephen Wells thank you for the super chat trial neuralgia type two have you heard of anyone with this condition being cured by this diet so it uh can certainly improve I have seen people improve dramatically um so it's there are different different causes and there's there's different sorts of um there there's different sorts of ideologies for trigeminal neuralgia um but either way whatever is inflaming that trigeminal nerve uh can be relaxed and calmed and the uh inflammation can go down and that can reduce the signal up that nerve and get applying that pain response um so yes Can it can definitely help um it depends you I mean sometimes you get you get like an aberant vessel that can sort of like move and shift around in your brain and sort of like press on the trial nerve and every time it beats it just just hits that trial nerve and you go pain pain pain pain pain and so sometimes you need surgery you need to go in there and just put a little Teflon pad in between the the um the artery and the nerve and then that can um that can just sort of block that off but yes it can um uh it can reduce the inflammation it can reduce the the pain sensation just like it does with a lot of other neurological pain um pathologies um if you've got something pushing on that nerve though is that going to reduce it all the way hard to say um you just have to see but it it almost certainly will reduce the pain if you're just getting rid of all this other inflammation because that inflammation increases the pain expression and so whatever pain you have in your body is going to be worse because of the things that you eat and so if you just cut all those things out then then that will almost always reduce the pain but keep in mind there can be physical reasons why that could that pain could be there Sue W thank you for the Super Chat can Venus stasis and autoimmune neuropathy the heel on Carnivore 3 months in having oxalate dumping lots of pain suggestions um autoimmune yes absolutely I mean you're damaging the nerves if the nerves are damaged then they could be permanently damaged and and that pain can still be there but it it should reduce the amount of pain that you have by reducing the inflammation the expression of that pain getting your ketones up by eating a lot of fat that can further reduce and suppress inflammation because High ketones directly suppress inflammation as well um oxalate dumping can cause pain oxalate dumping can cause nerve pain cause joint pain can cause headaches and other sorts of things as well so you might have to sort of get through that if it's too much of a bother um you can try Sally Norton's Protocols of having a very low amount of oxalates like a bit of lemon in your water or a bit of you know weak tea where you will have just a bit of oxalates you know less than 100 milligrams a day you can look these up and how much these things have um you know but 50 to 100 milligrams tops and uh per day and then that can sort of suppress the oxalate dumping if that's actually indeed what's happening it's hard to test for that we don't we don't have a test to show that you're oxalate dumping it's just sort of um it's a clinical diagnosis sort of things you know and um so but it can help these sorts of things Venus stasis depends on what's causing that U but it can help with a lot of issues with circulation certainly help with autoimmunity then the neuropathy and the Damage that's happened from that have to see how much of that heals but you at least give your body a chance to heal um and then keep that in mind for the oxalate dumping um hopefully things have gotten better though hopefully the pain even though it's severe is at least better than it was before you you switch to this way of eating hopefully there are other benefits as well focus on those good things and that can help you you know weather things until your body heals enough and gets the rest of the problems out as much as they can so good luck with that I hope it gets better soon Jason warley thank you for the Super Chat how about healing neurological disorders for example um adreno lucco disc trophia with spasticity and buildup of long chain fatty acids in the uh in the body symptoms um very good question uh neurological disorders in general can be helped I mean we have studies showing that um high-fat meat-based ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet because remember ketogenic diets are all animal-based high fat animal-based diets and a cornival diet is a high fat animal based ketogenic diet so anything any studies that talking about the um benefits of a ketogenic diet apply to a coral diet that is ketogenic so you're not having fruit or honey or those sorts or a lot of milk things like that so uh I don't know specifically for that I haven't really seen that uh I have seen I have seen pretty remarkable things with people that have had old Strokes or even spinal cord um severe spinal cord damage and and paraplegia or quadriplegia withs spasticity or cerebral poy withp icity improve their SP spasticity improve some of their neurological findings it's absolutely incredible so how much of that don't know but um it can um uh it can uh it can seriously um improve a lot of these sorts of things so it just depends um a lot of these sort sort of issues they they've caused damage to the body damage to the neur U the neurological system and it's just a matter of you know how how much healing the body can do and so it's um it just sort of one of those things that you just have to sort of wait and see um but a lot of things yeah it it does help with a lot of a lot of neurological issues absolutely I mean look at look at my interview with Dave Mack he he improved his symptoms from a stroke from a 30y old stroke after two months on a carnivore diet right he' done keto and ains before that it didn't didn't change anything just going car or two months he was walking normally and didn't have as much weakness nearly as much weakness it was just sort of normal wasn't quite as strong as the left side um but it was you know right right sided weakness previously but he um is basically functioning normal now excuse me and um and so you know that that's remarkable so we don't know everything that it can do but we're still learning and uh definitely it can heal a lot of U neurological issues so it'll at least put you in a position that your body can heal from as much of it as it can and hopefully stop it from getting worse uh Robbie Waller thank you for the Super Chat my sister's 46 was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's Jesus I mean what this was this never existed even in the elderly population we're saying no no no it's totally normal blah blah blah explaining in 46 year olds then these these people piss me off by by dismissing this oh yeah yeah just happens no it damn well doesn't it's not supposed to and uh you know now now we getting people in their 40s getting Alzheimer's this is just infuriating to me and um I normally swear a lot so I hope you people realize just how much self-control that I exert in these videos because I normally swear a lot I have rugby players on my team that be like you know chaffy can you just tone down the the swearing a bit I mean that's like having a long shoran telling you you swear too much so I hope you guys appreciate that because um normally I'd be there'd be a lot of expletives involved in in reading something like this um however she chose to do the Mediterranean diet what are your thoughts or recommendations well look I mean she's making conscious decisions to improve her her diet and and make a you know positive impact on her health so that's already great and so you know doing a Mediterranean diet as long as she's doing I mean look at the sardinians like they eat almost essentially all meat with a bit of olives and tomatoes and that's it um look at my video on the blue zones with um um Dr Bill Schindler he did a research trip out to Sardinia to the epicenter of the first Blue Zone he actually saw no they're not plant-based they're not vegetarian they don't eat we meat once a week they eat meat all day every day with a lot of dairy and um uh so you know that's just a flat out line by Dan Butner he's a li I'll say that publicly he's a liar um please try to sue me I'll sue you back you're a liar you made this up um you know because he went there and and Bill Schindler talked spoke to the same people that that Butner spoke to and they said why does everyone say we're vegetarian what the hell where the hell did they get that from we meet every day so he's a liar and um and he's a sday Adventist he's got a he's got a ideological bone to pick with uh the way Everybody Eats um the sth Day Adventist Church bought the Blue Zone rights for like something like $68 million uh this is a con these are liars and con artists and they are they are doing things that hurt people and so that bothers me um so she's doing a real Mediterranean diet you know the way that sardinians actually eat great um but look the main thing is she she's making a conscious effort to improve her health likelihood is she's going to be cutting out a bunch of processed foods and garbage uh seed oils and sugars and fine carbs so that's already really good um if you can get her to go ketogenic that's even better I have videos on Alzheimer's um dementia and living to past 120 I think it's called and where I talk about this there there are studies again these these studies with ketogenic diets there are thousands of high level randomized control trials in ketogenic diets showing specific with specific Health outcomes showing Improvement um a high fat meat-based ketogenic diet like the real Mediterranean diet the sardinians that has been shown to be a better treatment for Alzheimer's than every medication ever trial right so you really want to get rid of the carbs so eat meat eat fatty meat the brain is made out of fat and so it's made out of cholesterol as well right and we're we're we're working as hard as we can to lower our cholesterol and your brain is made out of cholesterol and there are studies showing that people have had and certainly case reports of people that had Alzheimer's and they were on statins statins can cross the bloodb brain barrier and and stop your brain from making the cholesterol that it uses to build your brain right are we insane right that doesn't get into your bloodstream that doesn't cross the blood brain barrier back the other way it's just being used for the for the building materials of your brain most likely may be mechanisms they can cross back and forth but it makes it in your brain so your brain can use it in your brain for your brain and we're giving drugs that reduce that stop your brain from being able to make cholesterol which is how you myelinate your axons and your nerves and so you can get brain shrinkage you can get damage and you can get insulin resistance so glucose can't can't feed the brain properly and you see this on pet scans where the glucose is is reduced the signal is reduced in the cortex of the brain with people with Alzheimer's so you go into ketosis is ketones don't have that problem brain brain wakes up right and then those ketones can actually reform into fatty acids which can then be used to rebuild the structures of the brain the cholesterol can rebuild the structures of the brain as well it needs to has to be there and so there's these these in the published literature they found these people that had Alzheimer's on these statins They removed the statins six weeks later wouldn't you know they didn't have Alzheimer's anymore put them back on the statins funny enough they got Alzheimer's again isn't that funny you know it's almost as if they're related so um sorry for the bit of the rant but I mean this is this is that doesn't need that should never have happened to your sister that should this should not be something that we're dealing with at all no one should have to deal with this right now we have been tricked and koled and fooled into eating things that are horrible for us because we think they're good for us and it is causing serious disease and harm and it never existed in any in any real form in humans before you know 100 years ago 120 years ago this is this is a man-made disease and it is devastating so uh but thing is is if we're causing it we can also undo the cause and uh and hopefully um you can get a lot of improvement from your sister and I would expect she will get a lot of improvement if she's able to go high fat keto even if it's not full of carnivore just get rid of the carbs add in meat and fat and um you know keep cholesterol in the brain because the brain needs cholesterol okay good luck with that good luck to her and uh Dan Butter's a liar dark sky thank you for the Super Chat uh could caffeine make autoimmune diseas is worse H potentially um it is a neurotoxin it's an insecticide the plants makes it to to fry the brains of insects they're trying to eat it so it's not it's not there to help you it is there to hurt you and it if you like the effects that's that's a um you know that's that's not the original intention so um uh you know to see how you go I mean I if with any autoimmune disease I would just cut out absolutely everything from Plants I would cut out everything except red meat really um I would I wouldn't be surprised if caffeine did but I don't know specifically if it does one way or the other you could always try caffeine coffee will coffee definitely will tea definitely will make autoimmune diseases worse but if you take just a caffeine pill maybe you can you can try it out and see for yourself but I would just sort of avoid it on principle really uh Pete thank you very much for the super chat um hi Dr chaffy I I lost something so maybe there's something else here Pete okay so I think I think I we may have lost some of your of your message um but saying uh life's otherwise good I do line diet oh mad 99% with occasional cheese and cream only one socializing how do I stop the weight or belly fat gain thank you for all that you do is there another one here um not that I'm seeing so sorry Pete I'm not seeing your other part of that question um but sounds like you're doing good doing line diet um occasional cheese and cream fair enough um um and saying you sort of building up belly fat or maybe not losing it as much it's hard to know um but it looks like stop belly fat uh and weight gain um so you need to address things like sleep and stress those are major ones especially with the belly um you know the the intraabdominal fat is is is very sensitive to cortisol so you you raise your cortisol because you're stressed out because you're not sleeping well um you're you're going to not only retain belly fat but you're going to grow your belly fat and so you need to you need to address that as well um if you if you get four to five hours on average of sleep a night for for a week seven days you'll actually give yourself diabetes right so not good because of how how much that cortisol affects you stress will do that too if you average seven to eight hours of sleep for the next seven days you can reverse that so really optimize and prioritize your sleep and try to prioritize your and optimize your stress levels and de-stressing as well very important things stress is stress you know we we all sort of face it but you have to try to do things that just make you happy and d-stress every day and try to get yourself into a situation that's that's more conducive to your your stress levels and mental health being being benefit uh of that so um and then just give it time you know there are reasons hormonally and otherwise that that could be a problem if you're medications that can also be a problem um occasional Dairy you know uh probably not that big of a deal but you know you're just get rid of everything and you're going to be better off and um uh exercise as well lifting weights uh doing sprints if you can even on on a stationary bicycle that can be very very beneficial and I it can stimulate fat loss and especially belly fat loss um chronic CIO the other way around that can actually raise your cortisol so you're doing like just long-term stuff on the treadmill or going for long jogs or whatever that can actually raise your cortisol and make it and make this H fat loss a bit more stubborn sprinting does the opposite just melts away belly fat and intraabdominal fat in particular so that's what I would do I'd add in those sorts of exercises the resistance training the anerobic training uh and high intensity really try to work you know work yourself uh as very hard with th you know safety uh a reasonable uh amount so that you're not hurting yourself but um you know challenge yourself make yourself work really hard and you'll get there just keep going with it and cut out everything all artificial sweeteners everything like that sounds like you are but just some of these things sneak in you know Stevia monk fruit sugar even things like on the electrolytes that people supplement with they they have artificial sweeteners in a lot of them so just don't take those ones and um and uh just keep going with it you'll do fine again some people just take a bit longer because of their hormones and other sorts of reasons to lose weight but you'll get there just optimize all those things and keep going you'll do great superfluity of naughtiness whatever that means so uh thank you for the Super Chat can you give a refresher on the efficacy of alleged health benefits of fiber both soluble ins soluble uh many say the carnivore purifies food in your gut yeah so the thing is is that um it can't purify in your gut if it doesn't get to your lower gut right because you're absorbing 98 to 99 to even 100% of the meat that you're eating if you cut out the gristle of the of the meat and you just eat the fat soft fat and the soft muscle none of it none of it's getting down to your lower intestine and to where the bacteria are in the first place right um so uh can't purify what does purify is the fiber because you can't break down fiber you can't absorb fiber it has to go out the other end so it necessarily has to go to your lower intestine because it's a one-way one-way tube and um and that's where the Fiber goes and then the bacteria work on it and purifies it and and um you know and that that's what that's what's getting putrified now if you're eating fiber and you're eating food and plants that have antinutrients that block the absorption and digestion of meat okay yeah then that can get down to your lower intestine and then the bacteria can work on that but that's the plan fault that's fiber's fault fiber causes that it doesn't help that um meat you absorb all of it nearly um and as long as you're not eating it with fiber and other antinutrients that that delay or block absorption um so yeah and um uh but yeah fiber you don't need it you don't want it no animal on Earth Eats fiber unless they can break it down and get something out of it we can't 70% of all animal species are carnivores none of them eat fiber in order to be able to defecate or for any other health benefits it's not necessary it it can cause harm And Delay up to 30% absorption of the food you're eating if you're eating High to Octane crap then that might be good you know you're going to absorb less carbs you're going to absorb less sugar you're going to absorb less other other garbage because it's a physical barrier and disrupts your absorption that's not good if you're eating things that are just good for you right so um yeah so that's a short answer I have a video on fiber constipation and diet that people can watch also Zoe haram's um video um what about fiber uh is excellent as is uh Dr Paul Mason's um video from fiber to the microbiome it's excellent they're both excellent and they and they don't even they have they have they're both very complimentary to each other they don't just say the same things all all all three of those don't say the same things uh they're all looking at it from slightly different angles and talking about it in different ways uh mine's more practical on how to you know avoid constipation and all that sort of stuff on carnivore eat more fat and um and how you don't have to have fiber and all these other sorts of things but those are excellent Zoe harkham and Paul Mason's especially they're fantastic so I would watch those Richard Bishop thank you for the Super Chat is a carnivore diet safe for an older person who has damaged liver from Advil and Ty uh thank you for being so generous with your time oh 100% And it first of all get the hell off those things um second of all you know this can reduce your pain so you don't need to take those things anymore um Advil tends to damage the kidneys Tylenol tends to damage the will damage the liver uh the combination will really damage your kidneys so you never want to take those together for more than five days in a row ever and um uh but your body can heal from a lot of these things um if you have therosis and Perman damage that's permanent but the rest of the liver um and the kidneys that are that are not permanently damaged can can certainly heal and get better and uh yes it's actually most important for people that are that are having health issues because you just don't have as much of a threshold to get um to uh to fix yourself um you know so you have to be be very careful with that so yes you know optimal diet um is is important and so hello ell Melly and she says that hugs help reduce stress as well that's a very good point and U yeah it was someone that was saying that the other day that we watch it like a 20 second hug uh releases oxytocin a sixc or longer kiss um red sends out oxytocin and um presumably helps stress levels as well so that's uh that's nice too and um and and she sent a very nice super sticker you don't have to keep doing that that's very nice of you uh very very sweet of you thank you it's nice to see you um okay uh Steve 573 V3 um thank you for the super chat some say Dr chaffy is making stuff up by saying brussels sprouts have 130 plus known human carcinogens what are their sources yeah that's just from my my class in um cancer biology so that was that was direct from the professor of cancer biology and and I say that and I preface that in everything I say like this is what we were taught in that in that class in cancer biology um so that's that's the source or take it take it or leave it um you know there are there are ways to find this out it's super hard it's just it's just drenched in the you know and and buried in the literature in a lot of places you can see like the Bruce AES uh paper they found 42 different toxins um 20 of which were shown to be carcinogenic so I mean this is a fact you know they do have carcinogens in them you look on the who website they flat out say these different plant toxins can be mutagenic carcinogenic lethal and uh and these are in the foods that we eat and so we have to be careful about that um so it's not me making that up the 136 specific um carcinogens that was from my class in cancer biology um so you know take it or leave it but you know there are other places that that do enumerate out different sorts of things um and that's just but I always I always preface that you know by saying this is what was taught to me in class you say the same thing you know you learned something in anthropology class and this and that and whatever um you know that's just what uh you know people learn things in school and I learned that in school so that's that's my was the source was my professor of cancer biology at the University of Washington in Seattle in the early 2000s and so there may be even more than 136 identifi now um but you know a lot of a lot of books on botony and biology they they they cover this sort of stuff you know so you can take a look at that as well uh Jill kitchen thank you for the Super Chat question I am only five feet tall but have a significant amount of weight to lose do I need to pay attention to calories no weight loss yet so I'm been worried um no I I don't think so I think you just need to just focus on just pure meat and water you need the fat you know you don't want to if you're chronically undereating your body's going to actually lower your metabolism check your leptin check your fasting insulin check these sorts of things you're your metabolism can be pretty botched up and that can make you very difficult and slow to lose weight uh check your thyroid as well there are reasons that these this can happen slowly a lot of people um uh will lose weight right away not everybody does so just just be mindful of that it's a process you focus on your health first uh watched my interview with Kelly watch a lot of interviews with Kelly Hogan she had this too she didn't she she gained weight for six months but her health was improving she felt better and then her weight started coming off so it does take time for some people um and watch watch Kelly Hogan stuff for that she did a video with Charles Washington about people that are slow to lose weight and they talked about that on her channel so take a look at that as well low carblow drama thank you very much for the generous Super Chat I appreciate it uh hi Dr chaffy what's the best diet for a one-year-old uh nutrient requirements Etc thank you for all you do well it's the same nutrient requirements for the rest of us mammals drink their mother's milk and then they're weaned onto their mother's diet and they eat that diet for the rest of their life and then they wean their children onto that diet as well for us that's fatty meat so you can start off by by giving them just the the meat juices from like a roast or a steak or something like that give little spoonfuls of that you'll see their eyes go oh that's good because it wants those nutrients a lot of iron and he and a lot of other really good nutrients in there that they'll that they'll want and they'll that they'll desire so fatty red meat that's that's what they should eat you know um there's different there's different um discussions on how to do that whether you give them a a much bigger piece than uh they could ever choke on and so they're just sort of gnawing things off they've got a couple teeth they're just going to be able to scrape off just a bit of that meat that's enough that's appropriate for them and they can eat that that's going to help their jaw work and their teeth form and their and their jaws form as well and that's going to be better for their facial structural development their jaw development their teeth development as well and certainly get the nutrients you want so fatty meat same thing that we all need is just fatty meat um and you can sort of you know puree it if you want but you know they need to chew you know that chewing action helps uh develop the jaw and the pallet as well and they'll have much stronger much broader Airways they won't have um all the breathing issues that that we have as a Mainstay now to get that so it's the same stuff so same thing that you eat you know they can eat too and they're they're much more sensitive you try to give them a piece of broccoli they will just they will just just be horrified and so uh don't just give them give them something that um is good for them you know fatty meat and they need a lot of fat and the meat as well because they their brains are growing they need to be in ketosis because your brain grows optimally in ketosis because of the ketones are better for your brain they also reconstitute into fatty acids help grow your brain fetuses are in ketosis nursing babies are in ketosis even though there's lactose and so it's only when we dump in a bunch of sugary crap when they they or formula or baby food that they kick out of ketosis and they're eating super soft mushy crap their jaw don't develop their their teeth Don't develop properly their airways don't develop properly it's really bad for them so um don't do that that and um they'll do great Jules Anders Anderson thank you very much for the super chat um fasting A1C is 5.3 glucose 4.9 insulin is 10 deficient vitamin C dizzy in in the morning causing cortisol Rush will vitamin C supplement help insulin cortisol and sleep uh beef lamb butter eggs and water thank you for being a great teacher uh you know my vitamin C was was undetectable and I don't have scurvy so the amount of vitamin C that you need is radically reduced uh when you're on a cardor diet and you won't get scurvy because you scurvy is a mdev of collagen and so it's um it it's it's required when you don't have the appropriate building blocks for collagen you need to make them denovo you need to make them from scratch by hydrolyzing Proline and lysine and so vitamin C is necessary to hydrolyze Proline and lysine you get the prehydrolyzed forms when you eat meat it's just when you're eating plants that you need that you need um and you're not getting enough from the meat that you need uh vitamin C to make that stuff so um you don't need that now caveat being with my vitamin C being undetectable is that I was drinking milk for like three days leading up to the test and um carbohydrates even in from lactose will block that out and will block out the absorption of vitamin C um so uh you know there is Vitamin C in meat there's actually more vitamin C in a gram of in per gram of liver than there is per gram of apples right so there's plenty of vitamin C you don't need it if you want to take some vitamin C I wouldn't take too much you know like you know 500 milligrams Max a day you just don't need as much um I don't think that it's going to necessarily change much to do with your cortisol or anything else but if you want to try it and you want to see if it makes you feel better you know go for it it's um as long as you're not taking too much you know excessive vitamin C actually turns into oxalates in your body and you can actually get oxalate problems so just be mindful of that as well Westfield uh thank you very much for the super sticker I appreciate that uh low carb low drama thank you for the Super Chat watching your live Q&A on my iPad while walking around Singapore Airport earlier this week was exhilarating thank you for making it possible well thank you very much I appreciate that and that's and that's fun um that you're you're well that people are even care what I have to say um and that they're finding it useful and helpful so thank you very much for that Jason warley thank you very much for the the very generous Super Chat I appreciate that what are your thoughts on Carnivore healing uh xald um adrenal lucco um distopia with symptoms such as spasticity low cortisol and very longchain fatty acid buildup too high of fat like 80% makes me dizzy um so I think is going back to the other one just just remember everybody that there is a bit of a delay between when I uh get a question and when I can answer a question um because it takes me longer to answer the question than it takes people to write them and so there's a there's a backlog but I I do I do get to all the super chats especially I try to do the other ones too um so I I I sort of answered this before but ALS Al just to add on to that um you know if you are if if you're getting a certain amount of fat and that's making you dizzy or giving you some sort of symptoms you just don't eat that much that's fine generally eating more fat than your body can absorb you just excrete it and you can get diarrhea it usually doesn't affect you physically otherwise except for the the loose stools um so that's interesting that that it makes you dizzy that's that's that's something I haven't heard of before generally you just physically can't absorb it so it's not going to get in your body unless you're takeing things like ox bile and then you'll force it to go in your body so don't do that um just eat the amount of fat that's right for your body so eat the amount of fat that that gets you uh soft stools but not loose stools and um and enough uh meat as well uh being any sort of state of ketosis and carnivore can actually um optimize your cortisol as well as your other hormones so people with metabolic syndrome actually tend to have low cortisol too low of cortisol and that in Reverse by putting people on a carnivore diet ketogenic diet because that reverses the metabolic syndrome and their cortisol comes up slightly but then people say oh my God it's coming up too hot no no no it comes up but it doesn't come up to Cushings Disease levels it comes up to normal physiological levels and so and then it stays there it doesn't just keep keep keep keep going up so it can help with that um could potentially help with the spasticity as well um as I mentioned with people with stroke and and all that that um and then we have a couple super stickers from osal very very nice of you thank you very much for that and Nick Johnson uh who's uh very kind to to send a super sticker as well um and um so I think I I just then of course my little Ellie Melly uh who sent a very nice super sticker thank you very very much for that um all right everyone I think I have to stop there um that that's all the super chat so I'm I'm glad I got through all those but it's 11:15 and I um was supposed to stop at 11: so um I need to I need to hop off um and get to my appointment and get to work and um and then I've got a a seminar actually tomorrow here in Perth where I'm giving another talk we're having a new uh intake for patients a new patient intake seminar uh tomorrow so for people going to that I will see you there and um uh otherwise I will see you all next week for my premiere of the new episode on Sunday Monday Sunday in America Monday here and then the uh the next live which will be my Wednesday uh America's Tuesday so thank you all very much thank you very much Al for for watching as usual thank you very much um Melissa and Rick and dar and all the other mods for helping out it's always uh great to have you guys uh help out and certainly better than it was before when um there's a bit of chaos and weirdness on on the chats and we didn't have mods uh so thank you very much it's very very nice of you to help out I really appreciate you all and uh big round of applause for the moderators thank you so thank you very much um we'll see you again soon I'm also releasing another video tomorrow with my friend uh Tyler from the the be uh the Rond City Roundup s the beef beef Roundup in Wyoming that I went to last year which was awesome I had a great time there and just just Wyoming was gorgeous so people you know this is where Yellowstone is this is where the Tetons are it's absolutely stunning country you know it's it's a very large state in America and it has like 300,000 people it's I think it's like the third largest state something something massive it's a big state and it's uh it's it's one of the least populous so it is just gorgeous pristine Wilderness and and uh so ell and I went there last year we're going again this year in end of August it's like August 24th I think is the is the weekend it's amazing and so they're trying to make it like a big carnivore event and um so and and they've sort of they're actually officially renaming their town uh they're not renaming it but they're so their Town motto is going to be officially set as the most carnivore friendly city in the world which is kind of cool so that's Riverton Wyoming that's going to be so I was staying more towards we were staying more towards the Tetons and the national parks by um sort of like an hour or so outside of of Jackson Hole uh which cool little town and that's like sort of an hour or two uh sort of yeah probably around two hours to Riverton um so we sort of drove over there stayed there for a bit and then went back and stayed out by the uh the national parks and then then drove around and and just saw a lot of really cool stuff in the national parks which was really really amazing so if people want to go to that it's fantastic go to um beef roundup.com and um I think that the website's being built but you know just you know we'll we'll talk about it more um in that that that video is going to be released tomorrow um and Roslin stop talking and go be late for your appointment I'll be fine thank you uh but thank you good to see you rosin that's my sister for people that don't know it's very very sweet sister very nice sister so thank you I appreciate it um but yes so that'll come out tomorrow and people can check that out um but it'll be a lot of fun and people like Dr sha omara courtley Luna um Jake from lifik Jake and my friend Simon Lewis who does the how-to carnivore with me um and Dr Lisa Weidman who's been you know carnivore opthalmologist for 15 years or so and um she'll be there as well and I'll be having her on my podcast too I was just on hers and I'll have her on as well she's great so um yeah so it'll be a lot of fun and um and they're trying to make it like a big carnivore event every year and it's worth going uh because it's um it's awesome part of the country and Roslin if you're still here talk to Mom and Dad about this tried to get them out last year and it was a sort of a bit to last minute but uh maybe we can fly them out there and and have and go for a a um I drive through Yellowstone because that's that's always fun that's something that that my my parents have wanted to do okay thank you all very much it's been a pleasure uh love you all see you later"
