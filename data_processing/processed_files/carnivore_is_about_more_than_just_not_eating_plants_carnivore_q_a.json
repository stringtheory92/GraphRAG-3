        "body": "a lot of people have different meanings when when they say carnivore right they'll just when you're eating carnivore they just mean they're going to eat a lot more meat and they'll eat less plants but they're still drinking coffee still using artificial sweeteners still doing X Y and Z and and whatever but the main thing is that um you know the whole point of of a carnivore diet is you're eliminating out all these different you know plants and artificial sweeteners and sugars and all that sort of other garbage and you're giving your body what you need which is Daddy meat the lime diet is just red meat basically someone asked about the um blood type diet what's a take on consuming blood is a significant part of the animal rich in nutrients is it beneficial is it safe should we consume it uh to waste less of the animal so I think I think eating blood is is not a bad idea at all there's plenty of people that do it uh like the MSI uh that's that's what they subsist on and um you know like the Mongols Mongol hord and even like people you know currently living there now they they drink blood all the time horse blood Mar's blood cow's blood things like that so there's tons of nutrients it's very very healthy uh depends on your Source obviously you can get these things that are contaminated and um and that can be a problem so you know you don't want to um you know just uh you know get it from any Source but if you're getting it from a butcher you're getting it from you know a proper Source it should be fine and uh but yeah know it's very very healthy blood is very very healthy I don't think you have to have it but I think it if you do have it I think it's it's a perfectly fine addition um so we have a few questions that were sent in so probably going to start with those and then people can um also uh tune in and and say sort of different things that they want to talk about as well um but we'll do these first so these were sent in by um by the the people who are in my patreon group and so thank you to all those who who submitted those questions um so from KES uh they say I am scheduled to have an acoustic neuroma removed next month do you have any advice for steps to take before surgery and then in hospital and posttop I'm not sure how to make uh my wishes for no sugar limited Pharma taken seriously so well I mean just in general for any surgery you just need to be as healthy as you can and um and let your body be in a very very good state so that you can heal properly uh from the surgery obviously it's very big surgery acoustic neuroma is a big tumor um in the back of the head that uh well can be big it can be small but but quite often these things get get to be quite big and then we have to we have to remove them and so you need to just be in you know good physical health and obviously diet and exercise is a very good important part of that um as far as convincing um as uh as far as far as convincing the hospital not to feed you you know highly processed sugary carbs that's that's going to be a fight and a struggle that's just all that they have you can try and say that you have allergies you say look I really can't eat anything just I mean I can eat like meat and eggs but you know I really don't trust anything else I can't I can't eat anything else so just uh you know be mindful of that and so um that's really the best way to do it and then otherwise uh you can just sort of pick through the stuff that you want to eat and and throw away the stuff that you don't want and then have your friends family bring in actual real food which is what you probably will have to do um because the hospital is just the food there is just appalling it's just appalling you know when when you're considering these are the people that are sickest and need the most help they're giving them the absolute worst garbage and uh it's paing so um so that's what I would do um so next question is from mateline uh she says I found out that I am deficient in magnesium and calcium so I'm wondering how to get more of those in my diet um especially calcium seems to be a bit tricky and I can have high histamine foods like sardines or Ag and I can't have high high histamine sardine uh hamine foods like sardines or age cheese uh any suggestions well there's other Dairy that you are able to take uh that doesn't give you that reaction you can try those you can try just calcium supplement if you want um any bone broth things like that that's going to have a ton of calcium in it and um magnesium generally it's quite rare for people to be deficient in magnesium on a carnivore diet I don't know how long you've been on a carnivore diet U that usually normals normalizes but if you take like a supplement just a tablet like if that's the thing like if if if you are a deficient like actually diagnosed deficient for any reason um you know then then it's not actually a bad idea to supplement or take something you know most people won't be most people will just get everything that they need but you know there are a number of different reasons why someone might be a bit deficient in something um but you know it's it doesn't really matter at the end of the day if you are deficient you should probably just take something for that so taking a bit of a supplement is is not that big of a deal uh it's generally going to be probably shortterm and then you're going to be um you know able to just maintain every with a carnivore diet you know may just be that you're just at a deficiency you know from previous uh diets and that you need to catch up and having some supplements and that that's fine that's fine to do that um someone asked about how to deal with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease uh that's basically caused by uh fructose and uh and excess carbs so uh just cut out the carbs cut out the sugar and uh and that should just sort itself out um and someone said do I eat fast or do I train fasted yes I absolutely do train fasted I always feel much better when I train fasted um and so I just that's just me that I just always feel better that way um you know when you're when you're eating you're you're pulling a lot of blood to your digestive tract which takes a lot of blood takes a lot of energy to to run your digestion and so you're taking that muscle that that blood away from every everywhere else and so you know you go into like a rest and digest mode where you want to like just hunker down and and conserve energy and so you're not going to have as much energy for for working out and that's um you know that's that's physiologically what's happening but also just that's what I experienc that's what I've always experienced and I think a lot of people are the same a lot of the uh you know top athletes that I've I've trained with and played with they've always um agreed with me they've always they've always done much better uh on an empty stomach there was a lot of I wasn't the only one who refused to eat the day of a game like I never I never eat before a game even the whole day even if it was like a night game it was like 7 o'clock that night I would not I would not eat the whole day or a tournament we're playing the whole time you know I would never do that so um that's uh that's how I felt um better and Douglas thank you very much for the"

        "body": "felt um better and Douglas thank you very much for the felt um better and Douglas thank you very much for the Super Chat that's awesome thank you buddy appreciate it um okay so and then uh so back to the question so mateline asks how bad is farmed salmon farmed salmon is not great um still meat but you know that farm salmon generally they give them like like you know grain pellets so it's it's just like it's just like grain-fed beef so they actually you're reducing the amount of Omega-3s that they're getting so now you have fish that's normally very high in Omega-3s now they're getting a lot more Omega sixes than Omega-3s still not as much as you know like seed oils and and and all that but it's uh it's not great and so you don't want to eat farmed salmon if you if you can avoid it it's just you know sometimes it's just whatever is available you know any port in a storm but um yeah it's uh it's problematic because they just feed the the anima ls The Wrong Stuff uh Mike thank you very much for the"

        "body": "ls The Wrong Stuff uh Mike thank you very much for the ls The Wrong Stuff uh Mike thank you very much for the Super Chat that's very kind of you um so he asks uh what about cardio I weight train regularly I eat carnivore late 20s is there a benefit to doing um example 70 to 80% max heart rate cardio 75 minutes a week is that good for the heart yeah it' be fine you know you you'll get your heart rate pumping um doing Anor robic activity as well um you'll also exert more energy and and and and stimulate growth hormone and testosterone production in uh in men especially and so that that's something good I cardio as as far as just like just running for extended periods of time uh at nauseum that was never that was never my thing um I was always um I always liked like explosive sort of training and so I train for what I was doing so it depends on what you're doing um if you just want to be fit and uh and look good and just you know just lift weights that that's more than enough maybe you know warm up on the exercise bike or something like that and then hit it but um that's really all you need to do is the weights uh and you'll look good you'll feel good uh for me I you know I I was training for sport I was training for rugby and things like that so I was I I wanted explosion I wanted to be very explosive on on the field and on my feet and so I wanted I did Sprints I did a lot of Sprints and Hill work and Hill and um uh stair Sprints things like that a lot of plyometric sort of things so I had that explosive power and um and then trained in sort of game specific drills that would uh you know train my body and get that muscle memory going so I could you know I could you know blast people at at at high speed when the time came with sort of just instinctually um so it depends on what you're training for I like hard Sprints I like I like feeling Dynamic I like being able to you know be able to have that feeling that I could just go and you know just Sprint you know for however long half marathon or something like that and just like get away from trouble or you know Chase down an elk or something like that or a fly half and um and I like that I like feeling uh that Mobility I like feeling fit it's it's a good feeling um so I like cardio for that but I don't just like just running forever I like like wind Sprints and um you know dynamic explosive sort of work so that's the kind of stuff that I do um but again it depends on what you're what you're training for what you're going for hope that answers that um so okay so Mikey followed up so really lifting and being in shape with carnivore is sufficient I'm not uh it's not bad to ignore cardio due to no not at all no you don't need to do that but again if if you're just if you're just going for health and um you know physique then yeah just just lifting weights is fine um I don't think you're missing out on anything by not running at nauseum there's there's a lot of people like um you know Dr John jaquish who would argue that actually you're probably uh you know hurting not hurting yourself but you know it's a detriment um to go do extended cardio because you'll end up increasing cortisol and suppressing test testosterone and um testosterone and um and growth hormones so you'll sort of do the opposite of what weights will do um and so that can sort of you know stall your games and things like that um but yeah I I don't think I mean at the moment I'm basically only doing weights you know might I might I do a bit more on the on the stationary bike now because I'm rehabbing my knee after getting it scoped but uh but that's it okay mik GL glad you like that that's good um all right so another question that we had submitted was from Jason um what do you do to fight cold or chest cold or sickness in general uh do you have personal tips and tricks for a carnivore quick recovery such as food you recommend or hydration uh with bone broth um I I still listen to my body on this I still will will um you know if I if I sort of lose my appetite I'll just sort of Let it go I'm not going to change anything I'm not going to eat anything besides meat but I might do some broth I'll drink more water I generally focus on um hydration but you know I really haven't been sick in years you know um I had I got covid and that was I was sort of down for a day and just sort of slept the whole time and then after that I felt better but I was just very tired and uh and I just didn't have an an appetite so I just basically didn't didn't eat much for about a week and I lost probably like 10 pounds you know which was wasn't good I mean I didn't have like 10 pounds to lose but um you know came back you know after you you uh sort of get your your um appetite back so I think the main thing is just just listening to your body if your body's telling you to to to not eat then then don't eat you know just take it easy get some fluids in you and um you know if it's going on it's a prolonged thing and you're sort of getting emaciated well then you just you just need to you need to you need to eat something but uh generally it's okay to fast generally it's okay to just let your body do its thing and just rest I mean I think the most important thing when you're sick is sleep sleep in water and um and your let your body just get over it um okay so we had a question here as well Dr chaffy I got a got a question I am now two weeks into carnivore and I'm 22 years old I've noticed a big decrease in rep strength and stamina in the gym went from 100 kg time 10 to 100 kg Time 5 is that typical it can be um you're you're it sounds like you're not fat adapted yet and your while your body's running on ketones your body's not used to running on ketones and so it takes a bit of time so um Professor Tim noes has done a ton of of of research on uh Athletics in general and training in in um in ketosis as well and um and they did a study where basically after people got fat adapted they didn't find any difference in their in their exercise um tolerance and output and all that sort of stuff compared to people they were just eating a whole bunch of carbs and taking the energy drinks I don't know if they're doing energy drinks but they were doing a bunch of carbs and then they switched the groups and so they gave them like 42 days to like get fat adapted and just do keto and then they test them again and they were fine everyone was fine U they all they all performed to the same extent and um and so they said they thought it would probably take 402 days for everyone to get fat adapted but they found that actually most people were getting fat adapted at about the 3- we Mark so just keep it up keep keep going with it um make sure you're eating enough as well that's that's one thing that most people find that their hunger signals change dramatically on a carnivore diet and so you have to uh make sure that you're eating enough and I go by taste so if meat tastes good that means you're still hungry you need to keep eating keep eating until meat stops tasting good and you just go like GH really want to eat this anymore try eating a couple times a day as well especially if you're working out a lot you're a young guy you know you're trying to build muscle you're trying to get uh you know get in the gym a lot you need to you need to you're going to need to eat a lot more than other people that are living a sedentary life um and so if you're not getting enough you're not getting enough fat in particular you're not going to have as much energy in the gym you're not going to perform as well um after that it's a matter of getting keto adapted and and and fat adapted which will happen it will happen all on its own you're two weeks into it generally doesn't take more than three weeks for me I didn't I didn't I didn't take any any time at all it was like day one I was better and so um just uh you know just keep it up and uh it you know before too long you you'll notice and just make sure you're eating enough make sure you're resting enough and just uh um give it a bit of time and then you'll be fine hey everyone I hope you're enjoying this replay of my YouTube live if you'd like to catch a live version and ask your own questions please go to the next scheduled one usually every Thursday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time all right see you then and please enjoy the rest of the Q&A okay so uh Liv and large asks started keto 4 months ago 66 years old with a stent and a AAA open repair in 2020 stopped at Staten in February of this year against orders doing great but unsure of my Statin decision lifting five days a week so statins and medications are very particular for particular people so it's very hard on that one sentence or two sentences to to give you very good advice however I can tell you that there are a number of studies that have come out with large number of people tens of thousands um of people that um that that show that there's probably you know little to no benefit from Statin uh especially if you haven't had a cardiovascular event now you have a AAA so that means you have you know you know um you know atherosclerotic sclerotic disease um and so you might be in that camp but at the same time if you're eating as you are and your HDL is high and your triglycerides are low and you're in ketosis um you know there's a paper that just got published um from Professor Ben bman and Dr Paul Mason and I think Dr Diamond basically arguing going through all the literature saying that look if you're in this in this state where your HDL is high your try glycerides are low and you're on a ketogenic diet or or even carnivore diet that statins really aren't aren't going to be um a benefit to you and that your LDL whatever it is is is is fine so that's that's what is out there at the moment so um if that helps you sort of make a decision on what you want to do with your statens [Music] um okay so I think like someone was saying that there was you might be a problem with his with my sound on Instagram but I think there's only one person can people hear me on Instagram hopefully maybe some people just say some yeses or something like that Christ all right well they're not saying anything so I don't know I don't know if they can hear me can you hear me can you hear me no yes okay perfect thank you all right so Matthew asks did I see or listen to Dr Barry's interview with Paul saladino recently and if so are there things that you'd like to say about it I haven't watched it yet um I haven't had the time uh so far but it is something I plan on watching I you know I I I like and respect both of those guys and so and I've I've spoken and met um uh Dr Barry online I haven't met Dr saladino online but I agree with a ton of things that he says um but um it would be very interesting to sort of see that and uh and see what they spoke about and uh yeah and when I when I do I will definitely be happy to to talk about it and give my thoughts on that um also from Matthew when you say that coffee is harmful to our health do you specifically mean the beverage as a whole or is it about the caffeine or maybe even other things uh than the coffee Dr Barry didn't talk about it in the talk with Paul uh but he mentioned multiple times in his own lives with Nisha that people have been trying to prove coffees toxicity for some decades sometimes with a lot of money invested interest in doing so but the research never went anywhere as it really seemed uh seems that the coffee is harmless with the caveat that I suppose all these studies were done on sad eating plants um Plante eating populations I remember Dr Barry even said multiple times that no one had been able to prove that coffee or at least caffeine was toxic for children babies or even impregnant women and that it was not um by lack of trying or lack of resources or bias so he's asking if my opinion is my opinion based on first principles and an abundance of caution or you have specific things resources to point to in regards for coffee yeah so the first one so my uh opinion is just based on the on the on the first principle is that that coffee bean is a seed it seeds the plant's baby this is where you generally find uh the most um you know defense chemicals that are in there and so heating it up roasting these things it's going to denature some of these things but it's not going to get rid to all of them um and so the I mean there's just documented um you know plant defense chemicals that are in coffee beans uh caffeine is one of them uh but it's not just caffeine but caffeine was was uh you know it's an in it's an insecticide you know and it's a neurotoxin and so while we don't get blasted by these things uh like a bugwood um it doesn't doesn't mean that it doesn't have effects on our body and our brain I mean that's that's the effect we're going for is getting us amped up on caffeine and um and so some people like that and that's fine but I've known people uh who've gone carnivore and fixed their seizures and then had a cup of coffee and you know had a seizure so you know that's that's a big trigger for them um uh for for epilepsy so you know it it can affect you you know and and whether that effect is large or small there is an effect and for me I just like you know that whole my body's a temple sort of thing and just don't don't let anything in there don't let the the Riff W in um as far as you know studies and things I you know I I'm sure I would agree with Dr bar I'm sure they're you know I'm sure that he's right in that he's he's he's very well researched in these sorts of things he he takes a lot of time and care to look into things so I'm I'm sure he's right there um there was someone who mentioned there was like someone wrote a book about coffee and it not being great for you but it could be that that's based on um you know uh poor data I don't know I haven't read the book but just for me just thinking about that in that way um is I I'm I'm a bit cautious with it but then when I've tried it and tried adding that back in I have felt worse and where I don't get sore after I work out at all when I drink a cup of coffee I'm sore for two days after working out you know so that so I know that there's something happening there obviously there's something going on in my body there's you know increased you know inflammation pain swelling stiffness uh something that's causing that soreness and stiffness and I don't like that I don't like being sore I like being uh you know just being able to work out like crazy and not have a problem with so for me coffee's out but that doesn't mean that everybody uh has to do that you know if people uh don't mind the effects or even enjoy the effects of of caffeine or just the experience of the coffee you know go for it and if it you know if what's um what's going on making you sore or whatever isn't isn't you know something that you really care that much about then you know go for it um I was I was talking to someone um who uh you know she was great she just had like a you know big workout she was all happy and you know I just like yeah this great workout you know really pushed myself really feel proud about it which was awesome and then um and then she said yeah but I'm I'm still sore you know like four days later from it and so I was like what are you eating you know like well you know just just meet like that's it I like still drinking coffee like yes yeah I'm still drinking coffee so it was like you know it's something that um you know you'll see in other people as well and I think that a lot of people when I speak to them about working out and getting sore and they say like oh yeah no I still get sore after working out they're almost always invariably they will be eating something from the pl Kingdom but it's almost always coffee they'll always almost always have coffee and just tell them like well that's what it's from and uh you know you're not going to you're not going to experience that you know you know that that U phenomenon of not getting sore uh from working out if you're drinking coffee because it will just it has stuff in it that makes you sore so that's it and say all right I'm stopping coffee in 2023 may the Lord help me and everyone around you while you're while you're withdrawing but um no I think I think you feel good I think a lot of people that I've spoken to um a lot of people that I've spoken to that have come off coffee they they've all really U benefited from that and they've all really liked it um so I think that uh it's worth trying anyway you know you just come off with something for a month and just see and just see how you feel and if you're just like yeah I like the coffee more then go back to the coffee it's not a big deal but at least you know at least you now you know so um someone ask you know what kind of whey protein I would go for um for Recovery I you know if you're just eating a carnivore diet you're getting you're getting hundreds of grams of protein you like you really don't need um to take any excess protein in a powder form but if you want to and if you do then I would just suggest getting whatever has um the least amount of um additives or just just straight way protein or egg protein or beef isolate protein um just because you don't want all that that other nonsense in there you don't want all those artificial sweeteners and things like that or God forbid sugars so I would just get the protein that just has that you know equi protein um who uh I've I've tried before and they you know they they sponsor me have like an affiliate link and things like that if people want to look that up um you know that has they have stuff that's just like the beef and just collagen it's just like nothing else and I think there's like naked naked way or naked protein or something like that um which I'm not affiliated with but I think that's another one that um that uh just does straight up protein with no additives and it's funny enough like the stuff with additives is cheaper than the stuff without additives you'd think that you know you're adding less stuff to it so it should be cheaper but I think it's just because it's a niche market there isn't really that many people going for it so it's just a bit more it's it's it's different it's separate from the norm and so it's just a bit more expensive because of that um sorry actually saw a question there that I was thoughts on cornivore to help infertility yeah so um you can look at the work of uh Dr Robert kiltz uh who who's great he's got um he's got his own podcast I've been on that he's been on mine and um and he's a fertility doctor you know he actually does um uh uh he has a a fertility clinic he's like one of the largest fertility clinics in uh in America and and he you know commonly um talks about how you know diet nutrition and carnivore can actually help your your hormones and get and get you pregnant and uh and help that pregnancy be very very healthy um so I would highly recommend uh looking at his stuff um and uh and you can see more there but just long story short it's going to optimize your your hormonal balance and your hormonal levels so your sex hormones um you know estrogen progestogen uh progesterone um and progestogens and um and testosterone levels just going to optimize those for for men and women um I mean even just going on a keto diet is really going to help women with pre with fertility as well because when you eat sugar or carbs your blood sugar goes up insulin goes up correspondingly and then you um and then that insulin actually blocks a conversion of testosterone into estrogen in the ovaries so women don't make estrogen directly ly they make a whole bunch of different precursors and then they make um testosterone and then they convert that testosterone into estrogen at at their ovaries and so estrogen can actually block that and so um if you have a whole bunch of uh you know high high insulin all the time then you're going to actually have higher testosterone and lower estrogen than your body actually wants to and obviously that can mess with fertility this also is one of the uh uh causes of uh PCOS polycystic Varian syndrome which is the leading cause of um infertility in women around the world so that's uh just a couple different ways that that can help but it it will absolutely uh help from from what we can see oh and how about Bulletproof Coffee so yeah I mean Bulletproof Coffee you're you're getting the good stuff from the from the fats and that's great but um it's uh it's got the coffee in it so it's not going to it's not going to get rid of the stuff that's in the coffee so even if you dress it up however you want it's still going to have the coffee in it so it's just like you know if you put uh you know cocaine in your tea or something like that you're like oh but it's but it's with tea so it's not really cocaine is it and it's like well now it's the cocaine is still in there right so the coffee is still in there even though you have the butter as well so just you know maybe just eat the butter and uh and well you know and uh Serena goes by Serena carnivore online uh she makes bulletproof water she just just Blends up hot water and and butter and she says it tastes really good and frothy and nice and warm so you can try that can the line diet be better for treating autoimmune disease than carnivore and why well I mean I mean the carnivore is the line DED I mean that's sort of the same thing I mean I guess it's like the line D just a bit more strict than um carnivore but you know that's the thing too is a lot of people a lot of people have different meanings when when they say carnivore right they'll just when you're eating carnivore they just basically um they just mean they're going to eat a lot more meat and they'll eat less plants but they're still drinking coffee still using artificial sweeteners still doing X Y and Z and and whatever but you know and using yeah like monk fruit sweetener and sugar and all that sort of stuff I see a lot of people that do that and so you know the main thing is that um you know the whole point of of a carnivore diet is you're eliminating out all these different you know plants and artificial sweeteners and sugars and all that sort of other garbage and you're giving your body what you need which is fatty meat um the lion diet is just red meat basically so for people don't know that lion diet is a carnivore diet but it's just red meat you know just um just uh just ruminate animals which I think are the best I think those are definitely the healthiest they have have the best um the best ability to to break down uh toxins and Gunk and uh and and ingest good things and uh and pass those on to you so I think those are healthier um as far as autoimmune imune issues are concerned yes I do I've this is something that that you do see and I've talked to uh you know Dr Paul Mason about this in the in the in a set of interviews that I did with him that I'll be publishing here in the in the coming weeks sort of in a three-part series um you know there there are things that are in like chicken and fish and dairy that can actually be uh pro-inflammatory can actually raise your your your uh CRP and uh and can raise your autoimmune antibodies uh for these these sorts of things and so you know you definitely want to get rid of the plants you definitely want to go just just meet if you have especially if you have autoimmune issues autoimmune issues respond very very very well to a carnivore diet um but they're just going to be a bit more sensitive you know especially while they're their guts healing we have this leaky gut problems things you're going to get in that aren't supposed to get in and you have problems um um no you don't have to supplement just to someone there um and so but people that are have autoimmune should also stay away from dairy should also stay away from like chicken and pork and and I guess fish as well according to Dr Mason I've certainly seen people have problems uh just just in practice with uh chicken and pork though and certainly Dairy so um just something just things to be aware of generally people with autoimmune issues should really try to go for the lion diet side of things like just the red meat and water and grass-fed if you can obviously because if the animal is eating what it's supposed to eat then it's going to be able to break down those toxins very safely and so those those toxins aren't going to get pass on to you but if it's eating something else that it doesn't normally do then maybe things are going to get get in there that it doesn't uh that you don't actually want um so someone's asking Sashimi Sushi are they carnivore well the Sashimi is sushi you know is comes with rice so that's that's the stuff you don't want but raw fish yeah definitely go for it and S right now um then Doug asks I use Primal kitchen sauces in ground beef should I remove those I don't I don't know exactly what's in in um Primal kitchen sauces I don't know who makes Primal kitchen sauces you who who does that I I don't know but I guess just I guess just read the label and and just see what it is you know if it's got a bunch of you know plants in it and sugar then I would probably stay away from that you know um and uh so I would uh yeah I mean I wouldn't I wouldn't use any of that anyway but um I would I would certainly sort of take a look if it's using capsicums and tomato uh base and all these sorts of things those are all night shades and those are you know if you're going to eat any plants I think staying away from the night shades is a is probably a good idea um so that would just be me though just take take a look at the ingredients and see if that's something you want it's got a bunch of night shades and has has sugar in it I would just I would I would not but um that's uh that's just me you guys can can do what you want you can always just try and without and you can always just try eating it without it and see how you feel see if you feel if see if you're doing any better and then after a couple weeks you know maybe sample it back in maybe give it a month just to actually give it a proper test and um and then you know you can introduce it back in see how you feel you know it's pretty pretty good way of doing it um so let's see here um so whenever I try eating meat only I end up throwing up after two days as soon as I eat some kind of carb I feel instantly better um well you shouldn't be eating to the point that you're sick you know and and the thing is is that a lot of people especially when they're trying to lose weight out I know if you're trying to lose weight but a lot of people uh are used to eating you know very large portions and they um they switch to carnivore and their body just goes hey you know we don't need all that you know we're we're fine we've got a lot of energy here and um and so just take it easy and then all of a sudden it just starts tasting horrible because instead of getting positive feedback uh from your body saying you know keep eating this is good for you you start getting negative feedback saying hey stop it cut it out and and so some people can get sort of uh um nauseated from that uh if you're getting to the point where you're you're throwing up or you're getting sick like I think you're just you're eating way too much and I think you just need to stop um or at least you can stop and so you you have to understand too that you don't actually necessarily need to eat as much as we we have been eating and we think we need to eat especially if you're losing weight excess body fat your body is going to recognize that and just say hey you know we have enough of this you don't need to eat I mean I've gone um after you know working out for you know 68 hours um thinking like why I have to I have to eat because I'm going to you know I've just done a massive workout and I'm gonna have a massive workout tomorrow so I have to eat because I I need that energy or else I'll just die or something like that and obviously I had weeks of energy just stored in my fat tissue and um and I didn't think about it properly but it was just like everything in my body was just like do not eat a steak that sounds horrible and I sort of tried to make myself um eat it and and I just wasn't enjoying I was just like gosh I am just really not enjoying this and so I just stopped and the next day I felt great had great energy and then and then you know meat tasted good again so I think if if meat's not tasting good and you're not enjoying it and certainly it's making you nauseous just just you know think about that as your body just telling you that you don't you don't need to eat and so just take it easy and um and you can also have withdrawals and and other sorts of other sorts of problems it can make you feel a bit crummy and and those would just go away so those you just sort of push through so those would be the two things that I that I think would be cover 95% of people in your situation um so let's see I'm on week two and I notice when I eat red meat with salt and butter I often feel my heart rate elevated is that normal it can be um I noticed early on that I I I not that I had a a fast heartbeat but it was like a strong heartbeat and um I was um I was looking at a few things and it it appears to be that when people are doing this they they they' get ECGs and things like that EKGs and uh and it's not an abnormal Rhythm uh but they have like a like a pattern that is um typically seen in people that uh are getting or are building up their health and building up their cardiovascular health so when they like athletes are getting fit and they're working out like sort of the beginning of the season they sort of notice that same sort of Rhythm their hearts sort of getting in shape so I think of it as a good thing I think of it has your body and your heart actually you know getting stronger and um if you are having a racing heart your your beat is very fast that could be something else then you might need to get checked out and so if you're having an irregular beat or you're having a very fast beat you know you should get that checked out because there could be other things going on as well that they sort of being uncovered now um but there there isn't anything in me you know it's not like a stimulant or something like that that's going to make your heart race um so um just be mindful of that but if it's if it's fast or irregular then I would just get that checked out just talk to your doctor and get like an ECG just to make sure EKG if you're in America and just make sure that um there aren't any issues there and um okay hope that answers that oh was that another one so Linda asks I'm thirsty all the time I do electrolytes and salt carnivore seven weeks I drink water bone broth and mineral water I almost can't stand any more water why is this um well if you're taking a whole bunch of electrolytes and salt you're going to make yourself more thirsty you're going to make you're going to increase your body's demand for water and so it sounds like you're sort of getting into a bit of a of a of a catch22 where you're you're drinking you're eating so much electrolytes you're drinking so much water and then you're you're drinking so much water that you're sort of stuck you don't like it anymore and um and and uh now you don't know what to do so I would just I would just tame it pull it back on the electrolytes and salt I you I don't think you need to take a whole bunch of those things in I don't really eat any salt at the moment I'm actually trying a to sort of a phase and just phasing out salt alog together so I haven't eaten salt this whole week um I'm fine I don't get cramps I don't have any problems with energy or or hydration and uh after that just um you know I would drink to thirst though but if you're if you're eating a bunch of salt and and electrolytes you're going to make yourself thirsty you're going to make yourself more thirsty as simple as that so hair thinning growth advice please so I'm assuming that means uh that your hair is thinning and um you want to to know why so most people um most people will will their hair will be much better much thicker much stronger same with their skin and their nails and everything else and um but there are some people that have some issues with hair loss um most often it is uh from not eating enough and not eating enough fat and so most people when they they they eat more they realize that their body's actually asking for more and they eat meat until it stops tasting good and they increase their fat they find that that that just goes away their hair starts becoming uh much thicker much much more healthy um I have I have come across exactly two people that have uh still had that issue um even though they've been eating enough fat and and filling up or or you know um it seems like they are anyway and um so there might be something else going on if you if you fit that category I would suggest getting it sort of a deep dive into your blood work and seeing if you're deficient in anything most people will not be deficient in anything however um you might be and so if you are for whatever reason it doesn't really matter just you know uh you know supplement or or take something uh like if it's something that it can be in like organs or liver or something like that and you just need a little more than um than you're getting just from from from muscle meat then then go for it I I don't have that problem I've got my blood stest tested and and everything and um never had an issue with that most people are in that category but not everyone is so you know if you're in that category and you need to supplement something then then that's okay it's okay to supplement okay so do Wonder don't men get really high ferien on a line diet uh not really I mean this is this is physiological if you're eating physiologically your body should work physiologically and so you shouldn't have a problem um and uh so your body should work in the way it's supposed to also you got to understand that that fertin is also an acute phase reactant so if you're sick or you're unwell have an inflammation or something like that your fertin can go up and so sometimes people with high fertin they go on a carnivore diet this actually reduces their inflammation their fertin goes down and so you know even though they think well there's a lot of there's a lot of iron and heem iron and and meat and and there is but um but you're sort of in in a a physiological State you're in in a sort of inflammatory State when you're you're eating all this other garbage and so um you know that can normalize and and it often does it usually does you know mountainwood Camp uh thank you very much for the"

and they don't seem to check LDL but there is a non-hdl cholesterol result do do you know if that's the same thing um yeah I guess so I I don't know if they're including like triglycerides in that uh as well um that's funny I I mean I would imagine they would I mean I mean they do uh generally um but no that's that's very strange I I honestly wouldn't worry about it like if your HDL is high and your triglycerides are low and you're not eating a bunch of carbs sugar smoking all these sorts of things like I just don't I don't think that LDL is relevant unless it's just massively massively elevated um because you have a sort of U-shaped curve your your cholesterol goes too low death goes up precipitously gets way way too high then you start seeing it go up as well it's all epidemiological but when it gets really really really really high that's when you start seeing some problems and uh and you know too much of anything can can disrupt uh your system but um um but yeah like my my H my HDL is high my triglycerides are low and my LDL is mildly elevated as compared to you know what what they think is is a good range to be in which I just don't I don't agree with just because it's is all based on false data frankly um so Jared asks for someone that works out regularly would you say you have to increase how much you eat significantly absolutely um you know you're going to require more energy you're going to require more protein uh to to build up your muscles and build up and and maintain your musculature as well um when I'm not eating as much as I need to my weight goes down even when I don't want it to you know I lose muscle mass and um and so you you definitely need to eat to maintain your muscle mass you definitely need to uh eat more in order to grow and uh provide the energy you need to do that those sorts of activities and run your muscles um you know it's just like you know going you know turning up the RPM on your car you're going to be using more more fuel and that's just that's just the same thing here um um and so I notice that when I'm working out and I work out very heavily when I do work out when I get the chance to um I I will double the amount of meat that I eat not because oh I need to double it ver just because my body naturally does and so my body's just like I want more I want more so I I notice that I tend to double the amount of meat that I uh that I eat or that I crave and uh and when I do that I I stack on muscle like no one's business it's it's kind of crazy like how um how much muscle you put on uh when you work hard and you just just eat a ton of meat it's pretty awesome um so zbz ask uh my 14-year-old slightly autistic tried keto and it helped a lot awesome but he lost more weight than I uh than I'd hoped for how to gain some back he doesn't do physical exercise much well he doesn't necessarily need to do physical exercise he just needs to eat enough you know because if you're if you're not eating enough your your your hunger s singles are going to be very very different if you go uh keto you stop eating carbs because carbohydrates uh just screw with your hunger signals and make you eat when you're not hungry and that's why we tend to overeat when we're eating carbohydrates and sugar and there's there's biochemical reasons for this that I go into in a lot of my talks um and uh and so um that's the thing so he's not going to be as hungry he's not going to his hunger signals are going to be much more subtle than um they would otherwise and so just need to just keep giving him meat and fatty meat and as long as it tastes good he should just keep eating he's not going to feel hungry in the traditional sense anymore so you just need to sort of relearn your hunger signals and just recognize that when meat tastes good that's positive feedback from your brain saying eat more okay and so if he does that he'll be fine he'll he'll be you know he's 14-year-old kid he's gonna be a growing boy you just you need you just need to shovel meat into that kid and uh and he'll grow and he'll he'll grow strong and he'll do great um so someone asked how much am I eating a day 500 Grand no no usually at least a kilo uh of fatty meat very fatty meat if it's more lean I'll tend to eat more um and then if I'm um and if I'm working out it'll be like easily two kilos like four pounds four plus pounds of meat a day um very a very fatty meat um so Shelly says three months carnivore currently six weeks pregnant congratulations doctors are very against carnivore yeah I I'm not surprised my cholesterol LDL is 350 tricer are 80 or HDL is 80 Tri glycer are 48 is this dangerous for the baby no I don't think so at all and I think that you know um people such as uh you know Dr Jamie Seaman who's a who's a OBGYN she does carnivore she Advocates carnivore um and then Dr who's also um fertility doctor he does the same and these are these are people that that do this um do this sort of diet and and dietary recommendations with pregnant women every day all right and so just remember biologically physiologically humans are carnivores and we have survived for millions of years in fact we've thrived in very harsh conditions for millions of years uh as carnivores and so for like 2 million years you know every single pregnant pregnancy was on on a carnivore diet so you are doing something biological it's not going to be bad for your kid um LDL there's actually studies that show that women who are pregnant and have higher LDL have much lower rates of kids with autism okay so your brain is made out of fat your brain is made out of cholesterol this stuff is good for you your HDL is very high your triglycerides are very low your HL is going to be fine your H or your LDL is going to be fine your LDL is going to be very healthy and undamaged that's a you know High HDL and low triglycerides or a marker that your LDL has not been damaged and oxidized and gly glycosilated so I think you're doing you're doing great and I think your your kid is going to really Thrive um as a result of this and will have will be able to develop to their genetic potential which will be far better than any of their peers so I think you're setting them up for Life there um and if you're concerned about that even more then I would go take a look at Jamie Seaman's um um podcast as well as Dr kils they're both great and they have a lot of good things to say exactly in this um scenario with with pregnancy and fertility um so JMP uh thank you very much for the"

        "body": "and fertility um so JMP uh thank you very much for the and fertility um so JMP uh thank you very much for the Super Chat really appreciate that um he asks lost 30 pounds in four months on this way of eating still had high blood pressure added um 4K salt and potassium my blood pressure is now 120 over 78 awesome very good job uh but we've been told low salt for high blood pressure is this normal concerns no um that's sort of been turned on its head um you know there are very few people that are uh salt sensitive and actually need to restrict salt um especially for like blood pressure and things like that um you know we have people that have like crazy high sodium in in in the hospital most people don't most people is very hard to get hypernut which is what high sodium is we don't see these guys having just blasting High um uh blood pressures really what what causes a main uh a major cause of high blood pressure is again uh you know High insulin chronically High insulin that causes insulin resistance and Insulin actually has uh um a role to play in the contractility of and uh and relaxation of your your arteries and and vascular vasculature and so when that becomes insensitive to uh insulin it just sort of stays solid and it won't dilate right so that's gonna that's going to keep you as a high at a high blood pressure uh because it won't be able to expand and and uh um you know accommodate a higher uh volume and so it's going to stay low which is going to increase pressure and so no I think you're doing everything right you know you're you're I mean it's tail of the tape right you're you you you're eating salt and your blood pressure is low so your blood pressure was high now it's low so whatever you're doing it's fine um you know if they're telling oh my God you got to stop that you got to stop that like why you you you you you aren't causing the problem that they're saying that you're gonna have so maybe you're a special case but maybe they're wrong as well and so I wouldn't I wouldn't worry too much about that um I like I said I don't really use much salt anymore sort of wean that out um you don't have to uh you don't have to use salt but if you want to it's clearly not causing a problem so I think you're fine hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I don't promote many products because

early nights and bad weather well that you will in the UK I think I've just it's so dark all the time um but you know I'm I'm a I you know I'm a bit uh curious about the whole vitamin D thing because you know I was talking to to Paul Mason and um and and we were talking about that and he thinks that uh actually you don't really need to take vitamin D that after a certain threshold like vitamin D is a hormone and it's very important for your body it's very vital it's very good for you um but you only need so much of it and so what he was saying is that after a certain point you get diminishing returns you don't really get uh much benefit right it's not causing harm you know there people that Tak tons of vitamin D and and don't cause harm so you know I don't think I don't think you're going to hurt yourself by supplementing with vitamin D but um after a certain point it seems that uh it may not actually be be doing all that much for you that it's more of an indicator of Health as opposed to a uh you know something that causes good health after a certain point right you do need uh vitamin D um that's why it's a vitamin and um so you know there's studies that Dr Paul Mason was talking about where people that you know had high vitamin D levels just naturally they were quite metabolically well and so they thought this was a marker of metabolic health because when they had people that had lower vitamin D and they supplemented up to that same level they didn't actually see the same benefits and so you know maybe it's more subtle response maybe this is is an indicator as well as being beneficial it's it's hard for me to say because I haven't looked as as closely into this stuff as he has but I'm not I'm not sold that you need to take any at all you know like um you know we had our ancestors living in in the Arctic uh Frost for you know all the ice ages and things like that and you have the eskimos and Inuits and the Nets and all these people living in the polar North and uh you know they don't they don't take any supplements right and uh you you get a lot of Vitamin D from animal fat as well so you'll probably actually have a pretty good vitamin D level and I would bet that you know being on a cornard diet being metabolically healthy you're going to be pretty good and you you your vitamin D levels will be fine um and so I'm I'm not convinced on the whole necessity for vitamin D if you have past a certain threshold um and then Marne says my hair has stopped falling out which is awesome fantastic very well done that's usually what we see and then uh the people that you know are still experiencing that on Carnivore generally aren't eating enough or not eating enough fat that's what that's what I've tend to see um GG asks uh says that she's epileptic and neuro neurologist freaks when I say keto alt and high and total cholesterol High High High um well you're well I don't know how long you've been doing carnivore or keto um your alt and a can be elevated for a number of reasons and could have been elevated previously um and cholesterol total cholesterol you know not too worried about that depends on what the breakdown is um depends on again what you're eating if you're smoking if you're drinking if you're eating sugar and carbs and um you know if you have higher low LDL higher low triglycerides as well so that's um not necessarily a bad thing if your HDL is high and your triglycerides are low I wouldn't really care about total cholesterol um but um um but yeah the alt and as that that should normalize on a cornivore diet uh that's really funny and a little upsetting that uh your neurologist uh freaks out when you say uh keto this is one of the more uh established facts in in uh neurology and neurobiology is that uh being in ketosis really helps suppress um seizures or maybe if you think about it this way things that were supposed to be in ketosis pretty much all the time that not being ketosis eating carbohydrates eating the things that kick you out of ketosis are actually triggering uh seizures and epilepsy which I think is actually a more accurate way of looking at it um that is a wellestablished fact I mean we we literally have a hundred years of data clinical trials randomized control trials and um and then just you know you know uh a stage four Trials of just people out in the community using it this was the only treatment that we had right for centuries the only thing that you could do for people with epilepsy was was fast fast them they they just you know they eat they they would um have epilepsy epileptic fits uh and then it sort of came up with a ketogenic diet because they found that hey you know if you didn't eat carbs you just sort of focused on meat that actually this would get you the same result as fasting and so they got into that and that's how that developed as a as a diet and so that bothers me you know because a they should damn well know that and B you know if they know that they shouldn't be try to trying to dissuade you away from it right the whole reason that we sort of moved to um pharmacological methods was because people were saying it's too hard to get people to change their life and to change their diet um it's easier just to give them a pill right okay but you've already said hey I want to do this myself and oh my God don't do it what the hell is that about you know like you were you know the argument was give them pills because we can't convince them to eat to eat a ketogenic diet and stop eating carbohydrates so why why are you why are you trying to convince someone to eat carbohydrates um one one idiot that I heard uh on this subject said well if you you know you don't want to go on a ketogenic diet or cornivore Diet because yeah it'll stop seizures but as soon as you you come off off of the ketogenic diet you you'll get seizures again it's like okay idiot well you've just taken them off ketogenic diet so now they're going to get seizures again good job uh and in fact that's actually wrong you know the studies actually are very clear that um the longer you're in ketosis the longer you're on a ketogenic diet the longer you're on a you know carnivore diet um you know no stud looking at carnivore diet but just ketogenic diet which a carnivore diet is um that it actually provides more protection and Lasting benefit you know so when you when you're on key to diet for like a year you're less likely to have seizures after even after you come off okay so that's wrong and that guy needs to either quit or read a damn journal in his own field that really just bugs the crap out of me I was talking to Professor um Thomas CED you know who's cancer biology expert um when he was a uh teaching neurobiology at Yale he did post talk there and then he was uh I think he was like an associate professor there teaching neurobiology and his research was in ketosis and epilepsy and he was furthering this on and at the time you know his department just said a you know don't worry about that we have such good pharmacological you know we just yeah just just focus on that that's easier just give him a pill and of course this is all industry-driven right so this is just like oh yeah give a pill give a pill this is so great um and and it's uh it's garbage and now so not only um have we said like ah you know let's just be lazy now now you we're so tied up in this that you were actually telling people not to go and do something that literally stops seizures in 50% of people like and and significantly reduces them in everyone else like what the hell sorry I I just always pisses me off when when I hear that uh someone's doing that so Sean thank you so much for the"

other's respective uh platforms that would be awesome so Hello nice to meet you um do I eat raw eggs I have eaten raw eggs I've uh sort of used that as sort of like a protein drink where I'll just sort of crack like 10 eggs into a glass and sort of mix them up and sort of break up the yolks and then just drink them just taste like cold uh SCP eggs it's actually okay um and uh yeah it's not a problem uh for me anyway some people do have a problem with egg whites and um I would just just be mindful of that and so if if that's something if if you're in that category and you have a bit of an issue with that then I would just um I would just uhh avoid it if that's if that's you okay um um so Jonathan has a question if we can't afford grass-finished meat do we need to uh be worried long term about antibiotics hormones pesticides Etc um which might uh be used on or around livestock no no I don't think so I mean in generally I think that you can um you know unless you're like in just some area that just has just you know really really bad uh habits and safety standards and things like that but I I tend to just eat you know Costco meat um you know I definitely preferred um having like I bought bought a grass-fed cow that was like 10 years old and it t tasted amazing it had much more flavor much more beefy flavor and and that was great and I felt great on that um but at the moment like mostly what I eat is uh is just is just uh uh you know normal grain finished beef so when you look at antibiotics antibiotics are are they tend to be given I mean people don't spend money you know just just for the fun of it right so generally you see like in cows in like huge herds in big area and they they have to keep these things you know healthy and they don't want to get them sick you know that is our responsibility as well to take care of these animals and so when you have just tons and tons and tons of animals um you know they could get sick and then you have half of these things die or be very very hurt by that and so they found that it's it's uh you more effective and safer for the cows to sort of give them antibiotics in those conditions but not everyone needs that you know if you're not in feed Lots you're just sort of out in in pastor and things like that you probably don't need that um and then the hormones to grow those are generally given at the beginning so that you uh grow right and so a lot of them are out of the system by then but there was um uh there was an article I read there's actually when you put this stuff in context it's it's very different so if you have um if you have 3 ounces of of nor normal meat not hormone treated uh it has about 2 o or sorry two nanograms of estrogen in it right and then um and then uh hormon treated cows will have 3.9 nanograms okay so it's doubling and that's what people say I'm like my God it doubles and that's true it technically does double however you know birth control pill depending on the brand can have like as much as 35,000 nanograms right so so going up by 1.9 nanograms is probably not that big of a deal um pregnant or or fertile women will have you know over 100,000 nanograms a day that they will produce and soy will have phytoestrogens uh that can mimic estrogen in your body will have over a million nanograms of that and so you know you put it in context right um and so I don't think I don't think it's that that big of a deal um but at the same time I I you know if you can get grass-fed and all that sort of stuff then I think that that's probably better but I think it sort of as as sort of getting gold and silver in the Olympics right so silver medal lost to gold right but the silver medal has also beat everyone else on earth right and so you know the the grain finished cows first of all 80% of their life is on grass and then they just the last couple months in a feed lot okay not ideal but uh is what it is and it's still better than than a lot of other almost everything else you'll eat as well um so th is uh asking again uh thank you again for the"

        "body": "um so th is uh asking again uh thank you again for the um so th is uh asking again uh thank you again for the Super Chat that's very kind of you uh what is your take on Seafood like sardines and Squid on a carnivore diet I think it's perfectly fine if that's something that that you like and you tolerate I I'll eat squid or octopus I love I like both um obviously I'm not frying it in any sort of seed oil I'm not breading it or anything like that or you can make sort of like like a panco breading uh from uh pork ranzo actually so that's something I I'll want to try U but no they're great and you know a good source of uh you know calcium and Bone with the the sardines because you're getting getting the skeleton in there as well and yeah no those are fine I think any any meat that you enjoy makes you feel good um and that doesn't give you some sort of you know weird sort of um intolerance I think is I think it's totally fine so whatever whatever feels good for you um okay so uh hello Dr Anthony what is your thoughts on eating only meat while doing one meal a day and every Monday no meal at all uh but in the weekend eating some potatoes with meat that's a very very specific question um but um but yeah but look if that works for you then that's fine I mean you know potatoes obviously carbs you're going to sort of uh kick yourself out of ketosis um which is you know is what it is is that's fine if if you want that then that's fine uh potatoes I think I think you could you could pick a better carb honestly um and so you know it's um you know it's a night shade right and so it's just going to have you know saline and other things you know so if you're going to eat it you know obviously you know cook it I mean who the hell eats these things raw but um you know peel it as well a lot of this stuff is you know barrier protection on the skin um but yeah I don't know I I would avoid potatoes myself I think there are other carbohydrates you can that you can do that uh uh will be better than that and um you know the the goldena bodybuilders like Ganda uh would actually have one meal a week that they would they just eat steak and eggs throughout the week and then like on Sundays they just eat like a you know they would they would uh eat carbs and things like that as well and they felt that that help build up their glycogen and they'd have better workouts at the beginning of the week I personally think that they're they're sort of shooting themselves in the foot um and they never really kept themselves keto you know keto adapted and so that they were constantly replenishing their blood sugar and glycogen because like when I work out now I can just go and go and go and go and go because I'm constantly mobilizing my fat store so I never run out of glycogen I never run out of blood sugar you know so they were you know well you know so if you need to carbo load you're you're actually shooting yourself in the foot I think I think that you're you're just sort of slowing yourself down um so yeah see another question um do you think carb in any amount is needed from female with Hashimoto well I don't think you need carbohydrates I think that that's um you know something that's that's pretty well established I there's several International Medical bodies that just say flat out you know the the the amount of carbohydrates that person needs throughout their life uh is zero you know you you make your own I mean you need carbohydrates obviously but you make them and you make the ones that you need and so you make blood sugar you make liver glycogen and uh and so you don't need to take in exogenous uh carbohydrates um whether this affects Hashimoto or not I'm I I wouldn't know that for sure but I do see people with Hashim I have probably a couple dozen patients with Hashimoto at the moment and um and they've been able to go on a cornivore diet and they do very very well on that and they're their numbers improve and their um and their antibody level come down as well it's Hashim Motors is a longer one it takes longer to sort of you know un undo that knot um and so you have people over a year a year and a half before things really start selling down complete but it's it improves steadily the whole time um as far as carbohydrates expecting that affecting that specifically I'm not uh too sure but I would um you don't need it I don't definitely you don't need it oh missed one of them um so hello your videos have helped me good very glad very glad to hear that seven weeks ago I started carnivore after watching your why we are carnivores video and it helped me fix my thyroid issues awesome that's very good to hear um I'd like to give more details but 200 character limit okay that's well I'm very glad to hear that you're that you're doing better I'm very glad to hear that that that that helped you um and so very well done for for doing that and taking control of your of your health I think that's that's really great um Stephanie says hi 55 years old female here eating mainly ketovore with some fermented veggies uh like sauerkraut for the last three years oh great um had three gout attacks this year and uric acid level around seven any suggestions um well Kim Barry has more uh information on this than than I do I haven't I haven't um looked into the the exact ins and outs of of this I do know that you know going back to like you know Dr Salsbury J J Salsbury in the 1800s uh they were finding they were reversing people's gout by putting them on a pure red meat and water diet and that's certainly something that you see people talking about now uh on the different forums and just just messaging me and things like that I've seen that a number of times uh I don't know if it's the the sauerkraut that's triggering it off something is um and so I I think that would be my first Port of Call is is just cutting out everything besides uh meat and water and then and then going from there and then um but uh Dr Barry uh Ken Barry has a lot of videos on on gout and and diet as well that would be useful to you here as well okay okay so deino asks how should I gain weight on the cornivore diet um thanks for your enthusiasm no problem um so how do you gain weight well you gain weight by stimulating your muscles to grow right so you need to exercise you need to uh you know focus on on Resistance uh exercise and uh and then feed your body and give your body enough uh fuel to grow and to um uh to get bigger and stronger so if you're working out hard and you're lifting weights and um and then you're eating enough and you're and you're eating until meat stops tasting good you know you're still getting that positive feedback from the meat that you're eating and you get to the point where you're just like uh not really liking this anymore you can safely say your body's has what it wants and um and at that point you will you will find that you'll actually gain uh muscle quite easily um so I that that is what I would do is just just work out and uh and and make sure that your body's getting enough one second okay so sorry I'm just trying to find some of these [Music] um trying to pick through some of these things that are comments or questions so I have to read them real quick ly sorry about that M Wood is saying thank you for the"

ask your question here anyway um pass it up uh now I'll keep an eye out for it sometimes I have to sort of scroll back and things like that so I don't see them coming through but if you ask your question here um then please please do I'm happy to to answer your question whatever it is so do I need to eat raw in order order to get the water soluble vitamins no I don't think so there's plenty of people that don't don't eat raw I mean I I I like less cook the more I do this I sort of like the less uh cooked I sort of sear it on the outside I've eaten raw meat but it's more of of a patience thing I sort of like don't want to don't want to uh you know sort of spend time cooking and so I just uh just start you know getting patient just start eating a bit but um no I don't think you I don't think you need to eat that no um so th all thank you again very much um saying I am currently doing animal based one meal a day diet since I don't want to miss out on exercise while intermittent fasting what fasting pattern do you suggest when working out well when I when I'm training um and when I was when I was playing um I just wouldn't eat before I before I worked out um certainly wouldn't I certainly I would never eat uh before games just ever just you know throughout the whole day I would never do that um but you know I might eat sort of earlier in the day if I'm just having practice or training I'll eat sort of like early in the day but I like literally like five hours I would you know have like a big big gap in between a training session uh between eating and training sessions so yeah so I would I would uh I feel better when I'm when I work when I eat after I out it depends on when you're when you're working out and if if your body really want wants like two meals a day if you're working out in the morning then that's great you just eat after you you work out and then you eat again later at night otherwise you might want to uh you know eat at night after you after you work out and after you train and then in the morning you might still be hungry your body might say like hey you know we want some more of this and so just just eat there but I I would I tend to feel better when I don't fill up during the day because you just you know your body's still just wanting a little bit more so it still has a bit of um you know it just has a bit bit I just have feel a bit more energy when I when I eat uh until I'm full I I get quite lethargic and I think that is just going into like a rest and digest mode your body saying hey calm down let's conserve our energy you've just gone out you've made your kill you've got your food and now settle it down we don't want to waste energy and so um I would just uh take it easy there and um uh try not to fill up completely during the day and then just try to eat after your after your workout I think that's that's been the best for me um from what I've noticed from you know from training and eating uh this way for a number of years and just my my entire athletic career I've always I've always noticed that that it's always better to eat after after you work out um see I live with my 24 yearold daughter who eats a sad diet I'm so tempted especially with my favorite candy uh does anyone have any ideas to help me with these intense Cravings I'm a NewBo lost 12 pounds well that's great um look you know sugar is a drug and um you know you're going to be dealing with with cravings for a while but those Cravings go away just like any other drug and then it's just habit and remembering like oh that was nice but um you you can relearn your patterns you can relearn your habits you can you can get um away from these sorts of things and so that is what I would do it's easier when someone's not in the house and and sort of tempting you with that uh at the whole time but it's uh it's something you can do and and the longer you do it the longer you'll be able to do it and if you slip up just get right back on the horse get right back um to what you were doing before and uh and you know don't don't let that derail you you know a lot of people will maybe they'll slip up and they go well I guess it's that's that's it for me it's just I I wasn't able to do it uh well you know people slip up you know a is is human um but you can you can you know you can fix it and you can sort of get back going again so you know just because you slip up doesn't mean you're out of the club you know you don't have to uh uh go back to all those ways but the longer you go without this stuff the the less you'll miss it you know I don't I don't I I used to have a you know I loved like guming candies and things like that I tended not to eat too much just because I was always you know athletic and and wanted to um you know just put good things in my body and um sugar was not one of them but I really like candy I really liked like gummy candies and I I don't miss them I don't miss them at all you know I look at them sometime you're like oh yeah yeah that was good that would have been nice but you know I don't care I I I would rather feel like a superhero 247 than eat something nummy sometimes I I just that's just a no-brainer fo r me um let's see so so so thank you Julie um for your"

        "body": "r me um let's see so so so thank you Julie um for your r me um let's see so so so thank you Julie um for your super chat I really appreciate that um Julie says I'm strictly carnivore but miss and enjoy flavored drinks uh yeah uh can I do herbal teas with heavy whipping cream and Stevia or energy drinks or flavored water sweeden with sucos I mean you can you can you're an adult you could do whatever you want but uh I wouldn't I don't think that that's going to be a good idea I mean herbal teas you know it's just going to be it's just going to be a plant it's going to have some things that are in plants and you know some people uh you know have a bit of a problem with some people don't really care so see if that works for you Stevia I would I I wouldn't personally just because those artificial sweeteners I think cause a problem uh I see a lot of people that have a lot of difficulty getting off of artificial sweeteners they actually feel like they're getting like withdrawals they feel pretty rotten and there's tons of oxalates and Stevia as well um and uh it's just and you're also keeping your your brain uh you know addicted you're you're um you're just sort of remembering that sweet taste and you're going and chasing it right now you're saying I really miss these flavored drinks that's because you're still you know thinking about them you're still sort of using them and eventually they'll go away you know you won't care anymore and so I think that's the best thing to do sucralose definitely I would avoid those sugar alcohols are pretty nasty for you and they cause horrible things to happen to your to your to your gut and and um and they uh uh yeah so they'll you'll get uh you know you'll sort of promote uh you know gut bacteria that you don't really want and you'll get like horrendous gas and it's also El laxative so it's like it does a lot of stuff to you that you you probably don't want to do so I would avoid that I think you you're doing really really well um and so you know this is just this is just one last thing and and you know you can just you know just stay away from it the longer you stay away from it the less you'll want it but you're doing really well um I just just keep going as you are you're doing great um so mountainwood Camp says how do you air cure without salt in the fridge so it's the same thing I just I just put it up there um on the drying racks it's not touching anything and um and um and it just dries out you know without the salt you know it does taste a bit Bland at the moment but um from from people that I've spoken to who've done this and haven't eaten salt and you know decades uh that that goes away so I'm waiting to see that I'm waiting to see if it sort of goes away and see how it goes um but uh yeah but you can still do this whole drying thing so I still do the drying thing I still have my meat sort of cut up and stacked uh and sort of placed on drying racks and um and so it's not um uh that's not a that's not an issue it'll still it'll still sort of dry out and and that concentrates the flavor and Browns better as well uh so that that still happens O Okay so it could you speak on traumatic brain injury my brother has severe diffuse axonal traumatic brain injury to the frontal lobe I'm very sorry to hear that um that's a that's a devastating injury unfortunately with acute a with um fuse axonal injuries um you know this is this is damaging the white matter tracks which um are important and like damaging a small amount of that has has much greater effect than than just the gray matter um when you get like a fall or an accident and you're head comes forward and then stop suddenly you can you can get those sort of sheer forces that can sort of tear those white matter tracks you can recover somewhat from these things but they're devastating injuries and um so depending on on how extensive his injuries are um you know there's there's going to be some permanent damage and and I don't know how how injured he is and I don't know how extensive his injuries are and so I don't know uh how much of that is going to heal um but it's uh it can be quite bad um so it's just only time we'll tell uh but uh as far as TB are concerned um you know there are studies that have come out showing that being in ketosis actually neuroprotective actually helps uh uh heal your brain after uh TBI um ketones are quite good uh for your body in general and uh for your brain in particular and so that is just one of the one of the many uh things that have been coming out that uh of of the benefits of being in ketosis and then I think at the end of the day if you're just doing whatever is physiological um you're giving your body what it needs what it's what it's um uh what it's designed to have which your your biologically appropriate species specific diet your body's going to be uh most AP and able to um uh you know it's just going to it's going to run as well as it can and so you're going to give your body all of the tools and ingredients that it needs to you know build repair and maintain your body and your brain and uh not least of all uh is uh not least of which is is fat and cholesterol so I'm very sorry to hear about your brother I I wish him the very best and I I hope that that helps okay on sorry just have to what type of butter do I recommend um well whatever whatever tastes good really like but grass-fed butter you know and stuff that doesn't have a bunch of like additives and things like that I would definitely not have anything um with any additives and so yeah just grass-fed butter if that works for you some people don't tolerate butter very well just the dairy and the and the uh um you know milk proteins but uh if you do then that's great now just go for a grass-fed uh what do I think of Macha te I think it's very bitter and so it's not something that I uh drank much anyway but you know I think I think that that bitter taste is you know you're brain in your tongue which are sophisticated machines they're telling you that there's something in there that is probably not good for you and so it's giving you a warning saying hey don't eat this spit this out this isn't good for us and so I think a very bitter taste is probably a warning that there's there's stuff in there that you don't want um saying thyroid is fixed still working on low blood count no idea what to improve uh well that's great well good job on on sorting out your thyroid that's awesome and Dale thank you very much really appreciate that says cheers for everything well thank you I appreciate it um okay question I have so much to learn I had no idea plants are poison what uh where can I learn uh more from credible sources uh botany just study botany is then horiculture like their their entire library is full of this you know I mean think about this you get lost in the woods you run out of food you know you can't just eat any random plant right most of them will make you very very sick or even kill you okay why is that that's because their innate defense one of their innate defenses is U making these you know chemicals that's are harmful to animals and insects trying to eat them and so that's how they survive and thrive you know so you know one of the one of early things I learned in biology I think you literally in seventh grade was uh that plants and animals are in an evolutionary arms race plants becoming more and more poisonous so less and less animals can eat them uh so that they can survive and thrive and then um animals becoming more and more adapted to specific spefic poisons in specific plants so that they can survive and thrive and uh so they have this sort of game that they play and and and they just go up the ranks um so it's not that that certain plants are more poisonous or less poisonous it's that we have more or less defenses to those poisons you know so I mean like spinach and kale broccoli all these things we can we can handle that pretty well actually um and uh and probably live our whole life eating this stuff but you know it is going to have stuff that we have to detox and can build up and can cause little problems here and there and can add up with a whole bunch of other things um but you know you have some Hemlock that'll just kill you you know because we don't we don't have really any protections against that and they have a toxin that will bind your Gaba receptors in your brain and you'll get intractable seizures and you will die uh within one or two minutes you cannot stop these things and so it's um you know it's it's just just a common well it's just it's just a universal aspect of plants is that they use uh chemical defenses right every every limit thing has a plant has a has a defense right down to single cell organisms everything's trying to eat everything else right and so while animals can run away or fight back plants can't and so they have to use other other means and other defenses and one of those is is by being poisonous being physically poisonous some animals use poison as well you know there's a bunch of you know frogs and toads that have bright colors or or insects that have bright colors that say Hey don't eat me I will you know you'll die if you eat me you know we'll both go down and so uh you know these things have to sort of use these defenses so uh that's why and and you can just yeah you study botney and horiculture um Professor Bruce Ames uh uh published a paper in uh he's a he was a professor at UC Berkeley and he published in 1989 um looking at the levels of tox in plants and comparing them to the amount of pesticides that we spread on them because they were trying to like ban pesticides and S he did this study and actually showed that there were 10,000 times more naturally occurring pesticides in the plants and vegetables themselves than the uh pesticides where they were spraying on them by weight and that the naturally occurring toxins were actually far more likely to cause cancer than the pesticides that were spraying on them in animal models in this case AAR is what they looked at um the who has has an entire uh you know web page talking about natural plant toxins or or just natural toxins in food really they don't even say they don't even say it's plant toxins but you'll notice that every single thing in there is a plant so there's all naturally occurring uh plant toxins or or algae that then get into seafood and then we eat the seafood and we get problems from from that but um but that's not the seafood's fault that's the algae's fault right so you can look at those um I have my um my video that I did for low carb down under um called plants are trying to kill you uh the very at the very end of that there's a slide you can pause it on there there's a huge bibliography of resources that you can look at for that and then also I have a a video by the same name plants are trying to kill you on my YouTube channel um that I sort of talk I cover most of the same things a lot of the same things but not in as Su succinct and uh um you know know pattern sort of a way and uh and I have a lot of a lot of references in there as well and you can take a look at those uh as well but literally any any book on on um horiculture or or um or botney will will tell you the sort of things I will there's actually a couple books as well so yeah there's there's a couple books we'll talk about like the different you know toxic plants so um there's a book called plants that kill a natural history of the world's most poisonous plants um 2018 Elizabeth dony and sunny Larson and then there's another book called toxic plants of North America um and those are just two ones obviously looking at at just really the more nasty of these creatures but there those are the ones we don't eat anyway but you know the who uh website is just talking about the ones that we do eat right um and so you know you don't want to um you know you don't want to eat certain plants without preparing them properly you have to you have to prepare them you know like cassava root you know this has tons of cyanide in it and uh and if you don't prepare it properly it can for the bitter cassava can kill you and even like you know lowgrade uh long-term cyanide poisoning uh can cause serious thyroid and and um neurological issues uh especially if you're not getting enough protein and a lot of these people who rely on cassab or in these sort of more impoverished areas it was more difficult to get uh protein and and fats and things like that and so you know like 500 million people their primary source of calories is from cassava and uh it's the third most important source of calories in the in the tropical regions and it will kill you if you don't prepare it properly and there's a lot of these things you know and it talks about talks about a lot of them um so Julie thank you very much that very kind of you um she asks want to lose 50 pounds of fat on Carnivore what kind of exercise program is best uh days per week length of workout I lift heavy but I'm open to recommendations I think I think lifting is uh quite good you know you'll build your muscles you're going to expand energy you're going to trigger your body to just fundamentally change and transform and then you're eating the right things and so the weight loss will come um the fat loss will definitely come obviously you're going to be replacing some fat with muscle and so that's going to make your the scale look a bit weird so don't get discouraged with that don't um uh you know don't get too discouraged because your your weight might stabilize you be oh my God I'm not losing any weight but your clothes will start fitting more Loosely uh you'll feel better and you'll continue to do more so I just keep doing what you're doing um generally you know when you're going to lift you're going to trigger a 36-h hour growth cycle and so you don't really want to be doing the same muscle group sort of every day every every other day is is fine but you don't want to overdo it you don't want to strain yourself and and you know tear a muscle or or develop tendonitis or something which you can do even on a carnivore diet but you really have to work at it um and like I was doing some some ridiculous sort of amounts of of workouts but eventually I was able to uh injure myself and umh so you don't want to do that so just keep doing that um whatever you're doing just just make sure you're consistent so if you're saying I'm going to do three days a week or four days a week you make sure you do those four days a week and do it every week and you do it consistently and then um never miss a day if you if you make an excuse to miss one day you you'll do it a thousand times you'll never get on on track and so just do that whatever days you you choose you make sure you get those days and then you work very hard it's not necessarily what you do but how hard you do it you really want to push yourself you really want to go to muscle fatigue and exhaustion and uh and go if you've got if you're doing 10 reps of something and you could have done 12 do 12 and uh and then you know then you'll start seeing that you'll feel better and you actually want to start add in a fourth day and then a fifth day maybe a sixth day and uh and just see how you go but keep keep working keep pushing and keep uh building so Mikey thank you very much I appreciate that um he asks um Paul saladino carnivore MD Advocates organic fruit and honey in moderation would you be able to set up an interview with him to hash out this topic I yeah I would love to I think you know I I you know agree with a lot of things that he says obviously I don't agree with that but that's okay you know you're not you're not really going to agree with everyone on everything unless you're in a cult and so that's good that you you don't agree with everyone on everything um I think probably the only person I've ever really come close to agreeing with everything on is is Thomas soul and that's just because that guy just backs up everything which is hard facts um and so it's not about me agreeing with his opinion it's just like yeah that's what that is that's there's there's the proof right there um and I understand Dr huberman is at um Stanford as well I don't know if you've run into to Thomas Soul as well that would be amazing um as well that's guy's one of my heroes for sure um so just answering a question here on Instagram as a keto adaptive I have been following some people for a while now who tout the carnivore diet or the animal-based diet however there is so much different conflicting information about whether or not to eat fruits and vegetables nuts Etc uh it has almost it's almost impossible to draw a conclusion on whether or not something is good or bad for you yeah it is difficult there's a lot of conflicting information I I tend to go just to First principles you know we have a lot of epidemiological stuff which can you know guide you in a certain direction but it's not great um it could be interesting but it's not it's not uh it's not awesome and um so you go to First principles you know what are we what you know we are an animal we are biologically uh designed and adapted to eat something and I think that the preponderance of evidence suggests that humans are carnivores and that that is our primary um uh food source evolutionarily going back two million years basically primar primarily at least in almost exclusively carnivore especially in certain regions up until very recently and then you look at the fact that you know botanically plants contain toxins they contain poisons and we don't we don't have as many uh defenses against these sorts of things uh as as other things do I mean look and and we have more than say you know canines and felines which most plants that we eat will kill them right and so you know that's a demonstration of the toxic nature of these plants right and they it's not that spinach is not you know deadly to other animals it is you know animals that don't have the protections we have some of the protections but we don't have all of them and you know like a koala has protections against you know the poisons that are in eucalyptus we don't you know eucalyptus would make us very sick and and so um you know that's what I go on you know like we're supposed to eat meat that's what we're we're um designed to do and uh plants have things that aren't good for you now how how bad or good are these things you know that's that's open for debate but the fact that they do contain these toxins is uh well I mean it's just a fact you know that's not a for that's just a fact they do that's a hard fact and in a hard science and so um you know and then there's all these arguments about hormesis and all that sort of stuff you know maybe but like you know there are thousands of different defense chemicals in plants and um you know so maybe you know are all of these are all chemicals are all toxins you know um you know are they all hormetic at a certain level every single one you know every all the time you know I mean you know arsenic is at very low doses you know you know some Studies have found that it actually gives a you know a bit of an advantage but does every single chemical ever you know do that I don't know I think that you'd have a hard time proving that um and also um you know what is the dose you know so you know oxalates okay well how many how many you know milligrams of oxalates are good for you and give you hormetic benefit you know exactly how much that is you know how much you're getting in your food I mean how how could you right and then there are like dozens or hundreds of other uh defense chemicals that are in these plants as well so okay so maybe you got the oxalates down at like a perfectly hormetic level you know exactly how much to eat to get that perfectly hormetic effect which like first of all you know like you know being an adult and just extract it and just give yourself the uh the oxalates in like a a perfect amount like in a pill that's why we that's why we have pills instead of you know the naturopathic approach of just giving someone a couple leaves of Fox Glove we give them digitalis because we know actually how much is is is in there and it doesn't come with all the different uh toxic you know other defense chemicals as well so you know let's say that you're eating something you have the perfect amount of digitalis right and you get that effect that you want great what else is in there or all the other things in there giving you a hormetic um uh effect at that exact dose right so are all these things in perfect hormetic balance probably not I mean that that that's sort of getting into the land of the religious there that you know we're in the Garden of Eden and God just made everything just just perfect for us and that every plant has a perfect dose that's perfect for us I don't I think that that's that's quite a leap of faith uh and there's no evidence for it and uh and you'd have a very hard time proving it so that's sort of what I go on and uh and there are other reasons as well I do uh my video on um why we are carnivores it's with a slide presentation I've done uh my recent talk at the medical conference in Gold Coast on you know plants are trying to kill you and then I've actually done a talk on fruit and honey and not being a good idea on Carnivore main reason being they have sugar and sugar is sugar is sugar and just because sugar comes in Honey or sugar comes in fruit and that fruit or that honey has other nutrients that can be beneficial to you the sugar is not beneficial to you you unless you're starving and you need the energy which you could be you know and that then yes that's an advantage uh it's hormetic and um but that's only in a certain uh circumstance and so you know there's a ton of work from Dr lustig uh from UCSF looking into uh how how fructose acts in your body and how it's actually broken down into the same byproducts as ethanol and you get this same damage to your body from those breakdown products of fructose as you do the breakdown products of ethanol and so you know go fatty liver disease therosis uh you know peripheral insulin resistance and diabetes and is even implicated in heart disease and cancer and Alzheimer so uh I think that that's probably a good reason to avoid those uh unless you're starving and you know fruit is not necessarily without toxins either you know citrus family for instance have have furanic cumerin which are very toxic and like even if you get them on your your skin if you get like lime juice on your skin you're in the Sun it actually is is photosensitive it's a photosensitizer it can and gets activated by UV light and will bind to proteins and DNA and damage them and and cause irreparable harm and so people have actually gotten like second degree burns on their hands just from having lime juice on their hands squeezing limes in the sunshine they get they get horribly burnt uh happened to my little brother when we were kids and we thought it was like an allergic reaction but um you know looking back on it like that's what it is because he's not actually allergic to limes he's he's you he drinks Coronas and maybe the corona has some magic power but I doubt it um so uh NF chick one thank you very much that's very very kind of you uh for the"

        "body": "and Robin thank you very much as well for the for the and Robin thank you very much as well for the for the super chat um what ratio of protein to Fat would you recommend for an older female um I think a lot of it's individual I think you want to shoot for about equal parts equal grams of protein and fat so like lean muscle to Fat um and and that will get you about 70% calories from that and then I think you just see how that makes you feel and you get uh how much energy you have your your skin and your hair and everything is healthy and your bowel motions I think that bowel motions are a very good indicator of um of how much fat you're getting because you can only physiologically absorb a certain amount of fat with your bile you run out of bile then most of that will spill out you can absorb some fat after that but most of it will spill out and that that is what keeps your uh stool soft and so if you're only eating meat and only eating fat not drinking coffee not taking artificial sweeteners which will both act as laxatives then I think that you're you can you can tell by your stool so if you're having dry hard stools then you're definitely not eating enough fat because your body is just absorbing every ounce of it if you're getting like loose stools then you know that's uh that's a lot more fat than your body can handle so I think you go for that you really want enough protein and enough fat that's really the main thing um and then Mary thank you very much Mary asks coming from a standard American diet transition slowly or for microbiome or going fast with guns of Blazing uh thank you so I I think I think most people will be fine um your your gut biome generally does change uh fairly quickly I mean because it it it eats what you eat and so if you're not e if you're if you change what you're eating that's going to promote uh different bugs uh to grow and so I think that that's uh that will change fairly quickly with you um you know Professor Kay talks about how this can actually lead to problems down the track I I don't disbelieve him you know he's he's very well researched I have a lot of respect for uh for him um and so if he says something I'm sure I'm sure there's a lot behind that that he's uh looked into um in practice I I didn't have that problem um and I've I've helped you know coach and and a lot of patience and things like that I've had over the last few years uh have not had that problem and so um you know maybe if that if that comes down and you you start having that sort of an issue maybe that's something that you you go back and and start transitioning off but um I think in general most people can just just dive in head first and that can be easier when you're sort of quitting something like you're quitting cigarettes you're quitting smoking you're quitting drinking um you know that that that cold turkey tends to work better than you just get it get in and get it done um and nfch one again thank you um it's very kind of you again I have topical dermatitis uh so bad on my fingers I can't even work oh I'm very sorry to hear that um I have to take the shot uh deutan don't think carnivore will cure this uh from your book or do you think carnivore will cure this from your book it sounds like it might it very well could I mean contact you know um it depends you know if you're getting like sort of contact dermatitis from something in your environment then you need to sort of find out what that is and get that out of your environment and um and then hopefully that will s of relieve that but yeah a lot of people have uh have found that that a lot of their skin issues uh resolve very well especially when they're getting like more fat like a lot of people with like psoriasis and Xmen things like that they find that when they're when they really get enough fat they're increasing the amount of fat that they eat that's when they find that their um that their body starts to to heal a bit better but the main thing is you want to eliminate out the things that in your environment that that are triggering that and so that could be something topical it could be you know simple as something like you know some of the soap or detergent or something like that you're using at home um or it could be something you're eating so if you go carnivore you're you're eliminating out a lot of things that that could be causing that and but there could be other things as well so you just need to be mindful of that and so you eliminate all these things out of your diet you're giving your body uh what it needs and what it wants and uh and you're you're going to be a step ahead of everyone else um and then you know and then and then seeing if there's anything else in your environment that can trigger that off as well um Dr chaffy would you ever have a sit down with another doctor who promotes a whole plant-based uh based plant food diet and lifestyle has discussed differences and ideas well I have actually I've done that actually dozens of times uh with you know doctors and uh clinicians and even you know phds in nutrition and nutritionist uh I love having those conversations I really I really you know uh you know Revel in them and um I suppose you mean have a sit down talk on camera uh if they're willing to i' be happy to um not everyone is you know they they sort of find that uncomfortable and uh and maybe confrontational which obviously you know you don't want people to feel feel that way and um you especially when they're on sort of camera they feel like oh my gosh I'm going to be set up or something like that so it's it's difficult but you know I've had I've had dozens of conversations with people I've done live debates with you know nutritional the Australian College of nutritional environmental medicine um I did um a debate with on Carnivore versus vegan diets with three uh vegan uh proponents one was a cardiologist uh another was a pediatrician who did her her Masters in public health at Harvard and the other was was an expert in the microbiome and so we you know we all sort of discussed all of our our ideas um and then uh you can find that on the Australian you know acum acnm that they still have that we also did I was also involved in a debate that that they did on cholesterol and there were two uh you know very well-known cardiologist on my team a SE mahor and um and Professor oh gosh I always forget his name anyway a professor of Cardiology here in Australia and and we went against you know sort of three cardiologists and professors of medicine I was I was the only only noncardiologist which is kind of funny but you know we we we did you know extremely well against them and we won like 86% of the vote for that debate and so you can find those and so and then I did a a video called um things vegan say where I sort of addressed some of the arguments in those those vegans arguments and just sort of said like why I thought that they uh they they weren't as robust as maybe they sounded um and yeah but I I really like those conversations I really like going uh and H and talking to people especially when they really know what they're talking about because I I don't want to be a victim of confirmation bias and just talk about things just because you know I think they're right and I'm not seeing the other side of things I want to know the other side of the story I want to know the the other argument I want someone to come up with new arguments I've never heard before I was actually a little disappointed in that that U debate with the carnivore versus vegan diets because I was thinking I was like oh theyve got all these like you know really bright intelligent educated people you know they must they might have something like new that I've never heard before so I'm going to really have to be on my game and uh no it was it was the same stuff exactly the same stuff you know same same tired stuff we've been hearing for the last 50 years that that's wrong it's demonstrably wrong and so it was it was quite easy to pick apart um Sean thank you very much that's very kind of you um 90day carnivore continuous running nose especially when working is this the histamine reaction if so will it eventually go away yeah it could be something you're eating depends on what you're eating um you know some sometimes when I get when I when I'm eating a steak or something like that I I find that I get a bit of a runny nose but it generally stops like if you're getting runny nose all day you know during the day and not just directly after you're eating there probably something more to do with your environment uh that you're that you're in and maybe getting some some allergies but um you know it could be if it's something to do with what you're eating uh just you know you can try changing up what you're eating but I think that if it's if it's distant to your meal that's probably uh unrelated you know so if you're just you're if you're not if you're only eating at night and all day you have a runny nose maybe less likely but you can still change up what you're eating and uh and take a look okay um all right everyone I think that um I should probably call it there because it's uh it's uh past 11 here and I've I'm actually working this weekend and so I'm up early tomorrow and then working all day so uh but thank you very much everyone um uh oh someone just asked opinion of pale medicina to treat diseases actually literally just released a video with the head of paleo medicina um you know Dr uh Sophia Clemens so uh you can watch that now you can go on there and I thought that was a great great chat um but yeah well thank you everyone I really appreciate you guys coming on hopefully we be doing more of these trying to do um I do them every week with uh you my patreon patreon guys but I I you know I like to do these uh big open ones as well because it gets a lot of people uh and asking a lot of of interesting questions which is always which is always sort of fun to fun to do so thank you everyone uh for coming on thank you everyone for uh you know joining and submitting questions um I'll have to figure out about this whole request to join thing and what in God's name is that's about but a lot of people have been asking to join and I'm a bit nervous about it because I don't know who they are so I don't know exactly what that's going to do and um you know it might be that you end up talking to one person directly and maybe that's interesting for people um maybe I'll try it sometime just roll the dice we'll see uh but um in any case guys thank you very much I really appreciate it and hopefully see you guys um maybe maybe in the coming weeks we'll probably I'll try to do uh some more of these so all right everyone really appreciate it thanks for thanks for coming by strict carnivore uh you have to look at stress and get out other things in your environment and uh and and cut out the Beef Pork no sorry not the beef the pork chicken and farmed fish especially farmed fish is terrible um just cut out the dairy for good measure um you just just play it as safe as possible and just go red meat and water"
