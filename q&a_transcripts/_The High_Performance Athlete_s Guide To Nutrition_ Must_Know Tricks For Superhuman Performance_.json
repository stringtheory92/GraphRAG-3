    "transcript": "[Music] any recommendations on Carnivore as an Ultram marathoner one gram of carbs per minute uh ran is standard fueling on ultramarathon world I'd love a video explaining this thanks you're doing God's work my friend oh thanks man look um a lot of people are proving this now that there's a guy I'll be I'll be putting this this episode out soon um is a guy in Sydney he's not a runner he's never run a marathon and he just decided to but he's been you know keto carnivore you know for a decade now keto first and then carnivore and um you know and he and he just said look I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna run five marathons in five days without eating so he went he ate Sunday night and then or Sunday and then ran a marathon Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday he ran the Sydney marathon and didn't eat the whole time and then just ate and he wasn't even really hungry after the Sydney marathon and he sort of had uh two hamburger patties you can do an ultramarathon on just your your body fat on you there's a lot of people that that run these things fasted and if you're faster you're eating ketosis you will you will run on your body's fat you know we have weeks and weeks and weeks of energy available to us um your refeeding is your fat you have it on you you've already done the eating you know what you when you're in in a ketogenic State you're not running on the energy that you ate from the food you ate yesterday you're running on the energy from the food you ate two weeks ago so you know you're fine you you're not going to have any issue so um you go on this and you just do a lot of high fat meat you're going to be great uh Professor Tim NOS has actually shown this in uh human crossover trials and athletes for for distance endurance as well as high performance um high-intensity athletes you get no loss of of output for being in ketosis versus on a carb diet because you make all the blood sugar glycogen and ketones that you need and in fact now you're running on ketones it's even better and but with the added benefit that you never have to refuel and refeed when you run out of glycogen you're done right you have to keep sucking in sugar right not the case when you're in ketosis and so because you're running on your on your fat stores now the other question is um which I was asked previously in an interview with a with a cyclist in Europe uh which I I didn't know the answer for it um but I mean I I suspected it but now it's confirmed that you know what about you know that glycogen refueling you know we can suck down sugar water and that you know gets your your blood sugar back pretty quickly you know how fast is it is it is that is it can you do that fast or is it slower from fat you know because we need to recover right away we need to just continue this uh yes so when you're in a ketogenic metabolism you will make like iogen and blood sugar faster from your own fat then you will be able to convert it uh from carb first and foremost you have to drink this stuff you have to digest it you have to absorb it that takes time right but also the conversion of glucose into glycogen is actually takes longer than our conversion from H fat into into glycogen I didn't know that but that's coming from Professor lzo boros who's a professor of medicine UCLA and and and a biochemist and runs bi and professor of biochemist CH istry and and runs a bioch ran a biochemistry Lab at UCLA since retired and now he's a professor over in in Hungary which is where he's originally from uh and he was saying that is actually there's less chemical steps to convert um you know ketones and and fat into glycogen who knew than than glucose but uh but it's quicker and it's also you don't have to digest it and absorb it and drink it and carry it with you so if you're doing an ultramarathon you're going to run on your on your fat if you really wanted to to refuel pkin you know 80 20 calories from fat to to protein pkin and uh or even just like a you know a squeezy bag full of of Tallow you know grass-fed beef Tallow plenty of energy uh but you'll have plenty of energy on you as well so but if you need to refeed Fat pkin those sorts of things that's that that's what I would do but you probably won't need it unless you're extraordinarily slim this guy in he was I I couldn't imagine he was over 10% body fat he said like 15 he looked way leaner than that so um that and yeah five days then he felt fine there's no problem so yeah uh check it out and uh I think you'll find absolutely fantastic results with it um okay so cam the carnivore thank you for the Super Chat what do you think about fasting while on carnivore uh yeah I don't I don't think it's necessary I think that you get most of the benefit of fasting just from from not eating the wrong things and if you're just eating cornivore I don't think you need to fast you know there are there are we don't really have studies showing like okay is it better to just not eat or just eat a carnivore diet or a ketogenic diet we do have some studies showing fasting benefits certain medical outcomes and they say okay can you get the same effect from uh just not eating carbs to being on a ketogenic diet and they found like yeah actually you do get you know pretty much the same results so those are the sort of studies we have but they have specific end points you're not looking which one's better which one does it best um you know just not eating or this but they you know if you reverse diabetes you reverse diabetes in a similar period of time um so that at least for for these specific end points they're the same just not eating carbohydrates is just the same as as not eating at all and so um I think that it's not something that you need to do I think we're well equipped for it Predators commonly don't get to eat every day we did actually we scare a herd of Mammoth over a cliff or bison over a cliff Crash and Burn we'd have food for the year so in fact we you know in a lot of cases especially during the meapa got an abundance of food and so I don't think we necessarily needed to fast but I don't think it's something that's going to harm us you know past a certain point you know you can definitely hurt yourself but you know you you go a few days you didn't get a kill you know you go a week or so you didn't get a kill you know fine but you know your body can handle that but I don't think you have to do it I certainly don't think you have to do it no so I think just eat fatty meat be happy don't worry about it uh less than cancer like people with cancer specific medical things using um uh you know fasting as a as a as a therapeutic tool u i me using carnivore as a therapeutic tool too it is a therapeutic interven mention it's not a diet it's just it's the the basis of Health but uh yeah other than that um just eat meat be happy uh Dean from X says uh it's first time I've seen you live on X yeah I I just sort of found that that we could sort of do this now and Link this all through streamyard which is kind of cool so it pops up on X and YouTube and Instagram as well so we have uh some people uh joining us on Instagram also uh which is great it's great to see everybody on here um well there's actually a question here on on Instagram that I just popped over from Maria prodin can a pregnant woman be carnivorous without having to worry about vitamins um you know humans are carnivores so you know for millions of years we've just eaten meat while pregnant and so uh yes you can definitely get all the nutrients you need for you and your baby uh on a carnivore diet and especially if you you include things like organs you know like a bit of liver kidney heart but most importantly liver is going to have all those B vitamins and folates b12 and things like that they're really important for neural development um and so yeah you can definitely you can you will definitely get everything there's there thousands of people around the world now you know you know in modern culture doing carnivore pregnancies and you know look at the msai and the Inuit and the Native Americans in the Great Plains up until 100 years ago just eating meat the whole time very healthy very strong you know clearly got all their nutrients as well so yes you can definitely get all the nutrients you need for you and your baby on a on a purely high fat carnivore diet especially if you include some organs people coming to this again early on almost always nutritionally deficient liver is your best friend in that case because it is a multivitamin so you want that to help you catch up you don't need too much because you can get you can get too much of a good thing and you can get hypervitaminosis or a bit you know too much copper or other sorts of uh fats or vitamins or metals that that come in in them but other than that yeah you do great that they actually trend is after 4.7 years they actually decreased their AOS sclerosis and burden of disease so that's huge it's massive massive Improvement and um and I've seen people with sarcoidosis include as well and I think there are actually studies showing ketogenic diets help sarcoid but don't quote me on that um but I've certainly seen people with sharid improve on"
