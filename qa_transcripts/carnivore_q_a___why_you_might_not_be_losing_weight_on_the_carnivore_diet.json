    "transcript": "[Music] so the main thing is your health and uh the very further down on as a very distant number two is your body composition nowhere on that is the scale and how much you weigh because the the scale doesn't tell you anything about your health anything about your body composition you can put on muscle and lose fat and stay the same weight and that happens very commonly I I experienced the same thing I lost weight initially in the first sort of two weeks I lost like 23 pounds and then nothing I didn't lose anything for months months and months and months but I could visibly see myself changing in the mirror and because I was working out I was lifting weights and so I was putting on muscle and I was losing fat so I could see that and but I stayed the exact same way literally to the pound I stayed 243 lbs on the nose every single day for months but I was absolutely transforming physically and and my health was was dramatically better and I felt amazing on the Rugby field so you know I was able to go back and play rugby at 38 which was you know not not everybody can do that and I felt fantastic doing it um so that's a main thing your your sugars are down your your blood pressure is down also remember that if your blood sugars are up even at 130 you know that that's probably still too high and so if your doctor has prescribed you medications you should continue taking these medications until such time as your body has recovered enough that you don't need them if indeed that happens which it does for most people but don't just say like oh I'm doing this now so I don't need medications anymore that's not really the case you know especially with blood sugar and with blood pressure you have to be very careful about these things not everybody can fully come off medications although many people do fact I would say probably most people do um but they they all reduce their demand for them significantly so make sure you're still taking medications look at your body composition look at how your clothes are fitting take take progress photos once a month you know don't don't get too hung up on this it's it's um you know just focus on your health and how you feel first and foremost then body composition very dist in second and see how you go you know and the other thing is too is a lot of people have hormonal issues they'll have metabolic issues that that need to get better they need to heal and and before their body starts giving up their fat stores and so there are a lot of reasons for that and there's some markers that you can tell fasting insulin uh leptin levels these sorts of things if those are elevated you're you're not going to lose weight uh straight away necessarily some people do but most people don't when you have a very slowed and depressed metabolism your body is just going to hang on to that fat a little longer and then as by eating enough meat so you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good every day and you do that and you exercise you're going to encourage your body and basically tell your body hey we're not in a famine anymore we don't need to we don't need to sequester all this um excess energy and you'll start using it so it's um it just takes time so some most people will lose weight straight away and dramatically some won't and it just has to do with their metabolism and their hormones and their body at that time so you just have to be careful uh to not get discouraged just because you don't have as dramatic weight loss results as other people do because everybody's coming from a different place they have different levels of health and they're they're going to react a little differently but long term you're all going to get there you're all going to get maximize Health you're all going to optimize your health and will lose weight you will lose body fat and you will be a lot healthier as a result of that uh there are a lot of Forums on this there's a lot of Facebook groups have been doing this for 20 years plus and this is a common thing some people just don't lose weight right away sometimes it takes a few months sometimes it takes six months a year a year and a half that's rare but it does happen so hopefully you're in you know the six-month group or even the four-month group and you'll start losing weight but just make sure you're eating enough eat until it stops tasting good and just focus on your health make sure you're taking medication if you still need medication if you're getting dizzy you're getting low blood sugar that's obviously uh uh time to start reconsidering your your dosages of your medications and talking to your doctor about you know what uh what would be the appropriate dose for you so good luck with that don't be discouraged you'll you'll be fine Beth ramacher thank you again for the Super Chat how long does meat usually take to digest thanks well it depends on if you're eating it with plants or on its own on its own it will liquefy and absorb within a few hours and if you're eating with plants some of it won't ever digest and absorb it'll it'll it'll have to be excreted because uh different plants can can block protease which is uh going to break down proteins so that stops you from breaking down your proteins properly they will have you know fic acid and oxalates and tannins and other sorts of digestive uh Inhibitors and anti-nutrients they're called sometimes they'll bind to protein bind to nutrients and stop you from breaking them down fiber is an anti-nutrient it can block up up to 30% absorption of the food that you're eating so they say oh well that's really good if you're eating a whole bunch of processed crap because it stops you from absorbing 30% of the processed crap like well if you don't eat any processed crap then then you absorb 0% of processed crap so um you know that that's the thing so if you're if you're eating it with plants and fiber and all that sort of stuff Less in fact sometimes you won't absorb it at all and digest it at all and if you're just eating meat just on its own you will depending on how it's cooked you know slow cooked it's going to absorb easier eggs are just going to be you know an hour they just going to be gone and and these sort and and you know sort of and there's that gradient in between there so but in in general if you're just eating meat just on its own and um uh you're yeah not eating with anything else you don't have any specific medical issues that that would delay things you'll you'll liquefy and absorb the meat that you're eating within a couple hours and and if you're eating smaller amounts probably even quicker so yeah not that long anyway pretty quick it all gets it all gets absorbed in the small intestine so before it ever gets to your large intestine that's that stuff's already already absorbed because you can't really absorb nutrients in the in the large intestine um mainly little little bits of things but mostly just water and salt and things like that Zeta thank you very much for the Super Chat Zeta says uh carnivore for a year but my husband and 12-year-old son are not is coconut oil or MCT oil healthy for them or should they just eat butter butter is probably the best I want butter is the best MCT oil um from speaking with people that manufacture it it's supposed to really isolate just the MCTS from coconut oil which are probably fine they're very ketogenic they absorb very easily you can actually absorb them without bile they're they're one of the few fats that you can absorb without bile and so you you absorb it and so you get your your Ketone levels up high and so if you have someone who has a specific need for this epilepsy m grains cancer and you want your ketones up then that's that's something you can use um coconut oil in general we have MCTS it will have saturated fats will have good fats it will have other fats maybe not so good but also they'll have plant sterols which is the plant version of cholesterol the plant version of things is typically not what we need or want the plant cholesterol plant sterols are close enough to our cholesterol that it are it tells our liver and potentially even our brain that we have enough cholesterol and we don't need to we don't need to make any more don't know how how that affects your brain's production people oh well you know the you know cholesterol doesn't cross the blood brain barrier that's actually not necessarily the case that's certainly something that has been posited but there are studies that have uh looked at this and actually found that the the levels have actually evened out and balanced out from one to another and there seems to be um uh a metabolite they'll sort of break down into a smaller uh molecule that can cross a bloodb brain barrier crosses the blood brain barrier and then reconstitutes in the brain or actually outside the brain so you can actually get cholesterol from outside the brain into your main circulatory system through the bloodb brain barrier and vice versa at least that's what a few studies seen and uh you people say that oh yeah I can't do that I mean literally five minutes on Pub met I found a number of studies that said well actually probably can but just not in the whole form it's not cholesterol itself is not going to cross it has to break down first cross and then reconstitute but it does seem to be able to do that in any case at the very least it's going to stop your liver from producing as much cholesterol as you want and that's actually not a good thing and so it can um it can you know make it so you don't have enough cholesterol for your hormones for your uh cell membranes for um other structural components as well vitamin D all these sorts of things so it's not great uh to have to have that sort of thing to have these plant steriles and any sort of plant oils even though I would say that that coconut oil is probably if you're going to do plant oil is probably the best but if you can just stick to butter I would stick to butter maybe some MCT oil every now and then sure but Butter's great butter has I mean Butter's called butter because of how how much butyrate it has which is is Ketone you know that that's one of the main Ketone bodies and so you really don't uh you don't really need anything else except animal fat so good luck with that hey guys just want to take a second to thank our sponsor at carnivore bar I don't promote many products because honestly all you need to be healthy is to just eat meat for those times that you're out hiking road tripping or stuck at work and you want nutritious snack that is just meat fat and salt if you want it the carnivore bar is a great option so I like this product not because it's just pure meat but also because I want the carnivore Market to thrive as well and the more we support meat only products the more meat only products that will be available in the mainstream so if this sounds like something you'd like to get behind check it out using my discount code Anthony to get 10% off which also applies to subscriptions giving you 25% off total all right thanks guys Roker thank you so much for another Super Chat um good to see so much of you today uh Beth says saw the butter question on Tuesday curious um how don't know if you do okay with butter I felt fine eating tons of plants that's true uh so feeling fine might not be the best indicator um of how healthy a food is yet so so that exactly the same is what you did with plants you cut it out and you stop using butter for 30 days and you see how you feel and if you feel better great and if you feel I think I feel the same add some butter back in carefully in control don't add a whole bunch of other things just something you know your normal meal but also add butter maybe just have butter on its own see how you feel and if you feel fine if you feel better great and if it if it makes you feel a bit weird you get a runny nose you start having weird sort of symptoms your energy is not as good you know whatever you know if someone has autoimmune issue if it sort of causes that to flare up you have ay joints all all these sorts of things just anything off so uh but that that's it you have to know eliminate it same idea with everything else it's elimination sort of diet you eliminate out things and then you can add some back in see what happens I mean some people add in uh you know plants again I mean I I don't know any anytime anything slipped in it's just made me feel worse and so I just have no interest and having that because I have no interest in not feeling my best so cut it out for 30 days and then reintroduce it and see how you go so Desiree Fetti thank you for the Super Chat hi Dr chaffy how much water do you drink while eating is it bad to drink while eating I think it is bloating me but I need some guidance thanks yeah I think I think it's probably good to avoid water when you're eating a you want your stomach to be uh the the that volume you want there to be enough volume for food you drink a bunch of water that's just going to fill up space and you can actually feel like you're full and want to stop eating before you're actually satiated from a a nutrient point of view also it's going to it's going to water down and dilute your stomach acids and your digestive enzymes from your pancreas once you get into the small intestines so um the thought is is that you'll digest things more easily if you don't drink water around meal time so if you uh like what what Salsbury said Dr Salsbury back in 1800s said is basically sort of like room temperature or warm water um and don't drink water uh within two hours of a meal before and after so you don't drink water two hours before so stomach's nice and empty uh the the stomach acid's nice and concentrated concentrated and then uh and then two hours after so give your body two hours to break this stuff down and absorb it before you start flooding in water and diluting it and things like that and especially if you're feeling bloated and it's not feeling good when you're when you're uh drinking water while you eat definitely don't do it so I am not always great at that sometimes I like something to just to wash something down um while I'm eating but I I typically try not to to drink water around meal times either can't say that I I've noticed a difference one way or the other but um I'm just going to do it on principle but if you if you feel a difference then definitely don't do it but uh that that's uh yes you're right it's it is it is something that can make a difference okay Sher Hutchinson good evening it's my first time well welcome Sherry thank you very much for joining and I'm glad that you're here hopefully it's something that's interesting and uh something that you're you're interested in trying and and give it a shot and just see how good you can do on it and darv one of our moderators Miss okay making fun of me for being late again okay uh thank you you Dar it um super chat from nav uh thank you very much nav it's very generous of you day 42 carnivore no caffeine and lion last eight days really good job I get a normal solid stool in am no constipation later in the day I get loose stools I don't get solid and loose simultaneously they are separate with time any tips um yeah that's interesting it's you know I if you're if you're eating something fatty and that's when you're getting the loose stools maybe you're eating more fat than your body can absorb if it's distant to that maybe something else is going on if you're getting hard dry Rocky stools and then otherwise you're getting like liquid stools regardless of the time of day that it happens it could be that you're actually more constipated than you think and you're getting these sort of semi blockages and then the liquid stool is sort of passing around that and you're getting liquid diarrhea it's called overflow diarrhea or spous diara and so that's something to consider as well so if it's just sort of normal soft but formed stools and then more liquid stools you're probably on the other side of that you're probably having more fat than your body can can absorb as readily that's not doesn't mean that it's bad for it doesn't mean that you're sick or you have an infection it's just you know inconvenient um but if you're having really hard stools and then liquidy stools you're probably actually more constipated there's sort of a U-shaped curve so uh you have too little fat you'll get diarrhea you have too much fat you'll get diarrhea so you want to be S of in that middle ground so you aim for one to two grams of fat per one gram of protein and um you know that's around you know 65 35 ground beef to 753 25 around there and um so you're in that range and uh and see and adjust from there and if it's that's not enough fat you're sort of getting those harder drier more difficult stools along with the loose stools up the fat see what it and then they might have loose stools for a while but you get all that clear that blockages out of there and then your body will start sort of forming these things more naturally um it's a bit of a pain but uh you have to sort of play around with it to see and uh and also remember that it's not just coffee coffee is obviously a major one but you know coffee caffeine tea uh but also artificial sweeteners magnesium supplements metformin which is a very common medication for diabetes that people are on all of those things can act as a laxative and so you need to um remember that and if there's any of that you know in in there you can't just adjust your your fat intake um and then after that if you think it is too much fat and and and you're not really absorbing it try staying away from the rendered fat try getting more solid fat that's in the meat itself and yeah so so a few things to try anyway and and the other thing is you can do a a journal right what you eat when you eat it and when you're having solid or loose stools and see if there's a connection there because it could be that you're just having something with more fat than your body can contend with and then it just just comes out and if that's it then that's easy to to deal with but it's uh it's sometimes easier to see when it's on paper uh Leah aloha aloha from Maui it's my 49th birthday I just started carnivore diet and just a tri tip celebrate hey well that's great happy birthday and welcome to the club uh I'm sure you'll do really well with it and thanks for for giving it a shot you know because why not you know you can always go back if it's if it's not working for you but very very rarely does that happen Gish shoer says your thoughts on cornivore diet and extreme Combat Sports like Muay Thai is it possible yeah absolutely I I know a number of um uh Fighters professional fighters there's um oh God who I'll try to remember but there's the there's is a UFC fighter right now that's um carnivore and how do I know this because he's uh carnivore bar sponsors him and he and he says he's carnivore so um and then there's a lot of top athletes um there's a more there's a boxer here in Perth that's giving you to try um there's uh Holland Gracie you know one of the Gracie family he's um head of Gracie jiujitsu in San Francisco I've had him on my podcast he does a carnival Bo diet and he says his his performance and training has just gone through the roof and um and numbers and numbers of athletes so yeah absolutely I mean I did I did mu Thai and pancre so you know MMA uh for quite some time before I I switched over to rugby fulltime and it um I wasn't I I I went fulltime into rugby and then went carnivore but I did dip back in and have trainings you know in in you know MMA and fighting things like that felt just like a like a different person now it's hard to say because you know I I transitioned to rugby full-time when I was 18 you know and so you know I go back at 2021 and I'm already you know uh uh an accomplished rugby player obviously my you know that training and years of maturity physically and mentally um are going to help when you go back into any sport you're going to look at things you know very differently and and um you're going to be better at it so you know it's hard to say but um it's uh that I definitely notice it a hell of a lot easier uh to train in any sport um Wilton Ziggler was the guy's name he's a he's an MMA fighter I'm pretty sure he fights in in uh in um the UFC so yeah you definitely do that any sport any Endeavor any health issue this can help op it's optimal nutrition you're giving your body the exact fuel that it needs to be optimal and if you're optimizing your health you're also going to be optimizing your athletic performance um you know there you know there are things like like different drugs and amphetamines and steroids that may give you a a shortterm boost to your athletic performance but do hurt you overall from a health standpoint but if we're just talking about nutrition what's optimal nutrition for you as a person should also optimize your health in general which will make you a better athlete right those two things should go together and so yes you can definitely do Muay Thai on this um okay and Laura says uh from Facebook says hello from Florida just wanted to thank you for this community and knowledge of this way of eating 5 months in and doing great well that's really good I'm really glad to hear that Laura and I'm glad that um Everybody the community is awesome I everyone here is you know is is you know there everyone is just wants to be healthy and they want to they want to help other people be healthy I mean you do get you know people that are that are a bit more aggressive and say no you have to do it this way but you know it's uh you know typically people are very supportive and very helpful and and U and that's and that's what you want and so it's uh it's been really nice to see you know you sort of know that you're on the right track if like the people in your community that're all doing this stuff are actually just nice people just trying to help each other out you get a whole bunch of nasty people that are just you know you know the people that follow those you know those shock accounts that just all they do is they don't do anything novel they don't do anything uh they don't bring anything new to the table all they do is just trash other people that cultivates a really really you know low class low brow sort of community of of just  who just you know just want to just talk and and tear people down you know it's just just all like the the high school bullies and uh you know childish people that just never grew up and just think that you know it's it's you know you you bring yourself up by tearing other people down it's just like you know high school's over like grow the up you know but um our uh you know this community is actually just nice good people that are just getting healthy and just trying to help other people get healthy and if you don't want to fine it's your business so yeah I'm glad that uh I'm glad that you've experienced that as well sorry for swearing hey everyone really happy to announce a new sponsor for the show and for everybody down in Australia Stockman Stakes who are delivering highquality grassfed and finished pasture raised beef and other meats flash frozen and vacuum sealed tood door something that I've been enjoying a lot of myself recently as well they also have a great range of specialty items such as high fat keto mints and carnivore beef and organs mint with liver kidneys and beef heart as well so use code chaffy today for free order of beef mints or another specialty gift along with your order at Stockman stakes. comom and I'll see you over there thanks guys AER crazy one thank you for the Super Chat carnivore for a year lipid levels pre- carnivore um have some panels there and now um so triglycerides yeah went up a bit um oh did they oh total cholesterol sorry and then uh triglycerides went up a little bit and then LDL went up a lot a bit but yeah no I I don't I don't you know the thing is is that you know higher LDL cholesterol is associated with longer life so um so good you're doing good um triglycerides is are still in a fantastic level your hdl's in a fantastic level your triglycerides are in a fantastic level even though they've come up a bit still fantastic you know you want um you want your triglyceride to HDL ratio to be under two so you want your HDL to be at least half of what your triglycerides are that's what a lot of people consider a good range and you're in that you're nearly one: one you were one to one last year so that's good um many things can affect your triglycerides stress poor sleep major major uh things that can affect triglycerides they can raise cortisol cortisol can raise blood sugar and that can kick off your triglycerides as well so make sure that you are getting proper sleep that you are managing your stress as well as you can doing things for yourself that make it so you know you can deal with the stress in your life everyone has stress in their life maybe you can change things so you don't have so much stress in your life maybe you can't if you can't do things that d-stress you that make you feel happy that make you feel good that make you think that you know make the stressful days worth it um so that uh that you're not not really holding this stuff in and letting it affect you negatively and uh that's pretty much it but you know what I think you're doing fine uh if you just stopped eating for five days and weren't eating any meat and any fat your LDL would also go up and so it's really not about you eating fat that's that's jacking up your all the Els about you not eating carbs that's the main thing and so uh I wouldn't worry too much about that if you're otherwise healthy and you're doing well and you're feeling well and everything else is good I think that's the most important marker um I don't bother checking cholesterol anymore unless someone specifically asked me to there are there are much better markers fasting insulin uh your your fasting blood sugar hba1c is actually not all that ra sort of a blunt tool um leptin these sorts of things um you know are are better sign of your overall metabolic health and they're they're stronger indicators of poor metabolic health and and potentially developing metabolic disease and heart disease cholesterol is not a very good indicator it's it's actually pretty poorly associated in a lot of studies actually it's not associated at all in other studies it's inversely Associated so uh like the Framingham study was misreported as um as being uh uh showing that higher cholesterol was associated with higher levels of of um cardiovascular disease and and yet the uh the actual data showed that it was the opposite lower cholesterol higher cardiovascular disease mortality rate so in any case um you know I have a video the truth about cholesterol and heart disease probably a good one to watch uh interviews with uh cardi cardiothoracic surgeon Philip ovadia um talking about similar things and uh interview with a cardiologist and uh published author and and um uh many Publications on cholesterol and things like that in the bmj and other other Publications a SE motra I've interviewed them both and they're sort of of the same opinion so take a look at those and and see what you think and you know decide you know with yourself and you know uh with your trusted uh doctor healthc care provider what's going to be the best thing for you for me I'm more than happy for my LDL to be above the the quote unquote uh uh normal range because I don't think that is a normal range I think that's just what we've arbitrarily assigned it and I don't think that that aligns with uh proper health so me personally I'm not too worried about it in fact I'm I'm happy for my LDL to be exactly where it wants to be because that's physiological that's what my body's telling it to do so I'm happy with that when you know we're playing rugby tournaments either for 15s or for sevens it's uh you it's a long day and uh you're playing these games you're really wearing yourself out you're putting everything out there every minute of the game where you should be anyway and um certainly at the higher levels you are or else you're not not getting invited to play"
