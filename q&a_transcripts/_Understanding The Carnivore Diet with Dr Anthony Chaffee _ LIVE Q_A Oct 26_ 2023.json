    "transcript": "okay hello everyone good morning good evening good afternoon um sorry running a little late but today is live for October 26th uh 2023 so thank you very much everyone for joining it's great to see you all um and I just let you guys know normally I have a bit of time uh to talk to everyone and and answer questions for a while today I have about an hour because I have uh patients waiting for me uh today in the clinic so I'll be in in there with them all day and uh but I'm going to try to get through as many of your questions as I can in that time but just so you guys know that's about how much time we have just one one moment my looks like my computer got unplugged one second okay all right so as usual if you guys can you know put question or cues or all that sort of stuff so I can see it that's uh very helpful and um obviously super chats pop up because they're they're a different color but um uh without that I need to I need it to be as visible as possible so please help me out with that so we'll start with the first Super Chat here from Jack um Morgado thank you very much for that Jack question uh 51y old 3 months carnivore 168 intermittent fasting so it's a sort of split he's only eating for 8 hours fasting for 16 Sprint heavy lifting five days a week great sounds like you're on a good good course fasting insulin I'm assuming is a six 6.0 triglyceride 79 HDL 64 LDL 356 total testosterone 419 um 49.6 nanograms per deciliter um three testosterone 0.298 nanomoles per liter would you advise trt LDL to high question mark thanks from Brazil um so just take a look there I don't I don't think I'm used to normally using those units for pre testosterone so I don't know exactly where that that um how that's going to translate but the thing with trt is that it's it's purely individual like if you feel that you're not doing well you don't have very good energy that's sort of affecting you negatively and you have significantly lowered testosterone that's something you can think about uh I would you've been doing for three months that's great I don't know when those blood tests were taken but I would check them again probably in another three months because they they go up and I have a lot of patients that go on a cornivore diet and they they double even triple their testosterone as as an older as an older man 60s 70s and so you're doing all the right things um so I would I would wait if you feel like you can wait if you feel that you're really symptomatic don't feel well you can always talk to your doctor about that if because I don't know exactly where those those numbers line up so I can't really give you a good estimation on on on that but it really matters your symptoms and how you feel as well so if you feel like you're doing good and you're improving then I would just wait and I would wait another three months six months keep doing what you're doing check it again and then see where you're at and if you're feeling good I don't think you ever really need to take it it's just that if you feel that there's room for improvement that that the diet isn't isn't quite getting then you know then you can think about that sort of thing the LDL I don't really worry too much about I think it's a poor indicator for heart disease you have very good HDL you have very good triglycerides which means you almost certainly have a pattern a ll which is the large Point LDL molecules which are the good ones even if you had pattern B which are the bad ones the damag small dense LDL molecules it still wouldn't uh be a massive increased risk it's like 1.7 times increased risk part disease whereas metabolic syndrome is six times increased risk and diabetes is 10 times increased risk which is up which is up there with smoking so the cholesterol really doesn't make make as much of a difference as if you as if you manage your metabolic issues and it's the high blood sugar and other nonsense that you're eating the inflammatory sort of things that are damaging the LDL and creating the sdldl in the first place so you address one you you'll fix the other at the same time and and and you are so that's all great um and because cholesterol and LDL have been shown to just have been a a a scapegoat for the sugar companies trying to cast the blame away from sugar why why are we still considering this it was never a problem in the first place you just have to throw it out and so in my head at least I I have for the most part I think it you can look at it for some things it's it's a marker of metabolic disease right you know if you have low HDL and high triglycerides well that's one check against you for metabolic syndrome okay so that that's important to look at if you're worried about metabolic syndrome after that I I I honestly think it's just been the wat has been so muddied you just really can't can't even look at it uh as a as a serious marker for for cardiovascular disease that's my personal opinion but that's where what I think the evidence shows that's what evidence shows me and um so that's what I think about that again with the testosterone though is I I go back to this a lot with with um blood test how you take the blood test you're working out five days a week did you work out the day of or the day before you got your blood test did you get your blood test done first thing in the morning fasted with at least two glasses of water and no exercise or sexual activity the day ever or the day before it matters and it really matters for your testosterone it really matters so you you Peak your testosterone production in the morning and then throughout the day it's going to come down but the action of that testosterone will continue on and so you won't feel like you have low testosterone but your serum levels will be low and so if you check your your testosterone in you know at 12 or in the afternoon or in the evening it's going to be much much much lower than if you checked it first in the morning if you worked out the day before or the morning up you will have lower testosterone if you have sex you will have lower testosterone that's just how this works and then it balances out later on down the track longterm working out will raise your testosterone but you know it can it can negatively affect a blood test at the time if you work out too closely same with cholesterol it can it can change your cholesterol numbers as well so you need to take your blood test first in the morning between 800 and 9:00 a.m. fasted from the night before 9:00 p.m. only water after that and only water in the morning no coffee or tea or or medications or anything like that it all makes a difference and not even any supplements or anything just just water just two glasses of 8 ounces of two 8 O glasses of water at least so same hydration status and no more than four four 8 O glasses of water in the morning be very calm don't rage out and freak out and get angry at traffic or something like that uh on your way to the blood test just be very relaxed very calm very sedate you know the morning of the day before and a couple days leading up to it and no exercise or sexual activity the day of or the or the the day of or the day before you get your test done it all matters so keep that done especially when you're doing talking about hormones like testosterone you need to keep that consistent or El get inconsistent results and like oh my testosterone went down why is that or it went up and maybe it actually didn't go up so you need to do these things in these in these uh meter uh in this meter fashion or else you're not going to get consistent results you have to have consistent test taking so you get consistent test results uh and so that's what I would do if you're feeling okay and you're feeling better you know just keep going as you are and uh check it again three to six months and just see how you feel that's the important thing I I like getting people off medication so I have I have patients that come into me in my functional medicine practice you know outside of neurosurgery and they you know they they're on trt and I get them going with this and they and they're doing all the things that you're doing and they're feeling so much better they're like hey you know do I even need to be on trt I'm like well no not if not if you don't feel you do and they start coming off and they and they happily come off of this and and their testosterone stays up and stays good so that's um that's my preference is to get people off medications uh when when in where you can if someone's very deficient you know yes you know doing these sorts of dietary measures and exercise will help them will improve things um but it'll take time and maybe they're feeling pretty rotten and miserable right then so maybe you put them on a supplement or something to to bring them back up to you know a better level so that they feel better and healthier and that affects a lot of other things as well you know that's something you can do but if you're already going and you already feel good then just I just keep going and I just keep looking for improvements okay good luck with that question from from Rachel nice to see you Rachel Rachel is one of my patreon members so it's very nice to see you here um my first ever Super Chat glad it's for you oh well thank you very much it's very sweet of you forever your student my healing story um my healing story my first YouTube why I became a carnivore out today and carnivore family has become my family God bless you well that's very sweet and so for people that don't know Rachel just started her own YouTube channel just talking about her story and why she came to carnivore and the that she's having and and how that's been helping her so people should check that out you can click on her name it's um so Rachel Maran Meed and um you can check out her story she's very very sweet and um and I've seen it and I I liked it so very good job U you when you start a YouTube channels just like I did I just you it took me four years to just do it and then I finally did it and then it was easier and so I just did another one and another one and another one and you just you just talk about things that you find important that you think needs to be that needs to have a voice and and and um you know and then you just keep making videos about that and then and then you sort of find your Rhythm on the different things that you like talking about and um you just go from there so good job question from zillan thank you very much for the Super Chat hi one month beef and water recently experienced diarrhea and would wake up late at night by stomach pain caused by diarrhea Maybe should reduce fat intake but I work out a lot and still crave fatty meat any advice yeah so there if you're doing everything just beef and water then and nothing else no coffee tea um caffeine or any sort of like you pre-post workk workout supplements and things like that they may have artificial sweeteners um those can all cause diarrhea and loose stools and stomach pain and upset so if you if you're having any of those obviously stop those even protein powders they'll have artificial sweeteners that that aren't going to do well for you but if you're not doing any of those it's only uh beef and water then uh yeah you know you you can pull back on the amount of fat that you're eating because you can only absorb so much so much fat the other side of it is if you're not having nearly enough fat that you can actually get what's called overflow diarrhea where you get get partially obstructed you get really constipated you get really dry hard hard Rocky stool that's sort of stuck there and and and then there's only sort of liquid stools can pass around it okay so that means you're really not eating enough you're eating way too low fat and so what that will look like is you'll get sort of watery diarrhea and then every now and then you'll get this big Rocky hard very difficult to pass stool that comes out like Jesus where' that come from and then it'll be liquid again okay so that that would mean you're very constipated and you need a lot more fat okay the other side of it is some people just have a harder time absorbing rendered fat like if you have Tallow that you're adding or butter that you're adding or just the you know the the melted fat that comes out onto the pan you put that back over the steak which is good to do because you want that fat generally sometimes people have a problem or or have a difficult time absorbing that it space it goes through them too quickly and they just need to focus on the solid fat in the meat um that usually helps people in that situation another thing is sometimes in in rarer occasions people um can't even really do the cooked fat all that much it's they have to sort of eat it uncooked right and then they cook the steak but they cut off they cut off the the fat before it's cooked and then hey buddy little visitor little rat tail and um you know so you'll have you'll have um just the raw fat and you cut that off and eat it uncooked and then you cook the steak separately and a lot of people do do really well with that there are some people that have a bit of problems after that but um you that that was I mean literally a couple people I've ever seen um still have issues after that and then there's sort of things you can do past that but that that that should sort out most people is generally getting sort of the right balance a first thing is getting rid of all the other all the things besides meat and water that can cause a problem because most people at least have something still remaining and uh and then after that it's adjusting the fat intake and the and the kind of fat that you're taking in as well so I would do that and hopefully that that will sort you out and a lot of people you know it's been a month it's early days so you know some people are just adjusting to the amount of fat and sometimes your body starts making more bile and can absorb more fat down the track and uh and that's that's certainly pretty common so I uh yeah I just just keep going with it and um and uh and those are some some things you can do to to improve it a question from NH thank you for the Super Chat hi from Germany three-month carnivore down 30 kilograms wow that's really great very good good job I'm really happy to hear that not everyone gets the those those results right away like that however you did so I'm very happy happy to see that and um good for you I'm very I'm very pleased all right let's see if we have other questions down here [Music] okay no Insanity Renee thank you for the Super Chat Dr chaffy did you dress up for JT's carnivore calendar um no I I I um I'm just dressed up for work so I'm just going straight into work after this but um I think there is a calendar thing coming out and um I I was asked to do that and I probably will so we'll see we'll see if um uh if I actually do that but that's that's the idea anyway all right there is a Super Chat here from from Annie M thank you very much for that there's no question attached but let me see if there's something sort of in the chat if if this happens if sometimes the the question doesn't get get attached in uh just try to try to put your your question in as quick as you can so I can try and find it in the rest of the chat um because otherwise otherwise I don't see it and I'm not I'm not seeing it so okay so sorry about that hopefully might show up later miss e thank you very much for the Super Chat how to recover from pancreatitis while doing carnivore I can't have eggs and dairy doctor says avoid fats and red meat I'm only two weeks in to carnivore so pancreatitis is is inflammation of your pancreas and that that can happen for a lot of different reasons it does not come from eating carnivore however your pancreas makes all the different enzymes and breaks down all your food including carbohydrates and plants and especially plants because those are difficult to break down but also meat and so really the thing that you do with pancreatitis is you just sort of fast and you just drink a lot of water um so I I don't know where you are in that recovery but people with acute pancreatitis that that are in the hospital you really just need you need to rest your pancreas and so if I were to get pancreas for some reason because you can get it for a lot of Reason like a scorpion sting you can get pancreatitis from that can damage your pancreas um you just sort of need to rest you need to fast you need to sort of give it time and you need to let your body heal a bit hey buddy how you doing and you need to let your body heal so I would I would just if you can it depends on how skinny you are it depends on how how much you know you need U from a nutrition standpoint but if you're if you're at all able to I would just sort of limit what you're eating in general I mean if you're eating carbohydrates you know your pancreas makes am as well and that's what breaks down the carbohydrates you know so I mean really the only thing is like simple sugars you're going to absorb you know like GL like glucose and high fructose corn syrup you'll absorb those without any problem because there's no bonds to break and um you know unless they're telling you to just sort of just you know become a you know hummingbird and just drink sugar water uh you know you still you know uh you know you should you should if you're going to eat I would still eat what you're supposed to eat which is just meat and and if you are you know having trouble I would just sort of limit it and try to just just fast a bit if you can until this sort of sorts itself out that's that's I don't treat pancreatitis but you know from medical school and so on you know what I remember being the treatment is basically just you have to fast these people you know you just have they have to drink a ton of water and when they're in hospital setting they just you just put them on tons of fluids and you just let their body to heal and they've just got to rest and relax and let their pancreas heal because pancreas is involved in the digestion of everything not just meat and fat um yes meat and fat but also carbohydrates and everything else so um that's the um that's the skinny there you really just need to rest your pancreas that means fasting as much as you can and then just small amounts of meat which is completely bioavailable and very easy for your body to digest and absorb it's much easier than than plants I mean only easiest thing is going to be the simple sugars because you don't need any enzymes to absorb those but those come with their their own problems but in a pinch that's um just so people know that that that is something you can absorb without enzymes and there's also and there's also sorry and there's also different you know enzymes that you can take there's there like Creon and things like that when people have pancreatic insufficiency they can take those with the food that they're eating and then they their pancreas doesn't need to work because they've you know they've got these inside going so that that's another option too that maybe you can talk to your doctor about as well but you probably won't need it if you're home with pancreatitis and just recovering from it you know that that means that you're you're on the you're on the road to recovery if you were in the hospital it' be a different story and you'd really need to fast and all that sort of stuff but if you're at home with this then that's then that's a different story and so I would see how your body feels and if you're just just eat small amounts and ease into it and uh you know have big rest periods between between meals just to let your your pancreas rest okay question from s female mid-40s HDL 57 triglyceride 66 LDL uh 235 I think that's great honestly LDL particle number uh 2528 LDL pattern a perfect there you go so you see that good level of LDL good level of glycerides and you get a pattern a epob 153 normal range is 90 to 119 uh LP little a 68 you want under 75 High sensitivity CRP under 0.3 excellent you know just under one is fantastic cacc score 59 hba1c 5.2 insulin 5.4 um her diet doctor listed low carb um listed low carb GP Primary Care wants her to take lipor and aspirin why um well this is just always the the way you know I mean I mean they're saying now that anyone over 50 should just be on stat in everyone regardless of your of your cholesterol um I disagree with that I mean these are things coming from the Staten companies and they're saying that that half of people over 4 should be on them and really and then and then they're moving towards saying everyone over 40 because why because they get to sell more drugs to people this is a drug cartel they're just doing it legally um I just I just don't I don't agree with it and I don't think that you should take their word on their own product I that's really dumb um but if you look at their own research their own studies which is going to be the best light this is ever going to be painted in if you take if if you have had a heart attack and you are taking Statin after you've had a heart attack and you take it every single day for at least five years then you will on average extend your life by five days that's their numbers five days okay and you're getting side effects and problems from the stat all that whole time okay this can cause serious problem cause memory ISS potentially increase dementia your brain is made out of cholesterol lipor in some studies some studies say it doesn't cross a blood brain barrier others say it does and that stops your brain from making cholesterol it doesn't just grab the cholesterol and pull it out of your system it stops your body from making the pattern a large buoyant LDL molecules in the first place so even if you had pattern B and you took a Statin it would actually lower the ones you want and now you have a disproportionately high amount of the type that you don't want right so this can get into your brain and stop your brain from making cholesterol your brain needs cholesterol about 20% of your brain is cholesterol the cell membranes are cholesterol the axons are melinated and insulated with cholesterol and and uh you know saturated fats that's what that's what increases the conductivity of your neurons and allows your brain to work so you reduce the cholesterol in your brain your brain doesn't work as well and and we and we we are seeing that now people have memory issues people are having reversible cases of Dementia or Alzheimer's because they're on a stattin that crosses the bloodb brain barrier and then you take them off those statins and all of a sudden they don't have Alzheimer's anymore in six weeks and then you put them back on and what do you know in six weeks they have Alzheimer's again so that's scary so these things do not come without risks and drawbacks and so if you've had a heart attack you'll increase your your life by 5 days but you could destroy your brain and a lot of other things if you have not had a heart attack doesn't really increase your life at all five days really does increase your life at all it's five days okay so you need to think about that as well your HDL is great your triglycerides are great LDL is associated with longevity and living over 100 so is low insulin which you have so really again this is more to do with a metabolic issue if you have pattern B it's because you have high blood sugar and you're eating seed oils and sugar and alcohol and all these sorts of things and that is damaging your LDL it's also damaging everything else and that's what's causing the problem I think I think that the sdldl the pattern bldl is the smoke not the fire I don't think that's causing the harm because it's 1.7 times increased risk if you have sdldl but diabetes is 10 times increased risk smoking is around 10 times increased risk so that if if you have a strong strong Association then you start think well maybe this is a causitive factor but if it's a weak Association well that why would it be a direct onetoone cause should be a onetoone Association but it's not it's a very weak Association so to me that doesn't scream cause to me that screams collateral damage this is this is a marker an indicator of something else going on and this is being damaged at the same time that's what that says to me apple b that that's sort of like taking your gener your your total cholesterol there are a lot of different things in apple some are good some may be bad uh but you can't really tell just by checking Apple uh Dr Paul Mason does has a great video it's very short it's like um it's it's a YouTube channel that sort of T to take short clips from from different videos and uh and and you can look up Dr Paul Mason app OB and it's sort of five minutes and he explains this in very very succinct detail it's it's great and so that that will put your mind at rest uh LP little a yours is in a good range that's really genetic you really don't really change that too much uh with with diet and lifestyle that's that's pretty genetic if that's high and elevated you just sort of have a genetic predisposition um to to developing atherosclerosis maybe but so what do you do you correct all the metabolic issues um I saturated fat doesn't it doesn't really into it because it seems to be really mostly just genetic you either have high LP little or you don't and um and your hscrp that's excellent right so having elevated High sensitive CRP that's just a marker of inflammation General inflammation and you know if this was just a Ono one cholesterol causes heart disease why are we worried about inflammation why are we worried about diabetes and high blood sugar if it's just to do with your cholesterol right so your inflammation is very low so you you don't have that risk as well so all your risk factors are very low your hb1c is normal you don't have diabetes your insulin is low you don't have insulin resistance um your C score score is 59 or her CAC score is 59 what was it last year two years ago three years ago four years ago right um you know when did she start carnivore when did she you know get these tests done the all these tests are just a snapshot in time you don't know if things are going up down or what the change is so you have to get subsequent tests also chac score just looks at the Hard plaque and doesn't look at the soft plaque so you could potentially have a lot of soft plaque and then that be coming down but your CAC score goes up a bit because a bit of it gets calcified also lipor increases your CAC score it calcifies those plaques and that's called a good thing they say yeah this is really good it stabilizes these plaques okay but I thought you you you didn't want a high CAC score but they're saying you do as long as you're taking their medication so as long as it's their medication causing a high CAC score that's good so there's a lot of there's a lot of weird things going on with this and but by their own numbers by the drug company's own numbers which are as good as it's ever going to get because they're going to paint this and devel and design their studies to be as good as they're ever going to be um 5 days if you've had a heart attack if you've not had a heart attack doesn't really change anything so I would address things metabolically those are much greater bang for your buck and I honestly don't see uh anything wrong here um you see a c score is mildly elevated you really only get worried about it when it's over a 100 but um you know obviously zero is nicer but you know you you've had a long life uh before today and it could be a lot of things that that contributed to that and also that doesn't tell you about your soft PLS either and what they're doing or they going up or down so um I would just if it were me I would just I would just keep eating what we're designed to eat and allow my body to work the way it's designed to work and uh in most cases people improve and that would be that would be my bet with her as well uh aspirin aspirin has a lot of data behind it showing that um Health uh benefits to longevity so I I'm less concerned about something like that the only the main concern I have with Aspirin is just from a surgical perspective we have someone come in they hit their head all of a sudden they have a big bleed they need surgery but they're on aspirin so they might die in surgery from bleeding out sometimes you can't operate um sometimes you do just to try but maybe they're on like dual antiplatelets that's like just that's just a non-starter um aspirin is very difficult i' I've seen people you know very normal simple operations die because of because because they were on aspirin um because everything was perfect and and fine and dry as hell and and then you close up and then all of a sudden they're not waking up well and something else is going on and you do a scan and headful of blood so that that's a very that's a danger and if you have a bleed or you have an injury or you have you know stroke or something like that and your own aspirin you get a minor bleed turning into a major bleed that needs surgery that now can't get surgery because you're on the aspirin so it's a bit of it's a bit of a catch 22 sometimes and so that's that danger but there is actually a lot of studies that that um and a lot of data showing the longevity benefits of aspirin so if you know I I'm not too concerned with that but I take it on an individual basis I don't take Aspirin because I don't think I need Aspirin but and I don't want the the health risks and the bleeding risks that come along with it but that's that one I'm I'm you know I'm a bit agnostic that that depends on the situation um Statin I just I don't see that ever being a part of my life or my practice you know I mean there may be exceptions to that I mean people that increase their life by five days I mean this is this is on average right so there are people that extend it more than that so there are going to be a cohort of people that this benefits but people are thinking now that that's not to do with lowering the cholesterol is to do with this an anti-inflammatory effect that has very mild aspirin's better right you know so that's why we take Aspirin because it's an anti-inflammatory antiplatelet and so that that can have that sort of effect and that's probably why it's helping and that's probably why the Statin is helping because it has a mild anti-inflammatory effect as well but a lot of people they even proponents for statins say yeah it's probably not anything to do with the cholesterol it's probably really just to do with the anti-inflammatory effect okay take a take an anti-inflammatory then and and and leave the stattin at home that would be that's sort of my thought process and um you know I have cholesterol numbers similar to that my HDL is higher um my triglycerides are lower like I have like three times the amount of HDL is triglycerides uh but my LDL is similar you know and I have pattern a and so I'm I don't feel that I need a St for my life but of course everyone's individual and so hopefully that that gives a bit of information and insight so that that she can make make a more informed decision on whether she wants to take it or not I have a video just called the truth about cholesterol and heart disease and I just go through a lot of the study and the data and the history about how this was used as a scape cat and so maybe watching that showing that to her can give her more information also I did an interview with Dr aim multra who is a Interventional cardiologist in the UK and he wrote a book called a statin-free life and he is not really big fan of these things people want to take them he'll give them to him to them but like he describes what I've described to you like this is this is what you get out of it you get five days or maybe no days and and it comes with these other risks and if that's but if that's what you want then sure you know but um so you can watch those and and then see what you think and go from there and good luck with that orange Dragon thank you very much uh for the Super Chat question asking for stepmom I have hemocromatosis um can I do carnivores since I can't have red meat if so how much can I eat and how often since I have to stay on a very low iron diet so the thing is is that all these things are sort of beholden to our biochemistry and our metabolism and and how our body is working or not working properly based on what we're eating so we don't know how all of these things actually end up panning out long term um if you're eating what you're supposed to eat what do I mean by that I mean that you can have derangement in your in your body that we call a disease that uh just sort of clears up when your body eats a normal diet so um I I don't have too much experience with hemocromatosis however Dr sea Baker does he has a large over 10,000 12,000 15,000 people in his Rivero system that they track numbers on and they do have hemocromatosis patients and he's found that actually going on a on a cornw that actually improves their numbers um so it could very well be that this is more to do with how your body metabolizes iron rather than how much iron you're getting in of course that is the case right because if you're eating a normal amount of iron and you're getting you know a bill up in your iron that's that's you know far too high your body's not processing iron properly right so if you get back onto a normal diet and you get away from these sorts of metabolic disruptions could very well be that your body works properly there are plenty of meats besides red meat so you can you can definitely do a cornivore diet without red meat at all you don't have to have any red meat at all if you don't want to um so you know chicken fish pork you know all the rest Seafood and so if that's if that's what you want to do then then go for it see how you feel see what your numbers are doing see what's going on with that but then you can always try the red meat and and if if your numbers are improving everything's getting better you go like wow okay maybe this is something to do with how my body's processing iron not just the amount of iron that's coming in then you can try the red meat and see how that that affects you as well and that starts creeping up you don't like that then you know fine you can stay away from red meat you don't need red meat there are a lot of other meats out there but you may find that it actually improves things now maybe it doesn't change anything at all and maybe you eating red meat or white meat or seafood or bread and pasta maybe you're just your level's just staying up here no matter what you do and that's like well then who the hell cares eat what's best for you apart from that and then treat the hemocromatosis which is usually with blood lightting and um with the doctor obviously not at home and so that's what I would suggest is just you know do do some self- experiment see how your body works and see how you feel and and uh and if you can uh do red meat great and if if not then you don't need to it's uh it's not required pound for pound of Beast thank you for the Super Chat I've been carnivore since January 1st best feeling ever blood pressure down lost over 30 pounds blood work improved that's awesome I'm really glad to hear that triglycerides down HDL 54 Etc but my LDL go did go up I feel amazing but my practitioner concerned uh what's your input on that well my input on that is uh we have studies looking at people we give them 36 eggs a day for several weeks and their and their cholesterol changes not one iota but then you have studies showing that when people fast and just stop eating all together their slams up right so why is that because you're now in a fat burning fat mobilizing metabolism and you need to mobilize fat and that's what LDL is for it's moving cholesterol and things like that around your body and so that's what I think is going on this is a transport molecule that is transporting fat and cholesterol right so you know when you're in a fat burning metabolism you're going to need more of this stuff that's my view anyway and if you eat a whole bunch of fat and cholesterol your CH your cholesterol doesn't change however if you just stop eating carbs or just stop eating all together slams up okay so I mean again this is not this is not really uh we've been told it it was and more people are understanding that dietary cholesterol really has nothing to do with your serum cholesterol but fasting does not eating carbs does so it's fasting bad for us now it's fasting causing heart disease it's just not eating causing heart disease doubt it um in fact most people recognize we have a lot of data on the fact that fasting regular fasting and religious fasting has significant improvements in overall health and so what are we doing here again why are we worrying about LDL it was a scapegoat it was blame for something it never did the Journal of American Medical Association published in 2016 actual internal memos from the sugar companies detailing how they paid off three Harvard professors to falsify data and published fraudulent studies to make it appear as if cholesterol caused heart disease when there were studies coming out showing a strong correlation between sugar and heart disease so they're like okay we need to get the the the focus off of sugar one of those professors was named head of the USDA and he was the one who authored and published the 1977 USDA declaration saying that cholesterol causes heart disease saturate fat increase cholesterol stop eating both well that's wrong that was a lie it was a lie then it's a lie now and so that that would be my input on this um Jesus Christ you feel the best you've ever had your blood pressure is down your blood sugar's down your insulin's down all your Bloods are improved proving your triglycerides are down your HDL is up you've lost 30 pounds you feel amazing and your doctor's going stop it immediately that's cognitive dissonance you know you're seeing something in front of you working and being better and I guarantee you that doctor has never seen that happen before I guarantee you they have never seen that happen to that regard now ask your doctor if you just took LDL out of the equation and you just looked at everything else looked at your overall health look at all your other blood work what would you say they'd probably say well that whatever you're doing keep doing it because you're awesome and you and you and you are and you were improving dramatically and they would be very happy for that so if you just don't if you don't consider that and you don't look at that what does the overall picture look like we get so fixated on that that little number and I and I just don't think that it that it warrants that amount of attention I I really don't so that's what I would do and uh and and again watch the the video the truth about cholesterol and heart disease that I do on on YouTube here I think that's one of my better that is my best one on cholesterol and um and then the interview with with Dr Asim mahro as well that's um uh that that talks all about statens and things like that and he he's he is definitely of that opinion that uh this is this has been uh we've been completely misled and we really need to rethink um the whole cholesterol model of heart disease uh Super Chat from from Peter Weeden thank you very much for that there's no question attached but I will try to scroll down and see if there's anything um in the chat maybe put down afterwards let's see okay I'm not seeing anything uh sorry about that Peter if you had a question if not we'll just thank you very much for the super chats very very kind of you um let's see how many more questions we have okay guys I think that's I think I have one two three four five six seven eight more Super chats um probably need to cut it there um and uh one more just came in so so maybe we we'll we'll maybe cap it there um because I I don't want to I don't want to not get to any of these and if we have a bit more time I I'll go through some of the uh just general questions that are in the chat if I can but I just don't I don't want to run out of time and not be able to to answer um all the super chats so question from low carb low drama thank you very much for the Super Chat do statins fix atherosclerosis they stabilize calcification uh meaning they increase CAC score isn't that bad in theory does it matter whether your score is 50 or 300 or a thousand heart attacks happen to people with cs scores of zero thanks uh yeah look so so a c score looking at the Hard calcified plaque but that doesn't say anything for your soft plaque so you could have a lot of soft plaque and yes if you had a big soft PL and that ruptured that could clot off and you could have a heart attack or a stroke and that's the idea of oh well it calcifies it so it hardens it so it doesn't break as easily honestly I don't know where that came from um I I I I wonder I've always wondered about that like has that actually been shown or is that a theory because the the problem is is that what what if you guys pay attention to this stuff long enough um you you'll find that a lot of things that are just thrown out there in medicine are supposition and it's just like oh well there's calcifying well you know I bet that makes it more stable okay well maybe there's some evidence for that maybe that's based on that evidence but but a lot of times people just say like I bet it does and and they just run with it and because somebody in in an authoritative position that that people respect a lot has a lot of of uh clout they just go like well this guy said it so that's it and people repeat it and repeat it and repeat it and then it's then it's there I mean this is this is the idea of propaganda from from Hitler and the Nazis is that you make the LIE make it big and keep repeating until everyone believes it okay so maybe this was not a lie but the repetition makes people think that it that it's true right and so it could have been just a best guess a lot of things are best guess in medicine because you we just don't have perfect data because you can't run randomized control trials on humans long term throughout their life you just can't right not not in in a rigorous way like you can with with lab animals you can keep because thish is perfect you can keep them there their whole life and you know you can't do that it's not ethical or practical you know because people live a long time and uh you can't enslave them and just you know just take them away from their families and just just raise them as as guinea pigs you can't um you know we do that with guinea pigs so that we don't have to do that with people but it's it's an incomplete model it's not a good model and actually was watching something yesterday by Dr Baker talking about that's some of the problems the limitations with our our research on fiber is that a lot of these studies are done on mice well I mean they're designed to eat you know carbs and fiber and things like that so they're like okay uh so it's good for them oh look at that it's good like yeah it's good for a mouse is that good for us though not necessarily so um as far as uh these things go with us it's sometimes it's best guess and you just sort of do the best you can as very well-meaning people trying to just give people some information some guidelines say hey maybe this is a good way to go and then people start doing it and then you start being able to see more population wide statistics on that still pretty weak evidence but at least it gives you some data and then you can extrapolate more uh from that and then everyone forgets that you needed to do it in the first place because everyone just know oh yeah everyone knows that this is is the case so I always take these things with a grain of Sal as far as do statins fix atherosclerosis I don't think there's any evidence for that it's increasing the CAC score which a lot of people will say that's a direct indicator of your risk for heart disease um whether it is or not or if it's improving things temporarily while your soft plaques are depleting and your CSC scores up temporarily and then that comes down who knows I mean these things are transient sometimes there's a flux there's an ups and downs and things like that so you don't know the directions and the flow you don't know the end result of what's going to happen so I I also take that with a grain of salt however if you're eating a lot of bad things and smoking and drinking and eating crap and your CS is going up and up and up I would take that as a direct sign of of danger um I don't I don't know of any information that suggests that Statin fix atherosclerosis the idea is that they just stabilize the plaques but they don't reverse them if that makes sense so you know that uh and and again you know we're saying that that a CSC score is bad but then we put you on a Staten for that high CSC score and then your CSC score goes up and then that's justification for putting one more stats it's a bit it's a bit backwards it's circular logic and so uh no I don't I don't know of any any any any any uh information that even suggests that Statin reverse atherosclerosis um and I don't think they don't they don't make that that either I think the only like actual Interventional trial that has been shown to reverse atherosclerosis in humans uh was meditation reducing stress meditating for 40 minutes a day calming the hell down reducing your cortisol chilling out taking some me time and that actually that actually uh reduced plaques okay so there will be other things that that reverse atherosclerosis I am sure I would bet that doing a very non-inflammatory diet like a keto carnivore diet getting a lot of this garbage out of your system stop smoking stop drinking stop eating seed oils and all the rest that you you can your body can heal from these sorts of things but we don't have studies on that it's just that's what I've been seeing anecdotally and so there are case reports that that are going to be coming out you know like Dr Jamie Seaman her husband reversed his atherosclerosis by going on a keto carnivore diet I think it's more keto but very close to carnivore both of them and you know reversing his atherosclerosis he's a doctor as well and so there she was saying that they they might P that as a case report great you know so you know there are things that that will likely reverse this Statin I don't think [Music] it okay um question from Super Chat from Ben n thank you very much for that three weeks carnivore somehow haven't pooped in two weeks uh yeah well that's the thing you know when you're when you're eating a bunch of plants in fiber you know roughly 90 well estimated my estimation is around 90% 95% of the plant itself is fiber right so that's its structural component you can't break it down you can't absorb it you can't use it it has to come out the other side right um exactly the opposite for fiber or for for when you're only eating meat you will absorb if you're eating meat and you're only eating meat and you're not eating it with fiber or a bunch of proteas Inhibitors and other sort of Digestive disruptors and tannins and things like that that block your body's ability to break down and absorb uh the meat that you're eating you'll absorb roughly 98% of the meat you're eating if you get rid of the gristle and you're just eating the just the soft meat and the soft fat nearly 100% and so you have very little waste coming out and so that's why um if if it's dry and hard that is constipation it's not the frequency it's the consistency so you go on to Bristol stool chart b r i s t o l and that shows you if you're constipated or not it does says nothing on there about oh it has to be every day or six times a day it's the consistency and the quality of of the stol not the frequency of your movements so if it's every two weeks but it's soft you're fine if it's every two weeks and it's hard Rocky and and difficult to pass then that's not fine you need to eat a lot more fat so it's the fat that drives your digestion not fiber and in fact fiber can can block you up more and because it's just more mass it's more stuff to get stuck but the fat keeps it soft right and it doesn't matter if it gets dry your colon is supposed to dry out your stool tools that's its job it's why are we fighting against our own biology we have to move it through as fast as possible so this evil colon doesn't take all the water away it's supposed to take the water away um it's not like oh danger time clock go you know no it's it's doing its thing it's supposed to dry the stuff out H if you have enough fat it'll stay soft so that's what I would do is um is just judge it that way and um if you're getting if you're getting that overflow diarrhea you're getting liquid stools and then every now you're getting pebbly hard stools that means you're really really constipated you have to eat a lot more fat really ramp up the fat and uh and just see how you go I I did a a uh a thing on YouTube just say you know you don't need fiber and parentheses fiber constipation and diet and um that goes through a lot of that in a bit more detail so you can check that out as well Jay go fast thank you very much for the Super Chat 40 to cornivore a little over 100 days down 40 PBS that's awesome very good job my lab came back 158 triglyceride still HDL 44 sugar 98 LDL 450 C score zero any reason uh why the high triglycerides well again these are snapshot time you have to keep getting consistent results also time of the day fasting status how long you've been fasting the longer you're fasting the higher those numbers go up and um and so on your hydration status you know are you taking any medications did you uh exercise the day before the day of have sex all these sorts of things it all matters it all changes everything so if you take your cholesterol you know multiple times throughout the day you're going to get multiple answers so just depending on the on the on what's going on during that day so um also stress I have seen people that have had you know pattern bldl and they're just stressed out to hell they're doing just just you know meat and water and you know they're trying to exercise things like that but they're just absolutely getting crushed at work or some sort of issues at home and and their triglycerides start creeping up and their HDL starts creeping down so all these things affect you so make your life as as good as it possibly can get the proper sleep reduce stress as much as possible uh exercise so sprinting lifting weights take your Labs consistently first thing in the morning fasting from 900 p.m. you know so go back to where I was talking before about about labs and how to do those do those exactly like that um I'll probably do a a video just a quick video on how you should take your Labs that people can check out too because it comes up a lot and um uh but you know your sugars are great I bet you your fasting insulin is great um the triglycerides and htl really just looking for signs of metabolic issue like your sugar is being too high and and you're and having diabetes or something like that and and that can be that can be consistent with a pattern B type of cholesterol right so that's that's the main thing um I keep an eye on that um from that perspective right so if your I mean your triglycerides aren't like massively high and your HDL is in a good range so that's good so you likely have pattern a LDL so that's good so you know I don't think that's a bad thing it it will likely when you when you keep going and you optimize things and you take tests in consistent manners that should still improve as you go your HDL will come up your triglycerides will go down but uh that right there is actually still good and you're doing great you've lost 40 pounds and um and uh you know I would I would hope that you're feeling really good on top of that as well so that's that's a bit of a rundown on triglycerides but you know that's not a bad number and your HL certainly isn't bad and it will probably improve from there but you already most likely have a pattern a LDL and that's what we're looking for really we're looking for signs of metabolic issue and and the pattern of your LDL which indicates that you're bringing something in your body or not that's damaging or not and causing metabolic function dysfunction or not so that that's where we go with that so Eric hle thank you very much uh for the Super Chat that um let me see I'm not there's no question attached let me see if there's something down the line okay not I'm not seeing anything uh but thank you very much uh for the Super Chat I appreciate it driving Mia thank you for the Super Chat are supplements needed for low stomach acid so I'm assuming you mean low acidity is in higher pH uh generally not generally you just need to stay out of your own way you need to stop taking medications that lower that like ppis or or um or or or you know Anta acids and things like that so definitely need to stop those and then you just want to then you just want to you know if you are worried about that that your stomach acid isn't isn't concentrated enough you know this is when you avoid different like liquids and things like that like like water just don't drink much water two hours before a meal and or during a meal or after a meal you know give it give it a wide birth on when you eat and that'll keep your your stomach acid very very concentrated and so that's usually what most people do there are supplements that people can take if they actually have a problem with their stomach acid I I I don't know how often that is though I would I would expect that to be exceedingly rare and if you sort of get out of your own way and you stop uh eating you know things that aren't great for you and you stop taking all these medications and supplements and things like that that that can you're like the anti acids that can disrupt that almost everyone will be fine with that so I would I would especially if you avoid water within two hours of eating sort of before and after eating if you're really worried about it so I I would try that so so see how you go try just not taking any of those things don't drink water you know two hours before or after you eat and uh and see how you go I would I would I would bet that uh that you do fine and that that that you digest things just perfectly well oh sorry um okay people are adding in some some more Super chats here guys please please don't add any more Super chats in guys because I I've got to go in a couple minutes I'm going to try to go through these pretty quickly uh Dr chaffy uh should I have portion control I eat as you said nothing after six I confess once in a while I have an espresso with whipped cream and drink tea I started to exercise 45 minutes a day well that's great um you can well you can eat you can eat after six um um shuriken and I have have spoken previously I can't remember if I said to not eat after six maybe there's a reason for that but in general people don't have to have to um uh stop eating after 6 I mean I eat right before bed often because it makes me tired and lethargic and I just go right to sleep and I like I like sort of being fresh and basically on an empty stomach the rest of the day because I have just better energy um portion control uh your body normally makes gives you natural portion control h when you're eating a natural diet because it just stops tasting good there are there are few people that will be an exception to this but the vast majority of people uh will be able to eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and and your body will naturally proportion it actually proportion that out and so you know you want to try to have leftovers you want to try to you you want to make a bit more than you think you're going to want to eat and then you have you get to the point where you go I'd really rather stop right now that's how you know you're getting your body giving your body what it needs so in fact you're trying to maximize what your body is taking in right you can force yourself after this and it will taste bad and you'll be really miserable and you won't enjoy it it will take a long time and yes that's overeating so you should have control in that sense not to do that not to push yourself past the point that that your body is telling you directly stop this right now we don't want this um but that that's pretty much it and if you're drinking you know coffee and tea that can actually suppress your your appetite a little bit so I would I would still definitely try to get as much as your body's asking for and keep eating until fatty meat stops tasting [Music] good uh lady G tarot Spiritual Living that matters thank you very much for the Super Chat there's no question attached let me see if there's anything below sometimes this happens um that that the question doesn't attach or maybe sort of hit send before the question is in there so if that's the case just just try to put it in the normal chat and okay I'm not seeing it um okay well maybe I'll show up later but thank you very much for the Super Chat I appreciate it DC Donnie thank you for the Super Chat uh 28y old male 5 foot 11s 160 pounds under 10% body fat great job never been over 175 uh never been over 12% body fat awesome very athletic eating over two pounds of red meat and drinking broth butter and still not gaining weight how do I gain pounds for rugby um our bodies are made differently and and we have you know different sorts of maximums that our bodies are going to want to get to but the main thing is you just need to stimulate your body to grow sprinting I'm sure you're doing that in rugby and lifting weights you also need rest periods so I've had when I was playing rugby I'd just be working out so much during the season I would lose 30 40 pounds of of muscle you know I'd be very very bulky very strong you know not not fat right like that maybe you know not you know 6% body fat or something like that but I I wouldn't really be much more than 12 or 15 and I'd be much bigger and then I just I Dro 30 40 pounds easily it would be difficult to hold on to that during the season because you're just you just go go go go go and it's very hard to eat enough and you don't get the rest days and then all of a sudden we'd have a bye and I just would do nothing for a week and just like i' be 10 pounds heavier at the end of it and like leaner so it's it's kind of crazy how that works um your body builds muscle on the rest days right you need rest days you don't want to overtax your body you need to rest you need to give your body what it needs you need to stimulate your body first and foremost you need to give your body the the food and the amount of food that it needs to have the building blocks to grow and you need to give it the rest days to grow okay you can overtrain and you won't put on muscle you will you actually slim down because you're just you're not giving your body a chance to recover so that's what I would do you're already running you're already sprinting great lift weights Like A Champion eat a hell of a lot of meat and give your body rest days you're going to need to uh eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good so over two pounds is great if that's getting you to the point where you just have to put the fork down and go I don't want to eat this anymore and you do that twice a day if you're working out hard because you're going to need a lot more than somebody else would who's not working out as hard as you are and when I'm working out and I'm pushing myself I my body doubles the amount of of meat that it asked for so that's what you have to you have to work for so you need to you're going to need to work in meals if your body's asking for that you know I was talking to uh Ryan talet who's the NCAA division one All-American two-time All-American in the cathlon he switched to carnivore halfway through his season his and his season took off he was an All-American that year won the Big 10 championship um next year got second in the Big 10 and and allamerican honors again and he's down at the PanAm games now competing in Chile which is awesome so I mean this this guy's going to be like in the running for the Olympics right he's up there anyway and um you know he was he was losing weight and it's just like okay what what the hell do I do I was like you need to figure out where you can get food in you know because you need enough food you need to get these meals in and you have to do it at a time that you're you're still able to train on an empty stomach and have enough and then eat straight afterwards and then give it enough time before you're your afternoon training and things like that so you just have to sort of figure that out when you're going to get food in you need to get enough food in and um and then he had the opposite problem he said he had to actually pull back on his workouts because he was putting on too much muscle it was like he was getting too big too muscular and he's like hey I need to keep my weight down so I can jump higher run faster right so good problem have most people have the opposite like like like you're having here so that's the main one you're eating the right thing you're working out properly I'm assuming you are and um you know now you just need to get enough food in and and I think that'll take care of that after that you know our bodies do have a maximum that they're that they're willing to get up to naturally um I wouldn't suggest doing this unnaturally because it has a lot of Health ramifications long term and you don't need it you can get extremely strong extremely uh muscular and extremely athletic um by doing this naturally with you know just those three simple things work your ass off eat a lot of meat and enough meat so your body has what it needs to regrow and give your body rest days you'll you'll have a very you'll have very good results with that you know like I think was it Mike ner or something like that he was a you know one of those those big time bodybuilders back in Arnold's day guy worked out like three four days a week and he worked out for like 20 30 minutes he did one rep one one uh set to failure he was just like yeah you need rest days you need you work out you stimulate it and then you rest that's where the that's where the the benefits come from so you can definitely overtrain and and that will hurt your results as as uh instead of giving you more so more is not always better Damen Williams thank you for the Super Chat awesome content your video discussing the deficiencies in cats eating cooked meat bothered me I only eat well done meat while consuming four raw eggs uh egg yolks three times a week help avoid deficiency um well certainly you're going to get a lot of nutrients from that um make sure you know where you're getting your eggs from so they're not like contaminated or Sal vanilla or anything like that I eat raw egg sometimes too but you know that that's a risk so you know do that um at at your own risk um so well done meat for cats is is a no-go it's um it's going to give them the toine and other sorts of uh nutrients that are essential to them that they have to have that um they lose when you that you lose when you cook cook the meat we don't we don't need torine to the extent that cats do we make it uh maybe some people me more or less maybe it's better beneficial if you get more could be but it's not strictly essential but conditionally it could be essential if if you don't make enough or you need more for different demands uh same thing with carnitine people say oh that's that's not essential only 70% of people make enough carnitine to make it not essential 30% of people need to have some in their diet it only comes from meat um so that's that could be the case with torine as well I'm not too sure and there could be other ones as well the the difference between us and cats is that we have been cooking meat for at least 800,000 years and probably using ovens for 800,000 years so or that sort of oven technology and uh that's a long time so whatever happens to meat when we cook it we're we're well adapted to that at this point um we're probably cooking meat longer than that actually so home sapians came around earliest 300,000 years ago and so we've been cooking meat for at least half a million years before Homo sapiens even existed right so homo sapiens were developed from people that were already cooking meat so we should be very well adapted to cooking meat so I I don't get too worried about that there are people that eat a lot of well done meat I I prefer it more rare more raw that just tastes better to me um I I don't eat liver often very rare uh but also I eat it very rare if it's if it's cooked it doesn't taste good it's a bad consistency I actually just got some liver yesterday and I S was cutting it up and I was going to just sear it very very lightly just sear each side keep it raw in the middle and just sort of had some raw I'm like that just tastes good on its own Raw Liver tastes way better than cooked liver to me I'm sure there's a lot of people that are that are vomiting next to their computers right now but you know that that's how that tastes to me so um having some raw egg yolks probably fine or even just you know lightly cooked you know softboiled or or um just lightly fried where the yolk is still uh still pretty rare that's probably fine too um but um I don't get too worried about the The Well Done meat if you're feeling good and you're doing fine I think I think you probably be okay if you want to add in some raw egg yolks I don't think that'll hurt you anyway if as long as it doesn't have any sort of contamination so any case good luck with that b carnivore good to see you buddy uh you're looking great you're doing God's work well thank you man I I appreciate that SN thank you for the Super Chat I have chest pain for more than 24 hours now ate only meat tea butter and cheese went to ER EKG x-ray BMP um everything was normal what do you think this might be well there's a lot of different causes of chest pain you know if it's a sort of a Sharp piercing pain it's first worse when you breathe in or you push on it that's going to be muscular celal it's going to be in in the rib cage as well so it you know you did the right thing you know you went in you say oh could this be my heart yes it very well could be so you go in you get it checked out that's the most important thing and then they investigate and say is this cardiac related chest pain or maybe a pleses a lung uh issue you have a pneumonia or something like that that's causing chest uh chest pain um and they ruled those out so likely this is more muscular sceletal or something else you can get some of precordial syndrome I think it's called you sort of stabbing laser pain just just this weird stabbing pain generally sharp pains aren't uh you know like a heart attack sort of thing you can have sharp pain towards your back it's like this tearing burning or tearing ripping stabbing pain that can be like a tear in the aorta or in the lower aort if it's in the lower back um and that's something just a good rule of thumb for anyone to know people over the age of 65 with acute severe uh acute onset severe back pain U that's just new just bang out of nowhere that's a bleeding till proven otherwise okay so you just go get that checked out especially if you're on blood thinners or anything like that like aspirin or warin or or any of the do the noax and things like that like River Rox ofan and calto and things like that um just good to know but there there are a lot of things that can cause chest pain the important thing is you get it checked out and and make sure it's nothing serious um meat's not going to cause that meat's not going to cause any sort of cardiac pain or chest pain or damage to your heart that I know of um and so it's not going to cause heart disease either from uh from what I can see so I would um I wouldn't I wouldn't be too concerned about that if your doctors would check this out and they don't think that there's any it's not cardiac related or chest related then it's it's probably just that muscular pain muscular sceletal pain and good luck with that if it gets worse or it changes character you get shortness of breath with it or something like that or it just keeps persisting you you it's fair to get it checked out again and if you're concerned about it I would definitely get it checked out again you know sometimes people you know check something and it's it's early on it's just not picking up and then you know it's something but something's developing it's just too early for the the the tests to show it and it becomes worse and gets better if it gets worse if you're worried about it if it's persisting and and you're worried about it definitely get it checked out again that's important to do and it hopefully is just nothing even then but always important to check but it's not to me causing it anyway um Sales Spirit 99 thank you for the Super Chat can keto cornivore cause keto acidosis also what meet foods for 9 to 12 month Voyage without Refrigeration uh no it does not cause keto acidosis um so a nutritional ketosis is a metabolic State keto acidosis is a is is a severe um medical emergency and it it has to do when you have zero insulin and um and you become you have such high ketones that you get become acidotic and so you have acidosis with massively High Ketone so that you have to have both so that's that's a medical condition that just shares that same root of Keto not the same thing um so no you don't have to do that uh foods for a nine-month voyage well think about the Vikings right they had barrels full of salted meat and that's what they you know they sail all over the world they they made it to America right in like I think the 11 1100s or something like that or maybe the 11th century I'm I'm not sure I think l Ericson is believed to have gone to North America Northern Canada maybe even Northeastern uh America so that's what they had they had salted meat packed in barrels and a buttload of water right nine months of water that's a lot of water but uh that's what they did you could also make pkin so you grind up there's a lot of recipes online you can look those up but you grind up dried meat and uh you blend it up really fine add in rendered fat about three you know 3/4 of a pound is about 2,000 calories right so 10 lbs of pkin is 10 days at 2,000 calories a day so you can sort of calculate out what you think you're going to need you can also fish right if you're on a boat Voyage if you're on a land Voyage you probably be able to restock somewhere but um but that's what I would do I would use pkin dried Meats uh salted Meats things like that cured meats that's what they're that's what they're there for they there to you you slaughter a pig or an animal and you don't have refrigerators so you need to dry it and cure it and repair it so that that can stick there in your ler for years and you have food and don't die Lori Olsen um thank you for the Super Chat saying GBM yes Thomas C free protocol is Kia a concern GBM is Glo blastoma multiform that's a a very severe form of of primary brain cancer um Thomas C PR protocol for people that don't know that's he's one of the top cancer researchers in the world he's over at Boston College and he's has over 150 peer-reviewed uh papers in in the literature and he's he's a very very good man I I think he's doing amazing work and he truly cares about this and he's not just trying to make a name for himself he has a name um he uh really is trying to help people and so people should watch that that interview that I've done with him with Professor caed it's excellent it's it's one of my favorite favorite ones that I've done and one of my favorite conversations i' had a lot of amazing conversations um that was that one I was very very very uh excited to do H because I I really look up to him um is Kia a concern Kia is when you get lose so much weight you just look very very gaunt like a cancer patient yes that is a concern you you need to keep your GK your glucose Ketone index down below two or below one if at all possible for as long as possible with a combination of Keto carnivore carnivore is keto should be keto especially in this case you really need your ke ketones up and your glucose down and um that gets your gki glucose Ketone index so you do that with a combination of your diet and fasting if you need to because fasting can really bring that gki down because it brings your ketones up and your and your blood sugar stays at at a low nice level so if you are limiting the amount you're eating and you're even fasting for a number of days yes wa too much weight loss is a concern and so you need to refeed on these other days so the other days that you are eating you need to get enough and so maybe your gki sort of comes up a bit okay well this is we're looking at averages over time and so for that day you refeed and you're and your maybe your gki goes up a bit I mean your your blood sugar will come up maybe a bit with big bullet of protein um and maybe your ketones will come down a bit but it shouldn't really go crazy and so see how it affects you if you're keeping your gki down you may not need to fast you may not need to limit your your the amount of meat that you're eating if you do find that that sort of comes up when you eat and you need to fast you need to limit the amount of meat that you're eating on certain days you need to refeed on other days so you need to make sure you're getting enough food on the days that you know you can on certain days so that you can weather the limitation of of food on the other days so that's that's that's the idea and that's a very important question and I um you know I I wish you all the best with that or if it's a loved one who's dealing with that or if it's just a general question and for people that are in that situation uh that's important to know about so um I will end with just one one more question then I really got to run guys um Ryan Parish why does Paul Sal youo believe there is adverse long-term effects to ketosis does long-term ketosis really lower testosterone I have not seen that certainly hasn't happened for me or any of my patients I've been doing this for six years I've not eaten carbohydrates except for the odd glass of milk once every year or two and um my testosterone's great I'll be putting out a I'll be doing a video when I find the time going through my blood work I've just have my blood work done was about sixy year mark and uh everything's great so not too worried about that um long-term effects of ketosis I I've looked at a lot of the literature and I've seen studies with with people that are looking at people in in ketosis for for two years for 24 months and they did not see their cortisol going up they did not see uh different issues metabolic issues and problems um they they found that everything was actually great and they improved so I did a a video with a friend of mine Richard Smith Goes by keto proo on um online and and we we talked about you know is ketosis harmful is ketosis bad for you and we go through a lot of the literature and you know we went through some of marola's um uh interview with um uh Georgie dinkov a really nice guy and we had a bit of a debate on on this subject and so people can look at that as well that's not on my channel that's on Brian uh grin's Channel if i g r YN I believe I if I've got that wrong I'm sorry and people can take a look at that as well and um and you we just we had a very friendly conversation about it um uh Paul and I had a very friendly conversation about it on his channel was a bit of an issue with our Wi-Fi it was it was hard to connect so it wasn't as free of a back and forth but I think we both um got to say a lot of what we we wanted to talk about but um Richard and I it's like two hours where we going into the literature on this I don't think that it's bad I I believe that this is not a fasting metabolism this is not an alternate metabolic State I think this is our primary metabolic State this is the primary met metabolic state of really most animals in the wild cornivore and herbivores because they all run on fat and protein carnivores because they eat animals with fat and protein get some glycogen in the muscles and if and if that's doing it if that's doing the trick it's fine you're still getting you know what you need from eating just meat whether you're in ketosis all the time or not I don't know I don't I don't really care all I know is is that we are we've been eating meat for a very long time and I think that that's where how we're optimized and we're metabolically optimized that way as well and so you know other animals are doing that as well you know the innuit you know they're eating meat maybe there's some glycogen in that maybe that kicks them out of ketosis maybe I don't know but they're just eating meat and that's and that's the main thing I don't think that you have to eat anything else I don't think you have to eat plant-based carbohydrates right so that's not you know that that's certainly um not to say that we're in ketosis all the time but we are certainly eating a ketogenic diet all the time right like just meat anyway we're not eating any plant carbs or sugars and um you know lions are in the same state they're just eating meat right also herbivores though because that's actually what they they break down fiber into they don't get carbs from fiber and plants they break the fiber down into fat and protein because it's actually the bacteria that eat the fiber and they secrete fat which the cow or the gorilla absorbs and then the bacteria die off and they absorb that as protein so they get fat and protein from eating carbs so they don't get carbs so they're all in this ketogenic fasting starvation State I don't think it's a starvation State I think that's our primary met State and whether we or not we go in and out of that I'm not I'm not too worried about I just think you eat what you're supposed to eat and your body's going to work the way it's supposed to work whether that's in and out of ketosis you know 24 you know 20 hours a day I I don't know 24 hours a day I don't know but I think that it's very clear that that we've been designed to eat meat and I and I you know if we're in that Ice Age if we're crossing a land bridge across the bearing straight um you know in the last ice age there's there's no plants and carbs to eat there's just marine animals and marine life to eat and so you know if you had to do that if long-term ketosis was harmful like you you die out you know or you'd get used to it which is what you know I think we are and and carnivores in general are always in this state so I don't I don't know why that would not apply to us when it applies to all of them Dolphins don't need a selection of tropical fruits every now and then you know neither do lions so I don't think I don't think we do either and that's just my two cents on that um but I go into much more detail with my friend Richard on that that episode of um you know you know is ketosis bad for you so okay everyone I I stayed a bit longer than I meant to uh thank you all very much um and uh thank thank you all I I have to stop there but thank you all I really appreciate you all uh coming on to this I going to try to uh keep doing these at the same time every week um I'm not going to have like the three hours all the time but I can I can certainly try to um do as much as I can before work so thank you all very much I appreciate it I'll have another um oh actually I have an announcement as well on Sunday this coming Sunday I'll be um putting out my episode with Dr Casey means um and she's a Stanford trained Doctor Who was going into ENT and then decided that look everything's metabolic we need to treat metabolic diseases and so she she she changed her practice to treating metabolic disease similar to what I'm doing now and she started a company called levels which you know you have constant glucose monitors and things like that people can check that out we'll have a discount for people who want to try that that we have like a discount for a week after we post that that'll be on Sunday and uh she's a very interesting lady very knowledgeable in the subject and and describing exactly what we're all talking about here which is like we have this plague of a metabolic disease so that will be coming up this Sunday at 400 p.m. Pacific Standard Time 700 p.m. East Coast time in the US uh 7: a.m. in Perth and what 9:00 am in uh in Sydney middle of the damn night in Europe so I'm very sorry for that but that's that's sort of the best time and uh so people check that out please come for the premiere and um and check that out that's going to be a very good episode and uh and the more people in the premiere commenting liking sharing the the better going to do and the better it's going to to to hit with the algorithm and and it's going to be suggested to more and more people so thank you all very very much and I look forward to seeing you next time bye now"
