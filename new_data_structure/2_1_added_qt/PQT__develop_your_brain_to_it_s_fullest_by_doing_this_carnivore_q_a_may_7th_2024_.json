    "body": "member says my 2 and 1 half-year-old son is non verbal recently diagnosed with autism now follows a strict diet of fatty meat and eggs cooked in butter and ghee and fruits one is butter and ghee uh with the casan okay and two do sugars in coconut water and fruits impact his development thanks so um to answer the second one first just the sugars in anything is are going to uh kick him out of ketosis and they're going to change his brain from running on ketones which are op which are the most optimal for his brain to running on glucose which is secondary energy source and his sub opal is not as good and will actually slow down his mitochondria not being in ketosis will uh curtail his mitochondrial development and neural development as well you want those ketones especially in uh growing brains have to have it so ketones are the primary energy source of the CeX and two-thirds of the brain and even when there's enough uh glucose um even when there's enough glucose there is uh your brain will excl or those parts of the brain will exclusively run on keton still and so you want to you want those ketones in the brain and also ketones cross the blood brain barrier reconstitute into fatty acids which then make up the physical Matrix of the brain so you know 60 70% of the brain is made out of ketones or or out of fat I mean and so it's uh it's very important to get that so any sugars from anything so sugar is sugar is sugar is sugar is sugar you know the glucose and fructose in uh fruit and coconut water is exactly the same as the fructose and glucose in high fructose corn syrup and table sugar and honey so uh and the glucose in uh starches is the same glucose as in fruits and everything else so it is it is the same there are some other vitamins and and good things that come with those fruits and the coconut water but the the sugar is the same and so I would I would definitely avoid that um as far as the butter and ghee is generally great yeah I mean if he the the casan is just going to be in the butter it's going to be out of the ghee so that's the idea of of ghee is that it's um it takes out the milk solid it takes out those proteins and so it won't have that casin in there there's not too much in butter but there is there there are a little bit of the proteins and the milk solids in there most people do fine on that most even with autoimmune issues people do do really well on that um you can try you can do trial and error you can just try uh cooking in ghee or cooking in um Tallow grass-fed Tallow and uh and see if he does better you know try it you know few weeks on few weeks off but by and large for most people uh butter and ghee are fine uh the fruits um you know I would I would avoid you know especially the sweet fruits because the the key here is is a you want to be just providing just the the optimal nutrition for him um which is meat but you also he wants to be in ketosis as well and so it's really important to do that for his developing brain and and the longer you're in ketosis the more you turn over your um mitochondria and the organells inside and switch them out for better faster stronger versions of themselves that uh will work better and will help the brain develop better and uh some people like Professor Chris Palmer from Harvard uh argues that a major issue with autism and the mdev of these neurons is a mitochondrial disorder and so you really need to be in ketosis long term after several months on ketosis in ketosis um you will have four times the number of mitochondria and they'll be four times as effective there's a very very big uh benefit it to being in ketosis so I would avoid the the sweet fruits definitely and um and and hopefully that uh really helps him a lot it certainly does help most people who do it and so good luck with that",

    "body": "member says if the keto diet effectively treats drug res resistant epilepsy would it work on those who take anti-seizure medications my colleague has been on anti-seizure drugs for 25 years and has never heard of a keto diet thank you for your time and passion yeah that that is something that really bugs the hell out of me um they just basically just said you know drugs are easier just just go down that route they work the the the treatment for epilepsy was ketogenic diet and then they started getting drugs and the drug company started pushing that and and just saying oh no no just just use the drugs just use the drugs and so we we started teaching people differently in residency and and and and directing research away from ketogenic diets helping epilepsy uh Professor Thomas C freed when he was doing his post-doctoral uh work over at uh Yale he was in the neurology department there and and he was doing research on ketogenic diets and epilepsy and the and the head of the department just said oh now we we've got good drugs for that now you know it's dead end research don't worry about it you know it's easy just you know give them drugs drugs work you know don't don't about that um so you know I mean that's uh you know maybe he could have been well-meaning but I I I just I think that that's almost certainly due to his the influence of the drug companies you know having him sort of push research away from uh any any alternatives um but you know John's Hopkins um at least last time I checked I found a paper that they published it was a while ago is an older paper but um you know that at least at the time they were saying hey you know this is this is still a really good treatment modality this is still something that we use uh it's not just for treatment resistant um epilepsy it was for all epilepsy um it's just that now it's just like well you treatment resistant and if somebody knows about it thinks about it they say oh well you could try this not everybody does a lot of people just don't even think about it don't even know about it which is crazy to me um really don't suggest it because oh but if you stop doing ketogenic diet then you could get seizures again if you stop taking your freaking anti-seizure medication you get seizures again so I mean what the what's your point it really bugs me um so sorry for swearing but like it bugs me because I've I've seen neurologists um argue with parents who want to put their kids on a ketogenic diet they're no no no just keep taking drugs just keep taking drugs it's like what the hell is wrong with you they're having seizures on the drugs and they and they're desperate to help their child and you're telling them that they're going to hurt their kid and kill their kid by doing something that you admit will work or should work and can help oh but if they if they stop then they're going to get massive seizures first of all no the longer you go without a seizure the less likely you are to have a seizure first of all second of all um you know just just getting out of ketosis it's not like it's just like this rebound effect like oh my go worst seizure ever no it's it it gets better and also don't come off the the the diet then that's easy right you know it's just like not coming off the drugs no have to take the drugs or you're going to have a seizure again all right well then don't come off the drugs oh but don't go on a ketogenic diet because if you come off the ketogenic diet then then you'll have a you you have a seizure like the same argument like you're telling people to stay on the drugs for the exact same reason okay well then stay on the diet you know so it's um you know it's it's just a bit of a weird weird thing but uh no it's not just treatment resistant it works for every well it it will work for a lot of people there are going to be people that are keto resistant you know that that aren't going to do as well um you know for memory things like uh the if you have like an actual epicenter like a like temporal lobe epilepsy would have this part of the brain that's just actively firing it doesn't work as well for those those types but um no it it works for you know not just treatment resistance it just works and I A lot of people are coming off their seizure medication uh at an appropriate time with appropriate uh care from their doctor doors uh or or help from their doctors to wean off these things because you have to wean off these things it's not safe to just come off uh for most of these and um and uh so you know it's um people people are people are coming off of these things all the time uh without an issue uh well not without an issue but they're able to wean off you know a lot of people with with brain tumors like um like um uh Andrew barboro he um he you know he would um um what's going on here and also he uh you know he he got off all his his seizure medications as well and um so you know and he had a had a brain tumor so he had a reason for that um but yeah no you can you can definitely uh do a ketogenic diet and and it should uh help you know raise his seizure threshold even with the medication to make it less likely he'll get a seizure and um improve his his uh his case so yeah so g ood luck to him I do think it would help yes",

    "body": "member says new uh new Doc thinks that I have an enlarged aorta and will be testing for that uh know nothing about this what causes it and can clean eating help like my eight months of carnivore statins in the future I'm 68 so an enlarged aorta um now I'm not not a cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon but just from medical school and things like that um you know there there there are various ways of enlarging the aorta you can get things like an aneurysm that's typically from atherosclerosis or very high blood pressure and just putting a lot of pressure out and it's just sort of bulging the pipes um and um and that can cause issues with like aortic valve regurgitation if it's sort of in that proximal part of the aorta as well um so that's sort of as much as I know about it I mean I don't no one's really told well you know asked the question about you know diet affecting these things it does depend on what's causing it you know if it's something inflammatory and and you know atherosclerotic in nature then yeah I think that your your diet and lifestyle have a huge role to play in the development of atherosclerosis you know smoking drinking sugar seed oils you know excess carbohydrates and um and a bunch of uh you know nasty plant toxins you know aren't aren't going to aren't going to help you um you know causing you know High a lot of high blood pressure damage to the the artery walls these sorts of things um you know low B12 because you're not eating all that much meat and then High home assisting damaging the interial walls of the arteries things like that so um so depending on the cause it could potentially try to mitigate that is it going to reverse that anybody's guess probably not you know I mean there are are these things that we we sort of damage our our bodies in ways that we don't necessarily recover very well from but you know sometimes you have connective tissue issues you know some people are are thinking that um you know if you aren't aren't making proper collagen um then you you may get sort of weakening of this tissue and that can and push this um and so you know going on a carnivore diet quite often people with connective tissue disorders and collagen disorders like Ellers Danos uh will will um will actually see Improvement and they don't have the joint dislocations anymore I I have three patients that I see that don't have joint dislocations anymore and with ell STL and I've spoken to many others online and done some consultations with them as well and seems to help uh a lot of people so you know still you know I'm I've personally consulted with less than 10 but you know that's that's not nothing and um and uh no one else is getting Improvement any other way so it's interesting so it just depends on what's causing the the enlarged aorta and whether the body can heal from that or not I can't tell you really one way or the other Statin I think most people know my view on statins I think it's treating an issue that doesn't exist that that you know lower it stops your body from making LDL but you want LDL that's why your body's making it it also stops your brain from making cholesterol as well which is really bad idea because your brain is made out of cholesterol and U some key components are made out of cholesterol so now you're not going to be able to have enough substrate to build and repair and uh your brain and then recover from from different sorts of uh you know wear and tear and and and insults and things like that so it's actually really important to let your body just actually run in in a normal physiological pattern so um I you know if you want to see more on that just watch my video on uh the truth about cholesterol and heart disease because and then also watch and and I you know go through a lot of studies on that and talk about a lot of um a lot of papers in that and historical records we go through and I link to nearly all of them I I don't think I have all of them all of them put in there but most of them in the description and then you know go watch um Dr Paul Mason has tons of of amazing lectures on uh on um statins and and um heart disease and saturated fat and things like that as well Zoe harkham does as well she has some excellent lectures also on all that so I would check those out and then and then you can make an informed decision on uh whether or not you think that that's that that's good for you uh Dr David Diamond does as well and he even talked about some studies looking at people with Alzheimer's who were on statins that could cross a bloodb brain barrier and um and so they cross the bloodb brain barrier they stop your brain from making cholesterol and is that a bad thing uh well at least in these these sort of Trials or these these papers they s seem to suggest that it did because people with Alzheimer's that were on um statins they were taken off the statins and six weeks later they didn't have Alzheimer's anymore when you know and then they were put back on Statin and the Alzheimer's returned six weeks later so you know this is um you know it's pretty it's pretty good that we have that out there so we say okay hey we can make a more informed decision as patients and as as doctors like oh okay well maybe this isn't the first thing I just slam everybody on uh maybe maybe we think about this but you know the the problem is is that people are still doing this wanly oh well no no that's just we just still have to do it you know and like you're hurting people you are actually hurting people and so uh that that's sort of annoying but yeah that's what I would look at it just depends just take a look you know hopefully it does help uh it doesn't matter what's what's causing it and um you know if you have some sort of connective tissue issue um you know maybe that's at play and potentially that could be helped as well so good luck with that though hopefully that um hopefully that gets better or or at least doesn't get worse and that you feel a lot better on a carnivore diet as well",

    "body": "member asks 56y old female carnivore for four months um cholesterol 5.5 triglycerides 1.1 htl 1.4 statins well I just yeah I I don't feel that statins are treating anything useful because it's it's it's reducing something that doesn't need reducing and because cholesterol was never the cause of heart disease so it certainly does reduce uh your your LDL and total cholesterol and so what uh that was never the cause of hard disease some people ask me it's like well is there what what LDL would be too high well nothing that your body's going to make physiologically in a normal condition um first of all so if you stop eating for five days your LDL goes right up right um it goes up exactly the same as if you just stopped eating carbohydrates like you went on a carnivore diet it's almost as if it was a metabolic issue and had nothing to do with um eating fat and eating meat because it doesn't has to do with eating carbs carbs going are going to suppress that down eating seed oils with plant steriles that's going to suppress that down because your your body thinks you have more than enough cholesterol so it's going to stop making it and so uh that's what's going on uh so we're we're reducing something that does not cause heart dis oh but what if you have too much what about too much well you're not going to make too much physiologically there probably is too much and you maybe get there someday and what would that do but what whatever it gets to it's not going to cause heart disease because cholesterol does not cause heart disease just doesn't you know the only randomized control trials in existent in existence the only extent uh randomized control trials on this subject have all shown that lowering LDL cholesterol does not improve cardiovascular outcomes not and then two of them actually showed that lowering LDL cholesterol causes harm and more people die of heart attacks and strokes by by replacing saturated fat with margarine and plant oils and um in very controlled setting where they had 10,000 people that were institutionalized so the the they controlled every meal that came to these people for years and they found that yeah replacing saturated fat and butter and animal fat with margarine and um and those plant oils that yeah that that did reduce LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol and guess what more people died of heart attacks and strokes as a result so this is this is a bad idea to do that okay so what if it gets too high what if it gets too high it's not going to cause heart disease because it doesn't cause heart disease so it'll do something else but you're not going to get too high physiologically your body's not just going to make too much of this stuff so I don't know how you would get too much LDL or total cholesterol it probably do something but no matter what no matter what level it gets to it's not going to cause heart disease because it's not the cause of heart disease plain and simple and also you know just going back to this uh that looks great your HDL is higher than triglycerides that means you're metabolically healthy it means you H are very likely to have pattern a LDL there's hundred different kinds of LDL and uh from that pattern you have the good ones you know so this idea that oh my God you're going to get pattern B if you go carnivore never seen that in my life um one guy one time had pattern B and remained on pattern B after six months of carnivore and that was because he had an intensely stressful um work uh situation and um and you know but after he switched out of that and the stress levels reduced and his sleep got better uh that just corrected just corrected on its own so you know there are other outside factors that can affect this you know stress um serious stress will raise cortisol that will raise glucose that will oxidize and glycate your LDL and cuse a pattern B uh type pattern sure but um that's not anything to do with your food and anything to do with what you're eating so you look great so that looks fine I wouldn't worry about that um so another followup member: faint 1 millimeter infar in 2022 on MRI um scan uh anti-platelets well that that's something you have to talk to with your doctor about on if antiplatelets are warranted um so you know it does depend on what sort of caused that um you know sometimes anti therapies can can help in all this but just going onto a very lwi inflammatory diet like or an anti-inflammatory diet like a carnivore diet can can definitely help but um those those sorts of things you need to talk to your doctor about um because you know I don't I don't you know I don't have enough information and I can't give you uh you know medical advice in this capacity so good luck with that do do follow up with your doctor if this happened in 2022 and they thought that antiplatelets were the right thing to do they probably would have put them put you on that at the time so just whatever you know I I would go with your doctors on on this one as as far as medications are concerned",

    "body": "member says uh big fan U thank you very much I appreciate that a friend's cholesterol is high even though she is not really carnivore should she be concerned is an indication of another health issue trying to get her on full carnivore um it's it's typically more to do with being in ketogenic ketogenic state so it's um if you just stop eating for five days your cholesterol goes up if you stop eating carb for five days your cholesterol goes up you know so if you check and depending on the time of the day you check your your cholesterol if you fast for 10 hours versus 14 hours you'll have different cholesterol numbers if you test your cholesterol 10 times through the course of a day you'll get 10 different results it's a a pretty fiddly test um which is another reason why may it's it's a bit useless but um it's more to do with that that's that state change that metabolic State change so if you are on a keep enic diet it's not to do with eating meat it's to do with not eating carbohydrates and your your your uh cholesterol tends to go up when you don't eat carbohydrates or you just don't eat you know but it's not not eating it's not eating carbohydrates so when you're eating carbohydrates you have way too many carbohydrates in your blood way too much energy out your body's just trying to get this out of there because High car high blood sugar actually harms you causes direct harm and damage is what kills diabetics it's high blood sugar right and so uh your body's trying to to get that down and so when your insulin goes up to to do this it locks down your fat store you can't mobilize energy and so you know uh what mobilizes fat from your fat cells to your liver to make energy it's cholesterol this is how you transport these things these the these transport molecules like HDL and LDL they transport fat around the body so you're running on fat when you're in a ketogenic state right if you're not eating or just not eating carb hydrates so you're running on fat you're running on your own fat Fuel and should you need to transport that fat you running on more fat you're going to need more uh uh LDL and HDL to to transport these sorts of things so that's what you're going to find you just stop eating for five days your HDL is going to go up your LDL is going to go up triglycerides are going to go down if you just don't eat carbs for five days your HDL is going to go up your LDL is going to go up Trier are going to go down you carnivore HDL is going to go up your LDL is going to go up triglyceride is are going to go down it's almost as if it's a physiological process that's normal and it is and typically when people are healthier and they're fitter and they have lower U BMI they're less less obesity um lower lean more lean body mass they typically have a higher corresponding rise in their cholesterol right and people that are more obese they tend to not have that rise in cholesterol so it's actually a marker of Health you know that your LDL goes up in that situ situation everything else gets better all your other blood markers get better your health is getting better your weight is getting better your body composition is getting better which is more important than weight weight doesn't really matter it's body composition and health and so all these things are getting better and objectively the numbers are getting better and then your LDL is going up but it doesn't people that are less well until they get better so why are we calling that a sign of poor health I call that a sign of good health so uh I wouldn't worry too much about that um I would watch the uh my video on the truth about cholesterol and heart disease i' show your friend that as well because it's just a con you know this was this was made up by the sugar companies they invented that idea and then they paid off a whole bunch of people like anel keys and other you know demons from hell that that pushed this on people and ended up killing you know billions of people at this point um and and ruining people's lives so um you know it's uh and and then they're still just changing the go post it was total cholesterol and then it was LDL cholesterol then it was L sdldl cholesterol now it's app o just they they keep shifting from point to point it was never cholesterol in the first place stop making up you know this is just nonsense just move on with your li fe",

    "body": "member says give me the big rant: Dr marola says a carnivore diet is calcium deficit Dr lustig's Facebook post yesterday said that meat drives Coline drives tmao drives heart disease high protein drives mtor uh that's cute I haven't seen Dr lustig's um Facebook post so I don't know uh sort of what he's talking about there but um you know does it you know I first of all who why are we saying that choline is a Bad Thing Chine is required for your brain uh now we're saying that's bad apparently you know tmao and all all these sorts of things these are these are all mtor all these sorts of things these are these are one part in a very complex multibillion piece puzzle and uh and machine and so and we're talking about just like one thing is clicking off here it's it's really myopic and missing the force for the trees when you just look at this one little thing and this is everything there's nothing else that matters is just this one little molecule and it's just like so even if it does drive up tmao is that necessarily going to always cause heart disease in all contexts forever probably not same with mtor you know and uh and also that's just it's assuming a fact it's not an Evidence there's absolutely no hard evidence that any of that stuff is true um so it's um and and flat flat out answer is no of course it doesn't because like you know the heart disease rates in Inuit when they when they're just eating meat basically non-existent same with the Messi when they're just eating you know high fat you know uh meat and in their traditional diet now that they moved to more grains and more sugar and like that yeah that's going up yeah absolutely but when they were only eating meat non-existant you know there's that study um uh I might be able to find it and put it in the chat but um if as a study back in uh the late 2000s um oh no sorry not the late 2000s the the late 1920s that um that's uh the I actually have it here I'll put it up in the chat in the late 1920s that um put in the chat now for people who want to check it out late 1920s that that found um uh they looked at the Maasai (tribe) looked at the Kikuyu (tribe) and Kikuyu (tribe) were largely plant-based Whole Food plant-based growing it themselves no pesticides no no pollution anything like that just this perfect idyllic situation they were very sick they got much more sick than the Maasai (tribe) um and the Maasai (tribe) didn't barely got sick at all they never really got sick the males certainly were less were the most healthy out of all of them um both males and females from the M Maasai (tribe) and Kikuyu (tribe) the male Maasai (tribe) were the healthiest the female Maasai (tribe) were the second healthiest and way down distant third were the Kikuyu (tribe) women who had a more diverse plant-based diet and the dead last were The Kikuyu (tribe) Men Who at mostly grains I've seen um you know Liars on the internet pushing a vegan that that completely lied about that um uh study and said that the the Kikuyu (tribe) women were the most healthy out of all for complete and utter they were better than the men the akiyu men uh but they were worse than both the males and females of the Maasai (tribe) what about the Maasai (tribe) mtor what about the Maasai (tribe) tmao um what about the Maasai um you know calcium and they drink a lot of milk but where do they get that milk from they get that from an animal well how how much calcium is in Grass how much calcium is in meat I mean I get is that enough for bones well I don't know why don't you ask a lion they have bones you know and um you know they drink their mother's milk and so they get a lot of calcium there okay yeah I guess they're drinking milk where did the mom get the calcium to make the milk she's just eating meat she's not drinking someone else's milk she's not drinking her mom's milk it was just like this you know wor oroborus where you just like you just just drinking milk milk milkk milk milk milk milk milk milk we just drink each other's milk and pass along the calcium to make each other's milk that's not happening right so they're getting the calcium from the meat that they're eating so you're dumb you know so obviously there's enough calcium in that meat right or else they wouldn't have any milk or they wouldn't have any milk they wouldn't have any calcium in their milk and they wouldn't have any calcium for their bones either because um you know baby cats are all mammals they drink their mother's milk and then they get weaned onto their mother's diet when they're very small when they're very young and then they eat that D for the rest of their life when lions are weaned onto and humans are weaned onto meat that they're still very small and so the majority of their bone growth and Bone mineralization happens after weaning happens after they they get off their mother's milk so it's not the milk that's doing it and again the calcium from the milk has to come from somewhere right um so you know the thing is is that you know you can you can say all this stuff and you can say oh well there's not enough calcium in there well okay where the hell does it come from the thing is is that when you're not eating with plants you're not getting these antinutrients that are blocking out the absorption of calcium you're not getting with oxalates that goes into your bloodstream and strips out the calcium you need way more calcium uh you know in those circumstances just to get anything than you would than you would otherwise also what about bone mineralization you have um bers cats they fed raw meat and cooked meat the cooked meat ones got sickly got small the Next Generation were smaller more sickly and had less bone mineral dens density and Bone mineralization and uh it was like from 14% to 7% and then the third generation was down to 3% right there's the exact same amount of calcium in cooked meat as raw meat right so it's not about the amount of calcium there's enough calcium there obviously because the raw meat cats had bones and made bones in their kittens and those kittens grew up to be adults with bones um the calcium was fine it was something else that was lacking in the cooked meat that made it impossible for them to function normally in a physiological manner so they weren't able to to mineralize their bones properly to make proper collagen um because you know they have torine and other sorts of amino acids that were getting cooked out that they require so that's what that's what's going on so you know you're looking at these things you're looking at at a mixed diet and we're looking at these uh rdas they were made up by some named Ancel Keys who I I don't trust a damn thing that guy's ever done because he's just a paid shill sellout and probably a spawn from Satan sent to this earth to destroy humanity and he um he came up with these damn things but he came up with them at a time when everyone was eating a mixed diet and so maybe that's correct for people on a mixed diet but that's not necessarily correct for anybody else because you don't need 10 milligrams of Vitamin C A Day To Save off scurvy on a carnivore diet you just don't you know because you you don't need Vitamin C in the first place to make collagen otherwise I'd be dead right now my vitamin C when I checked it was was Trace right so look at that you don't need that for scurvy right um so it's uh it's nonsense and so these rdas they only matter in the context of a mixed diet so they're saying well there's not enough calcium here because we know well no we don't because you haven't checked the rdas and the requirements for people that don't eat and don't eat plants that have anti-nutrients and block out the absorption of of calcium and strip out the calcium from your body they gave people spinach back in the 1950s spinach has a lot of calcium it's not bioavailable and they come with oxalate so in fact they gave them spinach because of all the calcium and people's calciums went down as a result of that right because none of the calcium was available to them it's not bioavailable it's all locked up in in bonds that we couldn't access right and couldn't break down and then the oxalates would get in the blood and strip out the calcium so if you're eating this crap you know uh then you're you're going to damage your body's your body in general but you're also going to damage your body's ability to maximize its nutrient profile in in the food that is bioavailable so um and again you know it doesn't matter what any any study says it doesn't matter what any you know really smart guy I have a lot of respect for Dr Lusty he's a very smart man but it doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is doesn't matter how smart you are if it doesn't agree with experiment it's wrong and The observed phenomena is that when people exclusively eat meat they don't get heart disease there was no heart disease to speak of certainly not rampant deaths from heart attacks before the 20th century in America or Europe just didn't exist in any real numbers there was a couple in Europe in in uh in America the first diagnosed um death from heart attack uh on autopsy was in 1912 it didn't exist before then right U they just they didn't see any of these things maybe they happened but they they were doing thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of autopsies um like each doctor would be doing hundreds of these things and they just never saw these things and they was like hold on a second that's you'd see that you it's not a subtle thing someone dies from a heart attack it means they have a blockage that kills an area of the heart and that muscle ruptures and has a massive blowout bleed and that stops the heart funny enough or they survive that it doesn't rupture and it scars down you have a whole side of the Heart Ball just scarred out and thinned out and then it might rupture or it might form an aneurysm out here are very you know not subtle signs right so you would notice that and yet they you we weren't seeing any of that stuff on autopsy not C certainly not to any great degree and uh and then all of a sudden 10 years later 20 years later it's a number one killer in America that's funny that's odd we don't see any of these things and now they're the only things we're seeing you know that's complete so we were eating plenty of meat before that the Native Americans the Plains Indians these guys really to be 110 120 sometimes 130 plus years where were their heart attacks when they're just eating bison what about the Inuit when they're just eating um you know uh seals and everything like that you don't get these things Anthropologist calls this the diseases of civilization um you know you get these um populations you know they have like you know uh they get injuries accidents infectious diseases it's only when they they sort of go into society and C cities they start getting the diseases of civilization um and the disease that you see in developed in developed countries and why is that these people are living plenty old but they're they're just not developing these diseases and people I saw this one idiot on um he's a doctor and he's an idiot doctors are people and some people are idiots that's all there is to it U this guy was on Tik Tok can't remember his name maybe someone remembers his name in the chats or something like that maybe they saw it but this guy he look something that Paul saladino said about you know there weren't really heart attacks in the 1800s and we were eating far more meat and uh he just goes like a well that's ridiculous people just weren't living long enough in the 1800s to to develop these sorts of diseases that guy's a he's um he's just pushing a really shitty ideology and trying to profit off of it um and he's he's a bariatric surgeon by the way so he's a he's a weight loss surgeon so um it's in his best interest to have really bad advice on weight loss right because um you know if his advice was so damn good he wouldn't need to operate on anybody uh but he does because he's he's a hack um and he's and he's just too stupid to even just look up the numbers I mean it's really easy I mean it's just like just just Google's your friend you just look this up I've got the statistics on my phone they got statistics going back to 1850 through you know the the 19 or the 2010s showing average life expectancy from birth and so it's just like yeah sure you know um life average life expectancy from birth uh in 1850 was only 38 does that mean that people were dying in their 30s that they were just dying of old age in their 30s well that'd be funny because the minimum required age to run for president of the United States was 35 and that rule was come up with they came up with that rule in the 1700s right so that's pretty odd people are just dropping dead of old age um you know or just getting killed by things everyone was just dying in their 30s they just weren't living long enough to develop heart disease and people do die of heart attacks in their 30s right but if the minimum age was 35 obviously that wasn't the geriatric population was it right that was a minimum age um Ben Frank was like 64 at the beginning of the Revolutionary War right I mean do I don't I don't I don't know if people actually think anymore you know they certainly don't look up it's really easy they can just check well people were dying there but but wait were they do I know that because people speak so authoritatively and and some of these things they have no business doing it some things they they that's the thing people you know um Thomas Sowell writes a lot about this about intellectuals you know because they they're really good at their area and they get so used to being an authority figure and just know like well I think this and I I spent 20 years 30 years in my field I know what I'm talking about and they just know what they're talking about so much that other things that they haven't spent 20 30 years looking into they just be like they just they just have this preconceived notion they're like oh yeah people died in their 30s back then yeah authoritatively what did you look at it up is that from your years of research and and clinical experience that you're you're coming at this no you just pull it out of your ass and it fits your narrative and so but now you're speaking authoritatively because you've been youve so used to speaking in that manner for so long so it's complet completely under garbage uh so no people were not dying in their 30s they were certainly living long enough look up every Founding Father you know um you know John Adams was 91 when he died and he he was born in the mid 1700s right Jefferson was like 82 you know all these other guys were in their 80s and 90s unless they were killed by something you know like George Washington died but in his his what late 60s or 70s but you know he he got sick he got pneumonia and they just kept like doing blood leting and cupping and all these sort of horrible things they basically killed him you know they just sort of just ex sanguinated him the poor bastard um he probably would have just been fine just let let the let the poor man rest but um uh he ended up he end up passing away as a result of these very well-meaning people most likely who knows but um but either way you know he he was he wasn't he didn't die of old age and he was plenty old enough to get heart disease and yet didn't get heart disease and he smoked and he drank four out of five men smoked in the 1800s where was that where where was that with heart disease why is why is why I mean that that should be a high risk and yet people weren't dying from this stuff you see it on on autopsy you can see some plaques they saw some plaques going back hundreds of years yeah but no heart heart attacks they're just like what's that and they recognized it as pathological they're like that's not supposed to be there that's normally not there that's wrong that's different H I wonder why that is so we documented that we did see this stuff but it never hit the prevalence that it did or or got bad enough to like actually stop people's um you know stop people's circulation and cause heart attacks or Strokes until until the 20th century and it's not because we were living longer so if you look at those statistics 38 from birth but infant mortality rate was very high and so that's an average because a lot of kids are dying in infancy the adults have to live a lot longer than that to pull that average up from zero right so you know that's a big difference and so the the PE people taking those statistics were a lot more intelligent than that that idiot Tik Tock doctor um who was like like this white-haired guy I mean he's he's a grown ass man he should some grandfather presumably he should know better than to just talk out of his ass and just make up that he hasn't looked up um so the people making the statistics much smarter than that guy who doesn't know how to think um probably wasn't taught how to think um in life expectancy from birth was 38 but if you live to be 10 years old it was 56 big difference right so you made it to 10 years old you make it to 56 you made it to 20 you'd live longer and so if you made it to adulthood you made it out of those early years where you can get killed by something or dying a war or famine or something like that the majority of people were actually living similar ages to to what they are now and that's what this that's what the the statistic showed and that's the official statistics so they went decade by decade of year and decade by decade of life it's a whole big chart and so in 1870 if you live to be 50 you were going to live this long on average again these are averages and they had that go up all the way to the 80s so in 1850 they tracked this out if you made it to 80 on average you make it to 86 now it's 88 right not much difference but the simple fact that they kept records and statistics on people getting to their eighth decade means that there were enough people getting there eth decade that it was worth taking statistics on right so I mean use your head I mean you just look up famous people from that era and how long they lived how long how old was was Mark Twain when he died you know my great-grandfather was was born in 1875 he died in 1975 at home fully accomplish MST he was a 100 years old born in 1875 right and um where where was his where was his uh um you know death at 30 I mean like he should have been I guess dead at the at the uh you know the turn of the century you know according to this guy this genius I mean how many people you see in these pictures they're just they're old men in the 1800s in the 1700s I mean Socrates was in his 70s and they had to kill him right and he there's no accounts in Plato oh my he's just the oldest man on earth I was like no one just could could imagine that anyone would live that long so you know this is just these are these are very very very shortsighted View and I would I would I would say that the marola is saying that calcium deficient is a short-sided view as well because it's not clearly your The observed fact is no it is not you see carnivores eating meat not chewing Up Bones getting calcium where did the calcium from the bones come from you know and of the animals that they're eating and then you know making you know calcium in milk and all these sorts of things and just and just being so reductionist that you say well meat has Chine Chine will drive tmao TMO will drive heart disease and high protein will drive mtor will it though and will it do all of those things the evidence is strongly in the negative it does not do any of that crap and um I yes I would bet my life on it and I am so thank you very much oh and it drives cancer what are they on about yeah smoking crack that's all there is to it yeah I actually really like Dr lustig I don't know why why he he's arguing that but you know the whole mtor thing I went into this with with um uh Professor Bart Kay um who uh you we sort of went into that the whole idea with mtor is that you eat protein it gets into your large intestine and there's certain bacteria there that could work on that protein that may secrete mtor and that could be absorbed and that may cause a problem lot of ifs ANS CS mayz or butts and uh because the but there is if you don't eat meat with plants and fiber and antinutrients and proteas Inhibitors protein is not getting your colon in the first place you're absorbing it right and so you know you're not it's not going to get down there so even if you had those bacteria which you may or may not because you're eating something different so you may not actually cultivate that bacteria right so even if you had that bacteria there wouldn't matter because the protein's not getting there anyway so it's a moot point and and I think people just really don't understand that um and if you're eating meat in a mixed diet and you have all this other crap in it that's delaying the absorption it's going to get there yeah maybe maybe and does that do something in your body that's negative maybe but maybe not there's literally zero hard evidence of that it's all conjecture and supposition and again it's a moot point because br's not going to get there in the first place because you're not eating it with a whole bunch of other stuff that's going to delay the absorption marola never really a fan of marola I I sort of half watched some of his things early on really wasn't impressed and just sort of got bored with him pretty quickly um he's pretty flighty pretty just goes where the wind blows him so he's all pushing oh keto keto keto and then one guy says one thing about Ray Pete and he's just like oh my God keto so bad you're all gonna die like okay okay you know but um you know I I and then just saying things oh it's it's deficient in calcium and yet it isn't so you know in real practical terms it isn't so there are people doing carnivore right now that have carnivore babies there's the Inuit who exist as a species generationally and their kids eat a bunch of meat they make milk from the calcium they get in meat and the kids eat meat and they build more bones and so it is it just does not fit The observed facts and if things it doesn't matter what your theory is it doesn't matter who you are if it doesn't fit The observed facts it's a dumb Theory I mean it's just it it's not even like the you know if if it doesn't meet with experiment it's wrong if you if you have a theory and you look out in the world and you see it goes completely counter to that theory it's a dumb Theory you need to throw it away or you need to think about it and go like oh okay I didn't I didn't realize that I didn't think about that um but if it's in your face going like well then how do lions make milk and you trying to make excuses for this or whatever you know it's just like okay well how did the innuit make milk you know if you don't say like okay yeah good point I guess I guess it's not what we thought it is I guess the RAS aren't really what we should judge this by you can't do that you know it's it's a dumb Theory and if you've looked at all that but no but the RDA the RDA said it you know you're being you're being kind of stupid at that point so Debs thank you for the",
