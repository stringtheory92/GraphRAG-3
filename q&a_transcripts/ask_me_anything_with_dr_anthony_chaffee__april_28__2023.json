    "title": "Ask Me Anything with Dr Anthony Chaffee! April 28, 2023",
    "transcript": "sorry about that I for some reason uh YouTube was not let's not let me just get this get this to work so I apologize for that um just gonna go live on Instagram as well now that we got this is everyone able to hear me no yes perfect okay all right so I see there's a couple questions that have been asked a couple super chats things like that I will get to those um just let me get this all set up and then we'll get going okay okay all right all right so I'm live here on YouTube uh and Instagram so we'll just get some of the questions uh that have been asked already so I'll start up at the top here uh with some of the questions that came in on Super Chat thank you guys for doing that um and we'll see here so so Angelique the annihilator great name uh thank you very much for the Super Chat I really appreciate that um they asked does carnivore prevent and reduce severity of bacterial infections by starving them of glucose it's certainly not going to hurt I mean there are a lot of bacteria that do run on glucose they run on other things as well like you know the different sorts of nutrients in and of your body so but it will um but it can absolutely reduce bacterial infections for that reason that's a that's one of the reasons why diabetics type 2 diabetics are um more prone to infections they just have chronically high blood sugar but also that chronically High insulin is going to cause other problems in their body as well and and disrupt their normal immune system their innate immune system so um your body is going to be much healthier a much happier when you don't need a bunch of glucose and your immune system will work better as well as not giving a fertile ground for things to grow demand demand uh thank you very much for the Super Chat um they say two months carnivore diet feeling great but lipid levels have uh gone a bit funky so total cholesterol went up LDL went up um uh some 120 to 240 triglycerides what from 52 to 86 and HDL from 64 to 62 A1C from 5.3 to 5.6 despite no sugars want to continue with scare that is a bit weird you know you don't really don't see that reaction or that change the thing with with cholesterol levels is they are very dependent on where and how you and when and where and how you take uh your your tests so you want to take it first thing in the morning between eight and nine in the morning you want to take it fasted obviously but not everyone does not everyone does take it fasted and you want to have the same level of hydration so because hydration levels can actually alter these results as well so you want what normally what what we recommend is you have a couple glass of water so at least two glasses of water like two cups of water so 16 ounces of water and no more than um four glasses of water four cups of water so that gives you a consistent level of hydration every single time you take the test and it does make a bit of a difference for for multiple tests the other thing is what do you do the day before um you're you shouldn't have a big workout the day before you shouldn't have sexual intercourse the day before these can actually affect your your uh your cholesterol levels so you want to take these things in consistent manner not eating any carbohydrates at all your triglycerides should not be going up because it's well it's primarily carbohydrates sugars alcohol and possibly seed oils that make your triglycerides go up but the first three definitely do and your HDL if you're eating saturated fat will go up um especially if you're exercising if you're doing resistance exercising your HDL will go up as well so those are all uh uh you know those should all go in various directions LDL don't much care about because um that's not really what we're concerned about because LDL is a general term just like total cholesterol is a general term well how does it break down there are over 100 different particulates of LDL they're not all created equal so some of these things are actually very good for you some of them can be damaged if you have high blood sugar and your glycating things um so that's what I would recommend you know a test is only as good as a retest so you you can go and test it and start getting this under more regular circumstances test that again the other question I would have if you're still on the chat is what exactly are you eating are you only eating fatty meat and only drinking water or you having anything else you have an artificial sweeteners or you have are you you cooking with oils are you doing anything except just meat and just water because if you're not then I would suggest doing that just cut out absolutely everything even if it's you know even if it's an electrolyte supplement that has Stevia in it just cut it out and only go just meat just water and if you really want to go after this you can go just red meat and water don't have any sort of pork chicken or or eggs or dairy that especially that have been you know fed soy and things like that because a lot of them have so that's what I would do I would still go on I mean you can always have an aberrant test just because you took them under different conditions and they just they just showed up differently because your numbers will change dramatically in the same day okay so I would I would test it again I would do it under those conditions and I'll cut out absolutely everything except probably red meat and water and see and see how you get on I think that you'll be you'll find that things things get better and I wouldn't worry about your LDL um I would just worry about HDL and triglycerides and that ratio you're actually still in very good ratio you're actually still doing very well um but you know you could get the HDL higher and you could get the triglycerides lower and I think that they will if you continue on but you can always check so all right so the next Super Chat um why does butter cause acne well in fact a lot of people are curing their acne with eating a lot of butter it's it's what else are you eating generally acne is hormonally driven I'm not a dermatologist but so this is this is just general uh information and general understanding that I have but from what I understand it's more hormonally driven and butter can actually help your hormones this is why a lot of fertility experts such as Dr Kilts recommends women increase the amount of animal fat they that they eat such as uh butter so they'll eat a lot of butter so I'm just going to clean this and um and so quite a lot of people I mean you know there's a lot of examples of people who start eating a lot more fat and eating butter in particular uh actually fixing their acne and doing a lot better with that so I would really be what else you're eating you know you're eating eating carbs and sugar or alcohol or seed oils or you know hormonal disruptors and there's a bunch of you know creams and things like that if you're just eating meat and you're just eating or just drinking water most of these hormonal things will calm down hormones can take a while they almost have long action hormones when you start your hormones you pump out now and start you you're utilizing your body now they have an epigenetic effect and they turn on and off different genes and that has a has a knock-on effect going forward weeks even months sometimes so you know you just have to be patient with it but uh no Butter's fine you know I mean I put Tallow and emu oil on on uh you know my face and skin and I like when I do that I have you know really really healthy skin so um yeah but I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't think that butter causes acne in fact it can it can help fight it um Doan hoddles thank you very much for the super chat um trying to keep and add muscle mass on 100 carnivore well you're going to be doing great first of all you're doing the right thing uh to get you there because you're you're seeing what your body needs you're not you're not plaguing it with a bunch of nonsense that it doesn't need um and so you will you will find that that your body's being given the best nutrition the best chance of of doing extremely well so good job for that um how to do it best well look you gotta you gotta work out you got to put in the work which you will be able to do you'll be able to work harder you'll work longer you'll be able to recover faster and so you'll get a lot more out of your workouts you'll be able to work out more so you have to put in the hard work it's not just going to come on its own you can't just put on muscle just you know by asking for it so you put in the hard work a lot of resistance training don't hurt yourself but you know get that get on a good resistance training program you know after this I'm going to be doing my X3 workout um which I think does does a great job and um especially for people that are that are time poor you know it's a it's a quick intense workout that you can get a lot out of and um and uh so that that's an excellent choice but whatever you do you need to work out hard you need to go to failure you need to really challenge your muscles and your body and then you need to give proper nutrition which is what a carnivore diet is but you need to eat enough it's very easy to under eat on a carnivore diet so you have to you have to eat until meat stops tasting good and when I'm working out a lot I find that I just need to eat more I probably need to be eat double the amount of food that uh that I would otherwise and so I'll end up eating you know four pounds five pounds of ribeye which is very fatty so it's a high calorie uh intake with high fat intake it's also a very high protein intake so I'm getting a few hundred grams of protein just by eating and I don't need to force it I don't need to take protein shakes I don't have to you know glucose load and all that sort of stuff to like force my body into being hungry enough to eat like my my Hunger signals just go up when I work out my body just wants more food when I'm working out because I'm working out and so you just need to listen to that and so keep eating fatty meat until it stops tasting good that's the trick you're getting positive feedback that this food that your body wants this food and then you get less and less positive feedback the less unless your body wants it and then you get to a point where you just go I'm not really enjoying this that's when you stop um you know the difference between something good for you giving you positive feedback is something bad for you addictive like a drug giving you positive feedback is that the addictive thing will just keep giving you positive feedback keep going keep going keep going keep going in fact you'll feel bad if you stop whereas with something good for you the more you have the you know the less positive feedback you get and eventually you get negative feedback your body actually resists you say hey stop this this tastes gross now it may send you that signal that it taste bad even though five minutes ago it tasted great so I would just do that and try eating more than once a day you'll probably find that you can't eat enough in just one meal that you'll physically fill up and eating more fatty meat is also going to be a benefit as well because you just get you just get much more nutrition and much more calories from that that your body will utilize uh to to deposit muscle so that's what I do and when I do it that way I put on muscle very very easily and so uh you know and everyone I speak to who is able to replicate that does the same so good luck with that uh red thank you very much for the Super Chat what do you think about deuterium depletion is there enough evidence to make it worthwhile you know what there's actually a lot of evidence there's a lot of mechanistic data there's a lot of there's a lot of very uh uh good biochemical information and um and even some clinical data showing that that deuterium is you know it's actually quite important for a lot of cellular functions and it's very it can be very damaging to our mitochondria and we know more and more and more that you know many of the chronic diseases that we're treating these days or you know come about from damaging the mitochondria specifically so I think that's a big deal and uh so last little professional borash uh is that was a professor is a professor emeritus of um of uh of medicine and Pediatrics and I think he's Professor biochemistry as well I had a biochemistry Lab at UCLA um so top university top scholar top professor and he has done a ton of research on deuterium and actually he was he didn't really buy it um until um you know he was he was he was uh uh basically the commission to do some some research and paid to do some research and like okay all right I'll run the test and he starts running and he's like oh crap this is there's actually something to this and then he started really digging into it in himself and so he's actually a professor of deuteronomics I think that's what they call it's a new field basically the study of deuterium and how that affects your metabolism and cellular function so I think there is I think there is a lot to that and and it could explain one of the other reasons why being in a ketogenic diet in ketosis on a carnivore diet is is even further beneficial um because when you make molecular water when you're in ketosis and you're burning fat you actually make no deuterium water non-deuterium water you know light water and so you actually have less and less deuterium so you're peeing this stuff out you're getting rid of it and I always sort of wondered if that's why people swear by you know drinking rain water I'm not suggesting anyone do this these are just my own musings um but uh it seems that you know sort of you know that distillation from the oceans especially in Northern latitudes and at altitude and all these sorts of things they have less and less deuterium in in the rain water in certain areas um I think you probably have to test it of course but that's my understanding from some of his lectures from Dr boris's lectures and um so some of these things will have a lot less deuterium and so it's like well maybe maybe it's uh there's something to that that you know you have this lower deuterium water and it's that's you're getting good hydration but you're not getting chalked up so I'm not the expert on it but I think people should watch the episodes I've done on deuterium with uh uh Gabor somalai and uh who who originally commissioned uh Dr borosh to do this research and then Dr boros himself I've interviewed both of them and b-o-r-o-s and then uh Gabor gab um or and some Lai I'm gonna figure that one out because I don't know it offhand and but they're all on my channel and they have something to do with deuterium in the in the title and they have other other interviews as well so uh check the check them out and they both have websites and they both have other uh you know informatics and things like that that you can you can check out I think it's very interesting I think there's definitely something to do with it definitely makes sense from a molecular biology point of view and a biochemical point of view and cellular biology or you know Southern biology point of view so I think there's definitely something to that yes uh seven is uh thank you very much for the for the Super Chat thoughts on quail eggs versus chicken herd quail eggs is good for allergies um well that's a good question I I don't know unfortunately I haven't looked into that specifically but you know what I will say is that Quail are generally raised a lot more naturally than than chickens are you're not having them a lot fed and feed fed and things like that and and quails generally are just left to Fours I mean they're about that big so you know they don't need much and they can just run around and get some insects and whatever else they feel like they want to eat and so I think that it's probably a lot to do with what the quails are being fed or what they're eating themselves and the chickens you know if you have a if you have a pasture-raised chickens on a regenerative Farm is bugs I think you'll probably find that it's that it's fine and then quail eggs are probably more likely to be raised in that manner so that's I I would I don't know for sure but I would guess if that's probably the difference there sorry guys um so Nicolas thank you very much for the Super Chat I've heard you say you enjoy smoking your meat in your opinion does this mean it's okay to consume Smoked Meats regularly despite known carcinogens from the smoke also your opinion on smoked salt um look it's it's not it's not uh the best obviously if we're looking for Optimal Health at all times then you know maybe avoid it but you know we've been cooking meat at least the last 790 000 years right so 500 000 years before Homo sapiens are supposedly even existed our ancestors were cooking meat uh with fire with smoke and so a lot of these studies that look at the carcinogens and and smoked meat or in uh burnt meat I should say they they did in animal models and they used tens of thousands of times more than you'd actually find in burnt meat right so that's not specifically uh that's not specifically smoked meat so that's probably going to have more of these little factors than um then just burnt meat but I think that we've been dealing with smoke for a very long time and uh and and smoking our meat and smoke in and around our food and things like that for a very long time so I think that it's you know we've adapted to having smoke in our meat and things like that and we're all burnt meat as well just because of of where where we've come from in our past so it's not something I do all the time it's something I do sort of rarely maybe once every couple months but I'll do like a big smoked brisket other times I actually do brisket in the oven and uh it actually comes out fine it actually tastes really good um I'm sure a lot of brisket barbecuer people will hate me for saying that but you know I'm look I like it it's not that I like the meat more than anything else and so you know I don't I don't have a problem just cooking in the oven actually it tastes great so if you want to avoid the smoke you just do it in the oven just slow cook it in the oven it's the same idea low and slow bring that that temperature up slowly you're not going to be able to do like a big massive brisket unless you have a big massive oven but uh you know you should be able to do smaller sizes uh with any with any other okay encyclopedia mystery oh thank you very much for the Super Chat I appreciate that didn't have a question to text so I just I appreciate that the support from Joe four-month strict carnivore and gallbladder is still not adapting very sharp pain which I'm guessing is gallstones what do you recommend bile salts well I would recommend getting an ultrasound first and foremost I just get that checked out and find out uh you know if it is if it is gold uh gallstones you know the thing is is that you have your own four months strict carnivore you're eating a lot of fat and you have gallstones one of two things is likely to happen one they're going to be small enough that they'll pass through and you're going to squirt these things out and you'll get rid of them or they're too big they're not going to pass on get stuck and unfortunately sometimes if you have really big Stones developed and you may not actually be able to get away from that so I would get that checked out first I would get a diagnosis I would I would know for sure what we're dealing with and then go from there bile salts I don't know of you know I don't personally know about a lot of research with biosols and if that's going to help with gallstones that's not it's just not something I've really looked into um there are some people that say that um that you know if you have biosol depletion then that can increase your chances of getting gallstones but whether that's true or not I don't know if that's going to change anything when you have gallstones actively so I'll get a diagnosis first I would see if you have gallstones it may be that you're just having cramping and you're having you know muscle spasms or something else weird happening and it may not be gallstone related if it is gallstones like you do have confirmed gallstones in there you want to take some biosols to see if that helps go for it I don't think they'll hurt you but you know obviously do everything under doctor's supervision and um and but I would get a diagnosis first I wouldn't just guess with this it does it does make a difference and you know it could be that you see there and you're like oh shoot there's no gallstones don't know what that pain is but at least now you're reassured that it's not you know gallstone getting stuck okay uh uh nektarios Tyrell I'm sure I mispronounced that so I apologize thank you very much for the Super Chat two questions I used to drink a lot of soda and now I and now I urinate a lot can carnivore help also my dad has diverticulitis and his he is afraid to try carnivore will carnivore help him um you should drink a lot of soda now urinate a lot well I mean drinking soda previously and you're not urinating a lot now um well those may not be connected you know could just be that you're you know you've got rid of the soda well I mean goodness it could be diabetic and increasing your urination from that so you know I wouldn't discount that I don't I don't know your full background um but you know just you know the point point now is just just eat healthy drink just water eat just meat and your body should be okay and if you're for peeing you're peeing that's okay um you know we're all meant to pee and uh if you drink a lot of water you're gonna you're gonna pee out as well and that can actually help your kidneys and not work as hard and flush things out and things like that so I like to drink a lot of water you know I've got my mug there and um you know so I feel better when I do that um as far as uh diverticulitis yeah I think it can help quite a lot you know when we when we have people in the hospital with diverticulitis uh you know we we put them on a low residue diet so low fiber diet so we want to rest the bowel and um and allow it to just chill out and heal um what does that mean that means that fiber causes your your bowel to work and work too hard and you can put it under stress and it can actually uh strain it and stress it it can actually cause diverticulosis diverticulosis is that those out pouching herniations on your on your distal colon diverticulitis is an infection of of those out pouchings so the best study that I know of that looked at over 2 000 patients you know did colonoscopies and confirmed diverticulosis looked at two over two thousand patients uh over a 15-year setting nearly 20-year setting found the only correlation no correlation is not causation but if you don't have correlation then you cannot have causation right there's no connection at all the only correlation found there's actually a strong correlation found between diverticulosis and sort of anything that they looked at was more fiber and more bowel motion specifically more than 15 bowel motions a week so like more that you know pooping more than twice a day every day and and then you know a third and a four you know a third a couple times a week that was strongly associated with diverticulosis and age as well because it just takes time for your body to break down so what are you doing you're overworking your colon you're overworking that organ and it starts to fail it starts to herniate constipation was not one of the risk factors meat was not one of the risk factors fat intake was not one of the risk factors fiber was fiber was a large risk factor pooping more than 15 times a week was a large risk factor so pooping less than seven times a week was not a risk factor so that's uh that's another that's just a clear indication that um you know you're overworking that organ in my view and so going on a carnivore diets very low residue so you you will absorb 98 of the fat meat that you eat and so that will go uh into your body and very little waste and so you're not going to be working over working your intestine there's actually a salisbury steak was grinding up steak in a way that that removed the gristle and so it's just like just the meat tissue and some of the fat tissue and you add in butter and make it really digestible like basically 100 of that you will absorb and so this was to really rest the bowel for people with like you know Crohn's and UC and things like that that they were having horrible horrible times you know 30 plus bloody bowel motions a day you know is life-threatening there's horribly debilitating uh back in the 1800s the only thing that they found that would would help these guys was putting them on a pure red meat and water diet and even better was when they ground it so they didn't have any of the gristle in them and so that is uh that is just showing again this helps people uh when you don't eat a bunch of fiber when you're just eating meat when you're eating when you're supposed to eat biologically and so yes I do think that that will help your dad quite a lot he will still have diverticulitis or diverticulosis but it will it will stop it from progressing as much and it will reduce the amount of strain that goes on it having to work and work and work and work and work and push through all this fiber and stuff like that it's very funny we tell people to rest about fast and go on low residue diets and not eat fiber while they have something like Diverticulitis and then student has done that oh you better eat a lot of fiber because that's good for you and then they're right back in the hospital again so um that's bad advice uh better advice is to actually rest the bow full time 100 of your day and um you know and just just eat what you're supposed to eat biologically I think that's you can't really go wrong with that oh Dr Chaffey thank you very much for your help and your listeners help him um in the comments uh we're very welcome my autistic 14 year old son has improved a lot with keto carnivore clear head no more um styming um his weight is steady now that's great thank you so much for sharing that uh zbz that's that's excellent news I I've seen a lot of you know things with autistic kids especially just on a keto diet improve a lot it's really really heartwarming to see that because it just gives these people their life back um when maybe they wouldn't have it if they kept doing what they were doing they they might continue to deteriorate or at least not improve and then that would be their life and that is that is heartbreaking whereas you can just change these dietary measures and their brain starts to work better and to develop better and to and to make up for lost time and so then they can actually get to a point where they're you know they're they're back leaving a much more normal life a much more positive um you know and having a much more positive experience which I think is I just think that's probably the best thing you could ever do for somebody in your whole life I don't think there's really anything better so that's really great to hear thank you very much for sharing um just found out as a it's an Instagram question so I'm just going back and forth guys just found out I have EDS I'm assuming you mean ehlers-danlos syndrome and dysautonomia uh paratrooper in the Army tried carnivore for a weekend symptoms got worse with supplementing electrolytes is this normal um well I can't really speak much to the the just autonomia um but um you know it's just yeah but you know I I you know there are people that have improved that um you know long term a lot of these things will take a while uh but Elders down the syndrome I mean I I have three patients right now that have all basically dissolved their symptoms of Alexander syndrome uh by going on a carnivore diet it takes a couple months but you know it works and I have um one patient who was getting dislocations every day basically he woke up and then one or more joints would be out of place like shoulder will be out of joint his fingers would be sideways um your ankle would be out something like that and so uh that's obviously very restricting and uh you know a couple months into to a carnivore diet and now he doesn't get any joint uh dislocations which is great you know because you lose a very active life you know and and so it's uh it's it's very limiting when you're when your joints just don't work the way they should so you know why is that well you know I think that you know ehlers Down syndrome these other connective tissue disorders that your body not able to make collagen properly and so you don't get tight collagen and so your connective tissue is just a bit more loose and a bit more weak but when you're eating meat you actually get the the precursors to collagen that you can just put together and build healthy stable collagen with you don't actually have to build it de novo you're just like vitamin C you don't need the vitamin C as much because you already have preformed collagen you don't need it to to catalyze a reaction to hydrolyzed Proline and lysine so you already have pre-hydrolyzed protein and lysine you just make collagen and so I think that's what's going on there you know we don't have any any uh you know clear uh you know evidence of exactly the mechanism but I see it working and so why not why not keep going with something that's you know our natural naturally designed diet anyway um okay so encyclopedia mystery I think has a has a question oh not a question just happy I found this way of eating well great me too my whole life has changed and my dreams of hiking and hunting again are coming true awesome I mean that that's the whole that's the whole point right it's it's getting people healthy and happy and and being able to to lead their life and you know enjoy themselves and enjoy their life so that's great I'm really happy to hear that uh Jeff Hart thank you very much for the Super Chat I went carnivore for two weeks to alleviate my ulcerative colitis but didn't see much improvement how long is normal before one typically sees improving uh longer than that I mean generally with uh chromosome ulcer colitis you mean you you will often see uh Improvement in your symptoms after sort of two three weeks four weeks things like that but it takes a while for this junk to get out of your system and it takes a while for your gut to heal and so you know you you will have damage and it's ulcerative colitis you have dig out ditches and ulcerations in the lining of your colon that takes time to heal so you know if you if you you know fell off a bicycle or a skateboard or something like that and you scraped up your whole arm you know you have these big gouges in your arm that's going to take time to heal even if you're healing and you're not messing it up and picking the scabs and ripping at it and scraping it again it's going to take time to heal so give your body a chance to heal um you also will have to be more strict than other people will it's not it's not always good enough to just eat meat and only drink water sometimes you just have to eat red meat people with with chronological colitis and other autoimmune issues find that they need to eat just red meat and that's probably because of what the animal is eating or feeding a bunch of soy to chickens and pigs and so they're just that's just not going to be what they normally eat and they're not designed to eat and so that's going to translate to things coming to us that we don't want either so I would stick to red meat and water and grass-fed and finished if you can get it but at least beef or lamb either way and and just water no Stevia no electrolyte drinks with with sweeteners in it no erythritol and monk fruitrina none of those things just get rid of everything except red meat and water no plants no sugar no sweeteners nothing artificial that goes for sauces seasonings and drinks as well just whole meat that you cook that you prepare no seed oils no cooking oils cook with fat cook the meat eat the meat drink the water and and give it time you know because it does take time for your body to heal and I mean this is this is a serious issue and and it does take time to heal but you know I have I have yet to see someone with ulcer colitis or Crohn's eating Kronos is more stubborn than ulcer colitis if they do that I have yet to see someone uh have any sign of either on biopsy of their colon after three months so just just stick with it do it really strict and and pure and you'll enjoy that anyway I mean who I mean I don't I don't I don't know why you wouldn't enjoy steak but um but just just do that um and if you and if it's hard to afford that sort of thing uh ground beef ground beef is great Chuck is great brisket is great it's super cheap so those are some options as well and you know you could look up the salisbury steak and learn how to grind these things down where you're only getting the muscle tissue and none of the of the fiber of the muscle the gristle and the muscle um because that will actually rest your bowel even more and I mean you will like not defecate you know more than than once a week or two so you know it's uh it's uh that's actually literally why that was designed why the Salisbury steak was designed for people in your case so you could look into that as well um Alma Gonzalez thank you very much for the Super Chat I have been she says I have been carnivore for three weeks my ultra Colitis symptoms did not stop okay I'm sorry I've had UC for 10 years how long will it take to heal my gut if I only eat meat and water as you recommend so um well that's a good piggyback on on to the last question so same answer um at three weeks you know normally we do see um you know improvements and and so I would hope that well symptoms didn't stop she says not that she didn't get any Improvement um so hopefully you were getting Improvement at that point um but you know it can take months before you get you get complete resolution and in fact after you get complete resolution of your symptoms and what you're feeling you can still you're still healing things in your gut like leaky gut which can let things in and your body attacks them and gets antibodies towards them those antibodies can spill over and attack your body and so uh that can take you know six months or so before you are safer to eat things like dairy or eggs or pork or chicken um so I would um I would just do the same thing as the last last gentleman and just focus on red meat and water sounds like you're doing really well but but you know keep at it you're just you're just getting into that period now at three weeks that you're just going to start really seeing Improvement and if you're the tighter you are with it and the closer you are to just red meat and water and close your order grass-fed red meat and water then the better you'll be doing so just just keep it up you're doing great kosher Dad thank you very much uh for the Super Chat I heard you say on one of your videos that the body was designed to live for 120 years I'm curious where you got that number uh uh telomeres the length of our telomeres and that was what I was taught in genetics at the University of Washington uh 23 years ago and they at the time my professors were in charge of the Human Genome Project so I didn't have any reason not to believe them and it was in the book so it's um that's where I got it from um you know maybe that's changed but that's actually the number consistently that I keep hearing over and over again even currently from geneticists and others uh that that that's exactly what we're designed to live and you can actually lengthen or shorten your telomeres based on your your lifestyle and so you know if you're exercising a lot and you're pushing yourself and you're leading a very healthy life then you know you'll you could potentially live more than that and again this is an average and so um yeah so that that's where I got it from anyway from my genetics class and it's based on length of our telomeres and um so now the question can carnivore get rid of sibo sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and raise stomach acids uh while your stomach acids um it can actually stop gastroesophageal reflux disease for a number of different reasons um but sibo yes absolutely it can and there's there's actually a study that came out last year that showed that going on a Carnival diet was actually a very effective treatment for a small intestinal bacterial overgrowth so yeah I mean it's just it's just part and parcel we're eating whatever we're supposed to eat we're eating what we're biologically adapted to eat and designed to eat we're going to get the microbiota that we should have that will complement that as well same with oral biota you know a lot of people in the carnivore Community you're talking about like wow you know I don't I you know my dentist is saying my teeth are so clean I'm not getting cavities anymore and all these sorts of things that's because your oral biota uh matters just as much as your as your gut biota so it's um you know it you what you eat promotes both and so yes it will help with sibo uh Marta uh Carolina thank you very much for the generous Super Chat is very kind of you are there any clinical studies or anecdotal evidence that going carnivore can help with healing from acoustic neuroma um non-genetic dealing with neurological issues from uh tinnitus vertigo hearing loss Etc so depending on the on the causes of tinnitus yes um same with vertigo but if you have an acoustic aroma and that's putting pressure on the various cranial nerves you know it can reduce the inflammation it can reduce the symptoms of that pressure just like when people have you know a trap nerve in their spine and have something pinching on one of their nerves and their spines and that's causing radiculopathy and paying down that distribution of that nerve uh or even mild weakness or even extreme weakness that can help with that because that's going to reduce the inflammation and and some of the damage being done to the nerve and the expression of that pressure but it's not it's not going to relieve the pressure entirely it's not going to um you know get rid of that I know I don't know of any evidence to say that an acoustic neuroma I don't actually well I don't actually know if it's been tested with acoustic neuromas and like a ketogenic diet there's certainly cancers and other tumors that respond very well to a ketogenic diet because they just have a higher metabolic rate and demand for glucose and generally they're in cancer certainly the mitochondria are damaged I don't know if that's the case with acoustic neuromas that they would respond in the same way um so unfortunately I don't know if that's that would help shrink the acoustic neuroma I my feeling would be that um I wouldn't bet on it and I wouldn't I wouldn't uh you know count on that to be the best thing to do if you're very symptomatic um you know there is a rule for surgery and there is a rule for surgery in cases where you're having a lesion or a tumor like this press on a bunch of nerves and getting you know encroaching on your brain stem that can be that can be a big deal if the symptoms aren't too bad um or you're or either way I would definitely go on a carnivore diet a ketogenic carnivore diet no carbs no sugar no honey no fruit anything like that um and and just see you know and just see how you go because I there's a there's a very real chance that you can reduce your symptoms and how and how this is expressed I can't say one way or the other if it's going to affect the growth of of the acoustic neuroma but depending on how big it is and how much you know how many symptoms you're having it could help your symptoms of it and and just see how you feel and if that's something that is is feeling better and you're doing better and you can avoid surgery fine then you just keep an eye on it you get you know MRIs every every so often according to your your surgeon and if it's growing and it's causing more of a problem then you you uh probably need to consider surgery at that point and we do we do remove acoustic neuromas when they get too big and as a school of thought that says well maybe we should just go after it early while it's not a big huge problem before it's a you know massive 14 hour 16 hour ordeal to get this thing out of there um but that's uh that's something that you know we need to discuss with your with your doctor uh but it's worth a try anyway uh thank you and can certainly help you in uh potentially with you symptomatic relief and also uh we'll help you on so many other ways and will make you better able to uh you know go through surgery and recover from surgery as well so I would I would definitely uh do it anyway you know just because it's it's advantageous too uh question from Vincent do you take any supplements if so which ones um and thank you for the Super Chat uh no I generally don't um you know every now and then I might take like a melatonin or something like that uh just to help me sleep like if I you know if I'm not you know if I normally I have uh like a few hours of sleep in a night and then I'm just on the next day but if I actually have a chance I'm like okay I've got like actually eight hours you know to sleep or God forbid you know 10 hours of sleep which would be amazing um I might take like a melatonin just like ensure that I get the most out of that sleep as I possibly can um generally not anything else so you know I mean I've you know some people take electrolytes magnesium and zinc all of my my numbers have been really good um in optimal ranges uh and not the reference ranges because the reference range is just the average for your community and so the first two thousand people that come in and get a test um you know that year that's the reference range and that's why reference range has changed between even labs in the same area and so um most people are deficient in vitamins and and minerals and nutrients and so that's not a good measure to go by so I go by a different uh group of of um reference ranges which look at Optimal Health uh for people in their mid-20s that are in good health don't have any medical issues and what are their numbers and those numbers are very different and generally much higher for vitamins and minerals and so mine are in that range my magnesium and zinc and you know calcium and b12 and uh you know all the rest that I tested are all in that range for optimal for 25 so I don't really need it I don't think you need to take supplements unless you have a deficiency um but if you do then fine take something or just eat a bit more liver or something like that I don't think you need to go to town on liver but if you're coming from a deficient diet you know standard Western diet or plant-based diet you are going to be deficient in uh in different uh nutrients and so maybe you need to catch up you'll catch up eventually but you know it's probably best to speed that up a bit with a bit more liver or some some targeted supplements uh but generally no you don't need to to take any of that yeah yeah unless you unless you need to you know I don't have a problem with with taking something um taking uh a uh a supplement you know if you if you have you know deficiency I think that that's I think that that's fine I think you should probably should um and so you know I wouldn't worry about that uh great so a question from Tony and Steph thank you very much Tony and Steph for the Super Chat I've been carnivore for 70 days today great I'm craving vegetables should I eat some I don't know um I've had weight stall for 25 days now I'm feeling pretty cruddy oh very sorry to hear that um well no I wouldn't I mean I wouldn't eat vegetables ever unless I was dying um but you know weight can solve for a lot of different reasons and and weight doesn't necessarily indicate that you're not changing your body style and happiness and so you know why I I mean I didn't lose weight for months but I was changing I was dropping fat and putting on muscle and I I could visibly see my I could see myself visibly changing in the mirror and uh and I would take progress photos you know sort of once a month and I was I was actually shocked at the difference that I made in each progress video so um that there were progress pictures so uh do that I mean I would I would take pictures and see and see how your clothes are fitting you know is your is your belt tighter or looser uh or is it the same um you know are you exercising are you eating enough I think that's the main thing here you know if you're not feeling great then that might be that you're not eating enough and you're not eating enough fat in particular you're not eating until meat stops tasting good um and you can have low energy and just feel sort of party from that and your metabolism will knock down um and it does so um that's a problem that you should you should think about because if you're not eating enough and you're chronically not eating enough you will actually slow down your metabolism and you can actually put on weight uh bariatric surgeons maybe like do the bypass surgeries they will commonly tell their their patients that if you don't eat at least 1200 calories a day for a woman for an adult woman uh that you won't lose weight you'll actually stuff your metabolism so much that you won't lose weight even though you're you're starving yourself basically uh because your your body knows that you're starving yourself and so it actually brings down your metabolism so it doesn't you know waste energy and start sequestering this fat so that you can have it for a rainy day because you know it's pouring outside basically so I would just I would just continue on I I you know if you're craving anything that's probably that your brain is telling you to eat more because it's saying hey look we need some damn food we need some nutrients so so give your body some nutrients um you know you eat a bit of liver eat a lot of meat and eat until you're full eat until it stops tasting good because you can feel satisfied and you can feel satiated but that doesn't mean that you're you're full because your body experiences hunger very differently on a carnivore diet so it's very easy to under eat so don't under eat it's very important make sure you're getting enough and uh good luck with it I would just I would just keep going because you're doing great you've gone 70 days um and uh you know you already said here you know you know you're talking about should I eat some I think you should eat just eat more just eat more meat and I think that'll see you through and again body composition is different than weight on the scale okay a lot of people don't lose weight because they're putting on muscle and replacing the weight of the fat that they're losing so just remember that it's not about weight it's about how you feel first and foremost you're not feeling great so I think you should definitely eat more and also about body composition way down in second place a distance second place is body composition nowhere on that list is the scale okay it's about body composition it's about losing fat not losing weight you want to keep healthy weight put on healthy weight and lose unhealthy excess body fat that's the idea okay so uh Lem viewer thank you very much for the Super Chat is keto carnivore okay without a gallbladder absolutely yes you still make bile from your liver it just it just drips into your small intestine it doesn't get short in the gallbladder so you just may have to uh space out your fatty meals throughout the day and to get maximal absorption you may finally get loose stools that's just an overflow of uh the fat that you're not able to absorb so just space it out a bit more eat smaller meals some people form what's called a pseudo gallbladder which is sort of an out pouching in the in the common bile duct and um and uh that works just like a gallbladder so you may may not actually need to worry about it but see how you go if you if you eat just a normal sized meal and you have a lot of loose stools okay and you're not drinking coffee you're not taking sweeteners or anything like that which are all laxatives then then you probably need to space it out but there are a lot of people that have had their gallbladder out that have no problem eating big meals okay so Chris Maynard thank you very much for the super chat um and also guys you know directly after this actually starting here in a minute uh is a premiere of one of my episodes uh where I'm interviewing uh Jessica henrard who's a um she does carnivore and she has uh little kids that she's raising carnivore as well and she talks about that and also about neuromuscular um uh rehab which is a is a very uh bespoke sort of field or I mean there's probably about two dozen people who even know about this around the world that are licensed practitioners of it um and it's just retraining your your neuromuscular Pathways with your brain and your body to overcome a lot of uh you know serious injuries and uh and and movement disorders and problems uh which is very interesting and so I've worked with her as well she's been helping me with my knee and um so if you guys are interested in that we'll continue this over there we'll be chatting live uh over text in there as well um and I may have to go before too long just to just to sort of catch that but I'll try to get through um as many of these as I can um so um and also obviously guys you know if you like And subscribe and and send these things to your friends uh people that you think would help um I really appreciate that it really does help you know the algorithm see things more and push things out there and um uh and that just that just gets more and more people able to watch these things and that's you know just gets the the message out stronger to people so in the the upcoming episode that's coming out if people could do that like subscribe or or like and leave a comment and send it to people or share on social media I really appreciate it um so Chris Maynard uh asked a question battling B6 toxicity due to supplements most meats are very high in B6 and they flare my symptoms any suggestions on how to overcome this drink a lot of water B6 is water soluble um maybe there are going to be different meats that are lower in B6 than others you could focus on those for a while you can do periods of fasting as well where you're just you know eliminating these things out um entirely for a few days and then sort of letting your body just sort of wash this stuff out and then sort of get back to it that's what I would do as well I I just I don't I don't treat B12 toxicity specifically that's a very specific sort of area but um but if I were to run into that myself that's that's what I would do that's how I would approach it uh Robert lotzer thank you very much for the Super Chat I take insulin daily as a type 2 diabetic I started full carnivore last week step by step how do you lower how to lower my insulin do I lower it first or do I wait uh for the blood sugar uh yeah keep a very close eye on your blood sugar and you need you will need to work with your doctor on this um or your diabetics nurse specialist um because when you're taking insulin you take too much insulin you get a hypo that's dangerous that's life-threatening so um it's something that you do need to be very cautious of um and get a plan with your doctor and your diabetic nurse specialist whoever is helping you with this and get a plan on exactly you know when you are going to be lowering this it is it is clinically proven that any ketogenic diet will will um uh resolve and reverse type 2 diabetes so uh you know insulin is going to need to come down your insulin demand is going to come down and so uh you know they should be on board with that um but yeah once you once you start seeing that coming down you don't want it to get too low you never want your blood sugar to get low I mean there's there is a range of normal and you don't want it to get too low especially because you're taking insulin and that that can actually suppress a bit of uh your Ketone production and things like that so um yeah you just have to take that you have to do that under direct medical supervision and uh and do very carefully so I wouldn't let your insulin get your your blood sugar get too low you um but before you start ramping it back okay uh Peter gauze thank you for the super chat later on talks about keto increasing heart disease risk due to your opposing viewpoints uh would be cool if you debated him uh yeah well I mean we'll see about that I think I think Lane will come around honestly um because I mean he's just he's just basing that on on the cholesterol thing and that's uh that is that's just been thoroughly debunked and you know more and more people are coming around to that um and uh more and more people are talking to him about that and going through the data with him but um you know that's just I mean he's of that opinion and that's fine he was going to debate uh Dr Paul Mason at the low carb Denver but uh unfortunately um unfortunately Dr Mason wasn't wasn't able to make the the trip from Australia which that would have been I think that would have changed his mind that day because Dr Paul Mason is extraordinarily well-versed in the literature and an extremely knowledgeable and erudite and uh and it's just you know it is very very very clear speaker and lecturer and and teacher you know and he can he can explain complex uh Concepts very very well and um and he's and he dude knows his stuff man I it's it's always just just a pleasure to like to talk to that guy just and just you know talk about a subject and just and just let him go and just like listen to him it's great um Andrew Fisher uh thank you very much for the Super Chat uh just says thank you for all you do well thank you very much Andrew I really appreciate it I hope that it's been helpful I hope this helped you and your family and and everyone else it's um it's actually really great that um you know we see so many of these stories and so many people getting better and feeling better and reversing major illnesses that 10 years ago people were denying could ever be reversed and then we are seeing this and we're actually getting clinical trials proving it uh as well which is which is really great and I I really I'm really glad that I could could help you guys and I appreciate all your support um great so Rachel from Queensland Australia hello and uh hello um in Australia I'm down here too can you do a dedicated video on what vitamins Etc we get by eating carnivore have seen videos from others that just mentioned uh one vitamin but it would be great to have all that info for the available vitamins minerals in one video um okay I hadn't really thought about that you know just because you know I mean my argument has always been you know well we you know we evolved on meat and and you know a lot of us that do subsist on me for years now without any you know without any diagnosis deficiencies of anything without any supplementation and we have entire civilizations alive right now and previously that only ate uh meat so so we know that we get a lot the problem is that our rdas are designed for or were studied first of all by answer keys there's a known fraud so God knows you know who influenced them to say what or if it was you know actual good signs it could have been you know I mean you got you gotta you gotta work your way up to you know to have something to sell out with right uh but he has a sellout and so I don't actually really put much stock in anything the guy does and also you know I don't get anything close to the rdas for some of these nutrients that he says that we actually need and here I am and my serum levels are perfectly fine so um you know we have to redo the rdas for a carnivore diet because your body just simply needs vitamins and minerals in different levels uh depending on what you eat um but I will I will definitely think about that I'll see if I can I can put something together that's coherent and I don't you know the problem is is that you know again we know about some of these things and how how uh carbohydrates interfere with the absorption and utilization of certain vitamins like vitamin C uh we have quite a lot of information on and other vitamins but um you know but the the long and short of it is you do get everything you need in the proportion that you need it from a carnivore diet because that is our evolved diet that's our biologically appropriate type um question from Andrew room uh thank you very much for the Super Chat even though they are not good for us why do we have such strong pleasure Center reactions to carbs and sugar if we are evolved uh to be carnivores uh well for fructose in particular we think that's because there we don't know of any really anything that that um that creates or that that has five or fructose in it sorry that is acutely poisonous to us it will kill us that day so we hit notices as a quick hit of energy or plant it's actually one of the quickest things to replenish your liver glycogen of the carbohydrates and so we recognize this as safe so this is something safe that we can eat and we can survive on um and get us to the next to the next meal but that doesn't mean that it's optimal it doesn't mean that it doesn't have long-term harm most carbohydrates I mean you know you just eat flour tell me how good that tastes right or um you know not even a raw potato disgusting because they have so many other things that are bad for you but even a cooked potato where you sort of denature those things your your brain doesn't recognize them anymore it doesn't mean they're not there there's you don't recognize them uh you know the carbs are it's it's pretty bland it's not it's not giving you too much it's when you add fat to that your body goes sweet Jesus um but it's really your body's reacting to the fat more than the carbohydrates um and uh and sugar but I mean fructose again is uh is addictive and it's and we're hitting that like oh hey this is safe I can survive on this sort of thing it was very rare that we would come across this in an ice age it was also very rare that even outside of an ice age and outside of the tropics that we would come across this stuff uh more than you know a few weeks out of the year and they were much less sweet and they had much less sugar you know and so we've cultivated these things and grown them to have way more sugar than they normally do and so um you know so there's a survival Advantage there to understand that something is safe but you know it's it's also a drug and it's also addictive and so you get reward and pleasure Center uh uh stimulation from gambling and from cocaine and heroin and meth you know so that's something that's just pathologically triggering these natural uh systems that we have and aren't does not necessarily mean it's good for you cocaine stimulates reward centers as well we are not cocaine of Wars right this is not something that you want in your body uh for you know at any point in your life really uh uh yeah is it safe to put bacon fat in replacement to Sugar on my steak while grilling on the barbecue absolutely I mean you start a fire if it's sort of you know dripping into the into the fire and things like that so maybe you know if you're cooking it in a skillet with bacon fat absolutely that just tastes great but you know if you're going to put something on afterwards I put it on afterwards I wouldn't cook it on because it's just going to melt off and and just start a grease fire so that's not a good idea uh Sergeant Maggie or Magi um thank you Dr best wishes well thank you very much I really appreciate that and thank you for the Super Chat and the kind words um I hope you're doing well and I hope that these sorts of things really help just trying to I'm trying to go back and forth guys um between Instagram and YouTube so if um you know if uh if you do pop up a question on on Instagram I'll try to try to check it maybe see what the last one was let's see [Music] um okay not seeing any questions there so uh we'll go to the next one on YouTube uh low carb low drama uh thank you for the super chat um four years of low carb keto and uh all my ill health Rose reversed started carnivore five months ago and lately healing uh pulsing pain in my finger joints thoughts please interesting you know one one thing that um Sally Norton talks about is oxalate dumping and that can that can be expressed as like pain in the joints as well I would I would isolate out any other issues um um and uh and then and then sort of think maybe oxalates after that so make sure you're just eating meat just drinking water eating enough fat maybe just focusing on red meat you know is there something else in your diet or your day that's affecting this um you know or you are you eating more unprocessed things maybe you're having some things with more spices or seasonings or you know some with sweeteners or seed oils or Stevia or something like that and that can cause you know low-grade inflammation and sort of makes a pain in your joints if you have some like arthritis there um that could all be I would I would cut down to Bare Bones just meat just water probably just red meat and water give that for a month see how that does with your fingers then that's still going and that's getting worse okay well maybe maybe think about oxalate dumping and uh and check out Sally Norton for her um her ideas on how to mitigate that uh Brian Morkie thank you for the Super Chat my mom is 71 and has a rare disease called multifocal motor neuropathy um often associated with multiple sclerosis will carnivore helper uh unfortunately I don't I don't know um that is very rare and it's not something that I've even seen anecdotally help I have absolutely seen a lot of people with multiple sclerosis get help and just basically all autoimmune conditions in general are severely are extremely helped I would do it very much try to just keep meat just water really just red meat and water because that will have less junk that can kick this off and I know a number of people with multiple sclerosis that have been helped by that I just interviewed a lady she's a PhD she does biostatistics and you know High you know high level uh research and the statistics statistician for these these large medical studies and so and she actually really significantly helped her multiple sclerosis just recently and so I'll be releasing that in the coming weeks but um you know and I've seen a number of others so I think it's absolutely worth well worth a shot and if it's anything like Ms I think it would uh really affect her and help her out significantly yeah so Teddy Honey Bunch uh writes um uh oh thank you for the Super Chat thanks uh thoughts on people that beat cancer on a vegan diet talk about anti-cancer properties and veggies and fruits I'm a cancer patient on Carnivore uh thanks so uh you know there you you it's always compared to what right and you can be on a on a whatever diet and still get appropriate treatment and chemo and radiation and surgery and still be cancer that doesn't I'm you know you know it's it's uh that's not the same thing as like not taking treatment at all and and your body fights off the cancer right so someone's vegan and they went through cancer treatment and they got through cancer which I hope they all do uh that's not the same as the vegan diet eating the cancer but you can be ketogenic on a vegan diet right you're gonna be very nutrient division you know you need to take supplements but you can do it and a ketogenic diet is clinically has been clinically shown again and again with multiple different kinds of cancers to be very very helpful because you're limiting the amount of glucose and the nutrients available for the cancer to actually grow and resolve so it's um uh it's something that you should look into you know anyone should look into and you can do it on a vegan diet you can do it on a vegetarian diet I think it's better to do it on a meat-only diet but you can do it you know and it's also compared to what right so if they're eating a bunch of just normal normal standard stuff like the normal high highly processed carbs and sugar I mean that's just cancer fuel you know and so you get away from that you go to you go to uh you know a whole food plant-based diet you know great um you know the anti-cancer properties of fruits and veggies I mean yeah there's some anti-veg Jeff and mushrooms there's other sorts of things that maybe this can be bad for cancer but uh you know we're talking chemo right so you know why would you take chemo when you don't have cancer right so that argument of well the other anti-cancer properties are just things that fight cancer cells well those things that fight cancer cells also fight your cells right and so maybe in the context of cancer yeah okay um you know that's an argument there's nothing proven there's no clinical study is actually showing that and you get the bad with the good as well increases inflammation increases other other harmful things going on in your body um but either way that's not a great argument for to do it on a normal daily basis if um you don't have cancer and why would you take chemo right so that would be saying or rational to do but I'm very sorry that you're going through that I do wish you the best I I personally think that as far as nutrition is concerned this is a great way to do it another benefit I think is is actually fasting itself because some cancers run on glutamine as well as glucose and some you know predominance of glutamine and so there are medications that can interfere uh with with glutamine utilization um they're not always licensed for different cancers but that's something you could look into and but if you're fasting you're not bringing in more glutamine you make glutamine you make glucose but if you don't eat it then it's not necessarily keeping you know more to the cancer cells and so periods of fasting can can help quite a lot and I think probably there's an additive effect and benefit from fasting and cancer for for eliminating that glutamine but you also want to look at your glucose to Ketone index and make sure that that's below two and and closer to one if possible and people that do that in clinical trials have better outcomes so I would look that up look at Thomas C fridge work I interviewed him professor seafreed at Boston College s-e-y-f-r-i-e-d is how you spell his last name and he and if you look up his name on Google Scholar and gki you'll find papers that that have that equation on how to figure that out okay down Holly Roth is sparkly mineral water okay also 38 years of high voluntary arthritis markers how long to heal um sparking mineral water should be fine as long as there's no additives to as long as there's no like weird natural flavors or sweeteners or all that sort of nonsense in it I'm just getting rid of all that um and uh rheumatoid well look you know your ra Factor may or may not go down but your symptoms of RA will likely go away uh within a few months on a carnivore diet sticky mainly to to red meat and water there are a lot of people that have autoimmune issues like rheumatoid arthritis that find that they can get flare-ups even from eating you know you know past you know feedlot pork and chicken and things like that so um but yeah it can absolutely help a lot okay oh what happened oh goodness and Skip down the bottom I hate it when it does that oh my goodness I gotta scroll all the way up sorry guys yeah okay um what was that all right um Noah Price hi Dr chafee any tips for explosive athletic performance on keto besides the obvious hydration electrolyte sleep Etc eating enough and not eating uh before or even several hours before you work out I always train on an empty stomach I always play on FPS perform better on an empty stomach you eat a big meal even a small meal you're diverting more blood to your your GI tract as opposed to your your muscles in your brain all right so uh only meat fatty meat a lot of it donate the day of a performance donate within five hours of training and uh preferentially uh eat after you train even if it's at night I generally eat just at night I don't eat during the day if I'm working out a lot sometimes I have to add in a meal during the day but I try to space that out literally over five hours before I'm going to to train Michael Jordan used to do this he had all of his uh Fitness strength and conditioning dietary coaches nutritionists working with him and they found to give him the best performance and the best biochemical profile uh that the best thing for him was to eat a big steak five hours before a game and that's what he did all throughout his career uh or for uh you know much of it anyway was a big steak five hours before a game and that's all he'd eat on game day and uh so you know that's what I would suggest as well you'll get naturally lethargic if you eat a big meal and I need to digest it your body will just say hey you got energy we don't need to work for it let's go to sleep now so um yeah eat enough train hard and then don't eat before you train or or uh perform and good luck to you uh question from Jay thank you for the super chat um Crohn's for 12 plus years uh went Carnival for three months it felt amazing great ended up with obstruction and emergency surgery not great scarring in the terminal ileum loss um oh God lost Journal allium and right colon advice dealing with bile acid malabsorption since losing TI and sequin valve um I wonder why you got got the obstruction I wonder where that was from you know if you had the scarring of the terminal allium you know I mean that's going to be long-standing and um unfortunately that's uh you know can be a complication of Crohn's it can affect you all the way up and down for people that don't know can affect you from your lips your anus it goes all the way up and down the GI tract and um and that's unfortunately can cause scarring and permanent damage it sounds like it did um any sort of obstruction um you know well anything's possible with that sort of that sort of damage to the body but uh just in general obviously when you're eating a carnivore diet you really do need to get enough fat because you don't but because it's the excess fat that you can't absorb that goes into your stools and keeps it soft so it keeps things moving and you don't get big buildups of of stool um bias absorption well it depends on how much you lost and it depends on um you know it depends on on if your body has the ability to to make up for that but the problem with with these sorts of things is that you know there's certain areas of your of your intestine that uh that you have to have there's only certain things are are absorbed in very specific spots and if those are gone um you can't really reabsorb them um and so people do get into problems with that so unfortunately I don't I don't know if there's any way to overcome that uh if you if you've completely lost the ability to absorb it it's just you know you can't absorb it anymore is my understanding um but I would continue on with carnivore diet keep going and hopefully this stops you from having any further flare-ups and scarring and and uh and issues and then you know you know eat a lot of fat um and make sure that you know that everything's soft and loose and moves uh freely and you don't give any obstructions and then just fingers crossed that you didn't lose so much that you just can't absorb this stuff anymore I mean you probably have areas that can still absorb uh absorb bile acids so and and your other nutrients so hopefully you know that's the case and I mean because people do lose their distal ilium and their and their SQL valve and so but they still you know can absorb uh more or less normally and um and hopefully that's your case as well um sonali cats trades I think the super chat um and um sorry I was just going to Quick quickly answer this one on Instagram how does carnivore help with anxiety and depression read lots of stories and people who are coming through diet basically it's just being in ketosis and that improves your mitochondrial function and after a couple months you get four times the mitochondria they work four times as well and that can help with all sorts of mental health disorders including anxiety crippling anxiety but also there are factors in plants that can disrupt our brain chemistry and really make us feel wretched and awful and so people are finding that even going from keto to carnivores as confers even more Improvement and more health benefits and outcomes for mental health in other way other things as well so that's why asks I have a cousin who has um uh yeah heart disease diabetes overweight list of things hard to get her to stop using sugar because she thinks she needs it for her blood glucose to be maintained at night is it okay for someone with their single carnivore absolutely it's very important for them to at least go keto their clinical trials showing that Diabetes Type 2 diabetes can be reversed it can come off insulin entirely type 1 diabetes you just reduce significantly the amount of insulin that your body demands because you're just you're just not pumping in a ton of carbs you're making carbs and you just need a bit of insulin to utilize that obviously under a doctor's supervision but yeah 100 so you can she can go uh zero carb or carnivore even better carnivore and in fact she would benefit greatly from doing that and probably if she's type 2 diabetic she can she could even reverse it and come off entirely my mom's not on insulin anymore she was on insulin for decades you know she's not anymore you know and so you know that's something to think about and we've proven this climate it's not just anecdotal it's not just my mom it's not just all the hundreds of people thousands of people I've been talking to over the years uh who have done this this has proven in clinical trials and and controlled trials in human populations so um yeah there you go uh stink ass cat uh thank you for the Super Chat uh says that they lost 50 pounds in three months on Hardcore carnivore thanks for all the good advice stock oh that's awesome that's always great to hear and uh thank you very much for your support I'm glad that that uh this helped and I'm glad that you I mean you're the one put in the work you're the one who did uh something that everyone told you was going to make you worse and it didn't and so you know you took the risk and you got the reward so well done question from dust thank you for the for the Super Chat um I've got osteoarthritis in my foot can I do anything on a carnivore diet to reverse it or prevent it from getting worse than 34 years old well it's not going to regrow cartilage that I know of there are some areas of cartilage that you can sort of uh reverse on the damage and even regrow um you know getting you know it's like the knees over the toes guy he actually you know has a full ranges of motion and all your joints and things like that including the knees and ankles and that actually gets more nutrients into the joint and you can actually strengthen things up quite a lot by doing that um but carnivore you know you're going to reduce the inflammation entirely you're going to improve your health overall and that's going and that can at least uh significantly mitigate and reduce the symptoms that you're feeling the pain that you experience and uh and can and slow or even stop the progression of osteoarthritis but when you have when you have also with rice you have this sort of rough surfaces and cartilage now there's friction it's going to scrape on itself it's going to cause more friction it's going to cause more fraying and that's going to progress I don't know if it's going to stop this just by going on the carnivore diet unfortunately but it will significantly slow it down and it will significantly improve your symptoms thereof oh my God every time YouTube sucks for this and I just try to scroll for a second it slams you all the way to the bottom so I'm trying to go through these in order guys um how long does it usually oh this is an Instagram question how long does it usually take to improve on a carnivore diet or for energy levels to improve a carnivore diet um well as far as getting fat adapted keto adapted it can take anywhere from two to three weeks uh some people laugh like I didn't I didn't have any lag period I just felt better right away and uh but you can also you can also uh be tired because you're eating during the day you're going to get tired after you eat uh you may not be eating enough you may not be eating enough fat you may not be drinking enough water you may be withdrawing from caffeine and that can affect your energy levels as well and make you feel pretty cruddy but given about sort of three weeks and you're doing all those things well you should be out of it by then you should be doing a lot better at that point um Josh bellbot asks thank you for the super chat um what studies or medical literature would have you come out uh would have to come out for you to change your stance on a carnivore lifestyle being optimal on Carnival by the way oh goodness well I mean look I mean do change all the time and I am open-minded to this and you know when I was coming to these conclusions you know I said okay well what am I missing you know what's the other side of the argument I didn't want to just just think like oh I got it and I'm just I only look at the things that I wanted to look at and uh and say oh look isn't this the moment we went I wanted to look at the most compelling arguments on the other side and see okay what what did they have to say about this what do they have to show for it and so I went to you know Gregor's website I went to Dean Orange's website I read their papers I read I didn't read their damn books but I I went to their you know blogs and I you know and I looked at all the different things they were addressing the evidence that they were presenting um and um you know and I found that the entirety of their arguments were based on on you know false premises such as cholesterol causes heart disease and saturated fat causes heart disease they don't that's that's a that's a fact you know I mean this is just a matter of historical record that these guys uh who did these original studies were frauds and they they falsified the data the Framingham study shows that the less cholesterol you have the worse your heart disease gets so you know not the opposite the American Heart Association misrepresented that two years later and said it was the opposite that higher cholesterol caused more heart disease I was taught that in medical school you know everyone has taught that in medical school that that's what the Framingham study shows it doesn't show that it shows the opposite and so this is garbage so they're basing these things on false premises they're saying well you can't eat meat because that's saturated fat because oh it just causes these diseases no it doesn't Okay and we know that um and um and that's pretty much it I mean that's really what they base all this stuff on um and uh you know you can't even get a basic complement of nutrients on a vegan diet so how can that be our optimal diet I mean you can't you can't even survive on it you have to take supplements okay so that's insane um and uh you know so all of these arguments were just were wrong or fallacious we're based on very bad information that false premises and pretexts that were demonstrably wrong and so um you know just just made my understanding of this even more uh more firm but you know what would come out I mean you know we would have to find that those cave paintings were actually of carrots and not Buffalo uh we would have to find that the you know our ancestors actually were herbivores eating plants that exist now but didn't exist then somehow or maybe some master plant that actually had everything that we needed like a steak does and um instead of all these different plants that didn't exist on the continent that we grew up on and were just on all these different places that we would never have access to um you know I mean I'll there would have to be a lot there would be a lot that that would come out but I'm not I'm not against it I'm constantly you know trying to be challenged on this because you know I don't I don't want to be giving people bad information uh that terrifies me that terrifies me that you know uh that that I could be hurting people that that really bothers me in my family myself I mean I've been doing this a lot longer than most people have and you know and I don't want to be sick and I don't want to be unhealthy I want to live a very long healthy life and right now I am I feel great and I I certainly don't want to hurt others and so I I do want to see what is out there but you know the more and more I look and the more and more I'm challenged on this and the more and more I look at other people's arguments like the more comfortable and confident I am in in this position so um I just think more and more information is going to come out to the positive and we're all early adopters and and um and early adopters and early innovators and things like that so I think we're going to be on the the spearhead of uh something very very good for people uh and I I hope I hope we are okay another secret chat um from a name unfortunately uh is not in a language I recognize and so I can't pronounce but I say oh all right well it says it in the text so hey brother this is Paul Weiss thank you for the answers uh that you sent me we are going strong on a carnivore diet and just love it thank you for for what you do okay well great well it's great to great to hear from you great to see you and thank you very much um for you know for the kind words and uh and I'm glad that that was helping you and I just wish you guys the best keep it up oh I kind of did it again every time okay so there's there's a couple more Super chats here guys and I'm probably gonna have to call it after that because I do have to run over to my Premiere uh with Jessica uh henrard uh which is which is going now and but we'll continue talking there as we'll be in the chats there um talking to people um and uh you know typing and chatting during the during that uh so from Jerry Baker can carnivore helped reduce nerve pain left over from shingles absolutely yeah it can absolutely help reduce that it's going to reduce inflammation in general and reduce that pain uh shingles pain is really nasty uh it can and can Linger on for quite some time but uh yes it can reduce nerve pain in general and inflammation in particular and um uh you know so I think it's definitely worth going for and looking you know even if it doesn't it's going to help you in so many other ways that it's well worth doing uh so I would I would definitely do that but I've had patients that had um you know decompressive surgery for trapped nerve and they um and they uh didn't get relief and they still had ongoing pain and we're looking at MRIs I'm like look we can't help you sometimes the nerve is just permanently damaged we can't do anything about it after a certain point and um but they go on a carnivore diet or or just a ketogenic diet of carnivores best uh kind of ketogenic diet out there and it actually resolves and they come off their pain medication and they their Fibromyalgia symptoms go away so this is amazing um I've seen them do some wonderful things as far as inflammation and pain is concerned so I I would I would expect this thing to happen uh with yourself so uh and I hope it does good luck with that okay um so this is this is the last question guys um it's from uh Janet McGregor I have PCOS IBS psoriatic arthritis uh gallbladder polyps and more been Carnival for three weeks and lost eight kilograms awesome uh question terrible periods I get really hungry even though I add fat making more uh making more blood or gallbladder I don't quite understand the last part of that question but um as far as terrible periods are concerned yeah look that's something that unfortunately can happen when you're when your body and your hormones are sort of recalibrating and that can take that can take months you know um so I know people that have not had all the same issues but have all of a sudden disrupted their their period and maybe lengthened the period cycle and then it sort of shortened and then they sort of was normalized and they got back to normal so just make sure if you're really hungry my goodness keep eating and not just add fat but just eat enough fatty meat you know that usually comes with meat just don't trim it away get fattier Cuts uh add butter if you have to hopefully you can just get it from your meat and uh and just eat until it stops tasting good and eat a couple times a day there are a lot of a lot of people that are healing a lot of these you know former health issues and nutritional deficiencies and hormonal imbalances that need just a lot more meat they need a lot more food they need a lot more fat and so you know there's some people especially if they coming from you know depleted nutrient uh you know way of eating before maybe they had an eating disorder or something as well they're they're eating thousands I mean there was a lady that had on the podcast um uh Clara who goes by or Claire sorry who goes by um Lolly carnivore and you know she was anorexic and vegan and uh and almost actually died for six minutes so she was resuscitated and um she had a BMI of nine and so she was an extraordinarily emaciated and she ended up going on a carnivore diet and has just found Newfound life she's back to a more normal weight but she she was eating like 8 000 calories a day just just going to town on this but that she needed that she needed that her body needed those nutrients that had been starved for nutrition and energy for decades and so she needed that and so you might need that as well you might need a bit more and if you're hungry you're hungry keep eating keep eating keep eating uh fatty meat if you're using artificial sweeteners or a bit of carbs or things like that I think that can can disrupt it so I would I would be careful with that um but yeah and I just keep eating and uh I think you I think you'll do fine uh and eventually your hormones will normalize I think your periods were normalized as well um and I have a couple chats here hey Dr chafee hey how you guys doing um all right guys well I think that's uh that should do it um it's been great I I actually only meant to be here for an hour and then go over to the um the live that's starting but um obviously you know we just sort of got into got into a role there and
