        "body": "okay hey guys uh this is dr chafee um just wanted\u00a0\nto do a quick uh video just just going over some\u00a0\u00a0 of the points that was made in the recent\u00a0\ncarnival versus vegan debate that was held by\u00a0\u00a0 uh acton and just do a bit of a rebuttal\u00a0\non some of the points that the vegan team\u00a0\u00a0 made um just because we didn't have a bit\u00a0\nas much of a back and forth um during the\u00a0\u00a0 the debate itself so i just wanted to address\u00a0\nsome of the points that they had as well or sort\u00a0\u00a0 of go through them live and then sort of you\u00a0\nknow stop and start and uh talk about things\u00a0\u00a0 as we go okay uh i also just want to say you know\u00a0\ni had a really nice time with this time you know\u00a0\u00a0 everybody involved you know you know whether or\u00a0\nnot we agree or disagree everyone you know was\u00a0\u00a0 coming from a very honest place you know they\u00a0\nthey you know my impression was that everybody\u00a0\u00a0 you know truly wanted uh what was right for people\u00a0\nthey wanted to sort of figure out the truth and\u00a0\u00a0 and what was the best way to help people and i\u00a0\nthink that's the best way of doing things and\u00a0\u00a0 i think it's very important for uh like-minded\u00a0\npeople in that in that regard uh to come together\u00a0\u00a0 and have these sorts of discussions and i think\u00a0\nthat it went uh very well from that standpoint\u00a0\u00a0 and uh everything was very uh you know collegial\u00a0\nwhich is which is the way to do it and you have to\u00a0\u00a0 have these sorts of discussions and debates so\u00a0\nthat you know your people hash out their ideas\u00a0\u00a0 and and bounce them off other people that have an\u00a0\nopposing view and and see what comes up so uh i\u00a0\u00a0 think that that went well from that standpoint i\u00a0\njust wanted to to go through uh some of those so\u00a0\u00a0 we'll start here with uh uh first uh\u00a0\ngentlemen who's an amazing guest here we go uh good evening everyone and thank you for joining\u00a0\nand thank you pran for opening up opening up the\u00a0\u00a0 debate i want to start off to think about why\u00a0\nwe choose a dietary pattern we either choose\u00a0\u00a0 it to live longer or to prevent disease and\u00a0\npran gave some very interesting arguments but\u00a0\u00a0 nowhere did i hear about any thing about the\u00a0\ncarnivore diet preventing the most common\u00a0\u00a0 diseases of western society or prolonging life\u00a0\nthe major disease is now it's a quick one on that\u00a0\u00a0 so obviously there there aren't you know robust\u00a0\nstudies that have have specifically exclusively\u00a0\u00a0 looked at the carnivore diet and you know what\u00a0\nthat's going to do long term these are these are\u00a0\u00a0 starting to come out now harvard just published\u00a0\na study um there was another study that just came\u00a0\u00a0 out you know just a couple days ago as well and\u00a0\nthis is going to sort of get the ball rolling\u00a0\u00a0 on those sorts of things hopefully we will get\u00a0\nthat sort of thing the the point that people in\u00a0\u00a0 the meat is good or carnivore camp uh are coming\u00a0\nfor or are making is that you know there is there\u00a0\u00a0 is data and there's information that you know it\u00a0\nis very clear that the the thoughts and and um uh\u00a0\u00a0 you know notions that we've had for for decades\u00a0\nnow are actually not true and so you know when you\u00a0\u00a0 have a you know sort of you know something based\u00a0\non a false pretense predicated on information we\u00a0\u00a0 now know as false we have new information that\u00a0\nthat shows that it's not that it's not accurate\u00a0\u00a0 you have to sort of throw those those assumptions\u00a0\nout and you have to start over again okay and\u00a0\u00a0 that's and that's a lot of what these arguments\u00a0\nare from they're quite robust actually so you\u00a0\u00a0 know just not having you know a specific size\u00a0\noh where's your rct that shows exactly what\u00a0\u00a0 carnivore does well they're coming but there's\u00a0\nthere's evidence that exists outside of that\u00a0\u00a0 and a big part of that evidence is showing that\u00a0\nyour evidence uh isn't actually accurate okay\u00a0\u00a0 now society relate to cardiovascular disease\u00a0\ncardiometabolic disease and cancer and vegan and\u00a0\u00a0 mostly plant-based diets are the only dietary\u00a0\npatterns that are able to achieve these goals\u00a0\u00a0 when will you think about choosing\u00a0\na dietary pattern for our health\u00a0\u00a0 just a quick one there again\u00a0\nyou know i addressed this in\u00a0\u00a0 you know my my part of the debate and i went\u00a0\nfurther on my my larger discussion on my arguments\u00a0\u00a0 what what is a vegan diet vegan just means not\u00a0\nmeat so the only thing that makes a vegan diet is\u00a0\u00a0 not meat so you know any vegan diet so just eat\u00a0\noreo cookies and shoot heroin that that's okay\u00a0\u00a0 that's going to reduce your cancer rate that's\u00a0\ngoing to be better than eating a steak really\u00a0\u00a0 you know probably not so you know when when\u00a0\nyou're talking about vegan diet like what does\u00a0\u00a0 that even mean you know generally when people go\u00a0\nvegan they're being very health conscious they're\u00a0\u00a0 thinking about this they're not eating processed\u00a0\nfoods they're not going out to meals they're\u00a0\u00a0 not eating drinking sodas they're not eating\u00a0\nthings with a bunch of added sugar and so forth\u00a0\u00a0 you're cutting out a lot of things that\u00a0\nthat actually cause harm we know cause harm\u00a0\u00a0 and so of course you're going to get better if you\u00a0\nwere eating those things before and so you know\u00a0\u00a0 that's not a that's not a controlled experiment\u00a0\na controlled experience means you change one\u00a0\u00a0 variable and you look at this group that hasn't\u00a0\nchanged anything you change one variable and then\u00a0\u00a0 you look at this group that's what a controlled\u00a0\nuh trial looks at that's not what's going on here\u00a0\u00a0 with the vegan community they're not just changing\u00a0\none thing they're changing dozens of things\u00a0\u00a0 and then they're saying oh wow you know but\u00a0\nbecause we call it vegan vegan means no meat\u00a0\u00a0 that's what it is well no i'm sorry you know if\u00a0\nyou if you stop eating meat and you just eat a\u00a0\u00a0 bunch of oreo cookies and you're drinking alcohol\u00a0\nand smoking cigarettes all plant-based you are\u00a0\u00a0 not going to be doing well i'm sorry so they're\u00a0\ndoing a lot of other things the people that have\u00a0\u00a0 benefits are doing a lot of other things because a\u00a0\nlot of people don't a lot of people do eat a bunch\u00a0\u00a0 of crap because they think that well it's vegan\u00a0\ntherefore is good for me no of course it's not health and well-being we have to think about\u00a0\noutcome benefits the first thing we do is\u00a0\u00a0 do is do no harm and i have seen plenty of\u00a0\nharm done by people eating a predominantly\u00a0\u00a0 carnivore diet especially with underlying\u00a0\nunderlying heart disease and then we have to\u00a0\u00a0 think about choosing a dietary pattern that is\u00a0\nevidence for outcomes and reduced disease race\u00a0\u00a0 when we recommend this for our patients and\u00a0\nourselves and for the people around us this is\u00a0\u00a0 what we need to look for and the evidence needs to\u00a0\nbe consistent for the food patterns and individual\u00a0\u00a0 foods within that particular particular patterns\u00a0\nand that can only be said for for a vegan diet\u00a0\u00a0 as a preventative cardiologist\u00a0\ni've been on a 10 year journey\u00a0\u00a0 to recommend sustainable dietary pattern that\u00a0\nallow patients to have a reduced disease rate and\u00a0\u00a0 reduce reliance on medications to treat cardiac\u00a0\ncardiovascular disease and it's no surprise to\u00a0\u00a0 see that the ex-president of the american college\u00a0\nof cardiology kim williams after his first heart\u00a0\u00a0 attack decided to become vegan you know and also\u00a0\nother wonderful preventative cardiologists such as\u00a0\u00a0 robert vogel team doctor to the nfl and\u00a0\nand dean ornish throughout this debate\u00a0\u00a0 i would urge you okay so that's appealing\u00a0\nto authority first of all just because some\u00a0\u00a0 some expert or something somewhere says this is\u00a0\nthe right way to go doesn't actually mean that it\u00a0\u00a0 is hitler was an expert hitler was an authority\u00a0\ndo we just do everything that he said because\u00a0\u00a0 you know he's an authority no of course not you\u00a0\nknow that's nice that you know people are are\u00a0\u00a0 going this that they feel that they're an expert\u00a0\nand they feel that that's the right thing for them\u00a0\u00a0 to do but it doesn't actually prove anything you\u00a0\nknow um and again what vegan diet what vegan diet\u00a0\u00a0 is he talking about does he just say yeah just\u00a0\neat oreo cookies and you know you know and a\u00a0\u00a0 bunch of pasta and drink soda that's all vegan you\u00a0\nknow oreo cookies are vegan okay so you know i'm\u00a0\u00a0 positive that he is not having people do that when\u00a0\nthey go onto a vegan diet and i'm sure he doesn't\u00a0\u00a0 recommend that either so there's this conflation\u00a0\nwhere you're saying you go on to a vegan diet and\u00a0\u00a0 everything gets better and i'm sure he's having\u00a0\nyou know very good results you know and and he's\u00a0\u00a0 obviously someone who cares about his patients and\u00a0\nobviously someone who's trying to do the best for\u00a0\u00a0 them and i'm sure that the diets and things like\u00a0\nthat that he's putting forward are helping them\u00a0\u00a0 where are they starting where are they ending up\u00a0\nthey're probably eating a whole bunch processed\u00a0\u00a0 crap with a bunch of sugar and carbohydrates and\u00a0\nother nonsense and then he's getting him off all\u00a0\u00a0 of that crap and put him on like a whole food\u00a0\nvegan sort of plant-based whatever and at the\u00a0\u00a0 same time he's saying oh and reduce the amount\u00a0\nof fat and you know saturated fat animal fat and\u00a0\u00a0 animal products that you have you know but\u00a0\nhe's going to be changing a lot of things\u00a0\u00a0 as well okay and you know we have we have so\u00a0\nmuch evidence to show that that cholesterol\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't actually cause heart disease that's not\u00a0\nthe problem here this is an inflammatory process\u00a0\u00a0 and you know actually has to do with you know\u00a0\num you know hyperglycemia and you know um\u00a0\u00a0 different kinds of cholesterol molecules like\u00a0\nvldl and hdl or sorry vldl and sdldl that are\u00a0\u00a0 derived from fructose and alcohol not from meat\u00a0\nand that these then get glycated from the high\u00a0\u00a0 blood sugar and that your your body can't suck\u00a0\nthese things up anymore because it's just damaged\u00a0\u00a0 now that's what glycation is is what kills\u00a0\ndiabetics having that high blood sugar\u00a0\u00a0 and so now your body can't suck these things\u00a0\nup you get by your liver can't you process\u00a0\u00a0 them the only things that can pick these up are\u00a0\nthe scavenger receptors on your macrophages and\u00a0\u00a0 so your macrophages start picking these things\u00a0\nup they just eat them up eat them up eat them\u00a0\u00a0 up beat them up and up and they grow and grow\u00a0\nand grow they turn these massive foam cells and\u00a0\u00a0 during this whole inflammatory process you start\u00a0\ngetting these these atherosclerotic plaques okay\u00a0\u00a0 that's been well described in the literature okay\u00a0\nso it's not cholesterol it's this entire disease\u00a0\u00a0 process that is generally you know pushed and\u00a0\npredicated on eating sugar eating carbohydrates\u00a0\u00a0 drinking alcohol okay smoking cigarettes oh\u00a0\nthere's a ton of things that that add to this\u00a0\u00a0 you know but just eating cholesterol is\u00a0\nreally not not the driving factor here\u00a0\u00a0 the carnival team to produce any long-term\u00a0\nstudies to show that a carnivore diet produces\u00a0\u00a0 a reduction in cut in in event rates or\u00a0\nreduction in reduction in cancer again\u00a0\u00a0 you know we don't have those studies that show\u00a0\nspecifically a carnivore diet is going to do this\u00a0\u00a0 we've got a ton of evidence and studies showing\u00a0\nthat like ketogenic does it we have a ton of\u00a0\u00a0 evidence biochemical evidence showing that if you\u00a0\ncut out carbohydrates this shrinks cancers that\u00a0\u00a0 this actually reduces your risk of cancers and\u00a0\nso forth by certain specific biochemical pathways\u00a0\u00a0 that that get disrupted when you eat carbohydrates\u00a0\nokay at a cellular at a microcellular level okay\u00a0\u00a0 um you know so that's a that's a false argument\u00a0\nyou know it's like of course we're not going to\u00a0\u00a0 produce a lot you know 30-year long carnivore\u00a0\nstudy showing that they don't exist yet because\u00a0\u00a0 this is a very new burgeoning argument that's\u00a0\nactually very very old but it's just being\u00a0\u00a0 rediscovered now um and so we of course we don't\u00a0\nhave the data for that you know but we do have\u00a0\u00a0 data looking at indigenous people like the inuits\u00a0\nand so forth or the native australians where they\u00a0\u00a0 don't they weren't eating any you know plant-based\u00a0\nproducts at all they're eating very high fat diets\u00a0\u00a0 they weren't getting any of these problems and\u00a0\nthey'll they'll argue there's like oh well there's\u00a0\u00a0 these studies that actually show that you know\u00a0\nthe indians and so forth uh living i mean wherever\u00a0\u00a0 i actually have you know mixed sort of you know\u00a0\nsome have heart disease some have atherosclerosis\u00a0\u00a0 some don't some have diabetes actually you\u00a0\nknow you can't just say that those studies\u00a0\u00a0 look at the inuit people as an ethnic population\u00a0\nnot living in their natural state as carnivores\u00a0\u00a0 as high-fat carnivores they're talking\u00a0\nso they're including the people living\u00a0\u00a0 in cities eating a western diet well we all know\u00a0\nthat's going to be that's going to be a problem\u00a0\u00a0 we're trying we're not talking about the ethnic\u00a0\ngroup inuits we're talking about their traditional\u00a0\u00a0 diet and what does that do and that actually\u00a0\nshows a significant benefit of in health and\u00a0\u00a0 reduction in disease um you know i learned when\u00a0\ni was a kid that you know native americans when\u00a0\u00a0 eating a western diet were four times as likely\u00a0\nto get obesity heart disease diabetes cancer and\u00a0\u00a0 so forth right i remember thinking as a kid\u00a0\nwell you know doesn't that mean that the food\u00a0\u00a0 is causing the disease because if they don't eat\u00a0\nthe food they don't get the disease and we eat the\u00a0\u00a0 food and we get the disease we just get it at\u00a0\na lower rate you know and i was thinking okay\u00a0\u00a0 well what what is a non-western diet you know what\u00a0\nwould they normally be eating that they're not\u00a0\u00a0 now and you know what are they eating that\u00a0\nwe're not vice versa right they never really\u00a0\u00a0 said anything but what you know but the answer to\u00a0\nthat is they were they were high-fat carnivores\u00a0\u00a0 you know planes indians were eating buffalo\u00a0\nthey drive a herd off off a cliff they have\u00a0\u00a0 they have really fatty meat make pemmican look it\u00a0\nup it's cool with that it's actually really good\u00a0\u00a0 they would eat that the rest of the damn year\u00a0\nokay you have the inuits up north they they're\u00a0\u00a0 you know eating seal and and walrus and and uh you\u00a0\nknow bear and things like that polar bear fish and\u00a0\u00a0 so forth so you know then when they go onto a\u00a0\nwestern diet and you'll drink alcohol and eat\u00a0\u00a0 sugar and things like that as well they get very\u00a0\nvery sick okay but then if you stop eating that it\u00a0\u00a0 goes away okay so that that's showing causation\u00a0\nthere and there's a study in australia that\u00a0\u00a0 actually showed that as well because they you know\u00a0\nthey're very very you know unhealthy population\u00a0\u00a0 you know as a whole here in australia the native\u00a0\naustralians uh that's because they're eating you\u00a0\u00a0 know western food and they're you know drinking\u00a0\nalcohol eating sugar and all these sorts of things\u00a0\u00a0 and then someone figured out was like okay\u00a0\nwell you know if you you guys won't normally\u00a0\u00a0 eat this stuff you know why don't you just\u00a0\ngo back to eat what you normally do which is\u00a0\u00a0 meat you know just animals that you you are\u00a0\nable to hunt in the in the wild and then when\u00a0\u00a0 you got them on that it just it just reversed\u00a0\neverything okay so this is showing causation\u00a0\u00a0 okay and there's actual studies that do show\u00a0\ncausation with like fructose and metabolic disease\u00a0\u00a0 and all these other sorts of things as well so\u00a0\nagain you don't have that perfectly designed you\u00a0\u00a0 know 30-year rct with you know carnivore versus\u00a0\nwhatever but there's other things that exist you\u00a0\u00a0 know there's a you know where's the randomized\u00a0\ncontrol trial showing that parachutes work\u00a0\u00a0 where's the randomized control trial showing\u00a0\nthat smoking causes cancer or you know after\u00a0\u00a0 or you know atherosclerosis or emphysema you know\u00a0\nthis is something we we just take for granted this\u00a0\u00a0 is what we're taught this is what we teach\u00a0\nand this is what we see but there aren't\u00a0\u00a0 any randomized control trials showing that\u00a0\nokay so again you know there's evidence that\u00a0\u00a0 exists outside of a randomized control trial\u00a0\nbut there are carnivore studies coming as well and i might even try to convince you to think\u00a0\nthat all the top researchers from the top\u00a0\u00a0 epidemiologists and every top doctor treating\u00a0\ncardio cardiovascular disease and oncology would\u00a0\u00a0 be thinking that they've got it wrong they've got\u00a0\nit right i want to bring you the evidence based\u00a0\u00a0 okay so here's sort of obviously you're gonna\u00a0\nhave to stop a lot here because there's just\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of these things are just um i think\u00a0\nthat they're not really robust arguments\u00a0\u00a0 so again you know it's just like you know how dare\u00a0\nyou question all the top epidemiologists in the\u00a0\u00a0 world well first of all epidemiological\u00a0\ndata um is used to to back things up\u00a0\u00a0 they don't have any business doing that when\u00a0\nyou're looking at epidemiological studies\u00a0\u00a0 generally if it doesn't show a 200\u00a0\npercent you know increased correlation\u00a0\u00a0 you don't even look at it as significant all these\u00a0\nepidemiological studies are showing like an 18\u00a0\u00a0 increase and so forth they have so many\u00a0\nconfounding factors that go into these sorts\u00a0\u00a0 of things and in fact when they redid all these\u00a0\nepidemiological studies they didn't even show a\u00a0\u00a0 correlation between you know eating meat and bowel\u00a0\ncancer eating meat and heart disease eating meat\u00a0\u00a0 and all these sorts of things okay so um you know\u00a0\nand and again that's appealing to authority just\u00a0\u00a0 because you know teachers said so that doesn't\u00a0\nactually mean it's true you know all the top\u00a0\u00a0 scientists in the world thought the earth was flat\u00a0\ntoo at one point how'd that one work out okay and\u00a0\u00a0 if you really want to know what the top the top\u00a0\nepidemiologist on earth thinks professor john i\u00a0\u00a0 neides from stanford who is one of the top 10 most\u00a0\ncited researchers of all time in any field he said\u00a0\u00a0 and i quote that eat lancet study is not\u00a0\nscience it's science fiction and that's\u00a0\u00a0 the only way i can describe it or paraphrase\u00a0\nthem anyway so actually the top epidemiologists\u00a0\u00a0 think this is garbage and they've shown\u00a0\nscarves you look up his work he talks about it observational studies when we think about some of\u00a0\nthe work done in the blue zones by dan buettner\u00a0\u00a0 from ikaria loma linda sardinia um\u00a0\nokinawa and nikoi and costa rica\u00a0\u00a0 these diets of the world's longest living people\u00a0\nare predominantly plant-based they did not either\u00a0\u00a0 they did not eat a lot of red meat and i can\u00a0\nguarantee you they weren't in ketosis for the\u00a0\u00a0 for their whole lives yet these are the people\u00a0\nliving living to 90th 90 years old and longer\u00a0\u00a0 and are happy and alive so when you think about\u00a0\nokay again so these are very problematic studies\u00a0\u00a0 the blues blue zone study they only looked\u00a0\nat incomplete data they didn't look at every\u00a0\u00a0 single society they didn't look at native\u00a0\npopulations they were eating as a carnivore\u00a0\u00a0 okay they just skipped those out all right um and\u00a0\nyou know talking about okinawa okay uh okinawa\u00a0\u00a0 they're saying that all these people these things\u00a0\ndidn't eat red meat that's that's clever how he\u00a0\u00a0 used that word didn't use red meat they eat a\u00a0\nlot of pig they eat they have pigs all over that\u00a0\u00a0 island okay they eat a lot of meat okay it's just\u00a0\npig it's not red meat like oh sorry you know i\u00a0\u00a0 guess throw the whole whole argument out um and uh\u00a0\nactually uh the longest-lived city is um hong kong\u00a0\u00a0 uh and this again is averages from birth right\u00a0\nwhich is mostly meaningless but that's what\u00a0\u00a0 we're looking at uh that's how we compare these\u00a0\nthings so hong kong eats the most meat per capita\u00a0\u00a0 of any population in the world they have\u00a0\nthe longest average lifespan from birth okay\u00a0\u00a0 conveniently things like the blue\u00a0\nzone study and eat lancet and all that\u00a0\u00a0 just just ignore that okay or just leave it out\u00a0\nall right um and then okay these guys are living\u00a0\u00a0 to the 90s well they're not all living to their\u00a0\n90s again their average is you know i think it's\u00a0\u00a0 uh 78 in okinawa around there i think um hong kong\u00a0\nis around 80. anyway it but that's the highest\u00a0\u00a0 um so you know that's the average people are\u00a0\nliving older than that though but they're saying\u00a0\u00a0 they're living to their 90s okay great um we\u00a0\nknow as geneticists that the human animal is\u00a0\u00a0 chromosomally genetically designed to live 120\u00a0\nyears okay so 90 is dying young actually okay so\u00a0\u00a0 you're doing something wrong okay now maybe it's\u00a0\nbecause you're eating plants you're not eating\u00a0\u00a0 whatever it is you're doing something and again\u00a0\nokinawa eat a lot of meat they eat a lot of pig\u00a0\u00a0 okay um so you know that's not you know that's not\u00a0\nreally you know uh a fair assessment i don't think\u00a0\u00a0 uh you know these people you know they're\u00a0\nliving longer as having a plant-based diet\u00a0\u00a0 i then want to ask you to think about\u00a0\na biomarker and biomarkers we use which\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't necessarily change our mortality but\u00a0\nthey are clues and a plant-based diet is the only\u00a0\u00a0 and vegan diet is the only dietary pattern that\u00a0\nconsistently reduces and improves biomarkers\u00a0\u00a0 associated with major disease\u00a0\nstates we do know that a\u00a0\u00a0 plant-based diet reduces traditional risk\u00a0\nfactors such as high-sensitivity crpl ldlc and high in whole grains um nuts and seeds\u00a0\nleads a reduction in ldl blood pressure and also\u00a0\u00a0 lipoprotein delay even with as much as four weeks\u00a0\nwe can on a vegan diet we can see a reduction in c\u00a0\u00a0 and crp lp little a as powerful as taking as\u00a0\npowerful as taking statin medications then when\u00a0\u00a0 we think okay so let's talk about that okay so\u00a0\nuh you know he's talking he's talking about um\u00a0\u00a0 you know reduction of ldl cholesterol ldlc's\u00a0\nldl cholesterol um ldl cholesterol does not\u00a0\u00a0 cause heart disease okay all the big studies post\u00a0\n2015 have showed this conclusively okay there's a\u00a0\u00a0 meta-analysis so you have a you know control\u00a0\ntrials randomized control trials you have a\u00a0\u00a0 meta-analysis which looks at all those randomized\u00a0\ncontrol trials looks all the data and sort of\u00a0\u00a0 correlates it out statistically and said okay what\u00a0\nare we seeing here with this massive population\u00a0\u00a0 and these these you know massive group of people\u00a0\nnow the large meta-analysis um in the journal of\u00a0\u00a0 american college of cardiology published in 2021\u00a0\nso it's a recent study okay meta-analysis showed\u00a0\u00a0 that saturated fat was not a cardiovascular risk\u00a0\nand instead it was protective against stroke okay\u00a0\u00a0 so this goes against everything that we are have\u00a0\nbeen taught in medical school certainly that he\u00a0\u00a0 was taught during his uh you know residency in in\u00a0\ncardiology so you know it's understandable that\u00a0\u00a0 he's very much on the side of you know cholesterol\u00a0\nis bad because we've been railing against\u00a0\u00a0 cholesterol for 60 years okay it just happens to\u00a0\nbe wrong um more so the british journal of sports\u00a0\u00a0 medicine uh they published a paper in the last few\u00a0\nyears showing that saturated fat ldl cholesterol\u00a0\u00a0 is not a cause of heart disease um it's actually\u00a0\nan inflammatory process like i mentioned before\u00a0\u00a0 um and in fact there's an inverse relationship\u00a0\nuh between saturated fat intake and heart disease\u00a0\u00a0 inverse okay so it protects against heart disease\u00a0\nit also protects against alzheimer's and and\u00a0\u00a0 parkinson's and so forth because your brain is\u00a0\nmade out of fat and cholesterol and so forth you\u00a0\u00a0 need that to keep your brain healthy okay you need\u00a0\nto to to develop healthy as well so kids vitally\u00a0\u00a0 important for them to get this evil saturated fat\u00a0\nas well okay um there's a large study uh with 60\u00a0\u00a0 000 patients i think was published in 2015 looking\u00a0\nat stats you say oh this is better than stats at\u00a0\u00a0 reducing cholesterol we don't want to reduce\u00a0\ncholesterol cholesterol is not the problem okay\u00a0\u00a0 statins have side effects okay they sap your cells\u00a0\nof vitamin co q10 anybody who prescribes statins\u00a0\u00a0 you know without prescribing vitamin\u00a0\nc q10 i think is doing their patient a\u00a0\u00a0 big disservice okay because i can actually damage\u00a0\nyour your cells and damage your heart cells okay\u00a0\u00a0 so you're giving a medication to protect your\u00a0\nheart and you're you're now damaging your heart\u00a0\u00a0 with that medication okay that's not great so\u00a0\nthis looked at patients over the age of 65 is the\u00a0\u00a0 most common cohort for people they're at risk of\u00a0\nheart disease and and um and heart attack zero\u00a0\u00a0 on statins sixty thousand people they found that\u00a0\nthere was a that that taking statins was at least\u00a0\u00a0 neutral in their um in their risk of getting\u00a0\na heart attack and stroke and so forth or even\u00a0\u00a0 worse okay so people are having statins having you\u00a0\nknow lower ldl cholesterol we're actually having\u00a0\u00a0 worse outcomes okay so statistically was actually\u00a0\nwasn't quite even it was actually they were a\u00a0\u00a0 little worse okay so saying look we really need\u00a0\nto rethink this because we're giving a medication\u00a0\u00a0 that that is is not helping it is definitely\u00a0\nnot helping and it could be causing harm and\u00a0\u00a0 i would argue that it does cause harm\u00a0\nbecause you're giving somebody something\u00a0\u00a0 that has side effects and no benefit okay so\u00a0\nthat's the definition of causing harm okay\u00a0\u00a0 the british uh you know uh the bmj the british\u00a0\nmedical journal um they did a literature review\u00a0\u00a0 a few years ago as well again found no association\u00a0\nare actually in inverse association between\u00a0\u00a0 ldl cholesterol and all cause mortality and\u00a0\ncardiovascular mortality in the elderly okay so\u00a0\u00a0 what are we doing that's not a marker of disease\u00a0\nthere was another study another lit review in 2018\u00a0\u00a0 um that showed again ldl cholesterol does not\u00a0\ncause cardiovascular disease there's another\u00a0\u00a0 study showing that lower cholesterol level\u00a0\nlevels were linked to depression and suicide\u00a0\u00a0 okay so people that had lower ldl cholesterol\u00a0\nwere having much higher rates of depression and\u00a0\u00a0 the ones who had depression and low cholesterol\u00a0\nhad a much higher rate of suicide okay that's\u00a0\u00a0 a big deal all right so in fact now psychiatrists\u00a0\nwho know this are now recommending their patients\u00a0\u00a0 get your damn cholesterol up okay that's good is\u00a0\ngoing to save your life and change your life okay\u00a0\u00a0 um so you know this is all the new data this\u00a0\nis this is very robust stuff we're talking\u00a0\u00a0 about hundreds of thousands of patients we're\u00a0\ntalking about massive studies meta-analyses all\u00a0\u00a0 these sorts of things okay but we almost don't\u00a0\nneed them okay because all the studies that\u00a0\u00a0 showed that cholesterol caused heart disease were\u00a0\nbunk there is no high level evidence that actually\u00a0\u00a0 shows that cholesterol is even associated\u00a0\nwith heart disease no high level evidence\u00a0\u00a0 none and the evidence that we do have we now\u00a0\nknow is bunk we now know it's not only false\u00a0\u00a0 but fraudulent okay the journal of american\u00a0\nmedical association published in 2015 actual\u00a0\u00a0 internal memos from the sugar companies back\u00a0\nin you know you know 40s 50s 60s talking about\u00a0\u00a0 how there were studies coming out that that were\u00a0\nsuggesting that sugar caused heart disease now we\u00a0\u00a0 you have actual hard evidence to suggest that it\u00a0\ndoes okay so at the time they were like okay well\u00a0\u00a0 you know we need to put some you know counter\u00a0\narguments out there so in their own words in\u00a0\u00a0 their own documents they detailed how they paid\u00a0\noff three harvard professors to falsify data and\u00a0\u00a0 publish fraudulent studies to make it appear as\u00a0\nif cholesterol was causing heart disease when it\u00a0\u00a0 was really sugar and one of those professors was\u00a0\nnamed head of the usda in 1965 and then the usda\u00a0\u00a0 is the was the one that declared unequivocally\u00a0\nthat cholesterol causes heart disease saturated\u00a0\u00a0 fat increases cholesterol stop eating both it\u00a0\nchanged the world people stopped eating fat they\u00a0\u00a0 stopped eating cholesterol i stopped eating red\u00a0\nmeat especially and eggs because all these are\u00a0\u00a0 the worst they have the most cholesterol actually\u00a0\nthey're the best they have the most nutrients that\u00a0\u00a0 which cholesterol is one of and so a saturated\u00a0\nfat what were the results you know we reduced our\u00a0\u00a0 our cholesterol intake by 30 reduced red meat\u00a0\nby 33 percent increased fruits and vegetables\u00a0\u00a0 by 30 and 40 respectively increase you know\u00a0\nsugars and grains as well what happened this is\u00a0\u00a0 in america hundreds of millions of people what\u00a0\nhappened the obesity rate tripled stroke crate\u00a0\u00a0 tripled heart disease tripled cancer rates tripled\u00a0\ntype 2 diabetes autoimmune disorders alzheimer's\u00a0\u00a0 parkinson's even neurodevelopmental delays such\u00a0\nas autism these all increased exponentially\u00a0\u00a0 okay these almost didn't exist before now\u00a0\nthey're the only things we treat so you know\u00a0\u00a0 he's talking about well where's your where's your\u00a0\nevidence to say that a carnivore diet is going to\u00a0\u00a0 reduce these things dude where's yours you know\u00a0\nthe you know you we reduced cholesterol by 30 we\u00a0\u00a0 reduce saturate you know saturated fat and and\u00a0\nred meat by 30 33 okay heart disease went up\u00a0\u00a0 heart disease tripled okay so that is that is\u00a0\nvery conclusive right well maybe there's something\u00a0\u00a0 else going on obviously there's a lot of these\u00a0\nthings can go on but when you run an experiment\u00a0\u00a0 especially with hundreds of millions of people\u00a0\nand you get these outcomes you have to start\u00a0\u00a0 thinking about it okay as richard feynman said you\u00a0\nknow it doesn't matter how brilliant your theory\u00a0\u00a0 is and it doesn't matter how smart you are if it\u00a0\ndoesn't agree with experiment it's wrong okay so\u00a0\u00a0 we did the experiment it's wrong okay and we know\u00a0\nthat we have we have hard evidence showing that\u00a0\u00a0 it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] okay ansel keys did something called\u00a0\nthe seven you know seven nation study or something\u00a0\u00a0 like that and he found the nations that say oh the\u00a0\nmore cholesterol you have the more heart disease\u00a0\u00a0 you have it was it was this exponential growth was\u00a0\nexponential you know chart okay wow that was very\u00a0\u00a0 that was very compelling but that's a correlation\u00a0\ncorrelation does not equal causation okay\u00a0\u00a0 and he had complete data for like 23 countries\u00a0\nhe only used the seven that fit the graph if you\u00a0\u00a0 look at the rest of the of the of the countries\u00a0\nif you plot those on a graph it's just scattered\u00a0\u00a0 you know so there isn't even a correlation\u00a0\u00a0 okay there isn't a correlation let alone a\u00a0\ncausation okay so there is no correlation between\u00a0\u00a0 cholesterol and heart disease framingham study\u00a0\nokay there's a very famous study in cardiology\u00a0\u00a0 i think it's like 76 000 patients followed\u00a0\nthem for like 20 years and they're like okay\u00a0\u00a0 what sort of markers these biomarkers that he's\u00a0\ntalking about which ones are significant and they\u00a0\u00a0 concluded that cholesterol total cholesterol is\u00a0\nbefore we distinguish them total cholesterol being\u00a0\u00a0 higher was an increased risk for heart disease and\u00a0\ncardiovascular disease okay the only problem with\u00a0\u00a0 that is their own results and findings showed\u00a0\nthe opposite okay but they actually you know\u00a0\u00a0 and you can find this and they says like well you\u00a0\nknow we did find this and this that and the other\u00a0\u00a0 however we still feel that you know cholesterol\u00a0\nis is a significant uh risk factor okay that's\u00a0\u00a0 fraud that that is your academic malpractice\u00a0\nokay but that went out and you get these things\u00a0\u00a0 and you repeat them so many times that people\u00a0\njust oh well that's what it is everyone knows\u00a0\u00a0 it well again everyone knew that the earth\u00a0\nwas flat too not that one worked out right\u00a0\u00a0 oh and the seeds too i mean okay you who cares\u00a0\nif you're we don't care that we're reducing ldl\u00a0\u00a0 cholesterol but you know it does one thing though\u00a0\nlet's say that you wanted it to do reduce the ldl\u00a0\u00a0 cholesterol okay but you got to understand this\u00a0\nis a complex you know organic count you know these\u00a0\u00a0 are all complex organic compounds you're putting\u00a0\nin your body and there's tens of thousands of them\u00a0\u00a0 you know what do those ones do what do the\u00a0\nrest of them do okay because i mean there's\u00a0\u00a0 cyanide in almonds okay you know one to two\u00a0\npounds of almonds in a day will kill you\u00a0\u00a0 okay you know inside a peach pit it looks like a\u00a0\nlittle shriveled up almond it's called call the um\u00a0\u00a0 um what is it called bitter almond okay one or two\u00a0\nof those will kill you with the amount of cyanide\u00a0\u00a0 that's in there okay so a seed is a plant's baby\u00a0\nokay all organisms protect their babies more than\u00a0\u00a0 anything a seed is a plant's baby that's generally\u00a0\nwhere you'll find the highest concentration of\u00a0\u00a0 toxic elements okay so you're eating a bunch of\u00a0\nseeds to lower your cholesterol which you don't\u00a0\u00a0 want to do and you're bringing in all this\u00a0\nother crap again it's cherry picking okay so\u00a0\u00a0 you're saying this you have this one beneficial\u00a0\nthing okay what else is in there what are the\u00a0\u00a0 other hundred thousand things that are so that\u00a0\nare in in all men what do those ones do for you\u00a0\u00a0 okay are they all good or at least neutral so\u00a0\nthere's one good thing just sort of tips you over\u00a0\u00a0 the balance you know the answer to that riddle\u00a0\nis no okay so we'll go on think about more novel\u00a0\u00a0 risk factors and my teammate um jason's going to\u00a0\ntalk about the microbiome but i want to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 trimethylamine and inoxide which is produced\u00a0\nby the gut in response to choline consumption\u00a0\u00a0 choline comes from red red meat eggs and\u00a0\ndairy and the more tmao we produce in\u00a0\u00a0 our guts as a byproduct of these foods the higher\u00a0\nthe risk for cardiovascular disease kidney disease\u00a0\u00a0 obesity and myocardial infarction and what's\u00a0\nfascinating is if if you vegans do not produce\u00a0\u00a0 tmao in the gastrointestory intestinal tracts\u00a0\nand we this is research has come out of the\u00a0\u00a0 cleveland clinic and has been re reproduced in\u00a0\nmultiples multiple studies on both high risk\u00a0\u00a0 and low risk risk patient groups then we have\u00a0\nto start thinking okay that's a better argument\u00a0\u00a0 all right you know talking about tmao and so forth\u00a0\nfine yeah you know i have no problem with that the\u00a0\u00a0 problem the problem um comes because these these\u00a0\nstudies look at meat eaters not carnivores okay so\u00a0\u00a0 you know he asked us where's the carnivore\u00a0\nstudy that shows that a carnivore diet\u00a0\u00a0 shows improvement in these sorts of things okay\u00a0\nwhere's your study that shows a carnivore diet\u00a0\u00a0 causes harm because we don't have those studies\u00a0\neither okay we look at meat eaters we look at\u00a0\u00a0 people that have meat in their diet okay and this\u00a0\nis again problematic with these epidemiological\u00a0\u00a0 studies and these confounding factors because\u00a0\nyou know we've been told for the last you\u00a0\u00a0 know 40 50 years that eating meat will kill you\u00a0\nespecially red meat will kill you and so you have\u00a0\u00a0 you have a certain population who then says you\u00a0\nknow what i'm gonna do this because i enjoy it\u00a0\u00a0 and i want to do it so screw it i only have one\u00a0\nlife well a lot of people with that mentality\u00a0\u00a0 also smoke drink you know you know do extreme\u00a0\nsports and all these sorts of things they're more\u00a0\u00a0 likely to die in a car a car accident they're more\u00a0\nlikely to speed more likely to do different things\u00a0\u00a0 that are that are dangerous because they say screw\u00a0\nit i've only got one life i'm going to enjoy it\u00a0\u00a0 and you know red meat got put into that category\u00a0\nof something that's super bad for you and they're\u00a0\u00a0 like ah screw it so you have these people\u00a0\nthat that is a confounding factor and that\u00a0\u00a0 is something has to be accounted for okay\u00a0\nso when they control for those things\u00a0\u00a0 you know that you know meat eaters are more\u00a0\nlikely to smoke they're more likely to drink\u00a0\u00a0 the more likely you do all these sorts of things\u00a0\nwhen you control for that and you and you sort of\u00a0\u00a0 uh correct for that you actually don't find an\u00a0\nassociation with any of this crap okay so again\u00a0\u00a0 where's the study that shows that carnivorism\u00a0\ncaused about not meat eating with all this\u00a0\u00a0 other crap going on but carnivorism and\u00a0\nokay so and and so for the microbiome\u00a0\u00a0 your microbiome is going to be very very different\u00a0\ndepending on what you eat it changes basically\u00a0\u00a0 daily okay because your what you eat feeds your\u00a0\nyour gut biome okay and so if you eat different\u00a0\u00a0 things you're gonna have a different biome\u00a0\nokay so it depends on what bacteria you have\u00a0\u00a0 you have specific bacteria that will break down\u00a0\nspecific things into specific byproducts okay\u00a0\u00a0 so if you have specific bacteria that\u00a0\nyou know may turn you know these these\u00a0\u00a0 um you know choline into uh you know a tmao\u00a0\nokay maybe all right are you gonna have that\u00a0\u00a0 gut bacteria if you're on a carnivore diet do\u00a0\nthat study where's your study showing that okay\u00a0\u00a0 um probably not honestly i don't know because\u00a0\nwe don't have a study but we don't know\u00a0\u00a0 it doesn't matter though because if you're just\u00a0\neating a carnivore diet you're not eating fiber\u00a0\u00a0 fiber delays the absorption actually blocks and\u00a0\nstops the absorption and breakdown of the food\u00a0\u00a0 that you eat this was the argument there's the\u00a0\nentire argument in the 80s on why you should eat\u00a0\u00a0 fiber because it stops you from absorbing calories\u00a0\nit has no nutrition it feels like you're full\u00a0\u00a0 and it blocks your body's ability to absorb food\u00a0\nhow would that arise in nature that that's like\u00a0\u00a0 a good thing for survival and starvation\u00a0\ni mean that doesn't make any damn sense\u00a0\u00a0 but that was the argument when it was all fat\u00a0\nbusters gotta lose weight lose weight lose weight\u00a0\u00a0 all these sorts of things um okay but what are\u00a0\nyou doing you're stuck you have these big tangles\u00a0\u00a0 of fiber that you cannot break down no vertebrate\u00a0\nanimal can break these down it's actually special\u00a0\u00a0 bacteria in the guts of things like you know of\u00a0\nherbivores that can break this stuff down okay we\u00a0\u00a0 don't have those okay there's something you can\u00a0\nget some of those in your large intestine they\u00a0\u00a0 don't exist before that um so you get these big\u00a0\ntangles okay and you know these food particles\u00a0\u00a0 are stuck in these tangles enzymes can't get to\u00a0\nit and they can't get to the you know the this um\u00a0\u00a0 you know the borders of your of your small\u00a0\nintestine and aluminum your intestine and so\u00a0\u00a0 forth so they can't get absorbed okay so these get\u00a0\ntaken into the large intestine where bacteria are\u00a0\u00a0 and these then you know cause these problems so if\u00a0\nyou're not eating fiber your body's gonna absorb\u00a0\u00a0 all this stuff very little of that is going to\u00a0\nget if any is going to get you a large intestine\u00a0\u00a0 we know this because we've studied this with\u00a0\npeople uh with stomas you know you remove part\u00a0\u00a0 of your intestine you have this bag the fecal\u00a0\nmatter comes comes out in the bag and we look at\u00a0\u00a0 this when people are not eating fiber and they're\u00a0\neating you know animal protein and so forth\u00a0\u00a0 almost none of it comes out okay but when you're\u00a0\neating plant proteins a lot of it comes out this\u00a0\u00a0 is how we know about bioavailability of\u00a0\nof you know meat-based proteins versus\u00a0\u00a0 plant-based proteins okay that's part of you\u00a0\nknow why we know that plant-based proteins\u00a0\u00a0 don't have a very high bioavailability and that\u00a0\nmeat does okay so if you're not eating fiber\u00a0\u00a0 you know and you're not eating plants at all\u00a0\nyou may not even have the right bacteria that\u00a0\u00a0 will turn the stuff into tmao okay but either way\u00a0\nyou're not eating fiber so you know the majority\u00a0\u00a0 of what you're eating is going to get absorbed so\u00a0\nit's not even going to get to the large intestine\u00a0\u00a0 to be introduced to the bacteria which may\u00a0\nnot even exist anyway okay so there's that thinking about outcomes because it's fine to\u00a0\nreduce think about what we see then it's fine\u00a0\u00a0 to think about biomarkers but how can we show a\u00a0\nplant-based diet can reduce both cardiovascular\u00a0\u00a0 event rates and and malignancy and these are\u00a0\nthe only dietary pattern that has shown to\u00a0\u00a0 reduce uh obesity and we do know\u00a0\nsome people think they can lose a\u00a0\u00a0 lot of weight on a ketogenic or or can't\u00a0\ncarnivore diet and perhaps some people do\u00a0\u00a0 so you'll have a thinner coffin when you die and\u00a0\nyou'll be if you be this you'll be there sooner\u00a0\u00a0 um okay so i mean he literally just contradicted\u00a0\nhimself okay he's saying there's there's\u00a0\u00a0 no st there's no diet that you know shows that you\u00a0\ncan get weight loss you accept a vegan diet oh i\u00a0\u00a0 mean i guess you could with keto but uh you're\u00a0\njust gonna die okay well does it make you lose\u00a0\u00a0 weight or doesn't it okay and again you know what\u00a0\nvegan diet what kind of vegan diet are you doing\u00a0\u00a0 the oreo cookie cookie and heroin diet that's\u00a0\nvegan meth is vegan okay just means no meat\u00a0\u00a0 right rocks are vegan okay so you\u00a0\nknow you know define your terms here\u00a0\u00a0 you know just any old vegan diet no obviously not\u00a0\nwe know that you know but then you're saying oh\u00a0\u00a0 nothing else has been shown to do this except for\u00a0\nvegan diet oh except for all these other things\u00a0\u00a0 too but uh you don't want those okay well you know\u00a0\nyou're not really helping your own argument here um we know that vegan diets significantly\u00a0\nimprove improved dyslipidemia we know that\u00a0\u00a0 they reduce hypertension we think again who\u00a0\ngives a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about dyslipidemia who cares\u00a0\u00a0 about your cholesterol when you're not eating\u00a0\nsugar you're not eating uh you're not drinking\u00a0\u00a0 alcohol and you're not eating a bunch of\u00a0\ncarbohydrates to jack up uh your blood\u00a0\u00a0 sugar okay you know if you're if you're one of\u00a0\nthese people that are you know you know drinking\u00a0\u00a0 alcohol eating sugar eating carbohydrates\u00a0\nand so forth you know statin might help you\u00a0\u00a0 you know because you you do have you know uh\u00a0\nyou know this disease process this inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 process that's going on okay you know maybe that\u00a0\nwill help that would be an interesting study\u00a0\u00a0 if you distinguish out those sorts\u00a0\nof things okay um but yeah otherwise\u00a0\u00a0 i really don't care about cholesterol as a\u00a0\ndoctor and as a patient like i just don't care we think about one of the most common causes of of\u00a0\nstroke and heart failure in western world it's uh\u00a0\u00a0 it's it's hypertension we know that a vegan diet\u00a0\npredictably you know improves improves diabetes\u00a0\u00a0 and and also in also a heart and also\u00a0\nheart failure okay so one of the most um\u00a0\u00a0 one of the the diets that we have the most uh\u00a0\ndata on and conclusive evidence on for helping\u00a0\u00a0 diabetes actually is the ketogenic diet we've\u00a0\nbeen using that for well over a hundred years\u00a0\u00a0 and we using the 1800s to stabilize diabetics\u00a0\nblood sugar and so forth okay so there is just a\u00a0\u00a0 ton of evidence you know showing a ketogenic diet\u00a0\nif you're diabetic especially type 2 diabetic\u00a0\u00a0 type 1 as well you really don't want to eat\u00a0\ncarbohydrates you really don't want to eat sugar\u00a0\u00a0 you know so that that is very important for that\u00a0\nso and again you know oreo cookies not going to be\u00a0\u00a0 good for a diabetic hypertension sure hypertension\u00a0\nis is a killer but you know i i'm you know we have\u00a0\u00a0 no study showing that a carnivore diet increases\u00a0\nyour blood pressure none okay and i have\u00a0\u00a0 dozens of patients right now on a carnivore diet\u00a0\ni've spoken to hundreds of people over the past\u00a0\u00a0 few thousands really and there's you know people\u00a0\nin you know carnivore groups and chat group things\u00a0\u00a0 like that where we talk about these sorts of\u00a0\nthings you know you know rivera health is a really\u00a0\u00a0 good one for that there's different facebook\u00a0\ngroups as well um you know dr baker has has helped\u00a0\u00a0 tons of people we're not seeing blood pressure\u00a0\nbe an issue in fact we're seeing people get off\u00a0\u00a0 their blood pressure medication my father's had\u00a0\nyou know intractable blood pressure problems for\u00a0\u00a0 you know for yonks he doesn't anymore that's very\u00a0\nstable now you know i've been eating this way for\u00a0\u00a0 you know i've always been heavy meat eater and\u00a0\ni've basically been a pure always basically\u00a0\u00a0 been in pure carnivore i eat everything else by\u00a0\nsufferance but you know for about the last 20\u00a0\u00a0 years i was really full on for a solid five years\u00a0\nand then sort of slipped off was eating little\u00a0\u00a0 bits and pieces of things here and there and for\u00a0\nthe last you know five six years absolutely not\u00a0\u00a0 anything besides meat salt water okay i don't\u00a0\nhave any blood pressure issues okay and you know\u00a0\u00a0 my patients don't have blood pressure issues on a\u00a0\ncarnivore diet either okay and i've never heard of\u00a0\u00a0 that i've never heard of someone going carnivore\u00a0\nand having a blood pressure issue um simple reason\u00a0\u00a0 why physiologically humans are carnivores that's\u00a0\nthe kind of animal we are that's how we develop\u00a0\u00a0 that's how we evolve so you know you know you go\u00a0\nto first principles we're not going to have these\u00a0\u00a0 disease state processes if you're eating naturally\u00a0\nyou know you know elderly lions don't you know\u00a0\u00a0 probably don't have a bunch of blood pressure\u00a0\nissues if they're just you know still eating\u00a0\u00a0 meat okay that's an abnormal pathology that\u00a0\ncomes about when eating the wrong thing there are multiple studies published in literature\u00a0\nin large peer-reviewed literature especially in\u00a0\u00a0 study in journals like the journal of american\u00a0\nparty cardiology journal which shows the more\u00a0\u00a0 serving of animal foods you have the greater the\u00a0\nchance of heart disease with 4.8 million million\u00a0\u00a0 person years and one of the most important studies\u00a0\nis that for every cat when even if we replace a\u00a0\u00a0 small amount of animal protein with plant protein\u00a0\nwe can show a significant reduction not only\u00a0\u00a0 cardiovascular disease but cancer you know it's\u00a0\nno point treating everyone with heart disease only\u00a0\u00a0 for them to die of many many many years later\u00a0\nokay again so you get these these associations\u00a0\u00a0 you know you know correlation is not causation you\u00a0\nknow and again these these epidemiological studies\u00a0\u00a0 are saying that like you know this um you know\u00a0\nmeat eaters what does that mean that does not mean\u00a0\u00a0 carnivores that means someone who eats meat\u00a0\nand also smokes and drinks and drives too fast\u00a0\u00a0 okay but i don't know which ones he's quoting\u00a0\nthere they've done tons of these over the decades\u00a0\u00a0 but the recent ones corrected and controlled\u00a0\nfor those sorts of things they didn't even find\u00a0\u00a0 an association with eating meat and these\u00a0\npoorer outcomes okay um so you know again\u00a0\u00a0 like you know and you know i don't know what\u00a0\nstudy he's referring to where you're replacing\u00a0\u00a0 some you know animal protein with with you know\u00a0\nwith plant protein and that improves some things\u00a0\u00a0 somehow i'd have to take a look at the study and\u00a0\nhave to know what he's talking about there but um\u00a0\u00a0 it sounds pretty suspect honestly because\u00a0\nit doesn't make any damn sense you know\u00a0\u00a0 if that's the only thing that you're changing in\u00a0\nthat system and again this is going to be a system\u00a0\u00a0 eating you know the sad diet you know standard\u00a0\naustralian diet standard american diet things\u00a0\u00a0 like that with a bunch of other crap in it\u00a0\nokay so it's not the meat that's doing this\u00a0\u00a0 show me a single study showing me showing\u00a0\nthat you've controlled for everything else\u00a0\u00a0 except for meat and meat is the problem show\u00a0\nme one study that says that there are none and we do know that people that adopted a\u00a0\nplant-based diet had significantly reduced reduced\u00a0\u00a0 malignancy rates um 30 seconds jason 30 seconds\u00a0\n30 seconds so i'd like to sum up that a vegan\u00a0\u00a0 vegan diet is what is the only dietary pattern\u00a0\nthat in a western society has shown a reduction\u00a0\u00a0 in the main in in both the incidents and allows\u00a0\nus treatment for the major diseases that reflect\u00a0\u00a0 western society and is sustainable for us for our\u00a0\nplanet for for our population and for our patients\u00a0\u00a0 to follow okay so sustainable for the planet\u00a0\nthat is absolutely incorrect um when you grow\u00a0\u00a0 a crop you necessarily have to destroy an entire\u00a0\necosystem you have to just you have to bulldoze\u00a0\u00a0 and destroy all the plants kill all the plants\u00a0\nkill all the animals rip up the ground till it up\u00a0\u00a0 and then you know plant your crops okay and crops\u00a0\nwell just any plant in general they take nutrients\u00a0\u00a0 they get their nutrients from their soil right\u00a0\nwhat puts the the nutrients back in animals so\u00a0\u00a0 when you're having an ecosystem you have plants\u00a0\nand animals living in symbiosis where you know\u00a0\u00a0 they each nourish eat and help each other\u00a0\nokay so you know animals will be eating the\u00a0\u00a0 plants and then they'll their their excretions\u00a0\nand so forth will then replace those nutrients\u00a0\u00a0 back into the soil okay and that is what is\u00a0\nwhat nourishes that replenishes the nutrients\u00a0\u00a0 in the soil okay and that's what keeps plants\u00a0\ngrowing again um tons of people have done this um\u00a0\u00a0 alan savory who's out in zimbabwe he's been doing\u00a0\nthis for 40 years or something like that taking\u00a0\u00a0 large herds of animals moving through deserts\u00a0\nmoving through mines like strip mines and things\u00a0\u00a0 like that and actually because those animals are\u00a0\nthere all of a sudden these things are able to\u00a0\u00a0 you know regrow the soil re-neutral um you know\u00a0\nre-nourish the soil and all of a sudden they're\u00a0\u00a0 growing just massive massive massive amounts of\u00a0\nvegetation and so forth forests are coming back\u00a0\u00a0 you know then new animals will come back through\u00a0\nyou know and start migrating there and so forth\u00a0\u00a0 um it's massive changes um you know dr peter\u00a0\nballista was very interesting guy you should\u00a0\u00a0 look up his stuff i'll try to put some some\u00a0\nlinks to these guys in the in the description\u00a0\u00a0 uh but you know he's a phd in forage agronomy i've\u00a0\ni've spoken to him you know just personally i was\u00a0\u00a0 very interested in his work so i emailed him and\u00a0\nwe ended up having a you know discussion over zoom\u00a0\u00a0 very interesting guy very bright guy really\u00a0\nshows the science behind how important animals\u00a0\u00a0 are to the environment think about it this way\u00a0\nduring the dust bowl in america during the 1930s\u00a0\u00a0 um you know no one could grow anything we\u00a0\nhad dust storms all these sorts of things\u00a0\u00a0 everything was horrible we then figured\u00a0\nand it was running into a desert it's\u00a0\u00a0 turning to like the sahara desert right um\u00a0\nwhich is man-made by the way look it up and\u00a0\u00a0 we figured this out this was actually the farming\u00a0\ntechniques okay um and we realized that you know\u00a0\u00a0 this is when you you're tilling the soil you're\u00a0\nmaking large rows of this stuff it rains it washes\u00a0\u00a0 all the topsoil away wind hits it picks it up\u00a0\nblows it all away okay so you're losing all these\u00a0\u00a0 top soil all this top soil we're able to change\u00a0\nthings around to mitigate that but we still lose\u00a0\u00a0 billions of tons a year in 2017 we lost 27.5\u00a0\nbillion tons of topsoil okay that's an area\u00a0\u00a0 of the size of kentucky okay which is the\u00a0\nsize of you know a european country okay\u00a0\u00a0 so you know that that's a finite resource as well\u00a0\nyou know it takes you know uh 500 years to grow a\u00a0\u00a0 centimeter of topsoil okay that is going to run\u00a0\nout a lot quicker than we realize okay and so\u00a0\u00a0 you know that's a big problem and you know where\u00a0\ndo these fertilizers come from for crops they\u00a0\u00a0 come from animals they come from livestock okay\u00a0\nthey come from their manure you know they talk\u00a0\u00a0 about they talk about you know animals you know\u00a0\nuh all day if we if we just weren't growing all\u00a0\u00a0 this you know like you know corn and things\u00a0\nlike that for you know animal feed and stuff\u00a0\u00a0 like that you know we we'd have more than enough\u00a0\nfood and blah blah blah blah blah that's nonsense\u00a0\u00a0 the the feed that they give to to animals is\u00a0\nlike hey how much hay do you want to eat exactly\u00a0\u00a0 okay they're eating the parts of the plants that\u00a0\nwe cannot eat that we cannot digest 92 percent\u00a0\u00a0 of the feed of the the crops grown for um for\u00a0\nanimals for livestock is inedible by humans it's\u00a0\u00a0 the leavings it's the waste okay so it's like you\u00a0\nknow the shaft of the wheat and things like that\u00a0\u00a0 we can't eat that that's given to cows okay and\u00a0\nthey eat that their manure replenishes the soil\u00a0\u00a0 okay so this is nonsense and you know helping\u00a0\nthe like that is just nonsense you know so i\u00a0\u00a0 can go to that and other things but watch peter\u00a0\nballista watch alan savory you know you he did\u00a0\u00a0 uh um several youtube talks and he had a ted talk\u00a0\nas well quickly about you know the sahara desert\u00a0\u00a0 that actually wasn't a desert several thousand\u00a0\nyears ago okay before the agricultural revolution\u00a0\u00a0 that's what changed things in my opinion i i think\u00a0\nthat anyway i think the evidence is there you know\u00a0\u00a0 the the um the pyramids and and sphinx we had soil\u00a0\nsamples done in the 1990s that actually looked\u00a0\u00a0 and found that you know they were like oh these\u00a0\nalways desert people i found no actually these\u00a0\u00a0 were these were built in jungles these were jungle\u00a0\npeople these were jungle pyramids okay but they\u00a0\u00a0 had widespread farming that sort of grew around\u00a0\nthat time and you know you know in the bc era and\u00a0\u00a0 it turned things to desert because they\u00a0\ndidn't figure it out you had the nile river\u00a0\u00a0 which flooded every year and the silt would\u00a0\nreplenish the nutrients we learned this as\u00a0\u00a0 kids and we don't think past that but what does\u00a0\nthat mean that means that the nutrients needed\u00a0\u00a0 to be replenished every single year where all\u00a0\nthe places that didn't have a nile river they\u00a0\u00a0 didn't get replenished they couldn't grow\u00a0\nthings after that turned to deserts we have\u00a0\u00a0 satellite images infrared satellite images that\u00a0\nactually showed that there's like human you\u00a0\u00a0 know human habitation all across what is now the\u00a0\nsahara desert you know like you know structures\u00a0\u00a0 and things like that you know the the you know\u00a0\nthe bones of a structure and civilizations and\u00a0\u00a0 things like that that was not a desert okay these\u00a0\nthings were made by agriculture by crops okay not\u00a0\u00a0 animals the animals are what kept these things\u00a0\nalive okay that's what keeps the environment\u00a0\u00a0 and ecosystem alive okay so i think that's\u00a0\nthat's probably enough for that one sorry that\u00a0\u00a0 i had a lot to say about that i'll do i'll do\u00a0\nthe other um the other participants as well\u00a0\u00a0 because i think there's definitely things\u00a0\nto address there uh in other videos um this\u00a0\u00a0 one was mostly surrounded by um you know with\u00a0\nthe cholesterol debate and i think that that's\u00a0\u00a0 something that's very very important because\u00a0\nthat's central to this discussion on plant-based\u00a0\u00a0 versus you know meat diets and carnivore vegan\u00a0\nand and so forth being the extremes of that\u00a0\u00a0 but it's something that's very very important\u00a0\nsomething i have patients and and you know\u00a0\u00a0 friends and colleagues going what about\u00a0\ncholesterol what about cholesterol what\u00a0\u00a0 about cholesterol okay so you look like you're\u00a0\nin good shape you know you look like you're\u00a0\u00a0 healthy and all your bloods and everything\u00a0\nlike that show you're very very very healthy\u00a0\u00a0 but what's your cholesterol doing i'll tell\u00a0\nyou what my cholesterol is doing i don't give\u00a0\u00a0 a damn i know what my cholesterol is but i don't\u00a0\ngive a damn okay it's actually basically normal\u00a0\u00a0 but i don't give a damn if it's high it's\u00a0\nphysiological whatever it is it's physiological\u00a0\u00a0 because i'm eating in an evolutionary\u00a0\nbiological species specific way and so whatever\u00a0\u00a0 my cholesterol is whatever my bloods are\u00a0\ndoing they're supposed to be doing that you\u00a0\u00a0 know we have these blood markers and these these\u00a0\nstudies and these standardized tests that we use\u00a0\u00a0 that are predicated on lies okay so we need\u00a0\nto rethink these and we need to get different\u00a0\u00a0 reference ranges and so forth to to tell\u00a0\nus what's actually healthy and what's not\u00a0\u00a0 okay all right guys well i hope you enjoyed that\u00a0\ni'll be doing further videos uh every week i'll\u00a0\u00a0 probably be a little more than that as well\u00a0\nsometimes i'm starting a podcast as well with\u00a0\u00a0 a friend of mine uh simon lewis uh called how\u00a0\nto carnivore with the plant for emd that's me\u00a0\u00a0 no plans um and i'll do more of these uh rebuttal\u00a0\nsort of videos as well i'm sure they'd like to do\u00a0\u00a0 vermont i think that would be great i would\u00a0\nlove to have a conversation with these guys\u00a0\u00a0 you know one-on-one maybe even over a video on uh\u00a0\non podcasts and because i'm sure they have i mean\u00a0\u00a0 things that i said and we said i'm sure they had\u00a0\ntons of things that they wanted to say about that\u00a0\u00a0 and that's how you that's how you work\u00a0\nthis out you both talk back and forth\u00a0\u00a0 you say well you said this however i've seen this\u00a0\nstudy and looked at this what about this and they\u00a0\u00a0 say the same thing back to you and you have a\u00a0\ndiscussion and i think that that's a very healthy\u00a0\u00a0 thing to do i think that's really the best way to\u00a0\nto come to you know some sort of conclusion that\u00a0\u00a0 you know maybe not maybe you guys you know when\u00a0\ni'm walking away saying you're going to agree to\u00a0\u00a0 disagree but you know other people can take away\u00a0\na lot from that and hopefully we can set that up\u00a0\u00a0 in the future all right guys if you can like\u00a0\nand subscribe and share this with people that\u00a0\u00a0 would really help i'm just getting the channel\u00a0\nstarted and and you know obviously that that is\u00a0\u00a0 helpful when you do that so uh click the little\u00a0\nbell and you'll see more of my stuff thanks guys"
